5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

Former England cricketer Derek Pringle has written about Agnew's sense of humour, describing him as [...] "hysterical". The pair toured Sri Lanka together on England B's 1986 tour. Pringle recalls that one hot day when England were in the field, Agnew came in for lunch: [...] "It's ****ing [...] red hot on the field, and when you come off it's ****ing red hot in the dressing-room," [...] Agnew screamed.

However, the writers soon found this storyline difficult to develop, and, by Spotnitz's own admission, the story [...] "started to evolve into a Cape Fear type of situation".

500|$|... "The hope, {{first and}} foremost, {{was to put}} this on people’s radar. Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists.

Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action.

500|$|Games in the Guitar Hero series {{have been}} {{generally}} well received by critics. The initial games were highly praised by reviewers. Neversoft's first {{entry to the}} series, Guitar Hero III, {{was considered to be}} too difficult, with many difficult songs presenting players with [...] "walls of notes"; the developers later acknowledged this. Subsequent efforts in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and Guitar Hero World Tour were seen to have some improvements, with Guitar Hero: Metallica considered to be a well-polished title and, at that time, the best Guitar Hero title Neversoft has produced. Guitar Hero 5s improvements toward social gameplay were complemented by reviewers and considered a further improvement upon the series. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "An addictive videogame provides the illusion of musical mastery for even the least gifted:.

500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests."

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> there?'" ...|$|E

500|$|The episode [...] "Brother from Another Series" [...] {{introduces}} Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{a chance to work}} with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E
500|$|Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly {{coined the}} song as [...] "thumping" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "Brown and guest Justin Bieber trade verses assuring their ladies of their dedication." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV News UK said [...] "It seems that {{everything}} Justin Bieber touches turns to gold at the moment and this cutesy ballad is no exception." [...] Dorken complimented how well the song showed the blending of the pair's voices, and she commented, as [...] "the most 'pop' song on the LP, we are hoping Chris decides {{to make this a}} single... a sure fire hit." [...] Nadia Noir of WNOW-FM wrote, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> when you combine two of pop's best-looking/greatest dancers, the sexy rasp of Justin Bieber, and a dance-jam/love-song? A combination of all the best elements of music!" [...] Nick Levine of BBC Music said the track was part of Brown's identity crisis on the album, as [...] "Next to You" [...] was just two tracks after the [...] "grisly sex jam" [...] of [...] "Wet the Bed" [...] featuring Ludacris. Levine called the collaboration a [...] "wholesome-as-homemade-chutney hook-up." [...] While complementing that the album had [...] "something for everyone", Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called [...] "Next to You" [...] a [...] "puppy-love declaration." [...] Bri LaPelusa called the song a [...] "dreamy ballad" [...] and said it melted Brown and Bieber's [...] "angelic" [...] voices. She went on to add that [...] "Next to You" [...] "might be affirmation that Chris Brown is once again an accepted celebrity." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

500|$|Cross, a {{resolute}} Christian, {{converted to}} Christianity while {{on leave from}} a posting to Cyprus in 1981. He visited Jerusalem over the Easter weekend and {{was inspired by a}} retired British Army officer he met there to convert. After converting, he considered leaving the Army, but has said in interviews that he reconciled his beliefs with his military service, contending that [...] "the British Army as a community [...] recognises the issue of spirituality and goodness and righteousness and justice and evil and wrong probably far more than most". He is a licensed lay reader in the Church of England and has involvement with a number of Christian organisations, including as a trustee of the British and Foreign Bible Society and {{a former president of the}} Armed Forces Christian Union. In an interview for the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2009, he said [...] "The moral component of fighting power is about leadership, it's about ethics, it's about culture, it's about how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> people to fight and embedded within that is an element of justice and righteousness. f you lose the moral component, you lose everything. I think we – collectively in the West – have gone through 30 - 40 years really of pretending that this moral component is not important, and that I don't need to have a biblical foundation in my life. And I challenge that." [...] He has written on the subject in the British Army Review, an in house publication aimed at generating professional debate, where he described ideas of a secular Army as 'tripe' and 'dangerously wrong' and the rewrite of the motto of the Girl Guides, removing reference to God, as 'vapid and anodyne'.|$|E
500|$|Due to his resounding loss to Nixon in the 1972 {{election}} and the causes behind it, [...] "McGovernism" [...] became a label that a generation of Democratic politicians tried to avoid. In 1992, nationally syndicated Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene wrote, [...] "Once again politicians – mostly Republicans, but some Democrats, too – are using his name as a synonym for presidential campaigns that are laughable and {{out of touch with}} the American people." [...] Conservatives used McGovern's name as a ready synonym for what they saw as liberal failures. Indeed, according to Daniel McCarthy of The American Conservative, the Republican Party began to act after 1972 as if [...] "every Democratic leader, no matter how Southern, how pro-war, how middle-of-the-road, is really a McGovernite. Indeed, for nearly 40 years the conservative movement has defined itself in opposition to the Democratic standard-bearer of 1972. Anti-McGovernism has come to play for the Right the unifying role that anticommunism once played, much to the detriment of older principles such as limited government, fiscal continence, and prudence in foreign policy." [...] The association with dovishness and weakness on defense has been especially prevalent, although McGovern publicly stated in 1972 that he was not a pacifist and that use of force was sometimes necessary, such as in World War II. McGovern later said in 2001 that his political image had been exaggerated: [...] "I am a liberal and always have been – just not the wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be." [...] He continued to feel that he was marginalized with his views miscast. He saw himself as a son of the prairie, in 2005 reciting his traditional upbringing and family values, culminating with [...] "I'm what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like", and in 2006 said, [...] "How the hell <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> elected in South Dakota for twenty years if you're a wild-eyed radical?" ...|$|E
