Structural analysis by high resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of a lateral AlGaN shell due to a composition dependent lateral growth rate of the barrier material. The structural properties are used as input parameters for three dimensional numerical simulations of the confinement which show that the presence of the AlGaN shell has to be considered to explain the observed dependence of the emission energy on the Al concentration in the barrier. The simulations reveal that the maximum in the emission energy for x ~ 30 % is assigned to the smallest lateral strain gradient and consequently the lowest radial <b>internal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> in the nanodiscs.

The induced <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> were computed for 1 kHz sinusoidal current with a magnitude of 1 A in the gradient coils. Rheobase <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> were then calculated and compared to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 2004 and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 2010 guidelines.

50|$|In a {{conventional}} solar cell, light is absorbed by a semiconductor, producing an electron-hole (e-h) pair; the pair may be bound and {{is referred to}} as an exciton. This pair is separated by an <b>internal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> (present in p-n junctions or Schottky diodes) and the resulting flow of electrons and holes creates electric current. The <b>internal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is created by doping one part of semiconductor interface with atoms that act as electron donors (n-type doping) and another with electron acceptors (p-type doping) that results in a p-n junction. Generation of an e-h pair requires that the photons have energy exceeding the bandgap of the material. Effectively, photons with energies lower than the bandgap do not get absorbed, while those that are higher can quickly (within about 10−13 s) thermalize to the band edges, reducing output. The former limitation reduces current, while the thermalization reduces the voltage. As a result, semiconductor cells suffer a trade-off between voltage and current (which can be in part alleviated by using multiple junction implementations). The detailed balance calculation shows that this efficiency can not exceed 31% if one uses a single material for a solar cell.|$|E

50|$|A {{dielectric}} (or dielectric material) is {{an electrical}} insulator {{that can be}} polarized by an applied electric field. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material {{as they do in}} an electrical conductor, but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization. Because of dielectric polarization, positive charges are displaced toward the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction.
