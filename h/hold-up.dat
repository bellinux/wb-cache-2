5|$|To {{create the}} bank {{needed for the}} episode, Ilt Jones and the {{location}} department staff found a former bank and current animation school and film production house on Fourth and Main Street in downtown Los Angeles. The building was completely renovated, complete with fake ATMs, columns, desks, and double-glazed windows. All of the items inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set decorator Tim Stepeck. During the <b>hold-up</b> scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow cameras to film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used. Some of the cameras made it onto the film, but they were erased during post-production.|$|E

40|$|Interfacial {{areas and}} gas <b>hold-ups</b> have been {{determined}} at pressures up to 1. 85 MPa {{in a bubble}} column with a diameter of 85. 5 mm and for superficial gas velocities between 1 and 10 cm s− 1. In some experiments the bubble column was packed with glass cylinders of length 5. 0 mm and diameter 4. 0 mm. The interfacial areas were determined by the chemical method using the model reaction between CO 2 and aqueous diethanolamine (DEA) and <b>hold-ups</b> by observation of height differences. The interfacial areas in the packed bubble column are unaffected by pressure. The gas <b>hold-ups</b> {{as well as the}} interfacial areas in the bubble column increase with increasing operating pressure. The magnitude of the pressure influence depends on the superficial gas velocity. The positive influence of pressure on the gas <b>hold-ups</b> and the interfacial in the bubble column originates from the formation of smaller bubbles at the gas distributor...|$|R

25|$|In May 2009, {{officers}} from the Emergency Response Unit were present when National Surveillance Unit detectives shot and killed an armed raider in Lucan, Dublin after he attempted to <b>hold-up</b> a cash-in-transit van. 27-year-old Gareth Molloy, who had previous criminal convictions, and his gang were under surveillance by the NSU {{for a number of}} weeks prior to the incident. Gardaí received intelligence that the gang were going to carry out a heist, and the NSU were backed-up by the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), Organised Crime Unit (OCU) and ERU. When Molloy and a gang associate attempted to <b>hold-up</b> a cash delivery van at gunpoint and fired a shot in the air, NSU detectives intervened and ordered the armed raiders to drop their weapons. Gareth Molloy pointed a sawn-off shotgun in the direction of armed Gardaí and was immediately fired upon by NSU officers and was fatally wounded. His associate refused to drop his weapon, and was also shot, but survived with serious injuries. 5 shots were fired by Gardaí in total. No one else was hurt. Four other gang members were arrested, charged and jailed following a pursuit {{in the aftermath of the}} incident.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, he {{returned}} to the police force in a somewhat limited capacity when he agreed to become an instructor at Police Commissioner Richard Edward Enright's school for detectives. Much of his time at the school was concentrated on the study of foreign police systems. In his later years, he advocated the deportation of immigrants convicted of a criminal offense, the elimination of the revolver through federal legislation, a bounty payment to killers of <b>hold-up</b> men and the restoration of the whipping post as punishment for first-time offenders.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1876, Jesse and Frank James {{surfaced}} in the Nashville, Tennessee, area, where they went by the names of Thomas Howard and B.J. Woodson, respectively. Frank seemed to settle down, but Jesse remained restless. He recruited a new gang in 1879 and returned to crime, holding up a train at Glendale, Missouri (now part of Independence), on October 8, 1879. The robbery {{was the first in}} a spree of crimes, including the <b>hold-up</b> of the federal paymaster of a canal project in Killen, Alabama, and two more train robberies. But the new gang was not made up of battle-hardened guerrillas; they soon turned against each other or were captured. James grew suspicious of other members; he scared away one man and some believe that he killed another gang member.|$|E

Of the 808 bank robbery incidents between January 1998 and May 2002 {{in which the}} number of offenders involved in the <b>hold-up</b> was recorded, 55% were committed by lone offenders, 25% by pairs, and 20% by three or more robbers. Unarmed offenders accounted for 28% of robberies, caused the fewest number of injuries to victims (one percent of all victims' injuries), were the type of robber who most often used a note to threaten bank staff (46% of all their robberies), and failed most often in their robbery attempts (33% failure). Unarmed gangs inflicted the most injuries to victims (51%) and failed the least in their robbery attempts (6% failure). Armed robbers used a disguise more often compared to unarmed robbers, with armed pairs employing disguises most often (59%).|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Los Angeles was increasing rapidly. In 1900 {{the population was}} slightly over 100,000. By 1910, it had become {{more than three times}} that number at 320,000, and by 1920 the figure reached 576,673. This unexpectedly rapid growth brought a demand for a larger water supply. Between 1920 and 1926, seven smaller reservoirs were built and modifications were made to raise the height of its largest of the time, the Lower San Fernando, by seven feet, but the need for a still larger reservoir was clear. Originally, the planned site of this new large reservoir was to be in Big Tujunga Canyon, above the city now known as Sunland, in the northeast portion of the San Fernando Valley, but the high value placed on the ranches and private land which would be needed were, in Mulholland's view, an attempted <b>hold-up</b> of the city. He ceased the attempts at purchasing those lands and, either forgetful of or disregarding his earlier acknowledgement of geological problems at the site, renewed his interest in the area he had explored twelve years earlier, the federally owned and far less expensive private land in San Francisquito Canyon.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the episode}} relied on props. The waterbed, which was {{purchased}} by Morris Fletcher earlier in the sixth season episode [...] "Dreamland" [...] while in Mulder's body, {{proved to be the}} hardest prop to locate. Stepeck searched Los Angeles and was unable to find a suitable bed. He had to order the bed from a specialized furniture store in San Francisco. Mulder's paycheck and envelope were created after several calls to the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. The checks were made to be as realistic as possible without looking too convincing. During the <b>hold-up</b> scene outside the bank, the police cruisers were all turned off, because the combined noise of the cars would drown out dialogue. To ensure their flashing lights, car coordinator Danny Briggs installed battery chargers in the cars.|$|E

Judge Starkey said, [...] "People have constitutional rights, and you can't shuffle them around." [...] The case was delayed in being brought to trial {{as a result of an}} agreement between the governors of New York and New Jersey as to the priority of the various charges against Shakur. Three other defendants were indicted in relation to the same holdup: Melvin Kearney, who died in 1976 from an eight-floor fall while trying to escape from the Brooklyn House of Detention, Twymon Myers, who was killed by police while a fugitive, and Andrew Jackson, the charges against whom were dismissed when two prosecution witnesses could not identify him in a lineup.|$|E

He finally defeats Goblin, wrapping him in webbing. The Goblin explains that a pumpkin bomb was hidden back at the black-tie event. When Spider-Man returns to find it, John Jameson opts that the pumpkin bomb is hidden in the chandelier and Spider-Man retrieves it. He launches the bomb into the sky and it harmlessly explodes. However, when Spider-Man goes back to arrest the Green Goblin, he has mysteriously disappeared.|$|E

500|$|Several {{directors}} {{associated with}} noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. Samuel Fuller's brutal, visually energetic {{films such as}} Pickup on South Street (1953) and Underworld U.S.A. (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as [...] "primitive" [...] and [...] "barbarous". Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as Gun Crazy (1950) and The Big Combo (1955). The former—whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, disguised by a front—features a bank <b>hold-up</b> sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential. The Big Combo was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits. The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson (The Phenix City Story [...] and The Brothers Rico [...] ) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale. The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as Felix E. Feist (The Devil Thumbs a Ride , Tomorrow Is Another Day [...] ), has become obscure. Edgar G. Ulmer {{spent most of his}} Hollywood career working at B studios {{and once in a while}} on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, Detour.

2500|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model is often critiqued for potentially leading to artificial scarcity and the <b>hold-up</b> problem. The <b>hold-up</b> problem {{refers to the}} difficulty in aggregation of the spectrum [...] resources (which would be required for high bandwidth applications), as the individual spectrum owners could ask for very high compensation in return of their contribution. Since spectrum is a scarce finite good, there is a perverse incentive to not use it at all. Participants and existing spectrum owners in the spectrum market can preemptively buy spectrum, then warehouse it to prevent existing or newcomer competitors from utilizing it. The existing spectrum owner's official plans for this warehoused spectrum would be save it for an unknown future use, and therefore not utilize it at all for the foreseeable future. [...] In a partial or incomplete [...] "spectrum as property" [...] regulatory regime, incumbent and grandfathered owners who obtained spectrum under the old cause and merit policy, can obtain windfalls in selling the spectrum they obtained for no cost under the earlier regulatory regime. When a regulatory regime changed to the property model, the original merit and cause guidelines for incumbent and grandfathered users are often removed, and no regulatory review mechanism exists to check if the merit guidelines are still being followed, and if not, revoke the spectrum license from the incumbent spectrum owner and reissue the spectrum to a new user under old merit guidelines or sell the spectrum inline with the new [...] "spectrum as property" [...] policy.|$|E
2500|$|Condensers {{are often}} used in reflux, where the hot solvent vapors of a liquid being heated are cooled and allowed to drip back.

Condensers are used in distillation to cool the hot vapors, condensing them into liquid for separate collection.
