5|$|In 2009, Microsoft Studios {{launched}} Halo Wars, a real-time strategy spin-off to {{the first-person}} shooter video game series Halo. The game {{was developed by}} Microsoft subsidiary Ensemble Studios. While Halo Wars was a commercial success, Ensemble Studios was shut down upon completion of its development. Prior to its closure, Ensemble had started writing a script and laying the narrative groundwork for a sequel. According to Halo Wars lead writer Graeme Devine, this original script explored {{the history of the}} Forerunners and involved the Spirit of Fire arriving at a Forerunner station that Anders had tracked. In 2007, Microsoft formed an internal division named 343 Industries to oversee and develop products in the Halo franchise. While the division had intentions of creating a follow-up to Halo Wars, they refrained from doing so until they <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> developer to partner with on the project. They viewed working with other developers and using external experience as a significant part of maintaining quality across their numerous projects.|$|E

25|$|Alan Rickman was Tykwer's {{first choice}} to play Richis {{and the role}} was not offered to anyone else. Tykwer and Eichinger looked through {{hundreds}} of audition tapes {{to find the right}} actress for the role of Richis' daughter Laura. Tykwer believed he had <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> actress on a tape with 15 actresses but couldn't remember exactly which was the one he liked. Eichinger looked through the tape and found {{what he thought was a}} suitable person. It turned out that both men had chosen the same actress, Rachel Hurd-Wood. Tykwer went to London to cast her personally. A new tape was recorded and she was given the role. A suitable actress could not be found for the role of the plum girl in England and the United States so Tykwer decided to look at actresses in Germany. Karoline Herfurth, who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a screen test with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.|$|E

25|$|Jamie Bell's {{audition}} {{for the role}} of Smike in a London hotel room left McGrath and the producers in tears, and they cast him on the spot. While considering Mrs. Crummles, a smug, opinionated, but lovable dowager, McGrath realized all her traits and characteristics were embodied by Dame Edna Everage, alter ego of actor Barry Humphries, but was hesitant to suggest casting a male in the role. The producers, however, agreed Humphries was an ideal choice. Nicholas {{was one of the last}} roles to be cast. Charlie Hunnam had been sent the script, but several months passed before he had an opportunity to read it. He met with McGrath, and based on a couple of hours of conversation with the actor, the director felt he finally had <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> man for the part. Ironically, the British Hunnam had to work with a dialect coach; having lived and worked in the US for the past several years, he had perfected an American accent in order to ensure regular employment.|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{news of the}} {{concentration}} of rebels in Rotunda were received, the military command of the city organised a detachment to break them up. The column, {{under the command of}} Colonel Alfredo Albuquerque, was formed by units that had been removed from the protection of the Palace of Necessidades: Infantry 2, Cavalry 2 and the mobile battery of Queluz. The latter included the colonial war hero Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro. The column advanced until near the prison, where it assumed combat positions. However, before these were completed, the column was attacked by rebels. The attack was repelled but resulted in a few wounded men, several dead pack animals and the scattering of about half the infantry. Paiva Couceiro responded with cannons and the infantry that remained during 45 minutes, ordering an attack that was carried out by around 30 soldiers, but which was beaten with some casualties. Continuing the gunfire, he ordered a new attack, but only 20 soldiers followed the order. Thinking that he had <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to assault the barracks of Artillery 1, Paiva Couceiro requested reinforcement to the division's command. However, he received the perplexing order to retreat.|$|E
500|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, with a 55%. rating. Pierson praised the episode's plot, the {{handling}} of Peter and Stewie, {{and some of the}} cutaways. He criticized the relationship between Lois and Peter as unconvincing. At the end of his review he stated, [...] "Family Guy doesn’t seem to have <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> balance yet between silliness and seriousness. So far its plots have been either irrelevant or emotionally unappealing. This was also a bit short on good jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|Early test {{screenings}} were poor, {{and many}} critics and industry observers were {{skeptical about the}} show's chances of success. The first season received generally mixed reviews, and several commentators found it too similar to The Office. The premiere episode was watched by 6.77million households, but the viewership declined almost every week in the Nielsen ratings. A season low of 4.25million households watched the final episode, [...] "Rock Show". Despite the low rating, [...] "Rock Show" [...] received the best reviews {{of the season and}} convinced some critics that the series had finally <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> tone.|$|E
500|$|St.André {{was ordered}} by the king to travel back to Guildford and to bring Toft to London, so that further {{investigations}} could be carried out. [...] He was accompanied by Richard Manningham, a well-known obstetrician who was knighted in 1721, and the second son of Thomas Manningham, Bishop of Chichester. [...] He examined Toft and <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of her abdomen slightly enlarged. [...] Manningham also delivered {{what he thought was}} a hog's bladder—although St.André and Howard disagreed with his identification—but became suspicious as it smelled of urine. [...] Nevertheless, those involved agreed to say nothing in public and on their return to London on 29November lodged Toft in Lacey's Bagnio, in Leicester Fields.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Several {{commentators}} {{said the}} show had potential, {{and pointed out}} that early episodes of The Office had been flat before the series found its footing. The finale, [...] "Rock Show", received the best reviews of the season. Several commentators declared that Parks and Recreation had finally <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> tone both generally and for the Leslie Knope character in particular. Several reviewers, even {{those who did not}} enjoy the show, applauded Poehler's comedic abilities and said her talent, timing and likability helped elevate the series above some of its flaws. Reviewers also said they particularly liked Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, and Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer. Some commentators approved of the Pawnee setting as offering a good opportunity to satirize small-town government and politics.|$|E

500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] {{features}} guest appearances {{from several}} actors and actresses, including Rosemarie DeWitt (as Midge) and Maggie Siff (as Rachel Menken). DeWitt {{was given a}} recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and I remember thinking 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure I was right for the part. Maybe the fact that I wasn't this 'vamp' is what made Matt Weiner give me a shot." [...] Prior to working on Mad Men, Siff mainly worked in theatre and performing arts.|$|E
500|$|According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs, Gilbert's plot [...] "admirably sparked off Sullivan's genius". Sullivan {{embraces the}} {{nautical}} setting; in [...] "We Sail the Ocean Blue", for example, he [...] "presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty". In the Captain's opening song, [...] "I am the Captain of the Pinafore", {{he admits that}} his gentlemanliness [...] "never... well, hardly ever" [...] gives way to swearing at his men, and although he has experience at sea, he [...] "hardly ever" [...] suffers from seasickness. Sullivan [...] "unerringly <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> musical setting for the key phrase 'What never?'... cunningly sharpened... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon." [...] Audrey Williamson argued that the music of Pinafore is quintessentially English and free of European influences {{throughout most of the}} score, from the [...] "glee" [...] for Ralph, the Boatswain and the Carpenter, to [...] "For He Is an Englishman".|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think {{it took us a}} while to find it but I think we <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> song." [...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] to be something that people didn't expect and then when we heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|E

500|$|Most {{songs from}} Back to Basics were {{inspired}} by real-life events that Aguilera had experienced. The track [...] "Oh Mother" [...] talks about Aguilera's childhood with her abusive father; its lyrical theme was compared to Madonna's [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989). Her marriage with Jordan Bratman was the main theme of the album, with tracks inspired by the event including [...] "Makes Me Wanna Pray", [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "On Our Way", [...] "Without You", [...] "Mercy on Me", [...] "Save Me from Myself" [...] and [...] "The Right Man". On [...] "The Right Man", Aguilera expresses that she has found [...] "the right man" [...] for her imagined daughter as she hopes that the child {{would not have to}} experience an abusive childhood like her, [...] "One day, My little girl will reach out her hand and she'll know I <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> man".|$|E
500|$|Series {{developer}} Al Gough {{contends that}} {{it was always the}} producer's intention to bring in the iconic Lois Lane, they just needed a good reason to do it—Chloe's supposed death at the end of season three appeared to be that reason. Gough explains that, when casting for the role, they looked to Margot Kidder—Lois Lane in the Superman film series—for inspiration. They wanted an actress who was [...] "pretty", [...] "smart", and who came with some [...] "wit". Dozens of actresses auditioned for the role of Lois Lane, {{but it was not until}} a tape from Erica Durance showed up that everyone felt that they had <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> Lois. As executive producer Greg Beeman describes Durance, [...] "She had a toughness about her. She was tough and sexy and direct." [...] Another plus, according to Beeman, was the chemistry between Durance and Tom Welling. Durance came on set that first afternoon and the two hit it off, becoming friends and developing a brother/sister relationship on the set.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2002, Hoffman starred {{opposite}} Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in Anderson's {{critically acclaimed}} fourth picture, the surrealist romantic comedy-drama Punch-Drunk Love (2002), {{where he played}} an illegal phone-sex [...] "supervisor". Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader saw the performance as {{a fine example of}} Hoffman's [...] "knack for turning small roles into seminal performances", and praised the actor's comedic ability. In a very different film, Hoffman was next seen with Anthony Hopkins in the high-budget thriller Red Dragon, a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, portraying the meddlesome tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in Spike Lee's drama 25th Hour, playing an English teacher who makes a devastating drunken mistake. Both Lee and the film's lead Edward Norton were thrilled to work with Hoffman, and Lee confessed that he had long wanted to do a picture with the actor, but had waited until he <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> role. Hoffman considered his character, Jakob, {{to be one of the}} most reticent characters he had ever played, a straight-laced [...] "corduroy-pants-wearing kind of guy." [...] Roger Ebert promoted 25th Hour to one of his [...] "Great Movies" [...] in 2009, and along with A. O. Scott, considered it to be one of the best films of the 2000s.|$|E
