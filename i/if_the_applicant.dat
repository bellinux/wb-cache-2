5|$|As a formality, {{a person}} must state a justifiable reason for {{purchasing}} a B category firearm, which include collecting, sporting, hunting or cultural activity, conducting business with firearms and ammunition, providing security, exercise of profession and self-defense. The police will issue the permit {{in up to}} 30 days (usually immediately) and the permit is shall-issue <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> has a valid gun license (and fulfills all of its requirements, e.g. clean criminal record); the purchase permit is valid for 12 months.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid {{police officers in}} accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised.|$|E
5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E

25|$|Historically, UTPA had open {{enrollment}} {{such that}} any student able {{to graduate from}} an approved public or private high school was granted admission to the University. This policy was implemented by former president Miguel Nevarez. After Nevarez retired UTPA moved towards minimum admission standards. The minimum standards for Fall 2011 admission are a diploma from a recognized high school and a combined Math/Verbal SAT score of 860 or an ACT score of 18. Additionally the minimum criteria will be met with a SAT score of 810 or ACT score of 17 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> is in the top third of his/her graduating class or an SAT score of 760 or ACT score of 16 will suffice <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> is in the top quarter of his/her graduating class. Any student who graduates from a recognized Texas high school {{as a member of}} the top 10% of his/her graduating class is guaranteed admission.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> is {{declined}} for credit, {{the lender}} is not obliged {{to reveal the}} exact reason why.

25|$|In January 2010, the {{starting}} base salary for incoming police officers was lowered by 20%. At the time <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> {{had graduated from}} high school their starting salary would be $45,226, if they had at least 60 college units, with an overall GPA of 2.0 or better, their salary would start at $47,043, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> had fully completed a college degree, the salary would start at $48,880. In 2014 after negotiations between the city and the police officers union reached an agreement on police officer pay that would give pay increases to nearly 1,000 officers who joined the department since the salaries for incoming officers were cut. The agreement also raised starting salaries for officers to $57,420 with an additional increase to $60,552 after 6 months which would become effective in the beginning of 2015. The agreement would also change the current overtime payment system from a deferred payment system, which was implemented to cut costs, to a pay-as-you-go overtime system as well as increasing the overtime budget from $30 million to $70 million.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} DBS {{check is}} primarily for positions of high responsibility (for example, accountancy and security).

25|$|Employment {{background}} checks and legitimate firearms purchases cause citizens to be permanently {{recorded in the}} system. For instance, the State of Washington mandates that all applicants seeking employment in an inpatient setting that houses vulnerable minors (such as children who are mentally challenged, physically or emotionally ill) are fingerprinted and entered into IAFIS {{as part of their}} background check in order to determine <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> has any record of criminal behavior.|$|E
25|$|Leave for a quashing order must {{generally}} be applied for {{within three months}} of the act or decision that is sought to be quashed. However, an application for leave can still be allowed <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> can account for the delay to the satisfaction of the court. There is no specified time limit within which leave to apply for a mandatory order or prohibiting order must be sought. However, the High Court has held that such an application should be made without undue delay.|$|E

Exchange will only proceed <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> appears in person at the relevant bank, and presents their passport or Chinese ID; these deals are being centrally registered. The maximum dollar withdrawal is $10,000 per day, the maximum purchase limit of USD is $500 per day. This stringent management of the currency leads to a bottled-up demand for exchange in both directions. It {{is viewed as a}} major tool to keep the currency peg, preventing inflows of 'hot money'.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>applicant</b> {{must show}} that he/she has been {{residing}} legally in France during the 5 or 2 year residence period.

25|$|Nowhere in Australia {{is there}} a {{requirement}} that a woman's sexual partner be notified of a proposed abortion or to consent to the procedure. Australian courts will not grant an injunction to restrain a pregnant woman from terminating her pregnancy, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> is the putative father of the fetus. There is also no waiting period for an abortion. A minor {{does not need to}} notify a parent of a proposed abortion nor is parental consent required, except in Western Australia. In Western Australia, a proposed abortion by a minor under 16 years of age must be notified to one of the parents, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the minor does not live with her parents.|$|E
25|$|No {{applications}} for dissolution {{may be made}} within one year {{of the formation of}} the civil partnership, except in Scotland. Like marriage, irretrievable breakdown is the only ground on which the court may make a dissolution order. Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not make such an order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent's behaviour, 2 years' separation and consent, 2 years' desertion or 5 years' separation. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by the evidence that the partnership has indeed broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the RMA {{argue that}} it ensures the {{sustainable}} use of resources for the foreseeable needs of {{the present and future}} generation, and also recognises the importance of indigenous rights in the mitigation process. In this respect, the RMA is a pioneering act in the area of sustainable development. Other advantages cited are the umbrella function, which (at least in theory) allows all consent decisions about a project to be considered in one process, freeing applicants from the need to research and apply for all the various permits they would otherwise have to apply for their development. It is also noted that the RMA is 'effects-based'. In other words, instead of a proposal needing to be on a list of approved or permitted developments or activities, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> can prove that the 'effects' of the development on the environment are unproblematic, then he or she is allowed to go ahead. In practice however, this proof is often elusive, especially with new or contested activities or developments.|$|E

50|$|According to Chapter 2 of the Constitutional Review Court Procedure Act, an {{application}} for Constitutional Review can be started by the Chancellor of Justice, the President of Estonia, any Local Government Council or an inferior Court.

5000|$|All jurisdictions that grant {{admission}} by motion require <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> to {{show that}} they were admitted to the practice of law in another jurisdiction and actually practiced there for {{a certain period of time}} (typically three to seven years), to prevent law school graduates from abusing this privilege to bypass bar examinations in states perceived as more difficult. Furthermore, many states only provide for admission on motion based on either an express reciprocal agreement or de facto reciprocity; that is, only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant's</b> home jurisdiction grants their own attorneys the same privilege.|$|R
25|$|Legal aid is {{available}} for committal proceedings in the Magistrates’ Courts; cases tried in the District Court and the Court of First Instance of the High Court; and appeals from the Magistrates’ Courts, and to the Court of Appeal of the High Court or the Court of Final Appeal. An applicant must satisfy the means test criteria which {{are the same as}} for civil cases. Notwithstanding that an applicant’s financial resources exceed the statutory limit, the Director of Legal Aid may grant legal aid to the applicant if the Director is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of justice to do so. However, in appeal cases, the Director of Legal Aid must be satisfied that there are meritorious grounds for appeal with a reasonable prospect of success. Notwithstanding the refusal of a legal aid application by the Director of Legal Aid, a judge may himself grant aid <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> has satisfied the means test. Applicants in cases involving a charge of murder, treason or piracy with violence may apply to a judge for granting of legal aid, and exemption from the means test and from payment of contribution.|$|E
