5|$|After the Civil War {{began in}} 1861, {{the demand for}} horses {{increased}} and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them {{as far away as}} New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861 Anderson traveled south with brother Jim and Judge Baker, in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had stated to a neighbor that <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> fight for financial reasons, rather than loyalty to the Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing loyalty to the Union. One way that <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> prove that loyalty was by severing his ties with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover.|$|E
5|$|As one policy initiative, Nixon {{called for}} more money for sickle-cell research, treatment, and {{education}} in February 1971 and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16, 1972. While Nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as sickle-cell disease and for a War on Cancer, {{at the same time}} <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> reduce overall spending at the National Institutes of Health.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{authorities}} reportedly maintain {{lists of}} high-profile overseas Falun Gong practitioners, {{and they use}} these blacklists to impose travel and visa restrictions on practitioners. Chen Yonglin, the defector from the Chinese consulate in Sydney, said in 2005 that approximately 800 Australian Falun Gong practitioners had been blacklisted (Chen claimed <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> remove most of these names).|$|E
5|$|He {{nonetheless}} persevered, {{staging a}} three-week, 17-city {{tour of the}} nation's ghettos and disadvantaged areas that none of his advisors thought politically worthwhile. <b>He</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> engage militants in dialogue, found himself exposed to the harsh realities and language of ghetto areas, and had an unusual encounter with hippies and The Diggers in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, after a {{reorganisation}} of the Indian Army, Ismay's regiment {{moved from}} Risalpur to Jhelum, {{further from the}} frontier. Shortly thereafter, Ismay was appointed the adjutant of his regiment, a position which he held for four years, during which time he also read voraciously and developed a great admiration for Winston Churchill, whom <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> emulate.|$|E

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>sought</b> {{re-election}} <b>to</b> {{an eighth}} {{term in the}} 1946 race but was narrowly defeated by Republican Abe M. Goff of Moscow.|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{was one of}} the few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the {{disastrous}} results, and <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election.|$|E
5|$|The ongoing {{criticism}} {{has been that}} the restorers presumed to know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling, and by what method <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> achieve it. The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved.|$|E
5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around the house, and the drive to the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> demolish part of it to create a smaller house. This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E
5000|$|Bawer himself {{characterized}} the criticism as symptomatic {{of one of}} the very problems <b>he</b> had <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> address in the book: ...|$|R

5|$|After {{his victory}} at Hastings, William {{expected}} {{to receive the}} submission of the surviving English leaders, but instead Edgar the Ætheling was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, {{with the support of}} Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ealdred, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced, marching around the coast of Kent to London. He defeated an English force that attacked him at Southwark, but being unable to storm London Bridge <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> reach the capital by a more circuitous route.|$|E
5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Although modest {{about his}} own {{abilities}} and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was {{fully aware of the}} talents he possessed as a player; {{there is some evidence that}} <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> influence his legacy. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews, assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.|$|E

50|$|Churchill's early novels were historical, but {{his later}} works {{were set in}} {{contemporary}} America. <b>He</b> often <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> include his political ideas into his novels.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> also <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> {{give more}} space to {{photographs}} and cultural news, {{before retiring in}} 1978. He {{died at the age}} of 86 in 1988.|$|R
5|$|Around 1924 Whorf {{first became}} {{interested}} in linguistics. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning. Inspired by the esoteric work La langue hebraïque restituée by Antoine Fabre d'Olivet, he began a semantic and grammatical analysis of Biblical Hebrew. Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya {{have been described as}} exhibiting a considerable degree of mysticism, as <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E

60|$|Despite himself Crispin {{felt his}} breath quickening--quickening with a {{pleasure}} that <b>he</b> <b>sought</b> not <b>to</b> account for--at {{the thought that}} she should have marked his absence from her side.|$|R
5|$|Demosthenes grew {{interested}} in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing Macedon's expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against Philip II of Macedon. <b>He</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the other Greek states.|$|E
5|$|Dillon started DragonFly in {{the belief}} that the methods and {{techniques}} being adopted for threading and symmetric multiprocessing in FreeBSD 5 would lead to poor system performance and cause maintenance difficulties. <b>He</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> correct these suspected problems within the FreeBSD project. Due to ongoing conflicts with other FreeBSD developers over the implementation of his ideas, his ability to directly change the FreeBSD codebase was eventually revoked. Despite this, the DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together contributing bug fixes, driver updates, and other system improvements to each other.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde {{has largely}} retired from {{politics}} since his {{defeat in the}} 2011 elections. <b>He</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> make amends with Menem for their past political rivalry, and met him during the 2013 Papal inauguration of Pope Francis. They had a private meeting at Menem's house, and Menem {{reported that they were}} on peaceful terms. They had previously met in similar circumstances in 2005, during the funeral of Pope John Paul II.|$|E
