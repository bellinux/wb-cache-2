2500|$|On January 13, 1913, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated {{was founded}} by 22 Howard University {{undergraduate}} students who had earlier been initiated into the Alpha Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Seven of them were the elected officers of Alpha Kappa Alpha: Myra Davis Hemmings, president; Ethel Cuff Black, vice-president; Edith Motte Young, secretary; Jessie McGuire Dent, corresponding secretary; Winona Cargile Alexander, custodian; Frederica Chase Dodd, sergeant-at-arms; and Pauline Oberdorfer Minor, treasurer. The 22 were dismayed {{at the lack of}} progress of Alpha Kappa Alpha to move beyond its function of orchestrating the affairs of campus society at Howard and wanted to reorganize the sorority to address higher purposes, like public service and women's advancement. The new initiates wanted to establish a national <b>organization,</b> <b>enlarge</b> the scope of the sorority's activities, and change its name to reflect a true purpose.

They also wanted to change the symbols, change the sorority colors, and be more politically oriented. In 1912, these 22 undergraduates voted to change the organization's name to Delta Sigma Theta. This new name was to reflect the group's desire to change the direction of the group and change in the philosophical underpinnings. The 22 undergraduate Alpha Chapter students sought to move towards social activism and greater public service, rather than continue to focus on social activities. According to Delta Sigma Theta's historian Paula Giddings, the 22 young women were concerned that since Alpha Kappa Alpha was not incorporated, there was no [...] "legal entity". Since there was no charter, there was no authority to form other chapters, thus limiting their ability to enlarge the scope of activity." ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1983 During {{the initial}} {{years of their}} rule, 1927 to 1937, did the Nationalists {{transform}} the politics of rural China? Through a study of Nationalist political organization and policy implementation in one particular area of China, Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, this dissertation attempts to answer the above question. It examines {{the establishment of the}} county's Nationalist Party and government organizations, the ways in which these organizations implemented policy, and the relationships that developed between the Nationalists and other political groups, especially the Communists and indigenous rural leaders. In 1927 the Rugao branch of the Nationalist Party briefly dominated county political affairs, but thereafter, because of the centrally-directed purge of Communists from Nationalist Party ranks, drastically decreased in importance. Between 1928 and 1930 the government tried to set up an <b>enlarged,</b> reformed political <b>organization</b> in Rugao, but {{because of the lack of}} higher-level support and local opposition was unsuccessful. After 1930 the indigenous local elite, as they had before 1927, once again exercised power and authority over Rugao political affairs. While the Nationalists never formally allied with local leaders, they often relied on them to carry out government policy. As a result, during the entire Decade the only Nationalist programs that were implemented were those in which local leaders took an interest. In the end, those most often were actions needed to alleviate a crisis, such as the rise of the Communists, or a natural disaster such as flooding, drought, or the appearance of locusts. Other long-term programs, such as water conservancy projects or agricultural improvement efforts, received little attention. Consequently, Nationalist rule in Rugao during the so-called Nanjing Decade can best be characterized as punctuated crisis government, and it can be seen that because the Nationalists in Rugao did not replace the pre-existing power structure, did not set up a sizeable political organization of their own, and did not implement most of their policies, that they failed to penetrate the Rugao countryside or to change the life of Rugao's residents...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years after}} the {{organization}} 2 ̆ 7 s founding, an air of disappointment surrounds the WTO. The great promise of a global trade regime, dedicated {{to the principle of}} comparative advantage, seems to have stalled. The Doha Development Round, launched in 2001 in an attempt to redeem the disastrous Seattle Ministerial Conference of 1999, has been stymied by familiar disputes between North and South, mostly with respect to agricultural issues, but with respect to nonagricultural market access and services as well. Frustrated by impasses at the WTO, members have increasingly bypassed the organization in favor of discrete 2 ̆ 2 preferential trade agreements 2 ̆ 2, or PTAs, that address trade issues in regional and sub-regional units. According to critics, these PTAs are creating a 2 ̆ 2 spaghetti bowl 2 ̆ 2 of trade regimes that threatens to make the global organization irrelevant. The dissatisfaction extends even to dispute settlement, long seen as the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s major contribution to international law. Although the DSU has had some notable successes, particularly in comparison to the often desultory GATT dispute settlement mechanism, commentators have voiced concerns. For example, one hears complaints that the retaliation remedy is too lenient, particularly in the context of asymmetric disputes between large and small economies; 2 ̆ 7 there are proposals to cure this problem by allowing for monetary compensation as a remedy. Commentators denounce the idea that members can violate their treaty obligations indefinitely—that members have the option to 2 ̆ 2 breach 2 ̆ 2 or to 2 ̆ 2 buy out 2 ̆ 2 their victims by accepting retaliation. Still others argue that the Appellate Body should be more willing to supplement WTO treaty text with other substantive international law, including customary international law. The Sutherland Report—more properly, the Report by the Consultative Board on The Future of the WTO—reflects this sense of unease about the organization 2 ̆ 7 s apparent drift. While affirming that the WTO represents 2 ̆ 2 the most dramatic advance in multilateralism 2 ̆ 2 since the 1940 s, the Report worries that the organization 2 ̆ 2 is not by any means fully equipped 2 ̆ 2 for the tasks ahead. To remedy this situation, the Report makes numerous recommendations {{in a wide variety of}} areas. The language is moderate in tone and the proposals mostly moderate in scope; the authors clearly understood the dangers of a radical transformation of the organization. And, as one would expect in a work done by committee, there are some tensions in the Report; its endorsement of plurilateral negotiations, for example, seems a bit at odds with its condemnation of PTAs. But one can fairly say that several important elements of the Report tend in the direction of strengthening the WTO as an institution, of making it a more independent and less 2 ̆ 2 Member-driven 2 ̆ 2 body. Reaction within the WTO membership has been tepid. There is little chance that the General Council will consider the Report before the end of the Doha Round, which could mean indefinite postponement. This lack of enthusiasm is not all that surprising. Enhancing the rigor of the WTO as an institution seems unlikely to solidify members 2 ̆ 7 commitment to the organization. On the contrary, increasing the demands of WTO membership—for example, by <b>enlarging</b> the <b>organization</b> 2 ̆ 7 s scope and making its rulings more binding—seems more likely, at this point, to result in greater suspicion and resistance. Empowering the WTO in some of the ways that the Report suggests could actually retard, rather than advance, the cause of freer global trade...|$|R
40|$| related values, {{while the}} three Portuguese regions {{have a small}} effect on values systems. While one of the {{enterprises}} is oriented to values such as: non-conflict, morality, social values and comfort; the other is oriented to: enlarger, competence, expressive characteristics of work and To attain goals/results". Apparently, each enterprise had generated its value systems, its own corporate culture. However, after we analysed all considered antecedents of value systems, we found that, at a general values level, the differences are mainly influenced by the personal characteristics (age, sex and education), Enterprise, region and individual organizational history have a weak influence on general values. On the other hand, at a work related values level, enterprise shows a constant and significant impact, by itself or associated with individual organizational history (e. g. seniority and training). Nevertheless, {{it is not possible}} to assume that this relationship results from a socializing process. The variables used as indices of socialization (promotion, training and seniority) appear mainly related with development/utility work related values (serve society, to attain goals/results and learn new things). In the enterprise managed like a public service, comfort and economic rewards are preferred, while, in comparison, development/utility are preferred in the enterprise managed like a private company. Thus, our data tend to confirm the enduring character of general values foreseen by Rokeach (1973), i. e. the individuals tend to keep their own values towards life, independently of the type of organization where they work (further research is needed with more and different kinds of organization). However, work related values, being more concrete and a specific domain connected with organizational activities, are influenced a great deal by different enterprises. Because the data happened to be available, we also analysed in an exploratory sense the antecedents on job/organizational perceptions mentioned before. Among the personal characteristics: education confirms the strong impact on those perceptions, inducing, when present, a systematic negative effect; while age shows a positive effect and sex shows weak or absent relationships. Among individual organizational history: seniority is only present in the regression equations when age is also present, which is certainly related with the strong correlation between them (. 88), nevertheless, while age produces a positive effect, seniority shows a systematic negative effect; training does not appear very related with organizational perception, however when present it shows a positive relationship, in opposition to education; promotion has only expected relationships with rewards perception. When considered on its own, supervision has quite a reduced relationship with organizational perception, nevertheless when in interaction with individual organizational history the number of relationships increase significantly. The effects of enterprise on job/organizational perceptions were rather expected according to enterprise characteristics. But the same did not happen with region. It shows quite an influence on perceptions. 181 where some of these influences produced by the Porto region are unexpected according to region and enterprise characteristics. Employees from both enterprises in Porto, which in public opinion is regarded as the "capital of work", are, for instance, more demanding towards the supportive and production orientation of their supervisors. As the Porto region is not related with specific values, the effects on perceptions seem to have to be interpreted in a cultural framework related with social norms. More research is needed to explain these specificities of Porto culture. The relationships found between general and work related values confirm theoretical expectations (Rokeach, 1973 and Vinson et al. 1977) and empirical data from the field of consumer psychology (Verhallen et ai., 1989) : general and specific domain values are logically and consistently related but not in a one-to-one correspondance. For instance, while morality general values are related with comfort work related values, competence general values are connected with expressive characteristics, economic rewards and development/utility work related values. General and work related values do not establish strong relationships with job/organizational perceptions. Nevertheless, the latter are not independent from values. As theoretically expected (James and Jones, 1989), these relationships tend to improve from descriptive perceptions to evaluative ones. General values found more related with organizational perceptions are: self-expansion -vs- self-constriction and morality -vs- competence. Work related values found more related with organizational perceptions are: comfort I (environmental) and economic rewards. General and work related values show moderate relationships with individual organizational outputs, where those that are established with affective outputs are stronger than those established with the declared behavioral output. Morality, self-constriction and social oriented employees systematically show a more positive reaction towards the job and the <b>organization.</b> <b>Enlarger</b> oriented employees are more organizational committed and give more extra-time to the enterprise. Among work related values, development/utility values have a positive relationship with job involvement, organizational commitment and extra-time; while economic rewards and comfort II show negative relationships with job involvement and organizational commitment. Probably, as a result of the scale used work related values are less related with individual outputs than general values. As theoretically expected, job and organizational perceptions are better able to explain the variance of job satisfaction, job involvement, organizational commitment and extra-time at work than values. And also as expected organizational levels nearer everyday life of the employees have more impact on individual outputs: job perception, group functioning perceptions and reward systems. Our results about the effects of enterprise on general and work related values indicate that to use the concept of value, in its more traditional sense in Social Sciences - as "a conception of the desirable" -, can not be done so arbitrarily and simply as is generally done. General values do not seem quite influence by enterprise (at least bureaucratic ones) and, thus, they can not be included in the framework of corporate culture. On the other hand, work related values are influenced by enterprise, i. e. they can be considered a dimension of corporate culture, but they are conditioned by the "enduring" general values which, in this way, put limits to some developments of corporate culture. Le. the enterprise seems to be able to influence employees values related to its activities if they fit in general values but it cannot manipulate their values towards general life. Managers ignoring this statement can be very disappointed with their cultural management...|$|R
