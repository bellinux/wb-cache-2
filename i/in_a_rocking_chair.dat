25|$|Alice Mitchell, née Johnson — Dennis' stay-at-home mother Alice {{is usually}} the reassuring figure Dennis can run to when things get too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. Although she grew up among animals on a chicken ranch, a running gag is that Alice Mitchell has a phobia of snakes. Another running gag {{involves}} Dennis's ever-changing parade of new babysitters: no one will take the job twice. Alice is also known for punishing Dennis's misbehavior by having him sit in the corner <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair</b> for timeout, although {{a couple of times}} she has instituted tougher disciplinary measures such as spanking, where afterward Dennis is shown crying or grumbling about the adversity.|$|E

Potter was modeling her sketches from a young kitten and, wanting not to show cruelty, she wrote of the kitten: [...] "She should catch him by the tail / less unpleasant". Children's literature scholar Peter Hunt writes that Potter was careful to protect her young audience from graphic details and she refused to depict death in her stories.|$|E

40|$|I like a {{good story}} well told. That is the reason I am {{sometimes}} forced to tell them myself. —Mark Twain What springs to mind {{when you hear the}} word “storytelling”? For most of us, it conjures up images of children gathered <b>in</b> front of <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>chair,</b> rapt with attention as an elder narrates a fairy tale. Unencumbered by the inhibitions of older years, they aren’t afraid to interrupt and ask for details to satisfy their cu-riosity, or clamor for more when the story ends. How can we, as visualization researchers and prac-titioners, elicit this same engagement and wonder in our viewers? How can we aid Mr. Twain in his plight and ensure that he isn’t the exclusive pur-veyor of good stories well told? All stories are sequences of causally related events.
