This paper proposes the framework to generate different offensive and defensive lists of commodities in the non-agricultural sector as input to the Philippine negotiators. Because the criteria that is used in generating the offensive and defensive lists is purely economic in nature, the negotiators are expected to weigh in the political and non-economic criteria to determine the final lists for negotiations in the PH-EU FTA...|$|E

40|$|The {{decline of}} {{manufacturing}} in OECD countries and job implications {{has been a}} long-time concern. Recently, policy-makers have set out for reindustrialisation. A trend related to these concerns and aspirations is the servicification of manufacturing – the increase in use, produce and sales of services. However, servicification of firms and its role for foreign trade and policy have only received limited attention. This paper reviews micro- level evidence and discusses trade policy implications. Servicification is found in several countries, including China, and {{there are indications that}} imported, domestic and exported services are key for the competitiveness of today’s manufacturing firms and their participation in international value chains. Therefore, the historic divides in trade-policy-making between trade in manufactures and services, between offensive and <b>defensive</b> <b>interests,</b> and between modes of supply are largely antiquated. Potential trade policy implications also include to: reform how governments consult business for trade negotiations; facilitate cross-border movement of persons; and cut tariffs on services embodied and embedded in manufactures and their sales.  Tjänstefiering och internationalisering av tillverkningsindustri...|$|E
40|$|In 2013, the European Union (EU) {{initiated}} {{negotiations for}} regional trade agreements (RTAs) with the United States (US) and Japan, key trading partners {{and two of}} the largest economies in the world. Both countries have strong offensive interests in audio-visual services, a sector that is a sensitive defensive interest to the EU. In this paper, it is argued that, besides the likelihood of it being unacceptable to the US and Japan, the ‘cultural exception’ for audio-visual services as applied in EU trade policy is ill-fitting for its purposes. First, it is too narrow at a cross-sectoral level and, second, it is too wide at the sectoral level. Therefore, it is claimed that the EU should reassess its negotiation strategy vis-à-vis audio-visual services. For inspiration in doing so, this paper analyses four cases in which the US and Japan have negotiated bilaterally on audio-visual services with counterparties with <b>defensive</b> <b>interests</b> somewhat similar to the EU’s, i. e. Canada, Korea, Switzerland and India. It concludes that whilst the Canadian approach, i. e. exclusion, is unlikely to be acceptable to the EU’s negotiating partners, the Korean, Swiss and, to a lesser extent Indian, approaches provide ample guidance for the EU to rethink its negotiation strategy for audio-visual services. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The 2006 'Global Europe' {{communication}} {{represented an}} important {{shift in the}} European Union's (EU's) trade strategy, ending a previous 'moratorium' on new free trade agreements and leading the EU {{to embark on a}} series of trade negotiations with emerging economies. In this thesis I study the drivers of this on-going preferential trade agenda. This poses a puzzle for conventional understandings of EU trade policy. While EU Studies approaches have treated it as uniquely insulated, focusing instead on supposedly 'exceptional' institutional determinants of policy, the shift to 'Global Europe' occurred {{in the absence of any}} institutional change to EU trade governance. I therefore begin by situating the study of EU trade policy within the discipline of International Political Economy (IPE), focusing on the role played by lobbyists (especially from the services sector) within a wider systemic context. I also suggest that rationalist approaches are insufficient to explain 'Global Europe' as the Commission's Directorate General (DG) for Trade served the interests of upmarket exporters at the expense of <b>defensive</b> <b>interests.</b> Given a strong mobilisation of protectionists with access to policymakers this liberal policy outcome cannot be explained purely in terms of institutional insulation nor be simply 'read off' from the material interests of societal actors. In contrast, I develop a novel constructivist IPE framework. While policymakers internalised a neoliberal discourse on the desirability, but politically contingent nature of, trade liberalisation – explaining why DG Trade pursued the policies it did, heeding the arguments of certain lobbyists over others – they consciously used a more necessitarian discourse in their public pronouncements to legitimate their agenda of market-opening. This approach also allows me to explain the recent convergence of what are traditionally seen as two distinct arenas of trade policymaking: the EU's 'commercial' trade agenda and its 'developmental' agreements with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

2500|$|This view is {{supported}} by German historian Johannes Burkhardt, who writes that Gustavus entered the 30 Years War exactly 100 years {{after the publication of}} the Confessio Augustana, the core confession of faith of the Lutheran Church, and let himself be praised as its saviour. Yet Gustavus' own [...] "manifesto of war" [...] does not mention any religious motivations at all but speaks of political and economical reasons. Sweden would have to maintain its integrity in the face of several provocations and aggressions by the Habsburgian Empire. The manifesto was written by scholar Johann Adler Salvius in a style common of the time that promotes a [...] "just war". Burkhardt argues that traditional Swedish historiography constructed a <b>defensive</b> <b>interest</b> in security out of that by taking the manifesto's text for granted. But to defend Stockholm, the occupation of the German Baltic territories would have been an extreme advance and the imperial Baltic Sea fleet mentioned as a threat in the manifesto had never reached {{more than a quarter of}} the size of the Swedish fleet. Moreover, it was never maintained to challenge Sweden but to face the separatist Netherlands. So if ruling the Baltic Sea was a goal of Swedish strategy, the conquests in Germany were not a defensive war but an act of expansion. From Swedish Finland, Gustavus advanced along the Baltic Sea coast and eventually to Augsburg and Munich and he even urged the Swiss Confederacy to join him. This was no longer about Baltic interests but the imperial capital of Vienna and the alpine passes that were now in close reach of the Swedish army. Burkhardt points out that the Gothic legacy of the Swedes, coalesced as a political program. The Swedish king was also [...] "Rex Gotorum" [...] (...) , and the list of kings was traced back to the Gothic rulers to construct continuity. Prior to his embarkment to northern Germany, Gustavus urged the Swedish nobility to follow the example of conquests set by their Gothic ancestors. Had he lived longer, it would have been likely that Gustavus had reached out for the imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the United States has pursued {{bilateral}} and re-gional free trade agreements (FTAs) {{in different parts of}} the world (table 1). This has marked a considerable shift in U. S. international trade diplomacy. While the U. S. Government entered into regional trade agreements in the past— notably in the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) —it relied mostly on the multilateral trading system to advance the progressive opening of world markets and to create legally enforceable trading rules. 1 Prominent in the recent set of bilateral FTAs are strong rules for the pro-tection of intellectual property rights (IPRs), a key market access interest of the United States—supported by private sector constituents who derive significant revenues from exports of intangible assets. Indeed, the trade promotion authority, under which these agreements were negotiated aims explicitly to promote intellec-tual property rules that “reflect a standard of protection similar to that found in United States law. ” 2 U.

It basically, underlines Turkey’s unique negotiating position; de jure developing, de facto an advanced economy {{status in the}} WTO Doha NAMA negotiations. At Doha Ministerial Meeting in 2001, WTO members agreed to initiate negotiations to further liberalize trade, among other areas, on non-agricultural goods. For this purpose, the Negotiating Group on Market Access (NGMA) was created at {{the first meeting of}} the Trade Negotiations Committee of the WTO, in early 2002. Turkey has been quite active since then in NAMA negotiations in calibrating its position between offensive and <b>defensive</b> negotiation <b>interests</b> although its offensive market access <b>interests</b> largely outweigh <b>defensive</b> one. Turkey has also been propagating an offensive non-linear tariff cutting Swiss Formula approach at the WTO to curb the international high tariffs, tariff peaks and escalations. Having a strong offensive market access interests, Turkey mainly aims at large developing country markets diversifying its trade portfolio away from traditional markets towards large developing economies. From the perspective of governance, Turkey has serious constraints on its trade and industry policy space stemming from the Turkey-EU Customs Union (CU). Although Turkey is a de jure developing country in the WTO and will have all legal rights and mobligations stemming from the outcome of the DOHA, in practice, Turkey will have to implement the same applied common external tariffs of the EU. Despite the constraints and dilemmas stemming from the EU-Turkey customs union, it can be strongly argued that, it is in Turkey’s industrial interests to be actively involved in the WTO to tackle the high tariffs, tariff peaks and escalations which hinders Turkey’s exports to the world markets...|$|R

40|$|The European Union is the world's largest trader, a {{fact that}} {{on the face of}} it ought to convert into {{considerable}} clout in international commercial negotiations. Yet, since the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) creation in 1995, it is difficult to point to a string of successes for the European Commission's (EC's) often beleaguered trade negotiators. Even the enthusiasm associated with the launch of the Doha Round in 2001 has dissipated as these negotiations have repeatedly stalled, with many questioning what can feasibly be accomplished at the WTO in the near to medium term. A 2006 EC decision to abandon its moratorium on negotiating new free trade agreements seems more of a stop-gap measure to maintain some negotiating momentum than a systematic strategy to leverage European clout. Worse, it carries the risk of seriously undermining the multilateral trading system if EC negotiations with Korea tempt Japan, and in turn possibly even the United States, to eventually seek preferential access to the European Union's markets. With so little to show for the last 10 years and the future of the multilateral trading system decidedly uncertain, a fundamental rethink of the ends and means of European trade policy is in order. That rethink needs to take account of the following realities: a shift away from a bipolar towards a multi-polar WTO; recognition of the fact that the principal liberalising accomplishment to date of the multilateral trading system has been the freeing of manufactured goods trade between industrialised countries and that many other potential reforms have either stalled or proved, on implementation, to be highly controversial; substantial opposition among many prominent groups in the leading trading powers to further trade reform (even in countries experiencing fast economic growth or export growth); and a greater emphasis on signing bilateral and regional free trade agreements (whose liberalising intent and impact is often highly circumscribed). Once the superficial attractions associated with the scramble for preferential market access in Asia fade, European trade policymakers ought to confront these realities. At a minimum, the search will then be on for a modus vivendi with the new trading powers. This will require thought to be given to the likely future offensive and <b>defensive</b> commercial <b>interests</b> of all concerned, bearing in mind the differences in level of development and overseas corporate exposure and organisation. The ultimate goal should be to identify the potential basis for future multilateral trade accords. Properly conceived, future European trade strategy could contribute significantly to the renewal of one of the most successful post-war international economic institutions. commercial policy; European Union; trade policy; WTO...|$|R
