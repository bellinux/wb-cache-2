25|$|The Early Dynastic period (abbreviated ED {{period or}} ED) is an archaeological culture in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) that is {{generally}} dated to c. 2900–2350 BC. It {{was preceded by}} the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods, and saw the invention of writing {{and the formation of}} the first cities and states. The ED itself was characterized by the existence of multiple city-states: small states with a relatively simple structure that developed and solidified over time. This development ultimately led to the unification of much of Mesopotamia under the rule of Sargon, the first monarch of the Akkadian Empire. Despite this political fragmentation, the ED city-states shared a relatively <b>homogeneous</b> <b>material</b> culture. Sumerian cities like Uruk, Ur, Lagash, Umma and Nippur, located in Lower Mesopotamia, were very powerful and influential. To the north and west stretched states centered on cities such as Kish, Mari, Nagar and Ebla.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>material,</b> and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDetermination of tearing {{resistance}} of heterogeneous dissimilar metal welds (DMW) {{that are critical}} structures of pipes in nuclear power plants (NPPs) is important in assessment of the structural integrity. Currently, {{tearing resistance}} of heterogeneous materials is determined by standards developed for <b>homogeneous</b> <b>materials.</b> The fracture behaviour of heterogeneous materials differs from fracture behaviour of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>materials.</b> Thus standards developed for <b>homogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> are not necessary directly applicable to heterogeneous materials. To develop a standard for heterogeneous materials {{the current level of}} knowledge of fracture behaviour in heterogeneous specimens needs to be increased. To enhance the knowledge of fracture in heterogeneous materials tearing resistance of 10 × 10 × 55 mm 3 and 10 × 20 × 100 mm 3 single edge bend (SE(B)) specimens extracted from a NPP ferrite-austenite DMW were measured. The specimens were extracted at three different crack locations in a region close to the fusion line between ferritic steel and weld metal of the DMW. As tearing resistance curves of the two specimen geometries are compared toughness and scatter varies, which can be explained by differing crack location with respect to the fusion line. However, the effect of crack location on tearing resistance was not microstructurally quantified, but the qualitative analysis of crack location done in this work implies that a standard developed for heterogeneous materials shall contain guidelines on characterisation of crack location...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we compare the {{propagation}} of a crack in a <b>homogeneous</b> linear elastic <b>material</b> and the propagation of a geometrically identical crack located at the interface between two ideally brittle materials. Whereas the former crack is free to kink, the evolution of an interface crack results in a competition among the relative toughnesses of the surrounding layers and of the interface. By constraining cracks in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> to propagate straight, as along an imaginary interface in a continuum, significant insights on the mixed mode growth of cracks at the interface between brittle materials are provided. It is shown that the collinear elongation in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> under mixed mode conditions requires a higher amount of energy, {{which turns out to}} be dependent on the mode mixity. Such a surplus of energy has the same mathematical form of the expression widely used to model the increment of the fracture energy in layered materials.
