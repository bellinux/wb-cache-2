25|$|The IMF's {{quota system}} {{was created to}} raise funds for loans. Each IMF member country is {{assigned}} a quota, or contribution, that reflects the country's relative size in the global economy. Each member's quota also determines its relative voting power.

25|$|The Conservatives and Liberal Unionists {{returned}} {{to power in}} the 1895 general election, remaining in office until 1905. During those years Home Rule was not on their agenda. Instead, with Arthur Balfour’s Constructive Unionism approach to settling the Irish Question they enacted many important reforms introduced by the Irish members, who, on the other hand, {{made no effort to}} settle their party differences. This bred apathy amongst the Irish public towards politics, much needed <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>from</b> America ebbing away. In this period of political disarray and disunity of purpose young Irish nationalists turned instead to the country’s’ new cultural and militant movements, enabling the Church to fill the political vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Paifangs {{usually have}} special {{inscriptions}} in Chinese. Historically, these gateways were donated {{to a particular}} city as {{a gift from the}} Republic of China and People's Republic of China, or local governments (such as Chinatown, San Francisco), and business organizations. The long-neglected Chinatown in Havana, Cuba, received materials for its paifang from the People's Republic of China as part of the Chinatown's gradual renaissance. Construction of these red arches is often financed by local <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>from</b> the Chinatown community. Some of these structures span an entire intersection, and some are smaller in height and width. Some paifang can be made of wood, masonry, or steel and may incorporate an elaborate or simple design.|$|E
25|$|In the forts along Hadrian’s Wall, no more Roman coins {{have been}} found in the {{excavation}} layers dating to after 407. Following the withdrawal of the Britannic field army between 407 and 410 by the usurper Constantine III the garrisons on the Wall probably lost troops as well. But it is unlikely that many soldiers from the north followed Constantine, as they were mostly born there and cultivated their own farms at their cantonment sites with their families. According to the Notitia Dignitatum, last amended in 420, the Wall appears to have been still guarded by regular limitanei until at least the early 5th century. They were at that time under the command of a dux (“duke”) who probably had significant military assets. Before leaving Britain, Magnus Maximus probably appointed a certain Coelius as the supreme commander on the northern border; he was the last to use the title Dux Britanniarum ("Duke of Britannia") introduced by the Romans. John Morris suspects that Coel Hen who, according to a Welsh tradition, was the ancestor of all Celto-British kings of the north, was in fact this Coelius. Archaeological finds prove that some forts along the Wall were still inhabited until {{the first half of the}} 5th century by the descendants of the Roman soldiers. Birdoswald was even continuously inhabited until the Early Middle Ages. In the course of time, most of them became fortified villages (oppida) or were used as quarries; a few milecastles were inter alia used as cattle pens. The southeast continued to be defended by the troops of the dux in Eburacum against attacks by the Picts and Scots. However, the administrative districts of the late Roman provinces in the south quickly became small independent kingdoms by inheritance, which is why the dux soon ceased to receive any material or <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>from</b> there. In the early fifth century Eburacum became the metropolis of the Celto-British kingdom of Ebrauc. The dux and his followers were now also rulers of an independent statelet. The consequence of this was that he finally left the southeast to itself and intruders were only fought when they threatened his own territory.|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 1819, the {{committee}} delivered its {{draft of the}} constitution and the society adopted the document, which provided that the organization should be known as the Polemic Society of Romney. The society's constitution also specified that the officers should consist of a president, secretary, and treasurer, each of whom was to be selected by a ballot vote. The constitution further stipulated that each member was to pay dues of 50 cents per month, and that the society had the authority to levy further <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>from</b> its members as it deemed necessary. The funds collected were to cover the society's operating costs, and the remaining funds were to be used in purchasing books for the library. Under the constitution, the society's meetings were to be held weekly. Following each meeting's business session, a debate or other literary exercises were to be held consisting of topics of general interest of the members. No political or religious discussions were to take place during the debates unless they were of an abstract nature or in general terms. Profane language and [...] "spirituous liquors" [...] were also forbidden from the society's meetings, with each offense being punishable with a fine of one dollar. The society's first elected officers were Charles T. Magill as president, William C. Wodrow as secretary, and John Temple as treasurer.|$|E

Free-State settlers from the North were encouraged by press and pulpit and the powerful organs of abolitionist propaganda. Often they received financial help from such organizations as the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company. Those from the South often received <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>from</b> the communities they left.

[...] Journalist Michael Massing writes that [...] "Jewish organizations are quick to detect bias in the coverage of the Middle East, and quick to complain about it. That's especially true of late.
