40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>treatment</b> {{planning}} and scheduling {{is an important}} part of forest resource management. It is a complex task requiring expertise and integration of multi-disciplinary fields. In this paper, we outline a real life problem from the ECOPLAN project called the Long Term <b>Forest</b> <b>Treatment</b> Scheduling Problem (LTFTSP). A review of optimization techniques applicable to <b>forest</b> <b>treatment</b> problems in general is presented, and contrasted with our case. The review suggests that long term scheduling is difficult because of the prohibitive size and complexity inherent to the problem. Based on experience from the successful resolution of a simplified problem, we advocate the use of iterative improvement techniques as a solution strategy. Iterative improvement techniques will in general benefit from high quality initial solutions. We show how a Constraint Satisfaction Problem formulation of the LTFTSP can be used to generate initial solutions. A key element to success is the use of a forest simulat [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Forests store {{large amounts}} of carbon in forest biomass, and this carbon can be {{released}} to the atmosphere following forest disturbance or management. In the western US, forest fuel reduction treatments designed {{to reduce the risk}} of high severity wildfire can change forest carbon balance by removing carbon in the form of biomass, and by altering future potential wildfire behavior in the treated stand. <b>Forest</b> <b>treatment</b> carbon balance is further affected by the fate of this biomass removed from the forest, and the occurrence and intensity of a future wildfire in this stand. In this study we investigate the carbon balance of a <b>forest</b> <b>treatment</b> with varying fates of harvested biomass, including use for bioenergy electricity production, and under varying scenarios of future disturbance and regeneration. Results: Bioenergy is a carbon intensive energy source; in our study we find that carbon emissions from bioenergy electricity production are nearly twice that of coal for the same amount of electricity. However, some emissions from bioenergy electricity production are offset by avoided fossil fuel electricity emissions. The carbon benefit achieved by using harvested biomass for bioenergy electricity production may be increased through avoided pyrogenic emissions if the <b>forest</b> <b>treatment</b> can effectively reduce severity. Conclusion: Forest treatments with the use of harvested biomass for electricity generation can reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere by offsetting fossil fuel electricity generation emissions, and potentially by avoided pyrogenic emissions due to reduced intensity and severity of a future wildfire in the treated stand. However, changes in future wildfire and regeneration regimes may affect forest carbon balance and these climate-induced changes may influence forest carbon balance as much, or more, than bioenergy production...|$|E

Currently there are nearly 50 million acres of Pinyon/Juniper woodlands and more acres are being invaded each year. Since World War II, the Forest Service and BLM {{have worked hard to}} stop forest fires. These efforts have resulted in more extreme fires today because of all the available fuels. Thinning can reduce or even eliminate the catastrophic aspect of a fire. Proactive management can provide positive use of pinyon/juniper fuels while reducing fire suppression and restoration costs. Utilization of woody biomass generated from <b>forest</b> <b>treatments</b> can provide jobs, stimulate the local economy and ultimately reduce the cost of <b>forest</b> <b>treatments.</b> Southern Utah Biomass, a loosely knit organization of private individuals and government personnel has come together to promote development of harvesting and utilization of pinyon/ juniper.

30|$|As fuels may {{continue}} to slowly accumulate in untreated ponderosa pine <b>forests,</b> <b>treatment</b> to reduce fuel hazard and stand densities that contribute to surface fuel accumulation is increasingly important.

Even if fuel accumulation is minimal in these untreated areas, the need still exists to restore stand structure and decrease ladder fuels that could contribute to undesirable fire behavior and effects.

30|$|In {{many parts}} of California, past timber harvesting, {{livestock}} grazing practices, and fire exclusion have changed the fire regime from low to mixed severity to a high severity regime {{with an increase in}} active crown fire. Land managers responded by implementing hazardous fuel treatment projects {{to reduce the risk of}} such uncharacteristic stand-replacing crown fires. Various fuel treatments have been implemented using either mechanical methods or prescribed fire in forested ecosystems across 14 national forests in California, USA. Mechanical treatments significantly altered forest structure (tree density, 75 th percentile quadratic mean diameter, canopy cover, canopy base height, and canopy bulk density) and generally increased surface fuel loads as compared to pre-treatment conditions. Prescribed fire significantly reduced ground and surface fuel loads and increased canopy base height, but did not appreciably alter other forest structure metrics. The changes in forest and fuel structures from prescribed fire reduced predicted fire behavior metrics (fire type, flame length, fireline intensity, and rate of spread); mechanical methods showed mixed effects on resulting fire behavior metrics. Modeled fire type, in addition to predicted flame length, fireline intensity, and rate of spread, is an essential metric for managers when choosing where to implement fuel treatments and for assessing the effectiveness of completed treatments. Under 90 th percentile windspeed, out of the five <b>forest</b> <b>treatment</b> combinations, three exhibited some passive crown fire before treatment and only one exhibited passive crown fire after treatment. Using gusting windspeed, four of the five combinations maintain the potential for crown fire (passive or conditional) after treatment. If reducing the potential for uncharacteristic crown fire is the main priority for fuel treatments, it might be beneficial to prioritize areas with elevated risk and to combine both mechanical methods and prescribed fire in order to achieve desired fire behavior under more extreme conditions.|$|E

The influence of <b>forest</b> <b>treatment</b> irrespective the separation into stump harvest and site preparation on Hg export to surface water streams was evaluated with regard to water quality (TOC, suspended solids, TSS) and with special focus on Hg and MeHg levels. Furthermore, the parameters affecting THg and MeHg concentrations were determined. 	Total phosphor (Ptot), total nitrogen (Ntot) and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were significantly higher in the treated areas compared to the reference sites (p = 0. 0465, p = 0. 0251 and p = 0. 0487, respectively). THg revealed nearly significant higher concentration in the treated areas than in the reference site (p = 0. 077). MeHg concentrations were not significantly differing between treated and reference areas, although a high standard deviation in the treated areas indicate that site specific catchment characteristics {{play an important role}} in the overall MeHg and THg mobilization. 	The individual comparison of stump harvested and site prepared areas showed no statistical significant difference. This might indicate that in general the treatment methods did not differ regarding their effects of Hg mobilization as well as nutrient and ion leaching on surface water quality. 	THg and MeHg correlated positive with TOC (R² = 0. 70, p < 0. 0001 and R² = 0. 48, p < 0. 0001).

This study could not confirm the indications in literature that forest harvesting is severalfold increasing THg and MeHg load to aquatic systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Much of the Sierra Nevada {{forests are}} {{overstocked}} {{with too many}} trees, {{are at risk of}} burning in stand-replacing wildfires due to the fuel loading, contain almost complete canopy coverage over the landscape and intercept {{a substantial portion of the}} snowpack, and in need of thinning. New research shows that forest thinning patterns allowing for forest structures comprising of clumps of varying density, single individual trees, and forest gaps are what the historic stands in Sierra Nevada were comprised of. In addition to returning the forest to historic stand structure, forest thinning will also allow for greater amounts of snowpack to reach the forest floor and persist longer into the season before complete meltout. This study set out to see if this new thinning spacing pattern would affect snow accumulation or ablation rates as compared with the current standard even-tree spacing. Data from four snow surveys, distributed light/temperature sensors, hemispherical photographs, and a small distributed network of snow-depth sensors were analyzed from three different forest treatments in the Sierra Nevada. The first treatment consisted of variable thinning, which reduced the stems per acre by 80 %, the basal area per acre by 40 %, and created a heterogeneous forest structure with small gaps and clumps of trees of varying density. The second <b>forest</b> <b>treatment</b> reduced the stems per acre and the basal area per acre stand down to similar levels as the variable thinning, however the residual trees were left to replicate a homogenous, even spacing. An unthinned control provided a comparison to pre-treatment conditions. Snow-survey data showed that approximately 10 - 20 % more snow accumulated in the two thinning treatments than in the control. Differences in snow depth between the two thinning treatments were statistically insignificant. Snow-survey results also indicated that the variable treatments kept snow on the ground longer than the even treatments in the 2013 water year, which had a peak snow water equivalent (SWE) of 17. 9 cm, and melted out at approximately the same time as the control units. In 2014 the peak SWE recorded was only 6. 3 cm, both the variable and even treatments melted out at the same time, and the control units kept a steady snowpack for approximately 1 - 3 days longer. Data from snow-surveys, distributed light/temperature sensors and snow-depth sensors showed that more snow accumulated in the open than at the drip edge and under the forest canopy, and that melt rates are faster in the open than under the canopy. Our data showed that the variable treatment held the snowpack longer and exhibited a slower melt rate than did the even treatments indicating a possibility to retain substantial amounts of snow in the mountains longer if this thinning structure were to be implemented on a landscape level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Sustainable forest {{management}} requires good {{information about the}} forest and its area. Decisions on <b>forest</b> <b>treatment</b> are taken on basis of the information you have, and errors in the information can lead to decisions being made on the wrong basis. For a profit-maximizing forest owner, previous {{studies have shown that}} errors in age and site index (SI), gives the highest negative impact on present value in a single stand. This is because SI is important for deciding what time to harvest, the type of regeneration and the optionally number of plants if planting is required. The SI is usually decided based on tree height and the age of the 100 largest trees pr. hectare (haa.) according to stem diameter. This method has some weaknesses, {{and one of them is}} that it requires fieldwork and therefor is expensive. An alternative way to decide the SI, which also is independent of the forests age, is to use the forest's growth over a pr. iod and the height at the start of the pr. iod. The use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) means that we in forest inventory in the future will have access to tree heights for the same area from two different times. These data can potentially be used to decide the SI. The present study aimed to demonstrate and validate two diiferent methodologys (directly and indirectly) for determination of SI independent of age. The data used in the study is area-based ALS- data from different times (T 1 and T 2) from an expr. imental area in the municipality of Krødsherad, Norway. The direct method utilizes linear (DLM) and nonlinear (DNLM) regression models to preach SI with input values directly from ALS-data. The indirect method (IM) uses the predicted height of the dominant trees (Ho) for T 1 and T 2 and then calculates the SI based on Ho at T 1 and the difference in Ho between T 2 and T 1. There were made spesific models for Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) The models were validated in 17 control areas consisting of 16 routes (233 m²) each. The models “error” was set as the difference between predicted SI and SI measured in field. The average error for DLM, DNLM and IM was respectively: - 0. 07, 0. 13 and 0. 66 in Norway spruce and - 0. 06, - 0. 37 and - 0. 97 in Scots pine and was not significant differentl from zero for all models. All methods and models, except IM in spruce, tended to overpredict the SI on sites with low observated SI and underpredict places with high. In conclusion, age-independent deciding of SI using FLS-data from two times has the potential to be part of forest inventory in the future. The costs associated with this should be relatively small...|$|E
40|$|A Landscape Analysis Plan (LAP) {{sets out}} broad {{guidelines}} for project development within {{boundaries of the}} Kings River Sustainable Forest Ecosystems Project. The plan must be a dynamic, living document, subject to change as new information arises {{over the course of}} this very long-term project (several decades). Two watersheds, each of 32, 000 acres, were dedicated to the effort by the Kings River Ranger District of the Sierra National Forest. Several documents were used to prepare a draft LAP in 1995. Although the plan lays out general guidelines for managing both watersheds, all land and <b>forest</b> <b>treatments</b> implemented under the LAP still require preparation of appropriate documents under the National Environmental Policy Act, which are open to public comment and appeal. Adaptive management is an overriding concept, with the basic intent being to learn from all individual projects and to adjust management directions accordingly. The existing draft LAP is presently under revision in response to new information from numerous discussions during field tours, new science presented in...|$|R

These studies, however, are few in number, the {{mechanisms}} underlying owl response remain unclear, only short-term responses have been studied, and a {{limited range of}} treatment types have been evaluated. There may be important tradeoffs between short-term impacts due to treatments and long-term benefits from those treatments due to reduction {{in the risk of}} high-severity fire (Lee and Irwin 2005, Ager et al. 2007, Tempel et al. 2015, Chiono et al. 2017). There also may be types of treatments that have not yet been evaluated that could reduce fire risk while maintaining habitat conditions suitable for spotted owls. Consequently, further studies aimed at understanding the effects of various types of restoration treatments on spotted owls are badly needed, as well as simulations of habitat trajectories with and without <b>forest</b> <b>treatments</b> (Lee and Irwin 2005, Ager et al. 2007, Odion et al. 2014, Tempel et al. 2015, Chiono et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Determining the {{life-cycle}} inventory (LCI) {{and impact}} of forest harvest, regeneration, and growth is necessary in conducting a life-cycle assessment of wood products. This publication provides quantitative assessments {{of the economic and}} environmental impacts of forest management activities covering portions of the Inland Northwest (INW), including Montana, Idaho, and eastern Washington, and of the Northeastern and North Central (NE/NC) forests from Minnesota to Maine and south as far as Missouri, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The management scenarios provide the inputs needed to develop an LCI on all the inputs and outputs for wood products as impacted by <b>forest</b> <b>treatments</b> and the harvesting of logs in the region. Productive timberlands were grouped according to forest type, productivity, management intensity, and ownership into three broad forest types in the west: cold, dry, and moist; and four in the east: spruce/fir, northern hardwoods, oak/hickory, and aspen/birch. Spruce/fir represented the feedstock to softwood lumber and a composite of northern hardwoods and oak/hickory the feedstoc...|$|R
