50|$|Cratonic {{sequences}} {{were first}} proposed by Lawrence Sloss in 1963; each one represents {{a time when}} <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas</b> deposited sediments across the craton, while {{the upper and lower}} edges of the sequence are bounded by craton-wide unconformities eroded when the seas receded.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} Devonian, black shales begin to {{dominate}} in the rocks, composed of detritus eroded from the uplifted Acadian highlands to the west; they also indicate widespread anoxic conditions across the sea floor.

50|$|Because {{the surface}} of {{continental}} crust mainly lies above sea level, its existence allowed land life to evolve from marine life. Its existence also provides broad expanses of shallow water known as <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas</b> and continental shelves where complex metazoan life could become established during early Paleozoic time, {{in what is now}} called the Cambrian explosion.|$|R

50|$|As a {{response}} to elevated global temperatures, the Earth's hydrologic cycle was significantly enhanced due to greater volume of moisture evaporation {{from the surface of}} the ocean. In turn, the absolute sea level during this time period stood at elevations much higher than the present level.

5000|$|The Transcontinental Arch {{refers to}} the islands of North America which {{extended}} from New Mexico to Minnesota and the Great Lakes region. [...] These islands were present during the Sauk sequence, the earliest cratonic sequence.

50|$|Early {{to middle}} Paleozoic rocks in Texas are {{typically}} carbonate deposited in <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas.</b> Exceptions include a significant areaof Cambrian sandstone in west Texas, and some shale strata from the Devonian and Mississippian periods. The Ouachita Mountains were uplifted {{across the state}} during the succeeding Pennsylvanian period; this provided a nearby source of sediment for shale and sandstone, along with more marine limestone deposition.|$|R

5000|$|The Sundance Sea was an <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> {{that existed}} in North America during the mid-to-late Jurassic Period of the Mesozoic Era.

5000|$|The Turgai (or Turgay) Sea or Turgai Strait, {{also known}} as the West Siberian Sea, was a large shallow body of salt water (an epicontinental or <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea)</b> of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras.

50|$|Encrinites form {{in areas}} where {{disaggregated}} crinoid skeletal debris becomes concentrated, typically shallow warm euhaline seas. They are therefore very common in the Paleozoic rock record of North America and Eurasia, particularly during the Silurian through Early Devonian and the Early Mississippian age, when high sea levels created widespread <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas.</b> Some encrinites are also known from the Jurassic of North America and Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|In hydrology, an oceanic basin may be {{anywhere}} on Earth that {{is covered by}} seawater, but geologically ocean basins are large geologic basins that are below sea level. Geologically, there are other undersea geomorphological features such as the continental shelves, the deep ocean trenches, and the undersea mountain ranges (for example, the mid-Atlantic ridge and the Emperor Seamounts) which are {{not considered to be}} part of the ocean basins; while hydrologically, oceanic basins include the flanking continental shelves and shallow, <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Marine {{regression}} also {{resulted in}} the loss of <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas,</b> such as the Western Interior Seaway of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered.|$|R

At times the Zechstein Sea may have connected with the Paleotethys Ocean through southeastern Poland; the point is disputed by researchers.|$|E
50|$|An inland sea (also {{known as}} an <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> or an epicontinental sea) is a shallow sea that covers central areas of continents during periods of high sea level that result in marine transgressions. In modern times, continents stand high, {{eustatic}} sea levels are low, and there are few inland seas, none larger than the Caspian Sea. Modern examples might also include the recently (less than 10,000 years ago) reflooded Persian Gulf, and the South China Sea that presently covers the Sunda Shelf.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper in this journal, Forte et al. [1993] have {{proposed}} a model of global dynamic topography with an amplitude of three kilometers (six kilometers peak to peak).

5000|$|Marinite is a gray to dark-gray {{or black}} oil shale of marine origin {{in which the}} chief organic {{components}} are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton, with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite and vitrinite. [...] Marinite deposits are the most abundant oil-shale deposits. They are generally widespread {{but at the same}} time they are relatively thin and often of restricted economic importance. Typical environments for marinite deposits are found in <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas</b> (e.g. on broad shallow marine shelves or below inland seas where wave action is restricted and currents are minimal).|$|R
50|$|These {{are both}} {{idealized}} scenarios; in practice identifying transgression or regressions {{can be more}} complicated. For instance, a regression may be indicated by a change from carbonates to shale only, or a transgression from sandstone to shale, and so on. Lateral changes in facies are also important; a well-marked transgression sequence {{in an area where}} an <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> was deep may be only partial farther away, where the water was shallow. One should consider such factors when interpreting a specific sedimentary column.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{particles}} remained suspended {{longer in}} this <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea,</b> flowing offshore as turbidites {{in a slow}} but persistent underwater avalanche. They finally came to rest {{at the bottom of}} the Acadian foredeep in the Appalachian Basin, hundreds of meters from shore, at depths that may have been 150 m or more beneath the surface.Alternatively, the basin may have been as shallow as 50 m or less, if the warm water was sufficiently stratified so that oxygen rich surface water did not mix with the anoxic bottom water.The Marcellus deposition produced a transgressive black shale,because it was deposited in deepening conditions when the basin floor dropped as the mountains rose up.|$|E
50|$|The Bromide Formation was {{deposited}} in a shallow, storm-dominated <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> that extended over {{part of the}} Laurentia continent, in what is today Southern Oklahoma. The sea spread into an area that sunk into a rift, that ultimately did not endure, a so-called aulacogen. Lying approximately at 30° Southern latitude, a low-land desert bordered much of the shallow sea from where well-rounded quartz sand blew in. This now represents the sandstone {{at the base of}} the Bromide Formation. Eventually, sea-level rise caused by subsidence drowned the borderlands cutting off the supply of sand, and now the shales and limestones of the Middle Bromide (upper Mountain Lake Member) accumulated on a broad ramp. Gradually - primarily echinoderm - skeletons build up a carbonate shelf. Further eustatic sea level rise (transgression) cut off the supply of virtually all sediments from land, and remains of carbonate-producing organisms began filling the basin. This now forms the limestone of the upper Bromide (Pooleville Member). Finally, a drop in sea level (regression) exposed the entire platform, and became a broad, nearly featureless, hot, semi-arid sabkha.|$|E
5000|$|The Tejas {{sequence}} was {{the last}} major marine transgression across the North American craton. Following the late Cretaceous regression that ended the Zuñi sequence, the oceans advanced again early in the Cenozoic, peaking during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. There were no dramatic <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas</b> in North America; indeed, the Atlantic coast advanced {{only as far as}} the Mississippi Embayment. [...] The Tejas was deeper in Eurasia and Africa, which experienced widespread carbonate deposition during the Eocene. There was a final transgression {{before the end of the}} Oligocene, the end of which marked the end of the Tejas sequence.|$|R
50|$|The cave {{is formed}} in Miocene (c. 22 - 18 million years ago) {{limestone}} created from {{the accumulation of}} shell fragments, sand and pebbles in the <b>Epeiric</b> Zealandia <b>sea,</b> and is a solutional cave.|$|R
40|$|Sandstones {{comprise}} {{nearly half}} of the Paleozoic (Upper Cambrian-Middle Pennsylvania) lithostratigraphic succession in the southern Ozark region of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. They record five distinct, but related intervals characterized by 1) Upper Cambrian arkoses resting unconformably on Precambrian granite; 2) Lower Ordovician reworked subarkoses, sublitharentites, and quartzites; 3) Lower Ordovician to Lower Mississippian reworked orthoquartzites; 4) Upper Mississippian first cycle sandstones with few metamorphic rock fragments (mrfs); 5) Lower Pennsylvanian (Morrowan) first cycle sandstones with common mrfs and Middle Pennsylvanian (Atokan) first cycle sandstones with common to abundant mrfs. These sandstones accumulated on a gently sloping cratonic platform reflecting transgressive-regressive, <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas</b> that eroded, transported, reworked and deposited more than 914. 4 m (3000 ft) of terrigenous clastic sediments across what is now the south flank of the Ozark Dome...|$|R
5000|$|The Eagle Ford was {{deposited}} in an inland sea (or <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea)</b> that covered much of modern-day Texas. The Texas shelf during the Cenomanian-Turonian was bounded by the Ouachita Uplift to the north, the Sabine Uplift to the east, relict reef {{margins of the}} Stuart City Formation and the Sligo Formation to the southeast, and the Western Interior Seaway to the west. The East Texas and South Texas regions were divided by {{an extension of the}} Llano Uplift known as the San Marcos Arch. Primary basins active during Eagle Ford deposition were the East Texas and Brazos Basins in East Texas and the Maverick Basin in South Texas. The bottom waters of the Eagle Ford sea were anoxic during most of Eagle Ford deposition, which is related to the global Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2), or Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, although the Texas shelf became anoxic nearly two million years prior to OAE2. [...] The low-oxygen conditions were conducive for preservation of the organic matter that ultimately generated the hydrocarbons associated with the Eagle Ford in the subsurface. [...] Evidence for anoxia include the high amounts of organic matter, lack of evidence for benthic organisms (fossils or trace fossils), and enrichment in the redox proxies molybdenum and vanadium. After the large drop in sea level (marine regression) associated with deposition of the Woodbine during the Early Cenomanian, sea-level began to rise (marine transgression), allowing for the deposition of Lower Eagle Ford organic-rich marls in South Texas and limestones of the Terrell Member of the Boquillas Formation in West Texas starting at about 96 million years ago. The rise in sea-level eventually drowned the East Texas Woodbine river deltas, initiating Eagle Ford deposition in East Texas. [...] The initial deposits, known as the Six Flags Limestone in Dallas and the Bluebonnet Limestone in Waco, are calcarenites predominantly composed of disaggregated prisms of Inoceramus clams and planktonic foraminifera tests.|$|E
40|$|Interpreting and {{correlating}} <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> sequences is key {{to understanding}} ancient marine environments. As a result, eNd, d 13 C and Sm/Nd profiles are developed as tools for interpreting <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> carbonates. Previously, eNd and d 13 C profiles in <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> carbonates {{have been used to}} study changes in the Nd isotope balance and C-cycle of adjacent ocean water. Instead, eNd, d 13 C and Sm/Nd profiles of Ordovician Midcontinent carbonates of North America demonstrate that fluctuations in sea level and depth are driving local changes in the eNd, d 13 C and Sm/Nd composition of epeiric seawater. Dissolved Nd derived from the Transcontinental Arch, Taconic Highlands and the Iapetus Ocean determine the eNd composition of Midcontinent seawater. As sea level fluctuated, submergence of the Arch and an influx of Iapetus ocean waters adjusted the Nd isotope balance of epeiric seawater. As a result, eNd profiles can be used to track the submergence history of the Late Ordovician Midcontinent. Comparison of stratigraphic variations in carbonate Sm/Nd ratios with sea level curves, conodont paleoecology, and the eNd profiles also suggests that variations in Sm/Nd ratios are related to changes in depth. However, processes effecting Sm/Nd ratios in epeiric seas may be varied and require further investigation. Sea level fluctuations and the waxing and waning of cool, nutrient rich, oxygen poor Iapetus waters onto the craton adjusted productivity and organic carbon burial rates on the Ordovician Midcontinent. Close to the Transcontinental Arch sea level rise caused an increase in organic carbon burial and productivity, while close to the Sebree Trough, and the influx of Iapetus waters, sea level rise caused a decrease in organic carbon burial and productivity. Differences in local C-cycling across a single <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> encourage caution when using d 13 C profiles from <b>epeiric</b> <b>sea</b> carbonates to track changes in the C-cycle of adjacent oceans. Because of their connection to sea level fluctuations, variations in the eNd, d 13 C and Sm/Nd profiles can also used to correlate Ordovician Midcontinent carbonates. However, the ability to correlate coeval strata using these profiles is limited by changes in depositional environment across the craton, which cause excursions to be absent, dampened, or magnified...|$|E
40|$|The Ordovician Kope Formation in {{northern}} Kentucky consists of fossiliferous limestone and shale. The Kope Formation is underlain by the Point Pleasant Formation and overlain by the Fairview Formation. The shale and interbedded limestones in the Kope contain brachiopods, bryozoans, crinoids, trilobites, and mollusks. Sedimentary structures include gutter casts, submarine cemented hard grounds, reworked concretions, and event beds such as distinctive faunal assemblages, taphonomic features, and trace fossils.

50|$|A {{theory for}} sea level {{fall in the}} Maastrichtian time period, the latest age of the late Cretaceous, has been {{proposed}} as evidence. It shows that sea level fell more {{at this time of}} the Cenozoic than any time during the Mesozoic. In rock layers at this time, the earliest layers represent sea beds, later layers represented shorelines, and the latest represented continental environments. The layers do not show distortion or tilting that is related to mountains, so sea level fall is most likely the cause. A massive fall in sea level would have greatly reduced the continental shelf margin which could have caused a mass extinction but for marine species only. This regression most likely would have caused a climate change by disrupting ocean currents and winds and therefore increased global temperatures. Other consequences include the loss of <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas</b> and the expansion of freshwater environments. Although the expansion of freshwater was beneficial to freshwater vertebrates, marine environment species still suffered.|$|R
40|$|Aragonite {{derived from}} marine {{molluscs}} is evaluated {{as the source}} for microcrystalline carbonate cements of limestone–marl alternations (LMA). Calculations demonstrate that extremely low levels of mollusc-derived aragonite, well below the production rates of molluscs in modern marine settings, could have provided sufficient carbonate to cement examples of Ordovician, Silurian and Jurassic LMA in non-tropical or tropical settings. It is likely {{that even in the}} Palaeozoic molluscs provided sufficient carbonate entirely to source microcrystalline cements of LMA. Autochthonous molluscan aragonite is the only viable aragonite precursor for LMA microcrystalline cements of cool-water settings where temperatures precluded calcified algae and abiotic carbonate precipitation. In ‘calcite seas’ where Mg:Ca ratios inhibited both abiogenic aragonite precipitation and aragonite generation by calcified algae, molluscan aragonite was again the most likely main contributor. In some <b>epeiric</b> <b>seas</b> where brackish wedges switched off the shallow-water carbonate mud factories molluscan aragonite is the parsimonious source of carbonate for LMA microcrystalline cements...|$|R
