5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This {{was followed by a}} cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the Olympics' closing ceremony. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The <b>Gherkin</b> and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E

The <b>gherkins</b> also achieved fame in 2003 with the award-winning film Good Bye Lenin! by Wolfgang Becker. In this tragicomedy, Daniel Brühl already had great difficulty obtaining the Spreewald <b>gherkins</b> that his sick mother (Katrin Sass) dearly loved and which he absolutely needed to convince her of the continued existence of the (in her view) [...] "ideal East German world".|$|R

25|$|Deloitte {{announced}} in April 2014 {{that the building}} was again being put up for sale, with an expected price of £550 million. The current owners {{could not afford to}} make loan repayments, citing differences {{in the value of the}} multi-currency loan and the British pound, high interest rates and general financing structure. In November 2014, the <b>Gherkin</b> was purchased for £700 million by the Safra Group, controlled by the Brazilian billionaire Joseph Safra.|$|E
25|$|The {{street in}} London called St Mary Axe {{is named after}} the Church of St Mary Axe, {{originally}} dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, St. Ursula and the 11,000 virgins. It was demolished in the late 16th century; the site is located close to where the skyscraper informally known as The <b>Gherkin</b> now stands. A manuscript dated 1514 claims that the church contained a holy relic: an axe used by the Huns to execute the virgins.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} was constructed by Skanska, completed in December 2003 and opened on 28 April 2004. The primary occupant {{of the building}} is Swiss Re, a global reinsurance company, which had the building commissioned as the head office for its UK operation. The tower is thus sometimes known as the Swiss Re Building, although this name has never been official and has more recently fallen out of favour, since the company's main headquarters is in Zurich and the <b>Gherkin</b> name has become more popular.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the show}} uses footage taken by its film crew {{for most of}} the episode shown, aerial footage of various {{buildings}} in London is used on The Apprentice, mainly to acts as small links between scenes and as part of the show's opening credits, and have included shots of the Square Mile and Canary Wharf financial districts, as well as the 180-metre <b>Gherkin,</b> HSBC Tower, One Canada Square, the Citigroup Centre, and the Shard; such locations aren't used for filming unless a task involves visiting the site.|$|E
25|$|On the building's {{top level}} (the 40th floor), {{there is a}} bar for tenants and their guests, {{featuring}} {{a panoramic view of}} London. A restaurant operates on the 39th floor, and private dining rooms on the 38th. Whereas most buildings have extensive lift equipment {{on the roof of the}} building, this was not possible for the <b>Gherkin,</b> since a bar had been planned for the 40th floor. The architects dealt with this by having the main lift only reach the 34th floor, and then having a push-from-below lift to the 39th floor. There is a marble stairwell and a disabled persons' lift, which leads the visitor up to the bar in the dome.|$|E

500|$|... 30 St Mary Axe {{opened in}} London in April 2004. Designed by Norman Foster, the [...] structure, London’s first {{environmentally}} sustainable tall building using recycled and recyclable materials, {{has been compared}} to the phallus and a <b>gherkin,</b> which also is a slang term for [...] "small penis"; its nicknames include <b>Gherkin,</b> the Erotic <b>Gherkin,</b> Towering Innuendo and the Crystal Phallus. Also likened to a [...] "phallic fat cigar", the building has been cited as a [...] "crude anatomical metaphor", yet {{has become one of the}} London's most iconic buildings.

500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{began after}} a filmed countdown showing numbers from around London on such locations as road signs, 10 Downing Street and the Palace of Westminster clock tower, {{with a camera}} panning up the River Thames over Tower Bridge before turning left towards the stadium. [...] The audience then completed a 10-second countdown {{to the start of}} the ceremony, to the chimes of Big Ben. [...] The arena had been transformed into a huge representation of the Union Flag in black and white, with ramps and famous London landmarks such as the London Eye, Big Ben, Battersea Power Station and the <b>Gherkin.</b> Newspaper cutouts on both the set and road vehicles sought to show a [...] "day in the life of London", with words from British literary figures such as William Shakespeare, J. R. R. Tolkien and Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.|$|E
500|$|Director Jonny Campbell helped {{search for}} several [...] "interesting locations" [...] {{for the first}} block to draw the {{audience}} with interesting visuals. This included a church in Smithfield and the Natural History Museum; in the latter's case, Campbell believed the location was [...] "harking back" [...] to traditional spy films. Filming there was expensive {{and management of the}} museum only allowed the crew to film for a few hours. The club Mace frequents was filmed at the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall. [...] "The Sleeper" [...] included scenes filmed at the University College London; a lecture room in the college was where the third series started filming. The explosion scene {{at the beginning of the}} episode was filmed at a council estate in Peckham. The estate was condemned for demolition, which proved to be a suitable location for a big explosion. The crew returned there again a month later to gather footage of the demolition work. Several exterior shots where Harry meets with government officials and his officers were filmed on walkways outside the Houses of Parliament. The upper class home of Riff and B in [...] "Celebrity" [...] was filmed in a house in Kensington that was for sale for approximately £27million at the time. Filming in public locations often took place on weekends, when they were closed off to the public. However, there were exceptions. Some scenes in [...] "The Suffering of Strangers" [...] were filmed outside the National Film Theatre in South Bank, a popular tourist destination. Shooting there became difficult as the crew had no control over the tourists. Other known London landmarks that were filmed at included Lord's Cricket Ground, St Martin-in-the-Fields, Tate Modern, the Old Bailey criminal court, Waterloo station, Empress State Building, and 30 St Mary Axe (the <b>Gherkin).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{secret of}} the Spreewald gherkins' special taste {{remained}} hidden, even to the satirist Fontane. Certainly, the moist soil, rich in humus, and the climate in the Spreewald {{also contribute to the}} good growth in the cucumber fields. The actual reason for the taste, which is considered by connoisseurs to be delicate, is found in their processing. While the process of fermentation in large barrels formerly took several weeks, <b>gherkins</b> today are ready for sale after only one day of processing—whether for mustard <b>gherkins</b> (Senfgurke), <b>gherkins</b> or dill pickles (Gewürzgurke) or pickled cucumbers (Salzgurke). This enormous time saving is achieved by heating to [...] with the addition of caustic soda. The composition of the additional ingredients, however, still remains a well-guarded {{secret of the}} approximately twenty picklers. These taste-enhancing ingredients, such as basil, lemon balm, grape leaves, cherry leaves or walnut leaves, give Spreewald <b>gherkins</b> their special sour, spicy taste.|$|R

2500|$|Béarnaise sauce ( [...] ; [...] ) is a sauce made of {{clarified}} butter emulsified in egg yolks and {{white wine vinegar}} and flavored with herbs. [...] It {{is considered to be}} a [...] "child" [...] of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in the French haute cuisine repertoire. The difference is only in the flavoring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorns, <b>gherkin</b> and tarragon in a reduction of vinegar and wine, while Hollandaise is more stripped down, using a reduction of lemon juice or white wine and peppercorns. (One means of preparing Béarnaise, see below, is to start with Hollandaise and add the other ingredients.) Its name is related to the province of Béarn, France.|$|E

60|$|As, {{whenever}} the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother {{took it to}} be an infallible sign that he ‘wanted support,’ the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit. It was a most wonderful closet, worthy of Cloisterham and of Minor Canon Corner. Above it, a portrait of Handel in a flowing wig beamed down at the spectator, with a knowing air of being up to the contents of the closet, and a musical air of intending to combine all its harmonies in one delicious fugue. No common closet with a vulgar door on hinges, openable all at once, and leaving nothing to be disclosed by degrees, this rare closet had a lock in mid-air, where two perpendicular slides met; the one falling down, and the other pushing up. The upper slide, on being pulled down (leaving the lower a double mystery), revealed deep shelves of pickle-jars, jam-pots, tin canisters, spice-boxes, and agreeably outlandish vessels of blue and white, the luscious lodgings of preserved tamarinds and ginger. Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach. The pickles, in a uniform of rich brown double-breasted buttoned coat, and yellow or sombre drab continuations, announced their portly forms, in printed capitals, as Walnut, <b>Gherkin,</b> Onion, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Mixed, and other members of that noble family. The jams, as being of a less masculine temperament, and as wearing curlpapers, announced themselves in feminine caligraphy, like a soft whisper, to be Raspberry, Gooseberry, Apricot, Plum, Damson, Apple, and Peach. The scene closing on these charmers, and the lower slide ascending, oranges were revealed, attended by a mighty japanned sugar-box, to temper their acerbity if unripe. Home-made biscuits waited at the Court of these Powers, accompanied by a goodly fragment of plum-cake, and various slender ladies’ fingers, to be dipped into sweet wine and kissed. Lowest of all, a compact leaden-vault enshrined the sweet wine and a stock of cordials: whence issued whispers of Seville Orange, Lemon, Almond, and Caraway-seed. There was a crowning air upon this closet of closets, of having been for ages hummed through by the Cathedral bell and organ, until those venerable bees had made sublimated honey of everything in store; and it was always observed that every dipper among the shelves (deep, as has been noticed, and swallowing up head, shoulders, and elbows) came forth again mellow-faced, and seeming to have undergone a saccharine transfiguration.|$|E
