50|$|Another type of War Tax stamp {{was issued}} with the a War Tax {{designation}} overprinted {{across the face}} of the stamp, in black or red ink. War Tax overprints were used in other capacities. War taxes were also placed on wine and spirits. To confirm the payment of this <b>tax</b> the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> Department overprinted the blue 5¢ Admiral stamp with the inscription <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> WAR <b>TAX,</b> overprinted diagonally in black. The olive green 20¢ and the black 50¢ stamps were also printed with the same style overprint. The 50¢ KGV issue had the overprint in red. The creation of a war tax in April on medicine and perfume provided a use for all three denominations. The overprinted War Tax stamps were not issued to pay for postage but were meant to be used to pay the tax levied on money orders. However, because all the War Tax stamps did bear the inscription that read Postage they were showing up on mail in Post Offices across Canada. The problem with the overprints got so out of hand that the Canadian Post office terminated the use of the overprinted stamps on May 20, 1915.|$|R

5000|$|On leaving {{school at}} age sixteen, Campbell {{went to work}} in the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> as a <b>tax</b> officer (1962-66). Campbell sold various of his early stories to editors {{including}} August Derleth and Robert A.W. Lowndes. His concept of what was possible in the weird genre became highly imbued with the influence of Lovecraft for the next few years. In December 1961, Campbell completed the story [...] "The Church in High Street" [...] (previously titled [...] "The Tomb-Herd") which he sent to August Derleth at Arkham House. Derleth accepted the story in February 1962 and it became Campbell's first professionally published tale, appearing in the Derleth-edited anthology Dark Mind, Dark Heart. Campbell wrote various other tales of the Cthulhu Mythos between 1961 and 1963. Derleth gave the young writer invaluable advice on improving his writing style.|$|R
50|$|To get Del set up financially, {{she pushes}} his {{relationship}} with Barbara, who comes from a rich family. Del takes Barbara out to dinner, where he gets engaged with her. Barbara's parents, Bernard and Beryl, take a liking to Del and invite his family over for an engagement party, during which Reg gets drunk and makes a fool of himself. Unfortunately, whilst alone in the kitchen, Beryl makes a sexual pass at a surprised Del and is seen {{by the rest of}} the family. Beryl confesses that she never had the happy, privileged life Barbara had, and became so jealous, especially with her disturbed childhood and unhappy marriage to Bernard, that she began secretly dressing in Barbara's clothes and listening to her music while alone. Despite Joan's efforts to patch things up, the engagement is off, and Joan ultimately decides to remain in Peckham for Del's sake. Meanwhile, Robdal and Kelly rob Pernell's art gallery together: many years back, Pernell cheated Robdal out of some money and went into hiding. Once Robdal went to jail, Pernell re-emerged, opened a new art gallery, and cheated Joan out of almost half of her wages. By robbing Pernell, Robdal will make him a target for the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> for <b>tax</b> fraud. Following this, Robdal vows to go straight, unaware of Del's failed relationship.|$|R

40|$|This paper reports early {{results from}} an ongoing {{analysis}} of the income dynamics of individuals, using the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> Department’s income <b>tax</b> database over the four- year period 1994 - 7. The first {{two parts of the}} paper assess the reliability of the data. The third part reports a preliminary {{analysis of the}} dynamic properties of individual incomes. Two types of analysis are used – an analysis of transitions between quintiles of market income over time – and an analysis of the covariance of individuals market and disposable incomes through time. The author finds that there is a high degree of consistency in the data, although inconsistencies point to the need for care in the handling of outliers. The analysis of dynamics suggests that, for this sample, a large fraction of the observed differences in incomes is transitory. For example, less than 50 % of the differences in incomes persist after 3 years. However, if outliers are excluded, the degree of observed persistence rises quite strongly: about twothirds of market income differences and about 60 % of disposable incom...|$|R
