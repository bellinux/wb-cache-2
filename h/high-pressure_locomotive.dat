5000|$|In 1924 the Delaware and Hudson Railway {{built its}} first {{experimental}} <b>high-pressure</b> <b>locomotive,</b> No. 1400 and named it [...] "Horatio Allen".|$|E
50|$|A 2-6-2 <b>high-pressure</b> <b>locomotive</b> of 1927, {{designed}} by Buchli. This used a three-cylinder motor {{to drive the}} wheels through a 1:2.5 reduction gearbox, then conventional coupling rods. This motor had poppet valves and uniflow admission.|$|E

5000|$|Locomotive 61 002 {{remained}} in Dresden and was employed on passenger train duties. As a one-off it created problems for traffic operating staff. However, for the Test and Development Centre for Engineering (VES-M under Max Baumberg) {{it was of}} interest as a trial engine for speeds over 160 km/h. It was converted in 1961 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn of East Germany at the workshop in Meiningen into a high-speed trials locomotive with a tender and the running number 18 201. With a new-design boiler, outer cylinders from the trials locomotive, H 45 024, and a new welded inner cylinder (the original cylinders were designed for a steam pressure of 20 bar and had too small a bore for the new, 16 bar boiler) and the carrying axle from the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>locomotive,</b> H 45 024, she attained speeds of up to 180 km/h.|$|E
50|$|<b>High-pressure</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were much}} more {{complicated}} than conventional designs. It was {{not simply a matter of}} building a normal fire-tube boiler with suitably increased strength and stoking harder. Structural strength requirements in the boiler shell make this impractical; it becomes impossibly thick and heavy. For high steam pressures the water-tube boiler is universally used. The steam drums and their interconnecting tubes are of relatively small diameter with thick walls and therefore much stronger.|$|R
5000|$|The Baldwin 60000 {{prototype}} {{worked at}} a modest [...] and did not use either of the complex systems described above. It had a relatively conventional watertube firebox and a firetube boiler. Nevertheless, high maintenance costs and poor reliability more than cancelled the fuel economies promised by high-pressure and compounding, and the design was not repeated. Other relatively conventional <b>high-pressure</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were built in the}} USA, including the remarkable triple-expansion L F Loree locomotive of 1933. None was successful.|$|R
50|$|The PLM 241 B 1 was a <b>{{high-pressure}}</b> steam <b>locomotive</b> {{built in}} 1929 for the PLM (Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée) using the Schmidt high-pressure system. It was a 4-cylinder compound design.|$|R
5000|$|ALCO {{produced}} steam locomotives for railroads for years. Later {{it became}} {{renowned for its}} [...] "Superpower" [...] line of <b>high-pressure</b> <b>locomotives,</b> such as those for the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1930s and 1940s. During World War II, it converted to support the war, making tanks for the US Army. As diesel locomotives began to be manufactured, ALCO joined with GE to develop diesel locomotives {{to compete with the}} EMD division of General Motors. But corporate restructuring to cope with the changing locomotive procurement environment saw the slow downward spiral of ALCO. Its operations fizzled as the company went through acquisitions and restructuring in the late 1960s. Its Schenectady plant closed in 1969.|$|R
50|$|SNCF 232.P.1 was an {{experimental}} prototype <b>high-pressure</b> steam <b>locomotive</b> {{ordered by the}} Chemins de fer du Nord, but delivered to the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF) in 1939. It {{was the first and}} only member of SNCF's first class of 4-6-4 or Hudson type of locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The DRG H 02 1001 was a {{remarkable}} <b>high-pressure</b> steam <b>locomotive,</b> built by the engineering firm of Schwarzkopff {{to the design of}} Dr L. Löffler. The aim was not only to improve fuel economy - the usual reason for adopting high steam pressures - but also {{to increase the amount of}} power that could be produced within the German loading gauge.|$|R
50|$|Most boiler explosions caused severe {{mechanical}} damage but often only the locomotive crew suffered physically; however, Brunton's locomotive was surrounded {{at the time}} by a crowd of curious sightseers, who formed {{the majority of the}} victims. The first <b>high-pressure</b> steam <b>locomotive,</b> Trevithick's Penydarren engine, had only appeared 11 years earlier in 1804, and engineering understanding of the forces and safety risks involved was still primitive.|$|R
50|$|The only 4-6-4 tender {{locomotive}} in the United Kingdom was the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) no. 10000, {{built in}} 1930 as an experimental <b>high-pressure</b> compound <b>locomotive</b> with an experimental high-pressure water-tube boiler. It {{was the only}} locomotive of the Class W1 and {{became known as the}} Hush-hush locomotive on account of the great secrecy under which it was built. Its trailing wheels were arranged uniquely. Instead of being in one four-wheel trailing truck, the first pair was a Cartazzi axle, mounted in a rigid frame but still allowed sideways deflection against a centering force, as typical of the LNER’s practice on its Pacific locomotives. The second pair was in a two-wheel trailing truck.|$|R
5000|$|In 1804, Richard Trevithick, in {{the first}} {{recorded}} use of self-propelled steam power on a railway, ran a <b>high-pressure</b> steam <b>locomotive</b> with smooth wheels, on an 'L' section plateway near Merthyr Tydfil, but it was found more expensive than horses. He made three trips from the iron mines at Penydarren to the Merthyr-Cardiff Canal and each time broke the rails that were designed for horse wagon loads. There was general doubt {{at the time in}} the grip that smooth wheels could obtain on smooth rails, and this resulted in proposals using rack or other drive mechanisms. Mr Blenkinsop of Middleton Colliery patented the use of cogged wheels in 1811, and in 1812, the Middleton Railway (edgeway, rack rail) successfully used twin cylinder steam locomotives made by Matthew Murray of Holbeck, Leeds. George Stephenson made his first steam locomotive in 1813 (patented 1815) for the Killingworth colliery, and found smooth wheels on smooth rails did give adequate grip. Although he later recounted that they called this locomotive 'My Lord' as it was financed by Lord Ravensworth, it seems it was known at the time as Blücher. In 1814 William Stewart was engaged by Parkend Coal Co in the Forest of Dean {{for the construction of a}} steam locomotive, which when trialled was reported to be very successful, but Mr Stewart didn't receive his expected reward and the two parties parted on bad terms and he was 'obliged to abandon the engine to that Company'. In 1821, a wagonway was proposed that would connect the mines at West Durham, Darlington and the River Tees at Stockton, George Stephenson successfully argued that horse-drawn wagonways were obsolete and a steam-powered railway could carry 50 times as much coal. [...] Shortly after the completion of the Stockton and Darlington railway in 1825, coal transport prices began falling rapidly.|$|R
