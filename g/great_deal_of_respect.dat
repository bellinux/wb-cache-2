5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney had a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, and simply {{could not afford to}} replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E

Although no one nation from Africa has formally been put forward {{as a candidate for}} membership on the Security Council, Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria are seen as the strongest choices. Algeria has gained a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for its neutrality over the years and its great commitment to African development; Egypt has the second-largest economy in Africa and the biggest military on the continent, was one of the founding members of the United Nations, enjoys great influence in Africa and in the Arab world, and hosts the headquarters of the Arab League; Ethiopia {{was also one of the}} founding members of the United Nations and holds the seat of the African Union Commission; South Africa has the third-largest economy on the continent; and Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, has the continent's largest economy, and is one of the largest contributors of military and civilian personnel to UN peacekeeping missions.|$|E

Despite Vorazun's many objections, she nominated Artanis {{for the role of}} Hierarch of the Daelaam. By the End War, Vorazun gained a <b>greater</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for Artanis. After the destruction of Shakuras and witnessing him survive against countless foes alone, she claimed Artanis had partaken and completed the [...] "Shadow Walk", becoming Dark Templar.

In 1985, Bill Graham had to once again pull strings for Santana to convince principal Live Aid concert organizer Bob Geldof to allow the band to appear at the festival. The group's high-energy performance proved they were still a top concert draw the world over despite their poor performance on the charts. Santana regained a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> in both jazz and rock circles, with Prince and guitarist Kirk Hammett of Metallica citing him as an influence.|$|E

25|$|When Lucchese became boss, {{he helped}} Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino in their fights {{to take control}} of their families. The three plotted to take over the Mafia Commission by murdering family bosses Frank Costello and Albert Anastasia. On May 2, 1957 Costello survived an {{assassination}} attempt and immediately decided to retire as boss in favor of Genovese. Then on October 25, 1957, the Gallo brothers (from the Colombo family) murdered Anastasia, allowing Gambino to become boss. Lucchese and Gambino started conspiring to remove their former ally Genovese. After the disastrous 1957 Apalachin meeting of mob leaders in Upstate New York, Genovese lost a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> in the Commission.

He is first {{seen as a}} hologram on Mars when Shepard is retrieving data to stop the concurrent Reaper invasion of Earth. The Illusive Man tells Shepard his plan to control the Reapers and attempts to foil Shepard when Shepard resists. Over {{the course of the}} game, the Illusive Man commands Cerberus to attack the planet Sur'Kesh, homeworld of the salarians, to instigate a war between two allied races and {{to take control of the}} allied interspecies forces' base, the Citadel. He makes another appearance on the asari home planet, Thessia, where he again tries to convince Shepard that controlling the Reapers is the best solution. Shepard refuses and suggests that the Illusive Man is indoctrinated. In response, the Illusive Man commands the assassin Kai Leng to steal vital information necessary to combat the Reapers. Shepard tracks the VI to Cerberus's headquarters and discovers videos of the Illusive Man having himself implanted with Reaper technology and warning Kai Leng of Shepard. In these videos, the Illusive Man shows the Commander a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect.</b> The Illusive Man makes his penultimate appearance at the headquarters. The Illusive Man appears at the Citadel in the endgame. Depending on prior in-game choices, players then decide whether to shoot him, or to convince him that he is indoctrinated, which makes him shoot himself. If the player shoots him he remarks how beautiful Earth is while gazing out through the Citadel arms, wishing Shepard could see it the same way, before succumbing to his wounds.|$|E

Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> social <b>respect.</b> But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B.

Larsa possesses a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for House Solidor and the men of his family, especially his older brother.

Other authors wrote to both him and Burroughs in Seton's defense, however; author and editor Hamlin Garland both wrote to Burroughs and spoke to him personally in this regard, saying that Seton's [...] "stories are based on careful observation."

500|$|Although Cherry {{points out}} that Chamberlain was an egotist, {{he added that he}} had good {{relationships}} with many contemporaries and enjoyed a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect.</b> He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention. Jerry West called him a [...] "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: [...] "The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand." [...] Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles. During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell. Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains. But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship got strained, and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of [...] "copping out" [...] in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years, until Russell apologized privately, then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas: [...] "There was a thing almost 30 years ago... I was wrong." [...] Still, Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted that he should have been [...] "more physical" [...] with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for [...] "intellectualizing" [...] basketball in a negative way.|$|E
