Hence the legal formul√¶: [...] "Everyone is presumed innocent until his guilt is proved"; [...] "Once bad always bad" [...] (i. e. in the same species of ill-doing, if amendment is not certain); [...] "What is known in a remote place is known in a neighbouring place", and others similar.|$|E
5000|$|A legal {{presumption}} (presumptio juris) is a presumption that is {{stated in the}} positive canon law (ab ipsa lege). Under the 1917 Code of Canon Law, {{legal presumption}} was divided into two kinds: <b>juris</b> <b>tantum</b> [...] "which is relative and vincible by both direct and indirect proof to the contrary", and {{juris et de jure}} or absolute presumption which can only be refuted by indirect proof (undermining the fact(s) upon which the presumption is based). This distinction between the subdivisions of legal presumption, the relative (juris simpliciter) and the absolute (juris et de jure) was not continued into the 1983 Code of Canon Law and was dropped.|$|E

Objectives: The main objective is to argue how, in the event of damage caused during transport, the carrier is presumed to be at fault, as an effect of triggering the presumption of liability, it may rebut the presumption of <b>juris</b> <b>tantum</b> by contrary evidence, proving that the real cause of the prejudice is not imputable. Prior Work: In the context where also the Romanian and European doctrine analyzes these causes, this paper aims at examining in detail and comparatively their impact, analyzing the legal texts, and also their impact during the trial. Approach: We will consider the exemption circumstances, based on the interpretation of international regulation of the contract of carriage of goods by inland waterways, which we will report in detail. Results: By comparing the two international conventions, we will demonstrate that these causes of removal of liability have a predetermined scope, {{in the sense that they}} affect both contractual relations and in tort liability of the carrier. Values: In the article it was used as a research method the analysis of these incidents laws, with direct interpretation of causes for exemption from liability of the Danubian carrier...|$|E
