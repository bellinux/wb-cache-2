5000|$|His {{pharmacological}} {{work was}} a materia medica written in Greek and, according to Erotianus, had the title περὶ ὕλης ("On material", [...] "On medical substances"). Dioscorides calls him a disciple of Asclepiades of Bithynia and speaks slightingly {{of him and}} others of the same school {{for a lack of}} care in investigating the remedies they recommend. Despite this disrespect, it seems clear that Niger was a major source for Dioscorides as he was for Pliny. Many of Pliny's books contain long stretches with close similarities to Dioscorides; and all these books are ones for which Pliny names Niger as one of his sources. Against the old view that Pliny was using Dioscorides, Wellmann notes that sometimes Pliny, sometimes Dioscorides provides a more detailed treatment and that the two were near contemporaries. [...] Unlike Dioscorides, Pliny writes of Niger with great respect as [...] "diligentissimus medicinae" [...] ("a very diligent medical writer"); and Galen also regarded him highly. [...] The work discussed medical effects of both plants and animals; its relation to folk beliefs can be seen in his comments on the salamander:Sextius venerem accendi cibo earum, si detractis interaneis et pedibus et capite in melle serventur, tradit negatque restingui ignem ab iis. Sextius says that sexual desire is increased by eating them, if they are preserved in honey with the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> feet <b>removed,</b> but denies that fire can be put out by them.From an examination of the parallel passages in Dioscorides and Pliny, Wellmann believes that his sources will have included the botanist Theophrastus and the writer on snakes Apollodorus.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to the oil}} content, <b>gutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> is avoided {{to reduce}} the risk {{associated}} with oily surfaces. The oily skin is kept as it retains the quality of the flesh. The filleting process is almost the same for the whitefish breeds, but oily fish is mostly canned.|$|R
50|$|Boneless Fish (Hone-nashi Sakana) is a fish-based {{frozen food}} brand and grocery product, {{the process in}} the {{production}} of which was invented by Dairei Corporation (大冷株式会社) of Japan in 1998. It is essentially a fish that has been scaled, <b>gutted</b> <b>and</b> deboned by a skilled worker before being reassembled with a transglutaminase to look like a dressed fish (fish <b>gutted</b> <b>and</b> with its <b>head</b> <b>and</b> fins <b>removed).</b> The fish is then flash-frozen and packaged, remaining uncooked.|$|R
500|$|However, in the Haouran region, Fellahs {{who were}} in poverty and {{suffered}} from famine ate locusts after <b>removing</b> the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> <b>head,</b> while locusts were swallowed wholesale by Bedouins. Syrians, Copts, Greeks, Armenians, and other Christians and Arabs themselves reported that in Arabia locusts were eaten frequently and one Arab described to a European traveler {{the different types of}} locusts which were favored as food by Arabs. Persians use the Anti-Arab racial slur [...] "Arabe malakh-khor" [...] ( [...] , literally Arab locust eater) against Arabs.|$|R
5000|$|Deep-water {{trawling}} {{is highly}} mechanised and massive capital investment is normally required to operate modern factory trawlers. These ships process everything caught on board. Even the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> are processed into fishmeal, {{which is so}} valuable it is known as [...] "brown gold". Elsewhere, major fisheries, such the northern hemisphere cod fisheries, were collapsing. Fishing companies in New Zealand were able to buy or lease the redundant trawlers cheaply. At the same time, the collapse of northern fisheries resulted in an unmet need in the world market for quality whitefish. Hoki and orange roughy from New Zealand were in demand.|$|R

50|$|Once the eel {{has been}} <b>gutted</b> <b>and</b> its <b>head</b> <b>and</b> skin <b>removed,</b> two inch long {{cuttings}} are simmered {{with a mix}} of finely chopped fresh herbs. These may typically be a selection of sage, ginger mint, oregano, sorrel, lemon balm (citronella), chervil, thyme, citrus thyme, savory, parsley, stinging nettle, spearmint, burnet, watercress, dragon's-wort, chives, and basil. Finely chopped shallot, cornflour, a little butter and salt are added. The stew is done as soon as the white flesh could easily be separated from the bone but still stays on when stirred gently; the amount of starch should allow the sauce on a plate after a minute to be a thickly flowing liquid. According to personal preference, a brighter green colour can be achieved by including spinach, though other aficionados reject this. Variations with beer or wine, lemon juice, egg yolk, or even with chicken broth do occur.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary market}} forms for fresh bass include <b>headed</b> <b>and</b> <b>gutted</b> (with the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> organs <b>removed)</b> and filets; the primary market forms for frozen bass include <b>headed</b> <b>and</b> <b>gutted</b> <b>and</b> loins. It {{can also be}} found in steaks, chunks, or whole. Fresh striped bass is {{available}} year-round, and is typically sold in sizes from two to fifteen pounds, and can be sold up to fifty pounds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} of cantabrian anchovy (Engraulis encrarischolus) viscera {{as a source}} of bioactive compounds is of interest for both, pharmaceutical and food industries. Cantabrian anchovy <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> were freeze-dried, extracted with methanol and subjected to fractionation by solvent partitioning using hexane, ethyl acetate, and butanol. Fractions were tested for antimutagenic, antioxidant, antifungal, and antibacterial activity using the Ames test; DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays; the radial grown inhibition assay; and the microbroth dilution method, respectively. Five fractions were obtained from the anchovy gut methanolic extract, in addition to the hexane- (HF), ethyl acetate- (EAF), and butanol-soluble (BF) fractions, an aqueous-soluble fraction (ALF) and precipitated crystals (ACF) in this were also obtained. HF and EAF resulted to be antimutagenic, HF and ALF showed antifungal activity, BF and ACF showed the highest antioxidant potential, and HF and BF were antibacterial against several strains. Anchovy gut, which to the present study had not been reported for any bioactivity, has antimutagenic, antifungal, antioxidant, and antibacterial compounds, which need to be isolated for full characterization and study...|$|R

50|$|To {{finish a}} board that is flat and of uniform {{thickness}} along its length, {{it is necessary}} to start with a board that has at least one perfectly flat reference face.

The reference face is often created by first passing the board over a jointer. If the lower face is not flat, the feed roller pressure pressing the board against the table will deform the board, which will then spring back as it leaves the machine, resulting in a non-flat upper surface.|$|R

5000|$|Working on foot, a few {{groups of}} Native Americans at times used fires to channel an entire herd of buffalo over a cliff, killing {{far more than}} they could use. The Olsen-Chubbuck archaeological site in Colorado reveals some techniques, {{which may or may}} not have been widely used. The method {{involves}} skinning down the back in order to get at the tender meat just beneath the surface, the area known as the [...] "hatched area." [...] After the removal of the hatched area, the front legs are cut off as well as the shoulder blades. Doing so exposes the hump meat (in the Wood Bison), as well as the meat of the ribs and the Bison's inner organs. After everything was exposed, the spine was then severed and the pelvis and hind legs removed. Finally, the neck <b>and</b> <b>head</b> were <b>removed</b> as one. This allowed for the tough meat to be dried and made into pemmican.|$|R
5000|$|Although sympathy is a {{well-known}} term, the implications of sympathy found {{in the study of}} human behavior are often less clear. Decision-making, an integral part of human behavior, involves the weighing of costs with potential outcomes. Research on decision-making has been divided into two mechanisms, often labeled [...] "System 1" [...] and [...] "System 2." [...] These two systems, representing the <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> the <b>head</b> respectively, influence decisions based on context and the individual characteristics of the people involved. Sympathy is an agent working in System 1, a system that uses affective cues to dictate decisions whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding on a home based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision. Sympathy acts in a way that provides a means of understanding another person's experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their individual well-being. It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all humans have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.|$|R
