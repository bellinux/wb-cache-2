Inside is a locked wooden box, with a transparent <b>dome</b> <b>top</b> and large red button visible underneath. An accompanying note reads: [...] "Mr. Steward will call upon you at 5:00 pm".

50|$|His {{courthouse}} building, {{completed in}} 1858, was an ornate Greek Revival structure with a tall, gilded dome 36 ft wide like its model. Its {{embrace of the}} style contrasted with the more restrained use of it on older buildings nearby like the Presbyterian chapel and Church House. The front columns were 50 ft tall, and the <b>dome</b> <b>top</b> twice that height. The cupola was once open to visitors, allowing for views to Lake Ontario to the north in clear weather.|$|E
50|$|The Innisfail Water Tower is a {{good and}} intact example of a 1930s {{reinforced}} concrete water tower, one of 15 constructed in Queensland during that period. Designed by the Irrigation and Water Supply Sub-Department of the Lands Department, it incorporates both central tower and surrounding support columns which were used on larger towers from the mid-1930s. As well as {{being one of the}} first towers with both a central tower and columns, at the time of construction the <b>dome</b> <b>top</b> on the water tank was {{one of the largest in}} the state.|$|E

50|$|The only {{surviving}} chapel of {{the original}} building stands by the northern wall. It is a small square building displaying oculus on the outside three walls, capped with a Renaissance <b>dome</b> <b>topped</b> by a roof lantern with a bell-shaped roof and a cross from 1617.|$|R
50|$|Marion County Courthouse is a {{historic}} courthouse located at Hannibal, Marion County, Missouri. It was built in 1901, and is a two-story, rectangular, Classical Revival style limestone building. It features an octagonal drum <b>dome</b> <b>topped</b> by an octagonal lantern towering above the two-story portico with four Corinthian order columns.|$|R
50|$|The spacious {{structure}} {{employed a}} radially symmetrical plan for spatial arrangement. The visual balance {{created by the}} precise construction became a characteristic aesthetic feature of Timurid buildings - one which would famously be adopted by the Mughal Architecture of India, especially in the gardens and structures of Humayun's Tomb and Taj Mahal, both commissioned by descendants of Timur.The double dome technique executed in the mausoleum made possible the huge domes of the Timurid era. The dome is created by employing a squinch, or corner bracketing, that allows for {{the transition from a}} square, octagonal or 16-sided base to a <b>dome</b> <b>top.</b> Indeed, the mausoleum's main dome remains the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Type 91 grenade was almost {{identical}} to the earlier Type 10. The main difference was the Type 91’s <b>dome</b> <b>top</b> {{as opposed to the}} Type 10's serrated top. As with the Type 10, a threaded socket {{in the bottom of the}} body allowed for the attachment of an auxiliary propellant canister for use in a Type 89 grenade discharger. The fuse was a percussion-activated delay type, initiated by pulling out a safety pin and striking the top of the cap. The grenade incorporated a 7-8 second delay before detonation. This feature was incorporated as part of the Type 91's other uses as a rifle grenade or as a shell fired from the Type 89 grenade discharger, as the long delay enabled longer time-in-flight to distant targets. [...] When used as a rifle grenade the fuse activated automatically, as the plunger was pushed in against a weak creep spring by the force of the launch. Additionally, the Type 91 could be used as a booby trap by removing the safety pin and setting under a floorboard or chair.|$|E
40|$|The oversnow {{traverse}} {{party of}} the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 1985 found {{the location of the}} top of the second highest dome in the Antarctic Ice Sheet at 77 ° 222 ̆ 7 S, 39 ° 372 ̆ 7 E with an elevation of 3807 m, and surveyed the dome. A ridge of the ice divide runs from the <b>dome</b> <b>top</b> in a west-northwest direction, and a narrow subsurface basin lower than 500 m above the sea-level extends in a scale of 100 km long below the <b>dome</b> <b>top</b> in a similar direction to that of the surface ridge. In view of the larger scale of 100 km order on the subsurface topography, this dome is classified into "the subglacial basin type" in contrast with "the subglacial mountain type" such as Dome A, the highest dome in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Comparative study between such types is important for discussions on the formation, development and variation of the ice sheet in the geological time scale, as well as their dynamics. From climatological and glaciological observations around the dome, the directions of prevailing winds and the lapse rates of snow temperature at 10 m depth (annual mean air temperature) are described, and the effect of the surface slope on such surface environments is discussed briefly. Annual mean air temperature at the <b>dome</b> <b>top</b> is estimated to be - 58. 0 ℃. By the use of mean annual net accumulation of 3. 2 cm in water equivalent which was abtained from the 5 m-pit profile of tritium content near the <b>dome</b> <b>top,</b> age of the dome ice with depth is simply estimated...|$|E

40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study was}} performed utilizing a three dimensional {{finite element model}} to assess allowable cavern field sizes for strategic petroleum reserve salt domes. A potential exists for tensile fracturing and dilatancy damage to salt that can compromise the integrity of a cavern field in situations where high extraction ratios exist. The effects of salt creep rate, depth of salt <b>dome</b> <b>top,</b> dome size, caprock thickness, elastic moduli of caprock and surrounding rock, lateral stress ratio of surrounding rock, cavern size, depth of cavern, and number of caverns are examined numerically. As a result, a correlation table between the parameters and {{the impact on the}} performance of storage field was established. In general, slower salt creep rates, deeper depth of salt <b>dome</b> <b>top,</b> larger elastic moduli of caprock and surrounding rock, and a smaller radius of cavern are better for structural performance of the salt dome...|$|E
