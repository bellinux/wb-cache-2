5|$|Clausholm Castle (1693–94) near Randers was {{designed}} by the Danish architect Ernst Brandenburger with assistance of the Swede Nicodemus Tessin who was invited to decorate the facade.

5|$|Excluding Whitney's sports fields, the school's outdoor {{facilities}} {{are composed of}} a number of circular gathering areas (including an amphitheatre) that were <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> during lunch hour and for outdoor class excursions.

5|$|The large caliber {{guns were}} {{designed}} to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a high explosive round <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} types of torches <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on the relay: a {{standard}} solid fuel powered torch made of aluminium, a special butane gas torch used onboard HMS Whitesand Bay, and a final torch used to enter Empire Stadium that was made of stainless steel and powered by a magnesium candle.|$|E
5|$|Calabria was <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in Italy's colonial empire, {{rather than}} the earlier vessels {{intended}} as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the scabbard and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were originally <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E
5|$|Mir {{was based}} upon the Salyut series of space {{stations}} previously launched by the Soviet Union (seven Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971), and was mainly serviced by Russian-manned Soyuz spacecraft and Progress cargo ships. The Buran space shuttle was anticipated to visit Mir, but its program was canceled after its first unmanned spaceflight. Visiting US Space Shuttles used an Androgynous Peripheral Attach System docking collar originally designed for Buran, mounted on a bracket originally <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with the American Space Station Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on footpaths or pedestrian zones, {{are built on}} a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E

5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually {{not a perfect}} circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The Alekseyev I-212 was a twin-engined, jet fighter {{designed}} in the USSR in 1947 at OKB-21 (OKB - experimental design bureau). It was a two-seat variant of the I-21 (Istrebitel - Fighter) {{designed in}} response to a requirement for a very long-range fighter issued by the Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily (VVS), (Soviet Air Forces), in 1946. Intended as an escort fighter, it was also <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as a night fighter and reconnaissance aircraft. No prototype was built, although some parts may have begun building before the project was completed.|$|E
5|$|The BT19 was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Hewland HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with less powerful 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine {{was more than the}} gearbox could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, with the result that Brabham normally made very gentle starts to avoid gearbox breakages. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at the request of both Brabham and Dan Gurney's Anglo American Racers team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.|$|E
50|$|The {{device was}} {{produced}} after a successful crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter. It also {{introduced a new}} battery-less film cartridge <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with the Instant Lab, which-unlike vintage Polaroid cameras-is internally powered.|$|R
50|$|Wrist straps <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> {{industrial}} <b>use</b> usually {{connect to}} earth bonding points, ground connections {{built into the}} workplace, via either a standard 4 mm plug or 10 mm press stud, whereas straps <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> consumer <b>use</b> often have a crocodile clip for the ground connection.|$|R
50|$|The Class EF65 was {{designed}} by Japanese National Railways (JNR) as a standard locomotive type developed from the earlier Class EF60 <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> primarily on the Tokaido Main Line and Sanyo Main Line.|$|R
5|$|The Fairey Spearfish was a British carrier-based, single-engined, torpedo bomber/dive bomber {{that was}} ordered from Fairey Aviation for the Fleet Air Arm during World War II. Designed during the war, the {{prototype}} did not fly until July 1945. Much larger than earlier naval bombers, it was <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> aboard the large s that were cancelled {{after the war}} and was itself cancelled thereafter. Seven prototypes were ordered, but only five were built, of which four actually flew. They were mostly used for experimental work until the last aircraft was scrapped in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Genesis {{represents}} Sega's {{entry into}} the 16-bit era of video game consoles. In Japan, Sega released the Mega Jet, a portable version of the Mega Drive <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on Japan Airlines flights. As a condensed version, the Mega Jet requires a connection to a television screen and a power source, and so outside of airline flights it is only useful in cars equipped with a television set and cigarette lighter receptacle.|$|E
5|$|The orbiter {{carried the}} Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) pallet in its forward payload bay; this had {{previously}} flown on Columbia to carry test equipment. The pallet was not outfitted with any flight instrumentation, but {{was used to}} mount two experiments. The first studied the interaction of ambient atomic oxygen with the structural materials of the orbiter and payload, while the second tested {{the performance of a}} heat pipe <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in the heat rejection systems of future spacecraft.|$|E
