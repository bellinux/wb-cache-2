40|$|Free planar {{electrons}} {{in a uniform}} magnetic field are shown to possess the symmetry of area-preserving diffeomorphisms ($W$-infinity algebra). Intuitively, this {{is a consequence of}} gauge invariance, which forces dynamics to depend only on the flux. The infinity of generators of this symmetry act within each Landau level, which is infinite-dimensional in the thermodynamical limit. The <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> states corresponding to completely filled Landau levels (integer quantum Hall effect) are shown to be infinitely symmetric, since they are annihilated by an infinite subset of generators. This geometrical characterization of incompressibility also holds for fractional fillings of the lowest level (simplest fractional Hall effect) in the presence of Haldane's effective two-body interactions. Although these modify the symmetry algebra, the corresponding <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> states proposed by Laughlin are again symmetric with respect to the modified infinite algebra.

The transition between P= 0 and 1, as seen when e. g. the magnetic field is tilted, is also studied by exact diagonalization in toroidal and spherical geometries.

For d {{of the order of}} the magnetic length and for all values of ∆t, we conclude that, in contrast to previous claims, the incompressible states appear at magic values of M which do not differ from those obtained for a single dot, namely M = N(N − 1) / 2 + j N where j is a positive integer number. For large inter-dot distance and simultaneously small inter-dot hopping parameter, new sequences of magic values of M are observed. These new sequences can be easily understood in terms of a transition regime towards a system of two decoupled single dots.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} Hofstadter butterfly, we define lattice {{versions}} of Landau levels {{as well as}} a continuum limit which ensures that they scale to continuum Landau levels. By including a next-neighbor repulsive interaction and projecting onto the lowest lattice Landau level, we show that <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> states exist at filling fractions, ν = 1 / 3, 2 / 5 and 3 / 7. Already for values of l 0 /a ∼ 2 where l 0 (a) is the magnetic length (lattice constant), the lattice version of the ν = 1 / 3 state reproduces with nearly perfect accuracy the the continuum Laughlin state. The numerical data strongly suggests that at odd filling fractions of the lowest lattice Landau level, the lattice constant is an irrelevant length scale.

It is shown that at sufficiently high density the QE's form pairs or larger clusters. This behavior, opposite to Laughlin correlations, invalidates the (sometimes invoked) reapplication of the composite fermion picture to the individual QE's. The series of finite-size <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> states are identified at the QE filling factors nu_QE= 1 / 2, 1 / 3, 2 / 3, corresponding to the electron fillings nu= 3 / 8, 4 / 11, 5 / 13.

40|$|The {{electron}} correlations {{near the}} half-filling {{of the lowest}} and excited Landau levels (LL's) are studied using numerical diagonalization. It is shown that in the low lying states electrons avoid pair states with relative angular momenta R corresponding to positive anharmonicity of the interaction pseudopotential V(R). In the lowest LL, the super-harmonic behavior of V(R) causes Laughlin correlations (avoiding pairs with R= 1) and the Laughlin-Jain series of <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> states. In the first excited LL, V(R) is harmonic at short range and a different series of incompressible states results. Similar correlations occur in the paired Moore-Read ν= 52 state and in the ν= 73 and 83 states, all having small total parentage from R= 1 and 3 and large parentage from R= 5. The ν= 73 and 83 states are different from Laughlin ν= 13 and 23 states and, in finite systems, occur at a different LL degeneracy (flux). The series of Laughlin correlated states of electron pairs at ν= 2 + 2 /(q_ 2 + 2) = 83, 52, 125, and 73 is proposed, although only in the ν= 52 state pairing has been confirmed numerically. In the second excited LL, V(R) is sub-harmonic at short range and (near the half-filling) the electrons group into spatially separated larger ν= 1 droplets to minimize the number of strongly repulsive pair states at R= 3 and 5.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{strongly}} correlated regime of a two-component trapped ultracold fermionic gas in a synthetic non-Abelian U(2) gauge potential, {{that consists of}} both a magnetic field and a homogeneous spin-orbit coupling. This gauge potential deforms the Landau levels (LLs) {{with respect to the}} Abelian case and exchanges their ordering {{as a function of the}} spin-orbit coupling. In view of experimental realizations, we show that a harmonic potential combined with a Zeeman term, gives rise to an angular momentum term, which can be used to test the stability of the correlated states obtained through interactions. We derive the Haldane pseudopotentials (HPs) describing the interspecies contact interaction within a lowest LL approximation. Unlike ordinary fractional quantum Hall systems and ultracold bosons with short-range interactions in the same gauge potential, the HPs for sufficiently strong non-Abelian fields show an unconventional non-monotonic behaviour in the relative angular momentum. Exploiting this property, we study the occurrence of new <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> states as a function of the total angular momentum. In the first deformed Landau level (DLL) we obtain Laughlin and Jain states. Instead, in the second DLL three classes of stabilized states appear: Laughlin states, a series of intermediate strongly correlated states and finally vortices of the integer quantum Hall state. Remarkably, in the intermediate regime, the non-monotonic HPs of the second DLL induce two-particle correlations which are reminiscent of paired states such as the Haffnian state. Via exact diagonalization in the disk geometry, we compute experimentally relevant observables such as density profiles and correlations, and we study the entanglement spectra as a further tool to characterize the obtained strongly correlated states.

40|$|We {{achieve an}} {{explicit}} {{construction of the}} lowest Landau level (LLL) projected wave functions for composite fermions in the periodic (torus) geometry. To this end, we first demonstrate how the vortex attachment of the composite fermion (CF) theory can be accomplished in the torus geometry to produce the "unprojected" wave functions satisfying the correct (quasi-) periodic boundary conditions. We then consider two methods for projecting these wave functions into the LLL. The direct projection produces valid wave functions but can be implemented only for very small systems. The more powerful and more useful projection method of Jain and Kamilla fails in the torus geometry {{because it does not}} preserve the periodic boundary conditions and thus takes us out of the original Hilbert space. We have succeeded in constructing a modified projection method that is consistent with both the periodic boundary conditions and the general structure of the CF theory. This method is valid for a large class of states of composite fermions, called "proper states," which includes the <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> states at electron filling factors ν=n/ 2 pn+ 1, their charged and neutral excitations, and also the quasidegenerate ground states at arbitrary filling factors of the form ν=ν^*/ 2 pν^*+ 1, where n and p are integers and ν^* is the CF filling factor. Comparison with exact results known for small systems for the ground and excited states at filling factors ν= 1 / 3, 2 / 5 and 3 / 7 demonstrates our LLL-projected wave functions to be extremely accurate representations of the actual Coulomb eigenstates. Our construction enables the study of large systems of composite fermions on the torus, thereby opening the possibility of investigating numerous interesting questions and phenomena.

40|$|Using an {{efficient}} cluster approach, we study {{the physics of}} two-dimensional lattice bosons in a strong magnetic field in the regime where the tunneling is much weaker than the on-site interaction strength. We study both dilute, hard core bosons at filling factors much smaller than unity occupation per site, and the physics {{in the vicinity of}} the superfluid-Mott lobes as the density is tuned away from unity. For hardcore bosons, we carry out extensive numerics for a fixed flux per plaquette ϕ= 1 / 5 and ϕ = 1 / 3. At large flux, the lowest energy state is a strongly correlated superfluid, analogous to He- 4, in which the order parameter is dramatically suppressed, but non-zero. At filling factors ν= 1 / 2, 1, we find competing incompressible states which are metastable. These appear to be commensurate density wave states. For small flux, the situation is reversed, and the ground state at ν = 1 / 2 is an incompressible density-wave solid. Here, we find a metastable lattice supersolid phase, where superfluidity and density-wave order coexist. We then perform careful numerical studies of the physics near the vicinity of the Mott lobes for ϕ = 1 / 2 and ϕ = 1 / 4. At ϕ = 1 / 2, the superfluid ground state has commensurate density-wave order. At ϕ = 1 / 4, incompressible phases appear outside the Mott lobes at densities n = 1. 125 and n = 1. 25, corresponding to filling fractions ν = 1 / 2 and 1 respectively. These phases, which are absent in single-site mean-field theory are metastable, and have slightly higher energy than the superfluid, but the energy difference between them shrinks rapidly with increasing cluster size, suggestive of an <b>incompressible</b> <b>ground</b> state. We thus explore the interplay between Mott physics, magnetic Landau levels, and superfluidity, finding a rich phase diagram of competing compressible and incompressible states.
