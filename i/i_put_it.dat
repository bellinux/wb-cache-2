Putting aside the Sarnoffs {{and all the other}} great names of broadcasting, Paley stood– stands– head and shoulders above everyone else. He had this blasting genius of instinctively looking at a show and knowing if it should be on the air. He could also be ruthless and distant ...

The same article also noted a humorous ode to black {{as a part of a}} wardrobe or in fact as a wardrobe, when one character notes: [...] "Sometimes I buy something that isn't black, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on and I am so sorry".|$|E

Soon afterwards I turned my attention to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision."

I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{original}} LP's third disc, entitled Apple Jam, {{four of the}} five tracks – [...] "Out of the Blue", [...] "Plug Me In", [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] – are improvised instrumentals built around minimal chord changes, {{or in the case of}} [...] "Out of the Blue", a single-chord riff. The title for [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] originated from the name of Clapton's dog, Jeep, and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album. In a December 2000 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison explained: [...] "For the jams, I didn't want to just throw [...] in the cupboard, and yet at the same time it wasn't part of the record; that's why <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus." ...|$|E
500|$|.....as I {{began to}} research, even I, {{as someone who}} had been paying {{attention}} {{to some of these}} sorts of things {{for a long time and}} was open to alternative explanations, even I was fairly astonished when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that that ever happened. In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at his trial: [...] "How shall <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> — certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me". Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to take away from the meeting. Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for [...] "minutes" [...] as the [...] "Wannsee Protocol") were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting. Most of these copies were destroyed {{at the end of the}} war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner, a U.S. prosecutor in the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.|$|E
500|$|Wainwright {{attended}} McGill University in Montreal for a {{short time}} to study Classical music composition. With his mother's support, he began writing pop songs and learned how to play guitar. Wainwright started performing at the night club Sarajevo, and eventually recorded a demo tape with record producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend, who had worked with Kate and Anna and who later produced Wainwright's second studio album Poses. Songs were recorded at Marchand's studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and no edits were made to the simple live tunes. The tape impressed Wainwright's father, who passed the songs along to producer Van Dyke Parks, who in turn presented them to DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. Waronker had signed McGarrigle to Warner Bros. Records in the 1970s. Describing his initial reaction to Wainwright's music, Waronker stated: [...] "When I was about to listen to his tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on and I said, 'Oh, my God, this is stunning. Wainwright acknowledged that having musicians as parents gave him a [...] "foot in the door", but attributed his success to hard work.|$|E

[...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E

Later, it was reported by Mars that the record {{was scheduled to be}} the second single from the album. This release involved little planning according to Mars [...] "I felt [...] was good. None of these things are planned, which one goes first, which one goes second. One day I wake up and I say, 'You know what? I want the world to hear this song that I wrote called 'Young Girls,' and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out". However, a week later, while performing [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] on the third season finale of The Voice, he announced that the track played would be the second official single from the album. The fifth and overall single, [...] "Young Girls", was first liberated on Australian contemporary hit radio, on November 26, 2013, after being promoted by Mars in radio station, Nova. Subsequently, the song was released to United States and United Kingdom contemporary hit radios on December 10, 2013 and February 17, 2014, respectively. Italian radio stations began adding the track onto their playlist on February 26, 2014. Later, on April 4, 2014 a CD single containing the track as released in Finland.|$|E
500|$|Creator Shonda Rhimes {{compared}} {{what she}} deemed the two [...] "most iconic {{moments of the}} season", describing how the season begins with Izzie lying in the prom dress on the bathroom, and ends with Cristina standing motionless in her wedding dress. Cast member Eric Dane described the impact his first scene in the season had on him, stating {{that it was a}} spectacular entrance: [...] "It was a brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. So every time <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." [...] Cast member Sara Ramirez noted {{that one of the most}} significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George [...] "have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks, but they say so much and it was just so rich", describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later. Betsy Beers, however, noted that the most [...] "powerful" [...] scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on-call room, talking about the future of their relationship: [...] "It's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange". Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey's passion of car racing in the series, although this ultimately did not occur during the season. [...] "Patrick loved it. He's always driving something new, always trying something out", stated the series creator, regarding Dempsey's response to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Against Boston College, {{running back}} Da'Rel Scott handled {{some of the}} kickoff return duties, but Smith {{returned}} two for 38yards. He also caught eight passes for 34yards and a touchdown. The following week, Maryland clinched bowl eligibility with a 62–14 rout of Wake Forest. Regarding the turnaround from the previous season's 2–10 record, Smith said, [...] "We {{expected to be in}} this position. No one else expected it," [...] but added [...] "No one is going to respect us [...] because we have not beaten any top dogs." [...] In the game, Smith had five catches for 66yards, including a 17-yard touchdown reception. Before the game against Miami, the coaching staff reported Smith's ankle had improved and he was [...] "as healthy as he has been in a while." [...] Against Miami, he had three receptions for 35yards. Smith also compiled 46yards on two kickoff returns to break the ACC career kickoff return yards record with 2,724 yards, which surpassed the previous mark of 2,688 yards held by Brandon Tate of North Carolina. At Virginia, Smith took advantage of the Cavaliers' man-to-man coverage and had seven receptions for 157yards, including a 12-yard touchdown. On a 62-yard catch, he said he was tackled on the seven-yard line only because he was exhausted. Quarterback Danny O'Brien expressed his readiness to throw deep passes to Smith in single coverage, [...] "If it's even, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] Maryland entered the game against 25th-ranked Florida State in contention for the ACC Atlantic Division championship. Smith recorded a phone message and video appealing to fans in a bid to improve home attendance, which had been lackluster throughout the season. The game was attended by 48,115 spectators, which surpassed the athletic department's projections. Maryland lost, 30–16, and Smith had seven receptions for 69yards.|$|E

500|$|Qs Mat Snow called Achtung Baby U2's [...] "heaviest {{album to}} date. And best." [...] Snow praised {{the band and}} its {{production}} team for making [...] "music of drama, depth, intensity and, believe it, funkiness". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt the record [...] "shows the band in a grittier light: disrupting, rather than fulfilling, expectations". He praised Lanois' production and said that due to the Edge's guitar playing, [...] "U2 sounds punkier than it has since its 1980 debut, Boy". Kot concluded his review by calling the album [...] "a magnificent search for transcendence {{made all the more}} moving for its flaws". Niall Stokes of Hot Press wrote, [...] "Ostensibly decadent, sensual and dark, it is a record of, and for, these times." [...] The New Zealand Herald found it [...] "pretty damn good" [...] and its sound [...] "subdued, tightly controlled, [...] introverted". However, it said that too many [...] "downbeat moments where songs seem to be going nowhere" [...] prevented it from being a [...] "truly wondrous affair". In Spin, Jim Greer was more critical of the album, calling it an [...] "ambitious failure"; the review welcomed its experimentation but judged that when the group [...] "strays from familiar territory, the results are hit-and-miss". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau rated it a dud, and in 1994, he reflected on this sentiment: [...] "After many, many tries, Achtung Baby still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the hall unable to describe a single song." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the band's musical transformation as [...] "thorough", [...] "effective", and [...] "endlessly inventive". Erlewine concluded that few artists at that stage in their career could have [...] "recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as U2 [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|This {{letter to}} Zweig was intercepted by the Gestapo {{and sent to}} Hitler. Strauss was {{subsequently}} dismissed from his post as Reichsmusikkammer president in 1935. The 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics nevertheless used Strauss's Olympische Hymne, which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Arturo Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, [...] "To Strauss the composer I take off my hat; to Strauss the man <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back on again", when Strauss had accepted {{the presidency of the}} Reichsmusikkammer. Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to concentration camps.|$|E
