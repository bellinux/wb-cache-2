The executive committee recommended that AWSA delegates vote for Anthony. At the NWSA meeting, Anthony strongly urged its members not to vote for her but for Stanton, saying that a defeat of Stanton would be viewed as a repudiation of her role in the movement.|$|E

500|$|On October 19, 1951, Josephine Baker made {{charges of}} racism against the Stork Club. [...] Baker visited the club on October 16 as {{the guest of}} Roger Rico and his wife; both entertainers were at the Stork after their theater performances. Baker said she ordered a steak and was {{apparently}} still waiting for it an hour later. [...] The controversy grew when Baker accused Walter Winchell {{of being in the}} Cub Room at the time and not coming to her aid. [...] Winchell was at the club; he said he had greeted Baker and vocalist Roger Rico as the two left their Cub Room table. Winchell said he was not aware of there being any problem, and left for a late screening of the film [...] The next morning, Winchell's rumored failure to assist Baker was big news, and he received countless telephone calls. The incident blew into a major scandal and was widely publicized on the radio and newspapers. Mrs. Rico, who was part of the Baker party with her <b>husband,</b> <b>said</b> that Baker's steak was waiting for her at the table after she returned from her phone call, but the entertainer chose to make a stormy exit from the Stork anyhow. News accounts show conflicting statements from the Ricos.|$|E

You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio.

2500|$|On February 15, {{during a}} closed-door hearing {{presided over by}} an Alabama judge, the charges were read to Bishop.

2500|$|Her first {{publication}} came with an obituary for Isaac Watts, published anonymously, in 1748. [...] In 1749, she wrote A Calvinistical Reflection for The Gentleman's Magazine. [...] It was a satire and critique of Calvinism in highly polished verse. [...] John Nichols later published two small poems written with great wit and polish, one being a pastiche of an Alexander Pope poem. [...] Despite these hints at Highmore's skill, she left {{nothing more to}} the public. [...] Her <b>husband</b> <b>said</b> {{that there were a}} great many poems that she wrote and left lying around, but he did not think to collect them nor she to publish them (her religious principles partly discouraging her from the pride of seeking attention).|$|E
2500|$|James Anderson, Bishop's <b>husband,</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} denial of her tenure had been [...] "an issue" [...] in recent months and he {{described}} the tenure process as [...] "a long, basically hard fight."

Bishop approached members of the University of Alabama System's board of trustees, and hired a lawyer who was [...] "finding one problem after another with the process." [...] One point of dispute was whether two of her papers had been published in time to count toward tenure; Bishop, who gave more emphasis to obtaining patents rather than publishing papers, reportedly received several warnings that she needed to publish more to receive tenure.|$|E

2500|$|Bryant {{became one}} of the first persons to be {{publicly}} [...] "pied" [...] as a political act (in her case, on television), in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1977.

While covered in pie, she began to pray to God to forgive the activist [...] "for his deviant lifestyle" [...] before bursting into tears as the cameras continued rolling. Bryant's <b>husband</b> <b>said</b> that he wouldn't retaliate, but followed the protesters outside and threw a pie at them. By this time, gay activists ensured that the boycott on Florida orange juice had become more prominent and it was supported by many celebrities, including Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Paul Williams, Dick Clark (Bryant had made several appearances on his shows, especially his namesake television show), John Waters, Carroll O'Connor, Linda Lavin, Mary Tyler Moore, Charles Schulz, Billie Jean King, and Jane Fonda. In response, David Allan Coe wrote the song [...] "Fuck Aneta Briant" [...] , which appears on his 1978 album, Nothing Sacred. In 1978, Bryant and Bob Green told the story of their campaign in the book At Any Cost. The gay community continued to regard Bryant's name as synonymous with bigotry and homophobia.|$|E

Two Russian journalists from Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Kommersant, who posed as family members, witnessed hysterical widows and mothers howling at Putin, demanding to know why they were receiving so much conflicting information and {{who was going to}} be punished for the deaths of their family members. During the meeting, Nadezhda Tylik, the mother of Kursk submariner Lt. Sergei Tylik, was extremely emotional and interrupted the meeting.

[...] When she would not be quiet, a nurse in civilian apparel behind her forcibly injected her through her clothing with a sedative.
