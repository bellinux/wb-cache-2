5|$|Critics {{argued that}} the {{confusing}} format of The Million Second Quiz, along with its lack of drama and technical issues with the show's app during the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, caused viewers to lose interest in watching it on air. Although peaking at 6.52 million viewers for its premiere, ratings steadily dropped during the show's run before rising again near the finale.|$|E

Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E

5|$|After her commissioning, Justice was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. In September 1909, she traveled to the United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she {{was assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, and spent the rest based at Corfu and Mudros without seeing any action. After the war ended, she participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet's withdrawal. Justice was sold for scrapping in 1922.|$|E
5|$|France {{maintained}} {{close ties}} with President Habyarimana during his years in power, {{as part of its}} Françafrique policy. When the RPF launched the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, Habyarimana was immediately granted assistance from the President of France, François Mitterrand. France sent 600 paratroopers, who effectively ran the government's response to the invasion and were instrumental in regaining almost all territory the RPF had gained in the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. France maintained this military presence throughout the war, engaging Kagame's RPF forces again in February 1993 during the offensive that doubled RPF territory. In the later stages of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, France launched Opération Turquoise, a United Nations mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for protection of displaced persons, refugees, and civilians in danger; many Rwandans interpreted it as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF, and their presence temporarily stalled Kagame's advance in south western Rwanda.|$|E
5|$|The Arab army {{marched in}} three {{separate}} corps, with Ashinas {{once again in}} front, the caliph in the middle, and Afshin bringing up the rear. Looting the countryside as they advanced, they arrived before Amorium seven days after their departure from Ancyra, and began their siege of the city on 1 August. Theophilos, anxious to prevent the city's fall, left Constantinople for Dorylaion, and from there sent an embassy to Mu'tasim. His envoys, who arrived shortly before or during the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siege, offered assurances that the atrocities at Sozopetra had been against the emperor's orders, and further promised to help rebuild the city, to return all Muslim prisoners, and to pay a tribute. The caliph, however, not only refused to parley with the envoys, but detained them in his camp, {{so that they could}} observe the siege.|$|E

Dutton led 3 Commando, as well as supporting units from the Royal Engineers, 7 Armoured Division, 16 Air Assault Brigade along with troops from multiple other nations, including US Marines, the first time American troops had been under the operational command of a British officer since the Second World War. Royal Marines from 40 Commando under Dutton's overall command, along with United States Navy SEALs, secured oil fields on the Al-Faw Peninsula to prevent them from being burned in the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground operation, after which 40 Commando and others from 3 Commando Brigade moved up the peninsula and took the port city of Umm Qasr, where they encountered resistance into the fifth day of the ground campaign.|$|E
5|$|After Fritz Kater and Max Winkler reaffirmed syndicalist antimilitarism in the August 5, 1914 Der Pionier edition, the {{newspaper}} was banned. Three days later, Die Einigkeit criticized the SPD's {{stance on the}} war. It was then suppressed as well. The FVdG promptly responded by founding the weekly Mitteilungsblatt. After it was banned in June 1915, the federation founded the bi-weekly Rundschreiben, which survived until May 1917. Social Democratic publications {{on the other hand}} were allowed by Prussian War Minister Erich von Falkenhayn to be distributed even in the army. In the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, about 30 FVdG activists in Cologne, Elberfeld, Düsseldorf, Krefeld and other cities were arrested—some remaining under house arrest for two years. The government repression against the FVdG was heavy. While bans were often placed on the union's regular meetings, authorities in Düsseldorf even banned meetings of the syndicalist choir. Another problem for the union was that many of its members were conscripted. Half of the Berlin construction workers, the federation's largest union, were forced to serve in the army. In some places, all FVdG members were called into service.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shutdown, many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social service organizations that relied on state funding. To hear their pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz {{as a special}} master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey County District Court when the shutdown began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should {{have been responsible for}} making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the shutdown, and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation, the 697th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division, {{supported}} by NDH units, thrust {{out of their}} bridgehead over the Drina at Zvornik and cleared the high ground southwest and south of that town, and south along the Drina valley road, hindered by roadblocks and destroyed bridges. It then followed up the retreating insurgents, mopping up the Drinjača valley, before pushing southwest through the mountains and reaching Vlasenica on 18 January. Parts of the 698th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division fought southwest from Višegrad along the upper Drina valley to Međeđa, while other elements pushed west towards Rogatica, followed by an Italian Alpini battalion. The 699th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division advanced along the Drina valley past the confluence with the Drinjača to the area west of Ljubovija, clearing roadblocks as they went. In the area of Milići, they captured about 400 insurgents, mostly Chetniks loyal to Jezdimir Dangić, along with a tank, two machine guns, about 160 rifles and {{a large amount of}} ammunition. The regiment then mopped up the area west to Vlasenica and one battalion cleared the route to Srebrenica.|$|E
5|$|On 15 and 16 May, another {{attempted}} Soviet {{offensive in}} the north met the same resistance encountered on the three <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle. German bastions continued to hold out against Soviet assaults. The major contribution to Soviet frustration in the battle {{was the lack of}} heavy artillery, which ultimately prevented the taking of heavily defended positions. One of the best examples of this was the defense of Ternovaya, where defending German units absolutely refused to surrender. The fighting was so harsh that, after advancing an average of five kilometers, the offensive stopped for the day {{in the north}}. The next day saw a renewal of the Soviet attack, which was largely blocked by counterattacks by German tanks; the tired Soviet divisions could simply not hold their own against the concerted attacks from the opposition. The south, however, achieved success, much like the earlier days of the battle, although Soviet forces began to face heavier air strikes from German aircraft. The Germans, on the other hand, had spent the day fighting holding actions in both sectors, launching small counterattacks to whittle away at Soviet offensive potential, while continuously moving up reinforcements from the south, including several aircraft squadrons transferred from the Crimea. Poor decisions by the 150th Rifle Division, which had successfully crossed the Barvenkovo River, played a major part in the poor exploitation of the tactical successes of the southern shock group.|$|E
5|$|The 38th (Welsh) Division (initially the 43rd Division, {{later the}} 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division {{and then the}} 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division) of the British Army was active during both the First and Second World Wars. In 1914, the {{division}} was raised as the 43rd Division of Herbert Kitchener's New Army, and was originally intended to form part of a 50,000-strong Welsh Army Corps that had been championed by David Lloyd George; the assignment of Welsh recruits to other formations meant that this concept was never realised. The 43rd was renamed the 38th (Welsh) Division on 29 April 1915, and shipped to France later that year. It arrived in France with a poor reputation, seen as a political formation that was ill-trained and poorly led. The division's baptism by fire came in the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Somme, where it captured the strongly held Mametz Wood {{at the loss of}} nearly 4,000 men. This strongly held German position needed to be secured in order to facilitate the next phase of the Somme offensive; the Battle of Bazentin Ridge. Despite securing its objective, the division's reputation was adversely affected by miscommunication among senior officers.|$|E
