By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> certain Sahralanyozan was appointed as its governor. In 622, Heraclius counter-attacked against the Sasanian Empire in Anatolia. Shahrbaraz was sent over there to deal with him, but was eventually defeated by him.|$|E
5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> massive {{head that}} had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It {{may have been}} {{at the top of the}} food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|With {{support of}} the Kiev city authorities, architect-restorer Y. Lositskiy and others {{restored}} {{the western part of}} the stone walls. The belltower was restored next and became an observation platform. Instead of the original chiming clock, a new electronic one with <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> set of chimes (a total of 40) was installed from which today the melodies of famous Ukrainian composers can be heard. The Cathedral was reconstructed last and decorated with a set of wooden baroque icons, copies of former mosaics and frescoes, and new works of art by Ukrainian artists.|$|E

5|$|This bipedal ornithopod {{is known}} from several partial skeletons and skulls that {{indicate}} it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0meters (8.2 to 13.1ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> head with an elongate pointed snout. The {{form of the}} teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal. This genus of dinosaur {{is regarded as a}} specialized basal ornithopod, traditionally described as a hypsilophodont, but more recently recognized as distinct from Hypsilophodon. Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three currently are recognized as valid: the type species T. neglectus, T. garbanii and T. assiniboiensis.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

25|$|Thescelosaurus was a bipedal dinosaur with {{a sturdy}} build, small wide <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long pointed snout from the Late Cretaceous Period, {{approximately}} 66 million years ago. As a herbivore, Thescelosaurus {{was not a}} tall dinosaur and probably browsed the ground selectively to find food. Its leg structure and proportionally heavy build suggests {{that it was not}} a fast runner like other dinosaurs. The first fossils of Thescelosaurus were co-discovered in 1891 by John Bell Hatcher and William H. Utterback, in Wyoming. However, this discovery remained stored until Charles W. Gilmore named the dinosaur in 1913.|$|E

25|$|In November, Napoleon {{directed}} {{the bulk of}} the Grande Armée across the Pyrenees and dealt a series of devastating blows to the vacillating Spanish forces, receiving the surrender of Madrid in scarcely a month's time. Fate was particularly cruel to the victors of Bailén: Castaños was himself routed by Marshal Lannes at the Battle of Tudela in November 1808, while Reding was ridden down and trampled by the French cavalry at the Battle of Valls in 1809, dying of his wounds. Marshal Soult overran much of Andalusia the following year and on January 21, 1810, his men recovered the lost Eagles from the cathedral of Bailén. Before long, only Cádiz remained firmly in Spanish <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> difficult war lay ahead to drive the invader from Spain.|$|E
25|$|Defences for {{the forearm}} are {{mentioned}} in earlier treatises, {{under the name}} cheiropsella or manikellia, but are not very evident in pictorial representations of the Komnenian period. Most images show knee-high boots (krepides, hypodemata) as the only form of defence for the lower leg though a few images of military saints show tubular greaves (with no detailing indicative of a composite construction). These would presumably be termed podopsella or chalkotouba. Greaves of a splint construction also occur, very sporadically, in illustrated manuscripts and church murals. A single illustration, in the Psalter of Theodore of Caesarea dating to 1066, shows mail chausses being worn (with boots) by a Byzantine soldier. Mail defences for the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> type of metal sabaton for the foot are mentioned in Byzantine military writings of the late 10th century, but are not described or illustrated in the Komnenian era.|$|E

25|$|Minifigures {{built from}} special, uniquely molded pieces were first {{introduced}} in Life on Mars. Martians {{are composed of}} five tools: two pairs of double arms, a mechanical torso, a conjoined leg piece, and a head. This configuration is also used for many Star Wars Droids; Battle Droids follow the same pattern, while Super Battle Droids feature a head fixed to a torso, General Grievous has space for four arms, and IG-88 has a head constructed of other Lego pieces. Other droids, such as Droidekas, Spider Droids and Pit Droids, are constructed entirely from standard Lego pieces, yet are still generally considered minifigures. R2-D2 and other astromech droids are constructed from unique parts, with a separate top, body and legs. The robots of Exo-Force, Mars Mission commander aliens and Bionicle miniatures have a design similar to the Star Wars Battle Droids, but with separate legs, movable <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> head affixed to a small torso.|$|E
25|$|Bose's {{view was}} not {{necessarily}} shared by {{the men of the}} Free India Legion, and they were not wholly party to Nazi ideology or in collaboration with the Nazi machinery. The Legion's volunteers were not merely motivated by the chance to escape imprisonment and earn money. Indeed, when the first POWs were brought to Annaburg and met with Subhas Chandra Bose, there was marked and open hostility towards him as a Nazi propaganda puppet. Once Bose's efforts and views had gained more sympathy, a persistent query among the POWs was 'How would the legionary stand in relation to the German soldier?'. The Indians were not prepared to simply fight for Germany's interests, after abandoning their oath to the King-Emperor. The Free India Centre—in charge of the legion after the departure of Bose—faced a number of grievances from legionaries. The foremost were that Bose had abandoned them left them entirely in German <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> perception that the Wehrmacht was now going to use them in the Western Front instead of sending them to fight for independence.|$|E
