5000|$|Ephesians {{is notable}} for its {{domestic}} code treatment in , covering husband-wife, parent-child, and master-slave relationships. In , wives {{are urged to}} submit <b>to</b> their <b>husbands,</b> and <b>husbands</b> <b>to</b> love their wives [...] "as Christ loved the Church." [...] Christian Egalitarian theologians, such as Katharine Bushnell and Jessie Penn-Lewis, interpret these commands {{in the context of}} the preceding verse, [...] for all Christians to [...] "submit to one another." [...] Thus, it is two-way, mutual submission of both <b>husbands</b> <b>to</b> wives and wives <b>to</b> <b>husbands.</b> But according <b>to</b> Peter O'Brien, Professor Emeritus at Moore Theological College, this would be the only instance of this meaning of submission in the whole New Testament, indeed in any extant comparable Greek texts; by O'Brien's account, the word simply does not connote mutuality. Dallas Theological Seminary professor Daniel Wallace understands it to be an extension of [...] on being filled by the Holy Spirit.|$|R
