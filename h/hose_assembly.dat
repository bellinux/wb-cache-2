40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of robotics in a new field for applying surface treatments in building voids {{and the development of}} the architecture of the robotic vehicle for use in this application. The nature of the application means that the robotic vehicle must be capable of accessing voids through small openings and this has led to a deployable architecture for the vehicle which can be fed through an opening and then reconfigures its form to enable practical operation. A typical application for the robot is to apply thermal insulation to the underside of wooden or concrete floors in buildings.

40|$|Supplier Oy (names {{will be kept}} confidential) is a Finnish {{joint venture}} {{established}} recently {{in the area of}} hydraulic <b>hose</b> <b>assembly</b> manufacturing for big Finnish OEMs. The company is considered to revolutionize the traditional methods of hydraulic <b>hose</b> <b>assembly</b> manufacturing by a majority of the industry experts. With the usage of extensive IT software and software driven machinery, it has now become the most effective hydraulic <b>hose</b> <b>assembly</b> manufacturing company, not only in Europe but in the whole world. The idea was developed by a small team of people that combined creativity and experience. However, precise designing of every detail took a considerable amount of time. It is now believed that each detail that was considered during the design process, contributed to the implementation phase in a big portion. Author himself not only witnessed the design process, but also contributed to it in a deeper extent. Some tasks such as 3 D design of the cells as well as whole factory layout and optimization of flows were led by the author primarily. After the design process was finalized, ramp-up phase started. Planning things on paper was one aspect, but actually building the whole factory from the scratch was a challenging task. After the ramp-up was completed successfully, development phase began. It was then necessary to make the small improvements in various areas, to improve processes and products, providing high level of customer satisfaction without sacrificing from the initial effectiveness of the whole idea. In winter of 2012, this thesis was initiated with the aim of analyzing cost effectiveness of the case company. However soon after the initiation, the topic shifted to the area of supplying the customer not only products, but also own performance measurements. The reason for this shift was a recent turn of events during that time. Customer and the case company found a mismatch in their metrics. It was realized that on-time-delivery ratio was drastically different according to two sides. Since both supplier and customer were in collaborative manner, they decided to investigate this mismatch and tried to solve {{it in a way that}} would be beneficial for both parties. After the investigation, some reasons for this mismatch were understood. Interestingly, supplier’s metrics were yielding more accurate results than the metrics of customer. This raised the question from customer side whether they should use the supplier’s metrics and hence the topic of the thesis shifted towards this more recent topic. The concept of supplying metrics as well as products is found out to be a rather novel area in the literature. The literature review resulted in only few small sentences of such concept in different articles. Therefore, it became more interesting to research this topic and write the thesis in a way that also case company and its customer can benefit from it to a greater extent. The framework was built based on multiple smaller frameworks. Eventually, it combined three dimensions: (1) Lean manufacturing, (2) Customer-supplier relationships, (3) Performance measurement systems. It was revealed that supplying metrics was not a far away concept in lean partnerships considering the previous attempts already done under the concept of open book accounting (OBA). In other words, companies which were collaborative partners were already familiar to the sharing of internal information with each other. Only difference this time was the information was based on non-financial data whereas in OBA it was financial data only. The findings of the thesis includes that sharing of vital information requires a certain level of trust and collaborative manner between parties. Lean manufacturing is proven to be an important driver in this trend of moving towards collaboration and close customer-supplier relationships. Based on the framework and logical deduction, shared metrics are in fact aligned with the complete philosophy of lean manufacturing. Since excessive performance measurement can also be considered as a waste (muda) in lean philosophy, sharing performance measures can easily yield to a reduction of total number of metrics between parties. Thus, both sides can benefit from this information sharing activity. Also, in case of a mismatch it is expected for collaborative parties to move towards troubleshooting to resolve any conflicts, which results in a more accurate performance measuring from the holistic viewpoint of the relationship. Finally, it is forecasted that sharing metrics can also initiate an improvement in other areas such as customer satisfaction or higher visibility of production...|$|E

The original aqueous IATCS coolant used in Node 1, the Laboratory Module, and the Airlock consisted of water, borate (pH buffer), phosphate (corrosion control), and silver sulfate (microbiological control) at a pH of 9. 5 +/- 0. 5. Chemical changes occurred after on-orbit implementation including a decrease to pH 8. 4 due to the diffusion of carbon dioxide through the Teflon hoses, an increase in nickel ions due to general corrosion of heat exchanger braze coatings, a decrease in phosphate concentration due to precipitation of nickel phosphate, and the rapid disappearance of silver ions due to deposition on hardware surfaces. Also associated with the coolant chemistry changes {{was an increase in}} planktonic microorganisms from less than 100 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml to approximately 1 million CFU per 100 ml.

40|$|One {{of the key}} success {{factors in}} today’s global and highly {{competitive}} markets is to develop new products. On the other hand, new product developments have exponentially increasing as the development project proceeds. Thus, more and more the need for evaluating ideas inexpensively and rapidly is rising. The problem with current prototyping methods is that they come late in the development stages. This problem becomes more important in lean companies which have strong relationships with their strategic allies. The current development tools and methods suggested from scholars for development of physical products do not offer flexibility and iterative development. However, this approach limits developers from testing and comparing several ideas. The objective of this report is firstly to challenge the common categorization and application of prototypes by introducing mid-fidelity prototypes to merge the two main product development models, agile and stage wise, and secondly to demonstrate {{the impact of these}} prototypes on cost estimations and how the information generated from studying them helps to facilitate open book accounting. Mid-fidelity prototypes can reduce costs of development projects by testing functionality of ideas cheaply. They are also an effective communication tool internally and also with supply network firms. The purpose of this approach is to complement the current existing literature on product development models and prototyping. To provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} implications of what such a model could offer, it was implemented and analyzed in a case of developing cleanliness of hydraulic hose assemblies. The project was done with a hydraulic <b>hose</b> <b>assembly</b> manufacturer in Finland. This research shows that first, fully functional mock-ups are effective communication tools among the development team and externally with customers or suppliers. Second, they provide hands on experience of the product for the project stakeholders. Third, they can be used to estimate associated cost impacts of the product. Fourth, the generated data could be used as factual information to be shared with strategic allies and facilitating open book accounting.

40|$|The present master’s thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} new test rig for the {{investigation}} of durability and failure mechanisms of flexible pipe connections – so called Rotation and Expansion Performing Assemblies (REPAs) –, which are utilized in Parabolic Trough Collector power plants. Said assemblies compensate for the motion of the absorber tubes relative to the fixed piping of the header connection. The work focusses on the test rig’s design in view of a realistic simulation of all loads a REPA is exposed to in commercial applications. To achieve this, all possible requirements of the components, which are supposed to endure a lifetime of up to 30 years in power plants, are depicted. A literature research is carried out in order to investigate and evaluate existing test rigs for REPAs or their single components. By means of the findings, a specification sheet is derived. The test rig is composed of two main assemblies. On the one hand, a Kinematics Unit is used to reproduce the cyclic rotational and translational motions of a Parabolic Trough Collector. On the other hand, an HTF cycle (Heat Transfer Fluid cycle) conduces to set up pressure, temperature and flow rate circulating through the test specimens. The main part of the thesis contributes to the integration of the externally designed Kinematics Unit into the HTF cycle – taking into consideration realistic operation conditions and a complete and precise measurement of all parameters. Special emphasis is put on an accurate acquisition of the mechanical loads the test objects have to cope with. As a result of this work, a test rig is erected enabling realistic endurance tests of two serially connected REPAs in less than three months. The hydraulic properties are adjustable in terms of mass flow (6 − 60 m 3 /h), pressure (up to 40 bars) and temperature (up to 450 °C).

The SAE fuel system committee, SAE G- 3 A (Aerospace Couplings, Fittings, <b>Hose</b> & Tubing <b>Assemblies)</b> has drafted a proposed environmental test standard [i] for fuel tube couplers that includes conduction of typical lightning currents through fuel tube couplings to verify that no arcing occurs that could ignite flammable fuel vapors. This paper describes a plan of exploratory tests to determine the conditions under which flames will and will not propagate to the ends of pipes attached to coupling specimens of various sizes. An initial series of tests will be conducted by igniting a hydrogen gas mixture with a small spark at the interior of tube specimens of various diameters to determine the conditions that let the flame appear at the open end of the pipe. A second group of tests will be conducted on couplings attached to short tube ends and arranged to produce an arc that is exposed to the interior of the coupling when typical currents are conducted through the coupling. Such an arc would have a higher energy dissipation than the 0. 2 mJ spark often used to verify ignition sensitivity of flammable gasses, but most electrical arcs that might occur at fuel tube couplings would be significantly hotter, and more incendiary, than the standard 0. 2 mJ spark. Several test laboratories are expected to conduct the same tests on identical couplings. If these “round robin ” results are consistent, the results will be used to finalize the fuel tube coupling lightning test standard...|$|R
