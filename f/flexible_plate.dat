They are used to detect changes in acceleration, in tilt sensors, or to detect free fall, as sensors triggering airbag deployment, and in many other applications. Some fingerprint sensors use capacitors. Additionally, a user can adjust the pitch of a theremin musical instrument by moving their hand since this changes the effective capacitance between the user's hand and the antenna.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>plate</b> {{is used in}} {{electric}} motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in <b>flexible</b> <b>plate</b> was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThrough an {{extensive}} and systematic experimental investigation of two geometries of <b>flexible</b> <b>plates</b> in air, it is {{shown that a}} properly defined scaled Cauchy number allows collapsing all drag measurements of the reconfiguration number. In the asymptotic regime of large deformation, it is shown that the Vogel exponents that scale the drag with the flow velocity for different geometries of plates can be predicted with a simple dimensional analysis reasoning. These predicted Vogel exponents are in agreement with previously published models of reconfiguration. The mechanisms responsible for reconfiguration, namely area reduction and streamlining, are studied {{with the help of}} a simple model for <b>flexible</b> <b>plates</b> based on an empirical drag formulation. The model predicts well the reconfiguration observed in the experiments and shows that for a rectangular plate, the effect of streamlining is prominent at the onset of reconfiguration, but area reduction dominates in the regime of large deformation. Additionally, the model demonstrates for both geometries of plates that the reconfiguration cannot be described by a single value of the Vogel exponent. The Vogel exponent asymptotically approaches constant values for small and for very large scaled Cauchy numbers, but in between both extremes it varies significantly over a large range of scaled Cauchy number.
