5|$|Stevens, Bilson and De Meo {{began to}} {{consider}} making The Rocketeer as a low-budget film, shot in black-and-white {{and funded by}} independent investors. Their plan {{was to make the}} film a complete homage to the Commando Cody serial films, and use a cast largely associated with character actors. However, that same year, the trio approached William Dear to direct/co-write The Rocketeer, and they eventually dropped the low-budget idea. Bilson, De Meo, and Dear kept the comic book's basic plot intact, but fleshed it out to include a Hollywood setting and a climactic battle against a Nazi Zeppelin. They also tweaked Cliff's girlfriend to avoid comparisons to Bettie Page (Stevens' original inspiration), changing her name from Betty to <b>Jenny</b> <b>and</b> her profession from nude model to Hollywood extra (a change also made to make the film more family friendly). Dear proceeded to transform the climax from a submarine into a Zeppelin setpiece.|$|E

40|$|In long-day breeders like horses, {{the length}} of nocturnal {{melatonin}} secretion is the main messenger of photoperiod. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the nocturnal jugular melatonin concentration is lower in horses, than in mules but is unknown in donkeys. The aim of this study was to estimate the inter-animal variability of plasma melatonin concentration in domestic mares and to compare this concentration with those observed in domestic <b>jennies</b> <b>and</b> in their hybrid mules. In the autumn, blood samples were collected at 22 h, 23 h, 0 h and 1 h during 2 nights at 3 weeks intervals, in 110 pony mares, 10 <b>jennies</b> <b>and</b> 6 mules maintained under natural photoperiod. Melatonin was assayed by a validated RIAmethod. The statistical analysis of themeasures was done with a specific unbalanced analysis of variance model. The effect of species and individuals (nested under species) was highly significant. The mean melatonin concentration was 24 pg. mL− 1 in mares and was significantly lower than in <b>jennies</b> <b>and</b> in mules which were 90 pg. mL− 1 and 169 pg. mL− 1 respectively. The melatonin plasma concentration was higher in jennies than in mares. These results suggest that the melatonin concentration is genetically determined...|$|R
