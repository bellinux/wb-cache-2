50|$|In 1957, Edward’s son, Ted {{also started}} {{working at the}} Company. The {{following}} years, sales representatives were hired and the products line was significantly expanded through a distribution arrangement with Letraset, a manufacturer of <b>dry</b> <b>transfer,</b> rub on <b>lettering</b> and lettering tapes.|$|R
40|$|The {{locus of}} this project is {{in the field of}} type face design, with the origins of the project based on an {{appreciation}} of the Letraset brand 1 <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> system (instant <b>lettering</b> and other elements included in the system) and the way they were used and/or mis-used. The project investigates the autographic ‘craft’ nature of the use of Letraset, the fact that if used carelessly it could create accidental applications and that these accidental applications could lead to serendipitous effects. The project explains how reflection on these effects led in turn to some users of Letraset devising their own unconventional techniques for its use and it proposes {{that it is possible to}} replicate some of these effects and to use them as the inspiration for new type face concepts. It further proposes that it is possible to use Letraset elements (rules, dots and squares for example) in ways other than originally intended as the raw material of the basic structure of new type face designs. The methodology used in the project combines narrative inquiry, self inquiry and the generation of ideas through creative reflection and the use of ‘tacit knowledge’...|$|R
50|$|Flat art {{was created}} by {{using a variety of}} {{standard}} graphic illustration techniques, using pen and ink, airbrush, paints, from clip art, colored paper, <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> such as Letraset, and by copying from existing materials on a copy stand or on optical slide camera. Cel art, such as found in cel animation, was also used.|$|R
50|$|MacPublisher {{was sold}} in 1986 to Esselte Letraset, whose {{business}} in press-down <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> was evaporating with competition from laser printers, notably Apple's pioneering LaserWriter printer. It was briefly sold as LetraPage, but dropped from the market when Letraset subsequently acquired Ready,Set,Go! from Manhattan Graphics.|$|E
50|$|Twentieth century {{developments}} {{include the}} parallel motion drawing board, and more complicated improvements {{on the basic}} T-square. The development of reliable technical drawing pens allowed for faster draughting and stencilled lettering. Letraset <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> and half-tone sheets were popular from the 1970s until computers made those processes obsolete.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, Letraset {{decided to}} start selling its own line of {{transparent}} tools. In response thereto, C-Thru acquired a small manufacturer of <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> products and started offering its own line of vinyl lettering. One year later, Ted Zachs bought out the other family members and became the sole shareholder of C-Thru.|$|E
50|$|Aftermarket {{markings}} {{are also}} available. Firms such as Archer <b>Dry</b> <b>Transfers</b> or Decalomaniacs produce stand-alone sheets of wet or <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> markings {{to allow the}} modeler to complete a different or more accurate variant.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether a commercial <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> system (DTS) could be used for loading or unloading used nuclear fuel (UNF) in L-Basin and to determine if a DTS pool adapter could be made for L-Basin Transfer Pit # 2 that could accommodate a variety of DTS casks and fuel baskets or canisters up to 24 ” diameter. [1, 2] This study outlines the technical feasibility of accommodating different vendor <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> systems in the L-Basin Transfer Bay with a general work scope. It identifies equipment needing development, facility modifications, and describes the needed analyses and calculations. After reviewing the L-Basin Transfer Bay area layout and information on the only DTS system currently in use for the Nuclear Assurance Corporation Legal Weight Truck cask (NAC LWT), the authors conclude that use of a <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> cask is feasible. AREVA was contacted and acknowledged that they currently do not have a design for a <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> cask for their new Transnuclear Long Cask (TN-LC) cask. Nonetheless, this study accounted for a potential future DTS from AREVA to handle fuel baskets up to 18 ” in diameter. Due to the layout of the Transfer Bay, it was determined that a DTS cask pool adapter designed specifically for spanning Pit # 2 and placed just north of the 70 Ton Cask lid lifting superstructure would be needed. The proposed pool adapter could be used to transition a fuel basket up to 24 ” in diameter and ~ 11 feet long from a <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> cask to the basin. The 18 ” and 24 ” applications of the pool adapter are pending vendor development of <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> casks that accommodate these diameters. Once a fuel basket has been lowered into Pit # 2 through a pool adapter, a basket cart could be used to move the basket out from under the pool adapter for access by the 5 Ton Crane. The cost to install a <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> cask handling system in L-Area capable of handling multiple vendor provided transport and <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> casks and baskets with different diameters and lengths would likely be on the same order of magnitude as the Basin Modifications project. The cost of a DTS capability is affected by the number of design variations of different vendor transport and <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> casks to be considered for design input. Some costs would be incurred for each vendor DTS to be handled. For example, separate analyses would be needed for each <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> cask type such as criticality, shielding, dropping a <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> cask and basket, handling and auxiliary equipment, procedures, operator training, readiness assessments, and operational readiness reviews. A DTS handling capability in L-Area could serve as a backup to the Shielded Transfer System (STS) for unloading long casks and could support potential future missions such as the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Exchange or transferring UNF from wet to dry storage...|$|R

50|$|The name is {{also often}} used to refer generically to sheets of <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> of any brand. This {{technique}} was very widespread for lettering and other elements {{before the advent of}} the phototypesetting and laser computer techniques of word processing and desktop publishing. Currently, Letraset's line of print patterns and textures are more commonly used than its lettering.|$|E
5000|$|Dry {{transfers}} {{are used}} in manual technical drawing when standard graphic elements such as title blocks, forms, patterned lines, shading, piping or electronic schematic symbols need to be repetitively used. Use of a dry transfer reduces drawing time and standardizes appearance. [...] <b>Dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> such as Letraset brand is used where hand-drawn lettering is laborious to apply.|$|E
50|$|Dry {{transfer}} decals can {{speed the}} production of repetitive drawing elements such as borders, title blocks, line types, shading, and symbols. They were frequently used in {{the production of}} schematic drawings, maps, and printed circuit board artwork, for example. <b>Dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> such as Letraset was used especially in lettering larger size document annotations, or when consistency of lettering was especially required.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{need for}} a <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> system (DTS) to enable retrieval of used nuclear fuel (UNF) for inspection or repackaging will increase as the duration and quantity of fuel in dry storage increases. This report explores the uses for a DTS, identifies associated general functional requirements, and reviews existing and proposed systems that currently perform <b>dry</b> fuel <b>transfers.</b> The focus {{of this paper is}} on the {{need for a}} DTS to enable transfer of bare fuel assemblies. <b>Dry</b> <b>transfer</b> systems for UNF canisters are currently available and in use for transferring loaded canisters between the drying station and storage and transportation casks...|$|R
50|$|In common usage, {{the name}} Letraset {{originally}} referred to sheets of <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> which was originally manufactured as a wet process in 1959, with each character selected and {{cut from a}} sheet, placed face-down on a small silk screen frame and wetted with a paint brush to soften and release the gum arabic adhesive which held it. The frame was then turned over and the letter located over the artwork, and the character pressed {{into contact with the}} page, with the mounting base slid away as with model aircraft transfers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>Transfer,</b> the Spring 2010 {{quarterly}} release, had a print run of 5,000 packs. The edition {{featured a}} cover noticeably lacking the [...] "FIELD NOTES" [...] logo. Each pack {{came with a}} set of three books, and a <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> decal sheet, allowing the customer to create their own cover logo or design. Other than the lack of a logo, the books were identical to the standard kraft brown memo books the company started with making.|$|R

Users of [...] "Grot No. 9" [...] include Wyndham Lewis's 1914 avant-garde magazine Blast and more recently Newsweek (which commissioned a custom variant) and Q magazine. It reached Letraset <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering</b> and, unlike many of the other Stephenson Blake Grotesques, has been digitised.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 {{the company}} was {{acquired}} by Esselte Letraset, who had taken over Letraset, originally makers of the first <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>lettering,</b> and later to become developers of new typefaces for filmsetting and computer applications. In 2000, Agfa Monotype Corporation announced the acquisition of the capital stock of International Typeface Corporation (ITC) from Esselte. The transaction included ITC’s complete library of over 1600 typefaces, all typeface subscriber and distributor agreements, the itcfonts.com Web site, and typographic software. At this point ITC ceased to operate as an independent entity.|$|E

40|$|Recently, a contamination-free <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> {{method for}} {{graphene}} grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) {{has been reported that}} allows to directly pick-up graphene from the copper growth substrate using a flake of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), resulting in ultrahigh charge carrier mobility and low overall doping. Here, we report that not only hBN, but also flakes of molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_ 2 $) can be used to <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> graphene. This, on one hand, allows for the fabrication of complex van-der-Waals heterostructures using CVD graphene combined with different two-dimensional materials and, on the other hand, can be a route towards a scalable <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> of CVD graphene. The resulting heterostructures are studied using low temperature transport measurements revealing a strong charge carrier density dependence of the carrier mobilities (up to values of 12, 000 cm$^ 2 $/(Vs)) and the residual charge carrier density fluctuations near the charge neutrality point when changing the carrier density in the MoS$_ 2 $ by applying a top gate voltage.

50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>transfers</b> (also called rub-ons or rubdowns) are decals {{that can}} be applied without the use of water or other solvent. The decal itself is on a backing {{material}} such as paper or plastic sheeting much like a transparency. The <b>dry</b> <b>transfer</b> is placed in the desired location with the backing side up. The decal is then applied by burnishing the backing with a stylus or similar object such as a ballpoint pen. The contact side of the decal includes a pressure-sensitive adhesive; the combination of heat and pressure causes the decal to stick more strongly to the new surface than to the backing. When the backing is removed, the decal remains. This allows for ink only where needed even if the pattern is delicate, because the backing supports the decal while it is being applied.|$|R
