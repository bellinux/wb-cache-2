5|$|Sarvapitri amavasya (all ancestors' {{new moon}} day) is {{intended}} for all ancestors, irrespective of the lunar day they died. It {{is the most important}} day of the Pitru Paksha. Those who <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> to perform shraddha can do so on this day. A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as fruitful as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya, which is seen as a special place to perform the rite, and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period.|$|E

Tracy Jordan frustrates her further by deciding to break character during the show's live broadcast in {{an homage to}} The Carol Burnett Show. TGS co-star Jenna Maroney is determined to not let Tracy upstage her and declares she will have a deliberate wardrobe malfunction and bare her breast on live television if Tracy does not stop. As the show goes awry due to Tracy and Jenna's unprofessionalism, Liz is forced to cut away from their regularly scheduled programming to commercials for Dr. Leo Spaceman's new album of erotic ballads to cure erectile dysfunction and Drew Baird's public service announcement for hand-transplant surgery.|$|E

A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
5|$|Back in Zone Three, Al•Ith {{finds that}} her people <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> her, and her sister, Murti• {{has taken over}} as queen.

Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people {{that it is not}} her time yet. At the frontier of Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone.

He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|Eeyore's Birthday Party {{began in}} 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English {{students}} at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell, Jr. and other UT students. It was named for Eeyore, a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories who, in one story, believes his friends <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> his birthday only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him. Despite its name, the event does not fall on the official birthday of the fictional character. The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade, beer, honey sandwiches, a live, flower-draped donkey, and a may pole (in keeping with the event's proximity to May Day). For many years the party was a UT tradition, but subsequently the annual Birthday Party became a tradition in Austin's hippie subculture.|$|E

5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

25|$|A theme well {{covered in}} the novel is that of {{cultures}} suffering technological breakdowns who then proceed to revert to belief systems along religious lines.

25|$|During Libby's trial, the {{prosecution}} focused the jury on {{a sequence of}} events occurring between May and July 2003.

25|$|Rabbinic Judaism {{was based}} on {{vigorous}} and often contentious debate {{over the meaning of}} the Torah and other sacred texts. One challenge facing the rabbis was to establish the degree of heterodoxy that was acceptable in debate. In this context, Elisha the heretic and Eleazar, who is said to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> the Torah, represent two extremes in attitudes towards the Torah; actual rabbis and their arguments had to fit somewhere between these two limits.|$|E

25|$|By the 17th {{century the}} teachings of Luo {{combined}} with other folk beliefs, namely Maitreyan millenarianism and the folk mother goddess.

The three enlightened beings are Dipankara, Gautama and Maitreya the future one.|$|E

He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a homophobic fantasy. He believes only those who <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover appeared in compromising situations.|$|E
