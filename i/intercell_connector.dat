40|$|The silver-zinc (AgZn) {{battery system}} has been unique {{in its ability to}} safely satisfy high power demand {{applications}} with low mass and volume. However, a new generation of defense, aerospace, and commercial applications will impose even higher power demands. These new power demands can be satisfied by the development of a bipolar battery design. In this configuration the power consuming, interelectrode current conductors are eliminated while the current is then conducted via the large cross-section electrode substrate. Negative and positive active materials are applied to opposite sides of a solid silver foil substrate. In addition to reducing the weight and volume required for a specified power level, the output voltage performance is also improved as follows. Reduced weight through: elimination of the plastic cell container; elimination of plate leads and intercell connector; and elimination of internal plate current collector. Increased voltage through: elimination of resistance of current collector; elimination of resistance of plate lead; and elimination of resistance of <b>intercell</b> <b>connector.</b> EPI worked previously on development of a secondary bipolar silver zinc battery. This development demonstrated the electrical capability of the system and manufacturing techniques. One difficulty with this development was mechanical problems with the seals. However, recent improvements in plastics and adhesives should eliminate the major problem of maintaining a seal around the periphery of the bipolar module. The seal problem is not as significant for a primary battery application or for a requirement for only a few discharge cycles. A second difficulty encountered was with activation (introducing electrolyte into the cell) and with venting gas from the cell without loss of electrolyte. During previous work, the following projections for energy density were made from test data for a high power system which demonstrated in excess of 50 discharge/charge cycles. Projected system power = 100 kilowatts; discharge time = 30 seconds; discharge current density = 1. 75 amps/sq in.; system weight = 86 lbs (9. 7 WH/lb); and system volume = 1071 cu. in. (. 78 WH/cu. in.). EPI {{is currently working on a}} development program to produce a bipolar silver-zinc battery design for NASA. The potential application would be to power electromechanical actuators for space launch vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{different}} {{batches of}} partially Ba substituted lanthanum chromites were synthesized by a modilied liquid route followed by calcination {{and subjected to}} systematic characterization. Thin sections of components were made from these chromites by tape casting technique. Optimization of the compositions of the several ingredients to be employed in this fabrication procedure was attempted. The densification data of these powder were also obtained. A brief discussion {{on the relationship between}} the chromite processing techniques, their physical properties and component characteristics was attempted {{from the point of view}} of their application as bipolar <b>intercell</b> <b>connectors</b> for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) ...|$|R
