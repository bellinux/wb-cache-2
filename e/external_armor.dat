5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
25|$|Among {{terrestrial}} invertebrates {{there are}} a number of leg forms. The arthropod legs are jointed and supported by hard <b>external</b> <b>armor,</b> with the muscles attached to the internal surface of this exoskeleton. The other group of legged terrestrial invertebrates, the velvet worms, have soft stumpy legs supported by a hydrostatic skeleton. The prolegs that some caterpillars have in addition to their six more-standard arthropod legs have a similar form to those of velvet worms, and suggest a distant shared ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Catfish do {{not have}} scales; their bodies are often naked. In some species, the mucus-covered skin is used in {{cutaneous}} respiration, where the fish breathes through its skin. In some catfish, the skin is covered in bony plates called scutes; some form of body armor appears in various ways within the order. In loricarioids and in the Asian genus Sisor, the armor is primarily made up {{of one or more}} rows of free dermal plates. Similar plates are found in large specimens of Lithodoras. These plates may be supported by vertebral processes, as in scoloplacids and in Sisor, but the processes never fuse to the plates or form any <b>external</b> <b>armor.</b> By contrast, in the subfamily Doumeinae (family Amphiliidae) and in hoplomyzontines (Aspredinidae), the armor is formed solely by expanded vertebral processes that form plates. Finally, the lateral armor of doradids, Sisor, and hoplomyzontines consists of hypertrophied lateral line ossicles with dorsal and ventral lamina.|$|E
500|$|In May 1954, SCB {{created a}} class {{improvement}} {{plan for the}} North Carolinas which included twenty-four 3-inch/50 guns directed by six Mark56s. A month later, the SCB chairman voiced his belief that the North Carolinas and South Dakotas would be excellent additions to task forces—if they could be faster. The Bureau of Ships then considered and discarded designs that would move these ships at , four knots faster than their current attainable speed. In order for a North Carolina to obtain 31knots, [...] would be required. This, in turn, would necessitate the installation of an extremely large power plant, one which would not fit into the ship even if the third turret was removed. If the outer <b>external</b> belt <b>armor</b> were removed, [...] would still be required. However, no matter if the belt was taken off or not, all of the hull form aft {{would have to be}} greatly modified to accept larger propellers. The last strike against the project was the high estimated cost of $40million—which did not include the cost of activating battleships that had been out of commission for ten years.|$|R
5000|$|During the Korean War, AD Skyraiders {{were flown}} {{only by the}} U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, and were {{normally}} painted in dark navy blue. It was called the [...] "Blue Plane" [...] by enemy troops. Marine Corps Skyraiders suffered heavy losses when used in low-level close-support missions. To allow low-level operations to continue without unacceptable losses, a package of additional armor was fitted, consisting of 0.25 - 0.5 in thick <b>external</b> aluminum <b>armor</b> plates fitted to the underside and sides of the aircraft's fuselage. The armor package weighed a total of 618 lb and {{had little effect on}} performance or handling. A total of 128 Navy and Marine AD Skyraiders were lost in the Korean War [...] - [...] 101 in combat and 27 to operational causes. Most operational losses were due to the tremendous power of the AD. ADs that were [...] "waved-off" [...] during carrier recovery operations were prone to perform a fatal torque roll into the sea or the deck of the aircraft carrier if the pilot mistakenly gave the AD too much throttle. The torque of the engine was so great that it would cause the aircraft to rotate about the propeller and slam into the ground or the carrier.|$|R
500|$|The turtle's {{shell is}} divided into two sections: {{carapace}} and plastron. The carapace is further divided into large plates, or scutes.

50|$|The Hardware Version 2.0 suit {{consists}} of two layers, the basic armor and the <b>external</b> <b>armor,</b> which are described below.|$|E
50|$|Hardware's <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to damage. If the armor is breached, the nano-robots composing it are programmed to replicate themselves {{to repair the}} damage.|$|E
50|$|The basic armor is a {{plasticized}} {{metal alloy}} of Curtis' own design. Using a device called the Shell Forge, Hardware coats his body {{from head to}} toe with this material. Once polarized, the shell serves as a skintight, impact-resistant foundation upon which his <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> rests.|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} systems of Hardware’s armor are stored within the nano-robot housing pods in {{his helmet and}} shoulder pads. These systems are constructed by nano-robots, microscopic machines that are released via main control systems in the helmet. The <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> is powered by high efficiency batteries called power packs installed in the shoulder pads.|$|E
50|$|The {{aforementioned}} nano-robots replicate {{themselves into}} pre-programmed forms. When released from their pods, the robots begin rapidly constructing Hardware’s <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> from the shoulder pads down. Hence, he can don his armor in seconds instead of minutes {{as was the}} case with the Version 1.0 suit. Once empty, the nano-robot pods can be used by Hardware for other storage.|$|E
5000|$|Seamoths have {{modified}} pelvic fins {{that allow}} them to [...] "walk" [...] across the sea bottom where they live. Their jaws are ventral, located behind their long rostrum, and are toothless. Their mouth is highly specialized, and can form a tube-like mouth used to suck worms and other small invertebrates from their burrows. They periodically molt their bony <b>external</b> <b>armor,</b> perhaps as often as every five days.|$|E
50|$|Besides the <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> itself, the nano-robots {{construct}} the suit’s {{life support systems}} including temperature regulators and an internal air supply that activates when the armor is sealed for underwater or deep space travel. The armor is equipped with defense mechanisms to repel anyone who tries to remove it; Hardware has said these defenses can harm even beings as powerful as Blue Beetle. these defenses is a high voltage electric charge generated by the armor’s surface.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} {{the use of the term}} in {{paleontology}} is to describe hollow calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate or calcium phosphate plates grown as body armor by a number of Early Cambrian animals. Unlike sponge spicules, Early Cambrian sclerites appear to be <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> rather than internal structural elements. Sclerites are found on a curious collection of early animals including a common spongelike animal called Chancelloria; an armored slug-like form Wiwaxia; an armored worm with a pair of brachiopod-like shells Halkieria; and another armored worm Microdictyon that is generally considered to be a lobopod/onychophore.|$|E

50|$|However, the AL-21F engine proved {{tolerant}} of routine ingestion {{of sand and}} sand-contaminated fuel and by 1985 the combat readiness of the Su-17 fleet exceeded that of the Sukhoi Su-25 and the helicopters. The first-series Su-17s were quickly replaced with more capable Su-17M3 and Su-17M4.

5000|$|Most of the Cambrian SSF {{consists}} of sclerites, fragments that once {{made up the}} <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> of early animals, such as Halkieria or [...] "scale worms".

5000|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{hardness}} of the ceramics used, they offer superior resistance against a shaped charge jet and they shatter kinetic energy penetrators (KE-penetrators). The (pulverised) ceramic also strongly abrades any penetrator. Against lighter projectiles the hardness of the tiles causes a [...] "shatter gap" [...] effect: a higher velocity will, within a certain velocity range (the [...] "gap"), {{not lead to a}} deeper penetration but destroy the projectile itself instead. Because the ceramic is so brittle the entrance channel of a shaped charge jet is not smooth—as it would be when penetrating a metal—but ragged, causing extreme asymmetric pressures which disturb the geometry of the jet, on which its penetrative capabilities are critically dependent as its mass is relatively low. This initiates a vicious circle as the disturbed jet causes still greater irregularities in the ceramic, until in the end it is defeated. The newer composites, though tougher, optimise this effect as tiles made with them have a layered internal structure conducive to it, causing [...] "crack deflection". This mechanism—using the jet's own energy against it—has caused the effects of Chobham to be compared to those of reactive armour. This {{should not be confused with}} the effect used in Non-Explosive Reactive Armor: that of sandwiching an inert but soft elastic material such as rubber, between two armour plates. The impact of either a shaped charge jet or long-rod penetrator after the first layer has been perforated and while the rubber layer is being penetrated will cause the rubber to deform and expand, so deforming both the back and front plates. Both attack methods will suffer from obstruction to their expected paths, so experiencing a greater thickness of armour than there is nominally, thus lowering penetration. Also for rod penetrations, the transverse force experienced due to the deformation may cause the rod to shatter, bend, or just change its path, again lowering penetration. All versions of Chobham armor have incorporated a large volume of NERA plates either behind hard <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> to weaken the attack, or in front of the rest of the armor array intended to catch the remnants. This is another factor favouring a slab-sided or wedge-like turret: the amount of material the expanding plates push into the path of an attack increases as they are placed closer to parallel to the direction of that attack.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design process, hydraulic stability tests {{and construction of}} the Cubipod® armored Western breakwater at Punta Langosteira (Outer Port of A Coruña, Spain), located on the Atlantic coast of Spain. The environmental, geotechnical, economic and logistic conditions favored randomly-placed Cubipods for single-layer armoring of the trunk. 3 D hydraulic stability tests were carried out to validate the final design of the Western Breakwater; two models were tested with single- and double-layer Cubipod armors in the trunk and roundhead, respectively. Single-layer 25 - and 30 -tonne Cubipod® armors {{were used for the}} trunk section and a double-layer 45 -tonne Cubipod® armor was used for the roundhead. During this project, new challenges were overcome, such as constructing a transition between single and double-layer armors, and manufacturing and handling of 45 -tonne Cubipods. The transition in the armor thickness was solved by modifying the filter thickness under the main armor, to ensure a homogeneous <b>external</b> <b>armor</b> profile. Breakwater construction finished in November 2016 with no significant problem or delay in the original schedule...|$|E
40|$|Cable-series {{impedance}} modeling {{is widely}} applied in electromagnetic transients simulations and power-loss calculations. The calculations are usually {{performed in a}} 2 -D frame using the finite-element method or alternative approaches, such as MoM-SO, thereby losing the 3 -D effects imposed by twisting wire screens and armors. One {{of the implications of}} using 2 -D modeling for three-core and closely packed single-core cables is that currents will always circulate among the individual wires of each wire screen or armor. However, in the case of twisted screens/armors where the wires are insulated from each other, such current circulation will in reality not exist. As a result, the calculated impedances become incorrect as well as the induced currents and losses on individual conductors. A procedure is introduced for preventing such false current circulations in a 2 -D calculation frame by simple manipulation of the system impedance matrix. The approach is demonstrated for the modeling of single-core and three-core cables, with and without <b>external</b> <b>armor.</b> It is shown that the representation of the wire screen/armor armor with respect to current circulations can substantially influence the calculated result, both for the 50 / 60 Hz impedance and the cable transient behavior. The use of tubular screen representations is also investigate...|$|E
