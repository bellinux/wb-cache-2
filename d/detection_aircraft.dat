50|$|The Kriegsmarine {{believed}} that the Admiralty had an undisputed lead in radar detection. By the end of 1942, all U-boats had been fitted with the Metox radar detector (German:Funkmessbeobachtung, abbr. FuMB), a pioneering very sensitive high frequency radar warning receiver for Air to Surface Vessel radar transmissions from patrolling Allied aircraft. In March 1943, Karl Dönitz ordered his submarines to submerge after a positive reading from the device, expecting the U-boat to escape. Although the tactic was successful, Allied aircraft still continued to make positive contact. The Kriegsmarine decided on available evidence that the Allies had developed a new Radar, undetectable to Metox. A radio man aboard U-382 patched together a Metox receiver to a tuner which received a wider frequency spectrum above Metox. The patched gear had sounded a warning that was not received by the standard Metox. Marine Command believed this was proof of a new Allied radar and copied the radio mans device, calling it Magic Eye. However losses still mounted drastically, and B-Dienst and Kriegsmarine came to believe from expert testimony, that the Metox emitted radiation. Being a new technology {{it was hard to}} disprove. The Marine had its radar specialist attempt to locate the Metox radiation by flying <b>detection</b> <b>aircraft</b> close to active Metox on the submarine. The report indicated that radiation emissions could be detected from 500 to 2000 metres. However, it was a complete fallacy. No Allied detector actually existed and U-boat logs frequently reported contacts would be made when the Metox device was not switched on. The real reason was the Enigma M4 was being read by Bletchley Park cryptanalysts since December 1942, and read U-boats locations with some delays. As with OKW/Chi cryptanalysts, B-Dienst analysts misunderstood the extent {{of the size of the}} Allies' effort to break Enigma M. In an August 1943 BdU logbook, U-boat Command notes that word had reached them from Swiss man working in the US Navy that Naval Enigma was being read but failed to take action.|$|E

40|$|Image filter is {{the process}} of {{removing}} various types of noise from the images. The ensuant image is an information rich image than the original input image. The filtering finds its application in many fields from medical imagery, face detection, robot navigation, object <b>detection,</b> <b>aircraft</b> maintenance to image enhancement and image restoration. In the field of medical sciences the filter serves the purpose of image enhancement for efficient disease diagnosis, in aircraft maintenance for the purpose of detection of faults during takeoff, in case of face detection, object recognition and robot navigation used for object detection. This paper uses different quantitative metrics to analyze the result of different filtering techniques on an image. Initially, well known registered images from various aspects of science and nature are taken such as one image ct. jpg from medical sciences, two images Lighthouse. jpg, Penguins. jpg of natural scenery, two images of faces Koala. jpg, lena. jpg and a picture of naturally grown flowers Tulips. jpg are taken as input.

The work performed by the UAH personnel under this Delivery Order, concentrated on design and analyses of a compact coherent lidar system capable of measuring range and velocity of hard targets, and providing air mass velocity data. The following is the scope of this work. a. Investigate various laser sources and optical signal detection configurations in support of a compact and lightweight coherent laser radar to be developed for precision range and velocity measurements of hard and fuzzy targets. Through interaction with MSFC engineers, the most suitable laser source and signal detection technique that can provide a reliable compact and lightweight laser radar design will be selected. b. Analyze and specify the coherent laser radar system configuration and assist with its optical and electronic design efforts. Develop a system design including its optical layout design. Specify all optical components and provide the general requirements of the electronic subsystems including laser beam modulator and demodulator drivers, detector electronic interface, and the signal processor. c.
