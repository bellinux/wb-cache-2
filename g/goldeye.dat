"You {{may have}} {{the head of the}} catfish for the snuff, and the whole catfish for the box," [...] said La Certe, with the {{firmness}} {{of a man who has}} irrevocably made up his mind--for there are none so firm of purpose as the weak and vacillating when they know they have got the whip-hand of any one! [...] "And, behold! I will be liberal," [...] he added. [...] "You shall have another <b>goldeye</b> into the bargain--six goldeyes for the five shillings and a whole catfish for the box and snuff--voila!" [...] The poor Switzer still hesitated.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the busiest}} of the busy at that bustling time was Peegwish. While others were {{hard at work}} clearing, rebuilding, ploughing, and sowing, our noble savage was fishing. The labour of this {{occupation}} consisted chiefly in staring at his line, while {{he sat on a}} mud-heap on the river bank, and smoked in the pleasant sunshine. Occasionally he roused himself to haul out a <b>goldeye.</b> Wildcat assisted him ably in his labours, and still more ably in the after consumption of the goldeyes. Angus Macdonald discovered them thus occupied, and had difficulty in resisting his desire to pitch the lazy fellow into the river.|$|E

6000|$|Having {{arrived at}} the edge of the place where we usually fished, each drew from a cleft in the rock a stout branch of a tree, around the end of which was wound a bit of twine with a large hook {{attached}} to it. This we unwound quickly, and after impaling a live grasshopper upon the barbs of our respective hooks, dropped them into the water, and gazed intently at the lines. Mr Russ, who was a great lover of angling, now began to get excited, and made several violent pulls at the line, under the impression that something had bitten. Suddenly his rod, stout as it was, bent with the immense muscular force applied to it, and a small <b>goldeye,</b> about three or four inches long, flashed like an electric spark from the water, and fell with bursting force on the rocks behind, at the very feet of a small Indian boy, who sat, nearly in a state of nature, watching our movements from among the bushes. The little captive was of a bright silvery colour, with a golden eye, and is an excellent fish for breakfast. The truth of the proverb, [...] "It never rains but it pours," [...] was soon verified by the immense number of goldeyes of every size, from one foot to four inches, which we showered into the bushes behind us. Two or three dozen were caught in a few minutes, and at last we began to get quite exhausted; and Mr Russ proposed going up to the house for his new fly-rod, by way of diversifying the sport, and rendering it more scientific.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Goldeyes</b> {{name was}} resurrected in 1994 when the {{independent}} league Rochester Aces {{of the new}} Northern League relocated to Winnipeg.

50|$|There {{have been}} two {{separate}} and distinct baseball teams based out of Winnipeg to use the <b>Goldeyes</b> name, each playing in different incarnations of the Northern League. They first played in the original Northern League from 1954 until 1964. During that time, the <b>Goldeyes</b> were a minor league affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals and they won the league championship three times (1957, 1959, and 1960). The <b>Goldeyes</b> returned to the Short Season-A Northern League for one season, 1969, as an affiliate of the expansion Kansas City Royals, {{but they did not}} return in 1970, and the entire league shut down after the 1971 season.|$|R

[...] Katz himself served as the company's first president, and took part in negotiations with different levels of government concerning the stadium's construction. [...] Riverside Park later leased the stadium grounds and surrounding lots from the city for $1 per year plus payments equal to property taxes, and sublet the land to the <b>Goldeyes.</b> In July 2004, the <b>Goldeyes</b> and Riverside Park had the same directors.|$|R

50|$|Lake Winnipeg has {{important}} commercial fisheries. Its catch makes up {{a major part}} of Manitoba's $30 million-a-year fishing industry. The lake was once the main source of <b>goldeye</b> in Canada, which is why the fish is sometimes called Winnipeg <b>goldeye.</b> Common carp were introduced to the lake through the Red River of the North and are firmly established. Walleye and whitefish together account for over 90 percent of its commercial fishing.|$|E
