5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
25|$|Sōjirō is Shishio's {{right-hand}} man, a young assassin {{trained by}} Shishio himself. Sōjirō {{is known for}} his lack of kenki (offensive aura) in a fight, his apparent emotionless state reflected also in his sarcasm and polite manners with his smile hiding his true feelings. However, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> special relationship with Komagata Yumi, who functions as an older-sister figure towards him. Sōjirō usually dresses up in a blue kimono with white handguards.|$|E
25|$|In an invited comment (Seymann, 1991) and in {{subsequent}} {{letters to the}} editor, (vos Savant, 1991c; Rao, 1992; Bell, 1992; Hogbin and Nijdam, 2010) Morgan et al. were supported by some writers, criticized by others; in each case a response by Morgan et al. is published alongside the letter or comment in The American Statistician. In particular, vos Savant defended herself vigorously. Morgan et al. complained in their response to vos Savant (1991c) that vos Savant still had not actually responded to their own main point. Later in their response to Hogbin and Nijdam (2011), they did agree that it was natural to suppose that the host chooses a door to open completely at random, when <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> choice, and hence that the conditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., conditional given the situation the player is in {{when he has to}} make his choice) has the same value, , as the unconditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., averaged over all possible situations). This equality was already emphasized by Bell (1992), who suggested that Morgan et al.'s mathematically involved solution would only appeal to statisticians, whereas the equivalence of the conditional and unconditional solutions in the case of symmetry was intuitively obvious.|$|E

500|$|Faye and Joseph became {{engaged in}} series ten, much to Jac's displeasure. Roberts has relayed Marcel's insight that, [...] "Jac's left with very little. She hasn't got the {{consultancy}} post. Joseph's father {{is long gone}} and I think she may be nostalgic for all of that. She's hankering after Joseph again. She wants him for herself." [...] He added, on Joseph's reaction to Jac's meddling in his relationship with Faye; [...] "He's a good guy but Jac brings out the evil in him. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> darker side. He will fight injustice with injustice." [...] In the episode [...] "Locked Away", Joseph and Jac are locked in theatre together– after being affected by an unknown poison– where they both reveal their true feelings for each other. Joseph admits that he still loves Jac, but would not take her back as she has hurt him too many times.|$|E
2500|$|Though Garfield {{can be very}} cynical, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> soft {{side for}} his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and one Christmas he says, [...] "they say I {{have to get up}} early, be nice to people, skip breakfast... I wish it would never end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Border was {{a capable}} bowler, but, as captain, he underused himself, but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{tendency}} to bowl around the wicket, aiming outside off stump and bowling short.

2500|$|Can White {{stop the}} h-pawn from queening? The {{position}} looks lost for White but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> defence {{which seems to}} defy the rules of logic. White will calmly construct a [...] "fortress" [...] which will hide his pieces from attack. The only weakness in White's [...] "fortress" [...] is the g-pawn. This pawn has to be defended by the bishop and the only square where {{this can be done}} safely is from h6.|$|E
2500|$|On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an {{interview}} with The Daily Caller where he asserted {{that he is not}} [...] "backing away" [...] from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And I think <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." [...] Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Ukrainian {{prisoner}} Nikolai Getman {{who spent}} the years 1945–1953 in Kolyma, records his testimony in pictures rather than words. But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> plea: [...] "Some may say that the Gulag is a forgotten part of history {{and that we do}} not need to be reminded. But I have witnessed monstrous crimes. It is not too late to talk about them and reveal them. It is essential to do so. Some have expressed fear on seeing some of my paintings that I might end up in Kolyma again— this time for good. But the people must be reminded... of one of the harshest acts of political repression in the Soviet Union. My paintings may help achieve this." [...] The Jamestown Foundation provides access to all 50 of Getman's paintings together with explanations of their significance.|$|E

2500|$|Rod Foxx (Bryan Moses) (or [...] "the Hot Rod" [...] as he {{sometimes}} calls himself) is {{the younger brother}} of Steve Foxx.

[...] Although <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reasonable amount of sporting talent and can be successful on the dating scene, his ego knows no limits {{and he seems to}} be delusional. [...] He has 'released' a single, entitled [...] "I C U (Picture Perfect)", which details a man's (Rod's) obsession with a (presumably) under-age school girl as he stalks her and takes pictures of her changing and at the pool without her knowledge. Has a severe addiction to sexual harassment, resulting in him being shot, slashed and stabbed in that order.|$|E
2500|$|Milner is {{regarded}} as being a tenacious footballer. As a result, his main role on the team is as a wide midfielder who creates scoring opportunities, as well as taking the ball past defenders. He could be deemed a traditional English winger. While Milner does not score many goals, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good record at providing assists. Nolberto Solano, a former teammate, said that because of his ability, Milner would [...] "become an important team player". After his move to Newcastle, he began playing more as a winger. He {{has been described as}} [...] "comfortable on either wing". He has also been used occasionally as a central midfielder, a striker and as an emergency right-back, generally during an injury crisis. Manuel Pellegrini, who managed Milner at Manchester City, described Milner as the most complete English player in the modern game praising his all round ability, commitment, performance level and versatility.|$|E
2500|$|The same day, Deputy Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu admitted, [...] "In the process, and in {{the speed}} of the event, a mistake happened." [...] However, she {{rejected}} the view that Jantjie was a fraud, stating, [...] "we should not say that he is a fake interpreter because <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> basic sign language translation qualification. He started off very well and got tired in the process ... e has interpreted to deaf people in court before and is able to communicate with his deaf friends very well. It's just that (on that day) he did not sign what was expected of him." [...] The South African news broadcaster eNCA alleges that between 1994 and 2003 Jantjie was charged, but not sentenced, for various crimes ranging from rape and housebreaking to attempted murder and kidnapping. According to the report he was sentenced to three years in prison for theft but the other charges were dropped as he was judged ...|$|E

2500|$|When James {{graduated}} from high school, he went to Cincinnati Christian College to study under R. C. Foster and Grayson Ensign. Proceeding on from there, he attended Christian Theological Seminary and studied under Walter Sykes. By the time he finished his time as a student, he had collected over 500 hours of graduate credit because his mentor died unexpectedly right before {{he was about to}} graduate with his 1st doctorate and the program that he was a part of collapsed, so he had to start over. [...] He earned a B.A. and M.A. from Butler University, a Bachelor of Divinity from Christian Theological Seminary, and a Th.M. from the Chicago Graduate School of Theology. He fulfilled his Ph.D candidacy requirements at Indiana University, but due to a change over in the faculty from one year to the next he did not finish the degree. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> D.Min. from Eden Theological Seminary, Webster Groves, MO.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Hanson wrote: [...] "Obama's reset was a {{green light}} for Putin. Who {{in the real world}} of serious {{diplomacy}} shows up in Geneva with a red plastic toy reset button, complete with a mistranslated Russian label? When Putin soon sized up the Obama administration's appeasement around the globe—from fake red lines for Syria, to a scramble out of Iraq, to chaos in Libya—he moved into Crimea...As he swallows Eastern Ukraine, he now eyes the Baltic States. He does not quite have a map on his wall of a new czarist Orthodox state the size of the Soviet Union, but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> general sense {{that there are a lot}} more former Soviet republics to be had—and he is eager to poke here and there to find out which will be the easiest to grab next." [...] In another 2015 column, Hanson wrote about he sees as Putin's mindset that: [...] "Obama's false step-over, red, and deadlines confirmed Putin's impressions of the continued weak leadership of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry. He probably believes that he can do to Estonia what he has done to Crimea or Ukraine—and without too many more consequences. Putin is not greatly worried that the U.S. will re-energize NATO, rebuild its own nuclear deterrent, work with the Eastern Europeans on missile defense, or start exporting its plentiful natural gas to a Russia-dependent Europe. Right now Putin is digesting Eastern Ukraine and sizing up Obama's responses to others' aggressions. But next year, in the last twelve months of the Obama administration, we should expect him to move on another former Soviet republic, as well as to emphasize new partnerships with China, a few Eastern European or Balkan nations, or an ascendant Iran." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harold [...] "Harry" [...] Crane (Rich Sommer): A bespectacled media {{buyer and}} head of Sterling Cooper's {{television}} department, which is created at Harry's initiative. Unlike his mostly Ivy League fellows, Harry went to the University of Wisconsin. Harry joins his colleagues in drinking and flirtations, though he is a dedicated husband and father. However, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> drunken one-night stand with Pete's secretary in Season 1, {{which leads to a}} brief separation from his wife Jennifer. Although he is well-meaning, Harry has a tendency to make poor decisions and avoid confrontations, which contributes to the dismissal of Sal Romano in Season 3. He is ultimately coerced by Draper and Cooper into joining Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, although he comes to the realization that it is the right move on his own. When Sterling Cooper {{was in the process of}} being sold, Harry mistakenly thinks they are considering opening a West Coast office and believes that he would be the person to move to California. Harry later becomes a bit of a braggart, who is overly fond of discussing his Hollywood connections. In Season 5 he has abandoned his faithfulness to his wife as he discusses having affairs while abroad on business and is easily seduced by Paul's Hare Krishna girlfriend Lakshmi in his office. [...] He also becomes increasingly image-conscious and petty, culminating in Season 6 when he explodes at Joan after she fires his secretary Scarlet for falsifying her time card, venting his frustration over her being made partner when he was not. By Season 7, the question of his being named partner is discussed again and endorsed by Jim Cutler, but the sale of SC to McCann Erickson eliminates that possibility. He also propositions Megan Draper in exchange for helping promote her acting career, but is rejected.|$|E

6000|$|His extravagance was constant.
