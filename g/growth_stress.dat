40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to obtain estimates of longitudinal <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> in standing trees of the Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden at eight, thirteen, fifteen and nineteen years of age and to determine their relationships with wood characteristics. The longitudinal <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> were indirectly measured by the "CIRAD-Forêt" method and estimated from both the dynamic modulus of elasticity and the modulus of elasticity in tension parallel to the grain. The longitudinal residual strain (LRS) and the estimates of the longitudinal <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> tended to increase with the age of the material. The LRS correlated positively and significantly with all the <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> estimates. The largestes magnitudes were at 13, 15 and 19 years of age.

The tree growth model was formulated in terms of large strain settings (large changes in volume), whereas the material model for stress development was based on the theory of small strains. An earlier three-dimensional distortion model was developed further for studying the influence of <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> on final distortion of the board.

40|$|International audienceAims: In European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) large growth {{stresses}} lead {{to severe}} log end splitting that devaluate beech timber. Our study aimed at detecting relationships between <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> and some morphology parameters in trees. Methods: <b>Growth</b> <b>stress</b> indicators were recorded for 440 mature trees in 9 stands from 5 European countries, together with morphology parameters. Results: Most trees displayed an uneven distribution of <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> around the trunk. Moreover, <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> intensity varied largely between individual trees. Geometry {{of the trunk}} was a poor predictor of <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> intensity. Crown asymmetry resulted in a larger stress dissymmetry within trees. Trunk inclination was not correlated to mean or tension stress, contrary to what is usually found in younger trees. In the case of small inclination, <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> was close to expected from biomechanics of restoring verticality. Trees exhibiting a larger inclination probably evolved a different mechanical solution: a rather large crown, lower tree slenderness and a sufficient asymmetry in <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> as to prevent a higher inclination due to growth. Conclusion: A large slenderness is the best accurate predictor of a large <b>growth</b> <b>stress,</b> although variations in the ratio Height/DBH explained only 10 % of the variability of <b>growth</b> <b>stress.</b> A large crown surface was {{the best predictor of}} a low level of <b>growth</b> <b>stress.</b> A large spacing between trees seems a good solution to lower the risk of <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> in mature Beech...|$|E

30|$|Many {{processing}} defects {{related to}} <b>growth</b> <b>stress,</b> such as radial cracks at log ends or distortion of sawn lumber, tend to progress with the elapsed time [98 – 100]. This is because <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> release is a time-dependent phenomenon, which is easily {{explained by the}} viscoelastic nature of wood. In other words, the <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> consists of two components, elastic and viscoelastic [4, 98, 99, 101]. The creation of a free surface, either due to cutting operations or to crack propagation, is equivalent to an instantaneous recovery, i.e., {{the release of the}} elastic component of <b>growth</b> <b>stress.</b> The resulting instantaneous recovery is followed by a delayed recovery caused by rearrangements of cell wall macromolecules, especially those belonging to the amorphous matrix. This interpretation is further confirmed by the amplifying effect of boiling or steaming on observed time-dependent phenomena, which is consistent with viscoelasticity being a thermally activated process. Researchers thus consider the delayed recovery to be caused by the release of viscoelastic components of <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> [4, 101].|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{evaluation}} of <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> in Eucalyptus trees and {{their influence on}} both morphological properties of trees and technological properties of wood have been aimed by several studies, which used indirect and nondestructive methods for these evaluations. The present study aimed to estimate <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> for woods from Eucalyptus ssp. clones trough some of their dendrometric properties, using Dummy variables. 12 hybrid Eucalyptus clones were evaluated by basic density (BD) and dendrometric properties: diameter at breast height (DBH), bark thickness (BT), height (H) and total volume (VOL). The <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> were indirectly evaluated by the longitudinal residual strain (LRS) following the CIRAD-Forêt method. 12 Dummy variables were defined based {{on the characteristics of}} each clone. After that, four models were proposed in order to estimate the LRD, using Dummy variables, DBH, H, VOL and BD as independent variables.

The LRD of the clones were satisfactorily described by the mathematical models, although these values showed significant variability...|$|R
40|$|During growth, trees develop {{mechanical}} stresses of high magnitude having a par cular distribu on across the sec ons of stems and branches.

Interest on this ques on is mo vated by both its technological implica ons (deforma on and cracks in sawn products) and the comprehension of its biomechanical func on in the living tree. In this presenta on, new analy cal developments and their func onal implica ons will be presented. As {{an extension of the}} well-known Kübler's model, simple analy cal models were developed to calculate the field on longitudinal <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> in stems. Different canonical cases are considered: (i) a straight axisymmetric trunk, (ii) a branch that bends without reac ng, and (iii) a sta onary lted stem (i. e. a stem keeping its shape constant during <b>growth).</b> The <b>stress</b> field resul ng from growth in these cases will be shown, using realis c parameters taken from various literature sources. These parameters define how the stem size, weight and matura on stress change during tree growth.

40|$|Abstract – The {{relationship}} {{between the amount of}} <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> and the degree of artificial inclination was investigated in saplings of two angiosperm species. The tensile growth stresses generated in Prunus spachiana, which forms gelatinous fibers, were larger than those in Liriodendron tulipifera, which does not form gelatinous fibers. In both species, the tensile growth stresses generated in the upper side of inclined stems increased and the cellulose microfibrillar angle decreased proportionally as the inclination changed from 0 ° (vertical) to 20 °. At inclinations over 20 °, the tensile <b>growth</b> <b>stress</b> and cellulose microfibrillar angle did not change further. The thickness of the current growth layer increased linearly with the angle of inclination, but eccentric growth was not the main fac-tor contributing to the upward bending moment to return the axis to the normal vertical position.

For this reason, preliminary studies on the development and characteristics of <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> in oxides on these materials have begun. These studies include in situ acoustic emission (AE) for monitoring scale cracking, deflection testing in monofacial oxidation (DTMO) and in situ X-ray measurements. The measurements were complemented by detailed post-experimental metallographic investigations. From the DTMO measurements the stresses in the oxide on the specimens tested in humid environment are increased by about a factor of 5 compared to dry air at the beginning of oxidation for P 91. In a humid environment the stresses decrease with oxidation time while in dry air they remain almost constant. Significant acoustic emission (AE) occurs in humid air for oxidation coupons while virtually no AE is observed for thin foils in a humid environment and for coupons in dry air. These first results seem to be in good agreement with weight gain data characterizing the breakaway behavior in these environments, indicating that, indeed, oxide <b>growth</b> <b>stresses</b> play a key role for oxidation resistance and, thus, component lifetimes of such steels.
