40|$|The {{strength}} {{and stability of}} frictional interfaces, ranging from tribological systems to earthquake faults, are intimately related to the underlying spatially extended dynamics. Here we provide a comprehensive theoretical account, both analytic and numeric, of spatiotemporal interfacial dynamics in a realistic rate-and-state friction model, featuring both velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening behaviors. Slowly extending, loading-rate-dependent creep patches undergo a linear instability at a critical nucleation size, which is nearly independent of interfacial history, initial stress conditions, and velocity-strengthening friction. Nonlinear propagating rupture fronts—the outcome of instability—depend sensitively on the stress state and velocity-strengthening friction.

As the German defensive campaign in Tunisia wore on into 1943, the division underwent several actions designed to bring its structure within the lines of a conventional infantry division, having two regiments being given formal numerical designations before it ran out of fuel and ammunition and was forced to capitulate near Bizerte on 9 May 1943.|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the many support {{measures}} taken by Government {{in the past five}} years, Italy's innovation performance remains modest. The lack of a true system of innovation based on dense interactions between the main stakeholders in a conducive environment represents the main stumbling block, as impediments lie on several <b>fronts</b> <b>spanning</b> from supply and demand of innovation to its diffusion across firms, the ecosystem and policy governance. A role can also be attributed to the prevailing small dimension of most firms, their «traditional» specialization model, and some aversion in gaining competitiveness trough r&d. Far from tackling all these impediments, public intervention spread out in a host of measures with relatively small financial impact, while lacking a vision, a fully fledged strategy focused on the main hindrances, forward-looking and mindful of past shortcomings. In such a context, useful hints can be drawn from the most innovative countries' policies, especially in policy coordination, leveraging specialized agencies in policy implementation, providing all-encompassing services to innovating firms, investing in knowledge and innovation diffusion, as well as in training, and resorting to simple and flexible procedures.

40|$|The fourth {{volume of}} Readings in European Security {{considers}} the EU’s {{internal and external}} challenges {{on a number of}} <b>fronts,</b> <b>spanning</b> from its own burning banlieues to Afghanistan. Containing the most recent set of working papers of the European Security Forum (Nos. 21 through 25), this collection brings together the contributions of leading experts on security matters during the period of January 2006 to February 2007. The book begins with the wider implications of the EU’s constitutional malaise on the international scene and the EU’s current or desired role as a strategic actor. The reflection on internal challenges extends to consider the rise of suicide bombings and parallel societies within Europe, with scholars offering diverse views on the role of Islam. Risks to the EU’s energy security are also assessed, in which its relations with Russia figure prominently. Ukraine comes to the fore in this context, with in-depth analysis given of its energy and foreign policy goals against the background of domestic reforms. Finally, the chapter devoted to Afghanistan provides a critical assessment of the West’s handling of the conflict, underscoring its growing difficulties in trying to set the global strategic agenda...|$|R
40|$|Macroscopic sliding {{between two}} solids is {{triggered}} by the propagation of a micro-slip front along the frictional interface. In certain conditions, sliding is preceded by the propagation of aborted <b>fronts,</b> <b>spanning</b> {{only part of the}} contact interface. The selection of the characteristic size spanned by those so-called precursors remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a 1 D toy model of precursors between a slider and a track in which the fronts are quasi-static self-healing slip pulses. When the slider's thickness is large compared to the elastic correlation length and when the interfacial stiffness is small compared with the bulk stiffness, we provide an analytical solution for the length of the first precursor, Λ, and the shear stress field associated with it. These quantities are given {{as a function of the}} bulk material parameters, the frictional properties of the interface and the macroscopic loading conditions. Analytical results are in quantitative agreement with the numerical solution of the model. In contrast with previous models, our model predicts that Λ does not depend on the frictional breaking threshold of the interface. Our results should be relevant to the various systems in which self-healing slip pulses have been observed. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Data from 2008 and 2009 were substantial enough to identify eight clusters of nuptial flights triggered by the same weather fronts.
