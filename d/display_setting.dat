5000|$|Besley's {{original}} Clarendon {{design was}} quite compressed, unlike most later 'Clarendons' intended for <b>display</b> <b>setting,</b> {{which are often}} quite wide. One of the original target markets for Besley's Clarendon design was {{to act as a}} bold face within body text, providing a stronger emphasis than the italic type that had been used for centuries for this purpose, and in this it matches the quite condensed body text faces of the period. (The modern system of issuing typefaces in families with a companion bold of matched design did not develop until the twentieth century.) Slab serifs had already begun to be used for bold type by the 1840s, but they were often quite lumpy in design and quite poorly matched to the body text face they were intended to complement. Mosley has written that [...] "the Clarendon type of the Besley foundry is indeed the first type actually designed as a ‘related bold’ - that is, made to harmonize in design and align with the roman types weight typefaces it was set with…Before the launch of Clarendon type printers picked out words in slab-serifs or any other heavy type." [...] However, because of the Clarendon design's strong reputation for quality, it was rapidly copied. Historian Nicolete Gray considered the earlier [...] "Ionic" [...] face from the Caslon Foundry in the same style more effective than Besley's: [...] "Besley's became the normal, but it was certainly not the first…in 1842 Caslon have an upper and in 1843 a lower case with the characteristics fully developed, but of a normal width…Besley's compressed Clarendon is much less pleasing, it has lost emphasis and confidence, and gains only in plausibility." ...|$|E

40|$|People {{naturally}} perform multimodal {{interactions in}} everyday real world settings, as they collaborate over large visual surfaces such as paper maps on walls and tables. While {{a new generation}} of research technologies now supports co-located collaboration, they do not yet directly leverage such rich multimodal interaction. Even though a rich behavioural foundation is emerging that informs the design of co-located collaborative technologies, most systems still typically limit input to a single finger or pointer. This problem is partly caused by the fact that single point interaction is the only input easily accessible to researchers through existing toolkits and input APIs. In this research, I distil existing theories, models and ethnographic studies on co-present collaboration into behavioural foundations that describe the individual and group benefits for using gesture and speech multimodal input in a co-located large <b>display</b> <b>setting.</b> Next, I will develop a toolkit that facilitates rapid prototyping of multimodal co-located applications over large digital displays.

Examples of ‘visual disturbances’ of existing conventions of art production, reception and consumption, through processes of repeated deferral and fracture are discussed. The paper also explores problem finding and delayed closure and reflects on the following issues arising from the practice: •	The temporary suspension or ‘short circuit’ of conventions of studio methodology and practice. •	The conceptualisation of a ‘ruined, pictured space’ and repeated deferral of ‘outcome’. •	The disembodiment of divisions between: object and space; literal concealment and project fantasy; settled comfort and lurking dread (Melville, H. in Vidler, A. 1999, p. 57). •	The problematisation of perceived physical and conceptual boundaries between art & ‘life’. •	The production and consumption of a body of work that speaks to notions ‘ruin’ and catastrophe.

40|$|Discolored {{fresh meat}} {{products}} in a retail setting are often perceived negatively by consumers when making purchasing decisions. Prolonging fresh meat color {{is critical for}} the retail industry in regard to sales and consumer perception. Variation in retail display settings can impact meat color shelf life from both a discoloration and oxidation standpoint. Lighting technologies are known to impact meat discoloration due to light intensities and temperature variations. A growing demand {{for the use of}} energy efficient lighting sources such as light emitting diode (LED) bulbs is being adopted in the United States. Therefore, it is imperative to know the impact these new lighting technologies have on fresh meat quality. Three trials were conducted to determine the impact of LED lighting technologies in comparison to commonly used fluorescent (both low [FLO] and high - UV [HFLO]) bulbs, and no light source (DRK). In a study conducted on ground beef from the Semimembranosus (SM) (n = 20) patties at two different fat levels (5 and 25 percent) had superior a* values, oxymyoglobin concentrations (MbO 2), and lipid oxidation levels (TBARS) than those treated with LED or FLO light sources over 7 days of retail display. Patties displayed under LED bulbs had higher a* values and MbO 2 concentrations than patties displayed under FLO light sources. Data indicated that the use of LED bulbs on ground beef promoted greater red color retention and less oxidation than FLO bulbs in a retail <b>display</b> <b>setting.</b> To evaluate retail display settings and fresh beef cuts further, two whole muscle cuts one color labile cut (Triceps brachii [TB]) (n = 20) and steaks from the SM (n = 20), known to be moderately color stable were evaluated xi under HFLO, FLO, and LED light sources over 7 days of retail display. For both whole muscle cuts, the use of HFLO light sources promoted greater redness retention as indicated by MbO 2 and a* values, less lipid oxidation as indicated by TBARS values, and less undesirable metmyoglobin (MMb) formation in comparison to steaks displayed under FLO or LED light treatments. The use of LED bulbs for prolonged ground beef retail display was superior to other light sources. However, ground beef is rarely displayed in retail settings {{for an extended period of}} time. The use of LED bulbs showed no advantages when displaying whole muscle cuts. Therefore, data from this study suggests while from an energy efficiency standpoint LED bulbs can be beneficial to retail settings. However, from a fresh meat quality standpoint, there is no advantage from color or oxidative standpoint for using LED lights in a retail <b>display</b> <b>setting</b> for fresh beef products...|$|E

The efficacy of imaging in the diagnosis of HCC in the AP of each liver segment was evaluated by the 3 independent reviewers, and classified into 4 grades as tumor conspicuity: “excellent (HCC enhancement at AP[*]≥[*]the enhancement of aorta)”, “good (liver parenchyma[*]<[*]< HCC enhancement at AP[*]<[*]the enhancement of aorta)”, “fair (liver parenchyma[*]<[*]HCC enhancement at AP[*]<[*]< the enhancement of aorta)” and “poor (liver parenchyma[*]≥[*]HCC enhancement at AP)”. These gradings were employed for the largest target 10 tumors. The scan timing of AP was investigated by these 2 grades: “good (arterial and portal vein enhancement of the liver are seen, but hepatic vein enhancement is not seen)”, “poor (portal vein enhancement is not seen, or both portal vein and hepatic vein in the liver are seen)”. The evaluation result was adopted when ratings given by 2 reviewers were consistent. When ratings by 3 reviewers were completely inconsistent, the case was discussed to determine the final rating.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Effects {{of display}} size and dual <b>display</b> <b>setting</b> on {{preferred}} display and keyboard positions were evaluated. Background: User-preferred display position may vary as its size changes or when multiple displays are used. It {{is also not}} known whether the use of larger displays or multiple displays would influence positioning of the keyboard. Method: Participants (N = 19) who had normal visual acuity (20 / 30 or better) determined preferred positions of the display and the keyboard during a data entry task in four display setups (19, 24, 27. 5, and dual 19 in.). The size of capital characters (3. 2 mm high) was kept consistent between setups. Results: Preferred viewing distance ranged from 0. 68 m (19 -in. display) to 0. 76 m (27. 5 -in. display). No significant differences in viewing distance and display height {{were found between the}} single 19 -in. display and dual 19 -in. displays setups. The preferred position of the keyboard was consistent between display setups. Conclusion: Participants placed larger displays farther and lower while maintaining the display top at or near eye height. Preferred position of the dual displays in landscape setting did not differ from that of a single display. It appears that the preferred display position varies with the vertical dimension of the overall viewable area of the display. Application: The results of this study can be used to determine the dimensions or adjustability of computer workstations for larger displays or multiple displays settings. close 6...|$|E
40|$|The theatre of Jay Scheib blends {{theatrical}} and filmic features, {{allowing for}} a theoretical investigation of {{the manner in which}} two different media coexist on the same expressive support. How can two distinct media like film and theatre fuse and, at the same time, be apprehended as separate artistic means in a single artifact? The present article uses a theoretical interpretive metaphor that rests on an application of the mechanisms of relationship between two physical systems issued from the quantum mechanical view of reality. From this perspective, the two afore-mentioned media are in an entangled state. Media is understood as “potential materials or forms for future practices,” or “automatisms” (Rodowick 2007, 42). At the same time, theatrical or cinematic media is apprehended by the audience in a dynamic way, not defined as a static bundle of defining features. Dynamic conceptualization will modulate or “tune” the comprehension of one of the media considered to be a subordinate system in the duplex. The blending of the two media presupposes a local conceptualization unfolding dynamically and an entangled one manifested nonlocal. The distinction between film and theatre is also {{to be seen as a}} difference in the cognitive model which posits a detached display (a screen/a scene), an imaginary world (a diegesis) and a spectator (observer). In theatre, the body of the observer is inside the theatrical <b>display</b> <b>setting,</b> while in film, the body of the viewer is conceptualized to be separated from the cinematic display.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} a novel method for fabricating quantum dot light-emitting devices (QDLEDs) based on colloidal inorganic light-emitting nanoparticles incorporated into an organic semiconductor matrix. CdSe core/ZnS shell nanoparticles were inkjet-printed in air and sandwiched between organic hole and electron transport layers to produce efficient photon-emissive media. The light-emitting devices fabricated here were tested as individual devices and {{integrated into a}} <b>display</b> <b>setting,</b> thus endorsing the capability of this method as a manufacturing approach for full-colour high-definition displays. By choosing inkjet printing as a deposition method for quantum dots, several problems currently inevitable with alternative methods are addressed. First, inkjet printing promises simple patterning due to its drop-on-demand concept, thus overruling a need for complicated and laborious patterning methods. Secondly, manufacturing costs can be reduced significantly by introducing this prudent fabrication step for very expensive nanoparticles. Since there are no prior demonstrations of inkjet printing of electroluminescent quantum dot devices in the literature, this work dives into the basics of inkjet printing of low-viscosity, relatively highly volatile quantum dot inks: piezo driver requirements, jetting parameters, fluid dynamics in the cartridge and on the surface, nanoparticle assembly in a wet droplet and packing of dots on the surface are main concerns in the experimental part. Device performance is likewise discussed and {{plays an important role}} in this thesis. Several compositional QDLED structures are described. In addition, different pixel geometries are discussed. The last part of this dissertation deals with the principles of QDLED displays and their basic components: RGB pixels and organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) drivers. Work related to transistors is intertwined with QDLED work; ideas for surface treatments that enhance nanoparticle packing are carried over from self-assembled monolayer (SAM) studies in the OTFT field. Moreover, all the work done in this thesis project was consolidated by one method, atomic force microscopy (AFM), which is discussed throughout the entire thesis...|$|E
