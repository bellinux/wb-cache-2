5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} out, and he <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E

40|$|The {{method for}} defectoscopy of {{materials}} that uses separated ultrasonic <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> emitting and reception of signals i. e. ultrasonic transmission defectoscopy {{has not been}} much in use {{in science and engineering}} until now. This method consists of an ultrasonic <b>head</b> <b>for</b> emitting signal and only a single ultrasonic <b>head</b> <b>for</b> its reception. The method described in this paper is named quadraphonic transmission ultrasound defectoscopy (QTUD). It is an ultrasonic defectoscopy method for materials testing that uses a single ultrasonic <b>head</b> <b>for</b> emitting and four ultrasonic <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> receiving of ultrasonic signal. The advantage of this method is its suitability even with porous materials, all based on relatively low frequencies (about few tens of kHz). Therefore, electronic components are cheaper, so the wide application of this method, both in science and industry is possible...|$|R

5|$|At 22:56 on 5June, 1944, the six gliders towed by Halifax bombers {{took off}} from RAF Tarrant Rushton.

Each glider also carried five Royal Engineers. Flying over the English Channel at , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00:07 on 6June, 1944 and released their towed gliders. With Wallwork at the controls, the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the canal bridge defences at 00:16. The other two gliders followed at one-minute intervals.
