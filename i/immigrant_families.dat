5|$|American {{and other}} <b>immigrant</b> <b>families</b> began {{arriving}} in St. Louis and opening new businesses, including printing and banking, {{starting in the}} 1810s. Among the printers was Joseph Charless, who published the first newspaper west of the Mississippi, the Missouri Gazette, on July 12, 1808. In 1816 and 1817, groups of merchants formed the first banks in the town, but mismanagement and the Panic of 1819 led to their closure.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to {{the announcement of the}} United Nations Partition Plan, Arab mobs stormed Mamilla Street on December 2, 1947, ransacking and setting fire to 40 Jewish-owned stores. Jewish merchants fled the area, which then came under heavy bombardment during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. With the cessation of hostilities, the area became a no man's land dividing the Jordanian-occupied Old City from Jewish West Jerusalem, until a truce was signed in 1952. In the 1950s, poor Sephardic <b>immigrant</b> <b>families</b> and tradesmen took up occupancy in the derelict buildings, and workshops and auto-repair garages replaced the former stores.|$|E
5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere from The Firm and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says {{that most of the}} claimants that they find are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic <b>immigrant</b> <b>families.</b> Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E

Much literature focuses on inequality between families, but inequality often exists within families as well. Though within-family inequality is not unique to <b>immigrant</b> <b>families,</b> the processes of migration and assimilation into American society provide new channels through which such inequality may emerge.|$|E

25|$|The main {{political}} issue {{addressed by the}} speech was not immigration as such, however. It was the introduction by the Labour Government of the Race Relations Act 1968, which Powell found offensive and immoral.

25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1810s {{with the growth of}} American {{families}} moving to St. Louis, brick buildings began to be built in the town.

25|$|Parents {{may feel}} that their {{authority}} over their children is weakened because there are greater resources available in the United States and children are thus less dependent upon their parents for financial support. Some parents believe that children's greater independence also makes them less likely to heed parent's teachings and advice. In particular, children in <b>immigrant</b> <b>families</b> may have greater access to education and work opportunities. These, in turn, can help facilitate social mobility, raising the socioeconomic status of subsequent generations of immigrants relative to first generation immigrants (see Second generation immigrants in the United States).|$|E
25|$|In many <b>immigrant</b> <b>families,</b> {{members of}} the younger {{generation}} have greater English language proficiency than their elders. In families where parents may know little to no English, children may act as interpreters. Young children may therefore be involved in important family matters, including finances. In cases where children are in charge of paying bills, they may {{be in a position to}} take a portion of their parents' money for their own use. Even when this is not the case, the role of interpreter gives a particular family member a certain measure of control over other family members who are unable to communicate as well in English.|$|E

Upon later visiting the hospital, it is claimed that the parents were told that their children had died though no bodies were presented and graves which have later proven to be empty in many cases were shown to the parents. Those who believed the theory contended that the Israeli government {{as well as other}} organizations in Israel kidnapped the children and gave them for adoption to other, non-Yemenite, families.|$|E
