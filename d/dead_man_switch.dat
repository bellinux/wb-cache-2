5000|$|The Neverwas Haul {{consists}} of three major sections: engine room, command deck, and parlor. The engine room stores extra cargo and seats up to six people. The command deck is dominated by a full size ship's wheel for steering. The controls are a throttle for hydraulic control, and a <b>dead</b> <b>man</b> <b>switch</b> for emergency stops. The parlor is well apportioned: it has a bar, library, veranda, vintage stuffed chairs, and a camera obscura. There is even stairs to the [...] "widows walk" [...] which has a rooftop view. While many media sources cite the Neverwas Haul as an unusual RV or Winnebago, it is primarily a large overly detailed kinetic art piece.|$|E

40|$|Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) is an {{independent}} flight safety system designed for small to medium sized expendable launch vehicles launching from or needing range safety protection while overlying relatively remote locations. AFSS replaces {{the need for a}} man-in-the-loop to make decisions for flight termination. AFSS could also serve as the prototype for an autonomous manned flight crew escape advisory system. AFSS utilizes onboard sensors and processors to emulate the human decision-making process using rule-based software logic and can dramatically reduce safety response time during critical launch phases. The Range Safety flight path nominal trajectory, its deviation allowances, limit zones and other flight safety rules are stored in the onboard computers. Position, velocity and attitude data obtained from onboard global positioning system (GPS) and inertial navigation system (INS) sensors are compared with these rules to determine the appropriate action to ensure that people and property are not jeopardized. The final system will be fully redundant and independent with multiple processors, sensors, and <b>dead</b> <b>man</b> <b>switches</b> to prevent inadvertent flight termination. AFSS is currently in Phase III which includes updated algorithms, integrated GPS/INS sensors, large scale simulation testing and initial aircraft flight testing...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{examples}} of a public transport vehicle that was developed specifically for one-man operation is the Birney streetcar introduced in the United States in 1916. The Birney was pre-equipped {{with one of the}} most important safety devices for enabling one-man operation - the dead man's switch. At the time (and to a certain extent also today) one of the most cited arguments against one-man operation was the safety risks to passengers and bystanders if the driver fell ill. The <b>dead</b> <b>man</b> <b>switch</b> ensured that the tram would stop in the event of an incapacitated driver. For this reason, the Birneys were also called [...] "safety cars". Another critical feature of the Birney in dealing with safety issues from the critics of one-man operation was its compact size which eased the drivers view of the road and reducing the number of doors to a single one.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the film}} was released, the Toledo Blade {{compared}} {{the events of the}} film to the real-life incident. [...] "It's predictably exaggerated and dramatized to make it more entertaining," [...] wrote David Patch, [...] "but close enough to the real thing to support the 'Inspired by True Events' announcement that flashes across the screen at its start." [...] He notes that the <b>dead</b> <b>man</b> <b>switch</b> would probably have worked in real life despite the unconnected brake hoses, unless the locomotive, or independent brakes, were already applied. As explained in the movie, the dead man's switch failed because the only available brakes were the independent brakes, which were quickly worn through, similar to CSX 8888. The film exaggerates the possible damage the phenol could have caused in a fire, and he found it incredible that the fictional AWVR freely disseminated information such as employees' names and images and the cause of the runaway to the media. In the real instance, he writes, the cause of the runaway was not disclosed until months later when the National Transportation Safety Board released its report, and CSX never made public the name of the engineer whose error let the train slip, nor what disciplinary action was taken.|$|E

50|$|When an {{apartment}} landlord attempts {{to open a}} door to deliver mail, he is killed by a bomb wired to the door. Since the apartment belongs to a Navy lieutenant, Gibbs and his team are called in. However, they find that the Navy lieutenant, Terence Keith, is missing after taking leave. Further investigation reveals that Keith {{had wanted to be}} a fighter pilot but washed out of flight training. He had also purchased over 200 pounds of C4 explosive and rented a STOL plane. The team deduces that he is planning to use the explosives and the plane to bomb a target. However, because the STOL can fly below radar coverage, it would be next to impossible to find. Fortunately, McGee comes up with the idea to use Twitter to find the plane by asking Twitter users to send a tweet if they see it fly overhead. Using the data they collect, the team figures out that Keith is planning to bomb the U.S.S. Benjamin Franklin, an aircraft carrier that is also carrying several of Keith's classmates who graduated from flight training and that Keith is attacking it, purely because one of his classmates, Lieutenant Junior Grade Dana Robbins is on board which Gibbs realizes is the ultimate blow to Keith's ego as Robbins gets to fly airplanes and Keith doesn't. Gibbs manages to contact Keith and tells him his plan is doomed to fail, as the carrier has scrambled fighters and its anti-air defenses have locked onto him. Gibbs even attempts to encourage Keith to surrender, stating that Keith will be given safe passage to do so. Keith turns the plane away, but since he is holding a <b>dead</b> <b>man</b> <b>switch</b> and has nothing left to live for, remarks that it's too late before he commits suicide by detonating the bomb, destroying the aircraft and killing himself in the process.|$|E
