He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier.

[...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E

Scores for the six questions were then totaled and those scoring 13 or higher were dichotomized into having ‘high psychological distress’; these are consistent with relevant recent Asian literature (Fushimi et al. 2011 Hozawa et al. 2009). All the questions were translated into Thai by a professional public health team and were validated with pilot subjects.

The focus of the later chapters is preluded by the first section of the book, entitled ‘Is decision making rational or irrational?’. In this section, Berthoz gives a brief account of the current controversy of whether decision making is just about computing gains, losses, and probabilities, or whether it is more than that. Decision making is of course more than that as emotional, social, and other factors frequently bias a person's judgment to deviate from the path of rationality, hence the book's title...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Dental {{treatment}} {{is necessary in}} oncology patients since pre-existing oro-dental disease may influence cancer treatment and prognosis. This study investigated the applicability of two indices in reflecting the actual oral health status of 100 non-cancer patients who were admitted for dental complaints/routine controls. Methods: The radiographic examination results and the decayed, missed, filled teeth score represented the ‘actual oro-dental status’. The simplified oral hygiene index was utilised for oral hygiene determination, and general oral health assessment index was used to establish the self-perceived oral health. Results: No correlation was observed between actual oro-dental status and the simplified oral hygiene index (p = 0. 27), but the relationship between oro-dental status and general oral health assessment index was significant (p = 0. 026). Items 9, 5 and 1 (<b>How</b> <b>often</b> were you concerned about problems with your teeth, gums or dentures? <b>How</b> <b>often</b> {{were you able to}} eat anything without feeling discomfort? <b>How</b> <b>often</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> limit the kinds or amounts of food you eat because of problems with your teeth or dentures?) presented correlation (r = − 0. 285, r = 0. 268, and r = − 0. 248).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence on {{prevalence}} and correlates of pretransplant medication nonadherence (MNA) is limited. The present study explored self-reported {{prevalence and}} correlates of MNA before heart, liver, and lung transplantation. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study included 174 patients: 69 lung, 33 heart, and 72 liver transplant candidates. MNA {{was assessed by}} self-report using the following question: "During the past 14 days, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not take your medication?" Patients scoring once or higher on a five-point rating scale {{were considered to be}} nonadherent. Correlates of MNA explored were demographics, anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Inventory), personality traits (NEO Personality Inventory-Revised), perceived health status (Euro-QOL), and social support (Social Support Questionnaire). RESULTS: Prevalence of pretransplant MNA was 16. 7 % and was comparable among the three groups. After correction for multiple comparisons (i. e., P= 0. 01), higher educational level (P= 0. 006) was related to MNA. Less severe depression (P= 0. 069), lower scores on the personality trait conscientiousness (P= 0. 021), and less received social support (P= 0. 062) tended to be related to MNA. Multiple logistic regression revealed that higher educational level (P= 0. 008), lower received social support (P= 0. 013), and lower conscientiousness (P= 0. 023) were independent predictors of pretransplant MNA. CONCLUSIONS: Several correlates of MNA allow identification of patients at risk for pretransplant MNA. status: publishe...|$|R

For example, respondents are asked, “During the past 7 days, because of your weight, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> experience joint pain (in any part of your body)?” Response options were based on a 5 -point Likert-type scale, which was chosen to ensure that meaningful distinctions could be made among responses for analysis while minimizing the cognitive burden for respondents completing the instrument [42]. Response options included the following: “Never/almost never,” “Rarely,” “Sometimes,” “Often,” and “Always/almost always.” A rating scale, which is frequently used to measure patient-reported health status and symptom severity, was used to measure the severity of respondents’ signs or symptoms [43]. Each item includes a sub-item measuring sign/symptom severity among those who experienced the sign/symptom in the past 7  days using a rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates “not bad at all,” and 10 indicates “worst imaginable.” For instance, for joint pain, respondents are asked, “If you experienced joint pain, how bad was it at its worst?” Respondents are then instructed to circle a number on the rating scale, which is consistent across sub-items, to indicate the sign/symptom severity they experienced in the past 7  days. The 10 signs or symptoms included in the updated WRSSM measure include shortness of breath, joint pain, low physical stamina, back pain, low energy, sensitivity to heat, trouble sleeping, heavy sweating, low sexual desire, and foot pain.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Low {{rates of}} {{contraception}} and at-risk drinking place many Russian women {{at risk of}} an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). The only realistic way to determine when women {{are at risk of}} AEP is by self-reports. A U. S. study found that a single binge-drinking question (SBD) effectively identified nearly all women whose drinking placed them at risk of AEP. Methods The present study replicated the U. S. study. Participants were 689 non-pregnant Russian women of childbearing age who were at AEP risk. Their answers to SBD, “During the previous three months, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have four or more drinks on one occasion”, were compared with their reports of binge drinking on a 90 -day Timeline Followback (TLFB) calendar. Results The SBD identified 99 % of at-risk Russian women as binge drinkers, replicating U. S. findings. Only 8 % of the women were identified at-risk using a second AEP criterion of ≥ 8 drinks on average per week. Although Russian women did not report heavy weekly drinking and two-thirds did not meet AUDIT criteria for problem drinking, when they did drink, 40 % of the time it was binge drinking. Conclusions Almost all Russian women who were at risk of an AEP were identified by a single binge-drinking question. Results from this study suggest that Russian health care practitioners can use SBD to successfully screen women for AEP risk. SBD identified 99 % of Russian women who were at AEP risk. Consequently, it is recommended that SBD be incorporated into routine health care screenings at OB/GYN clinic visits...|$|R

Those monies that were going to go into destroying those neighborhoods or building the highways were shifted into refurbishing the commuter rail system, extending the Red Line, relocating the Orange Line, basically rebuilding the public transportation infrastructure of the city. That came out of that decision and another component of the same decision - you can go check that speech that Frank Sargent gave - was that the only highways that would continue to be studied within Route 128 would be the depression and widening of the Central Artery and the extension of I-90 over to Logan in an additional tunnel, the two components that are today called the Big Dig. Those were really part of that, if you will, anti-highway - [...] "anti-highway's" [...] probably the wrong name - pro-city decision that was made by Frank Sargent to shift towards a transportation strategy that would build the city instead of destroying it.And a major component of that was, stop building destructive roads. Another major component was, put a lot of money into improving public transportation, and the third component that we're seeing built now is, take the existing Central Artery that's there and fix it. I mean fix it both from a transportation point of view, because it doesn't work, but also fix what it did to the city by etting it underground and knit the city back together again.

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005 - 2006 and 2007 - 2008 waves. NLC were assessed with, "In the past month, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have leg cramps while trying to sleep?" Responses were categorized as None, Mild, or Moderate-Severe. Demographics, medical history, sleep disturbances, and cardiometabolic risk factors were evaluated using the 2005 - 2006 dataset. Variables that demonstrated significant relationships to NLC after adjusting for age, sex, education, and BMI were assessed in the 2007 - 2008 dataset. Variables that were still significant were entered into a forward stepwise regression model combining both waves, to determine which variables best explained the variance in NLC. Prevalence was 24 - 25 % reporting mild and 6 % reporting moderate-severe NLC. NLC increased with age, lower education, unemployment, shorter sleep duration, all assessed sleep symptoms (nocturnal "leg jerks", snoring, snorting/gasping, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, non-restorative sleep, sleepiness, use of sleep medications), higher BMI, smoking, medical history (hypertension, heart failure, angina, stroke, arthritis, respiratory disease, and cancer), depression symptoms, and biomarkers (CRP, HbA 1 c, calcium, cadmium, red blood cells). Stepwise analysis showed that moderate-severe nocturnal leg cramps were associated with (in decreasing order of partial R 2) : leg jerks, poor overall health, arthritis, difficulty falling asleep, age, nonrestorative sleep, red blood cell count, lower education, angina, and difficulty maintaining sleep. Based on this first large, representative study, NLC occurring > 5 x per month are reported by 6 % of the adult US population.

40|$|Background Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) {{are common}} and poorly understood. Objective To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} NLC and associations with cardiometabolic, sleep, and behavioral risk factors in the US population. Design Cross-sectional epidemiology. Participants National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005 - 2006 and 2007 - 2008 waves. Main outcome(s) and measure(s) NLC were assessed with, "In the past month, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have leg cramps while trying to sleep?" Responses were categorized as None, Mild, or Moderate-Severe. Demographics, medical history, sleep disturbances, and cardiometabolic risk factors were evaluated using the 2005 - 2006 dataset. Variables that demonstrated significant relationships to NLC after adjusting for age, sex, education, and BMI were assessed in the 2007 - 2008 dataset. Variables that were still significant were entered into a forward stepwise regression model combining both waves, to determine which variables best explained the variance in NLC. Results Prevalence was 24 - 25 % reporting mild and 6 % reporting moderate-severe NLC. NLC increased with age, lower education, unemployment, shorter sleep duration, all assessed sleep symptoms (nocturnal "leg jerks", snoring, snorting/gasping, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, non-restorative sleep, sleepiness, use of sleep medications), higher BMI, smoking, medical history (hypertension, heart failure, angina, stroke, arthritis, respiratory disease, and cancer), depression symptoms, and biomarkers (CRP, HbA 1 c, calcium, cadmium, red blood cells). Stepwise analysis showed that moderate-severe nocturnal leg cramps were associated with (in decreasing order of partial R- 2) : leg jerks, poor overall health, arthritis, difficulty falling asleep, age, nonrestorative sleep, red blood cell count, lower education, angina, and difficulty maintaining sleep. Conclusions and relevance Based on this first large, representative study, NLC occurring > 5 x per month are reported by 6 % of the adult US population. Sleep disturbance symptoms and health conditions are {{associated with higher frequency}} of NLC, suggesting that NLC is a marker, and possibly contributor, to poor sleep and general health...|$|R
