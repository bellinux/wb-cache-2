5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made <b>foreign</b> <b>goods</b> more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing.

He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the growth and}} welfare effects of revenue-neutral tariff reform in a small open endogenous growth model with environmental externalities. As {{is the case in}} countries that depend primarily on imported energy, the employment of a <b>foreign</b> intermediate <b>good</b> causes negative environmental externalities in production. This paper shows that substituting a tariff on the <b>foreign</b> intermediate <b>good</b> for a tariff on the <b>foreign</b> consumption <b>good</b> in a revenue-neutral way raises the growth rate and the welfare, if the environmental externality is sufficiently strong and if the elasticity of substitution between inputs lies within a certain range.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic {{model for a}} small open economy with imperfect financial market. It provides a framework to analyze the role of credit constraints and debt denomination in the generation and amplification of macroeconomic instability in an open economy context. As in Bernanke and Gertler (1989), the imperfection in the financial market results from {{the existence of a}} costly state of verification (CSV) problem. Entrepreneurs whose net worth is not enough to finance their desired physical investment have to pay a premium above the risk-free interest rate to obtain external funds. Other key ingredients of the model are that a <b>foreign</b> <b>good</b> is used as an input in the production of the capital good, and that the debt is denominated in terms of the <b>foreign</b> <b>good.</b> Real exchange rate depreciations generate an increase in the cost of producing capital and a reduction in the net worth of entrepreneurs due to the debt denomination. Therefore, recessionary effects can be deepenedExchange rates, credit constraints, open economy. ...|$|R

5|$|After Selvo was deposed, it {{took several}} years for Venice {{to recover from the}} defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the {{immediate}} impact of his actions as Doge. When Venice provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in Venice (including a special gift to the coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of Venice in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over other <b>foreign</b> <b>goods,</b> but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between Venice and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made Venice a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import <b>foreign</b> <b>goods</b> or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I test the {{hypothesis}} that trade policies leading to higher prices for capital goods have a negative influence on the steady state level and transitional growth rate of per capita GDP. I derive this hypothesis from {{a modified version of}} a Solow-Swan model, in which capital variety increases productivity. This model has the implication that import restrictions on <b>foreign</b> capital <b>goods</b> reduce the steady state level and the transitional growth rate of per capita GDP. However, although I assume that technological progress spreads over different countries via the import of new capital goods, import restrictions do not reduce the steady state growth rate. A reduction of the steady state growth rate is only possible, if the number of varieties of imported capital goods were restricted. The empirical results show that capital goods prices as well as the relative input ratios of domestic and <b>foreign</b> capital <b>goods</b> are significantly positively affected by the level of import tariffs on capital goods and the coverage ratio of non-tariff measures on capital goods. A test of the steady state version of the Solow-Swan model displays a statistically significant negative relation between import restrictions on <b>foreign</b> capital <b>goods</b> and the level of per capita GDP. A test of the transitional version of the Solow-Swan model displays a statistically significant negative relation between import restrictions on <b>foreign</b> capital <b>goods</b> and the transitional growth rate of per capita GDP.

40|$|Although a {{vital part}} of the economy, the Korean textile {{industry}} has been challenged by the recent reduction of international trade barriers, particularly as this industry was fully integrated into GATT in 2005. The textile industries in Japan and many other countries have also faced difficulties. This study examines future prospects for the Korean industry by investigating the presence of economies of scale and relationships among the inputs of domestic capital, labor, and intermediate goods, as well as <b>foreign</b> intermediate <b>goods.</b> The findings are consistent with constant returns to scale and a substitutes relationship among all input pairs except for domestic capital and <b>foreign</b> intermediate <b>goods.</b> Thus, there appear to be no further cost reductions available through increased output and economies of scale. However, some reduction in industry output may not result in increased unit costs either. A reduction in the price of <b>foreign</b> intermediate <b>goods</b> will increase the demand for domestic capital, but also, at least in the short run, add stress to the industry as it decreases the demand for domestic labor and domestic intermediate goods.
