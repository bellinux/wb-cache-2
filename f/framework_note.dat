30|$|We have {{designed}} an extensive simulation testbed {{that can be}} used to validate our model by modeling traffic flow within an environment, tracking the path times of cars to determine the effectiveness of travel decisions. When vehicles make path planning decisions based on reports from other agents, if the accompanying trust modeling has been effective, the vehicles’ completion of travel paths should be timely. The implementation makes use of the following third party software, JiST/SWANS, vans, DUCKS, and Protegen. JiST stands for Java in Simulation Time; it is a high-performance discrete event simulation engine that runs over a standard Java Virtual Machine (JVM). SWANS stands for Scalable Ad-hoc Network Simulator; it is built on top of the JiST platform and serves as a host of network simulation tools. Vans is a project comprising the geographic routing and the integrated Street Random Waypoint model (STRAW). STRAW utilizes an A* search algorithm to calculate shortest path to a destination. It also allows realworld traffic to be simulated by using real maps with vehicular nodes (briefly illustrated in Appendix Appendix D Pictorial depiction of grid-like maps in simulations). DUCKS is a simulation execution framework, which allows for a Simulation Parameters file to be provided to define the simulation. Protege is a free, open source ontology editor and knowledge base <b>framework.</b> <b>Note</b> that the simulation constructed here, while inspired by that employed for the original model of [3], goes far beyond, to enable a rich modelling of traffic scenarios with effective measurement of successful travel.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{complexity}} of some contracts offered by many financial markets has increased a lot. A common but complex financial contract is the Shout option, which grants the allowance to the holder to alter certain features of this contract, according to some specific rules. An example of a Shout option, and the one analysed in this thesis, is the Strike Reset option, which grands the option holder the right to reset the strike of the option a predetermined number of times before maturity. The pricing and hedging of these contacts is much more complex than the simple European options, and for most of them there does not exist a closed form formulae. As a result the valuation of these options is mainly done using multiple layer binomial trees, using Finite Difference methods or using Monte-Carlo techniques. [6] and [5] analyse the Strike Reset Put option on a single underlying asset and consider optimal reset policies using a PDE approach. Moreover [19] uses Finite Difference methods to price Strike Reset Put options with more complex restrictions in the reset features. In this thesis we use Least Squares Regression method, which was introduced by Longstaff and Schwartz, to price the Strike Reset Put option. Moreover we use Pathwise Sensitivities Approach and Likelihood Ratio Method to obtain the Greeks of this Strike Reset option within the Monte Carlo <b>framework.</b> <b>Note</b> that this thesis is an extension of a previous thesis, [20], submitted by Yudaken, where in this thesis we handle the increased complexity due to the multiple strike resets that the holder of the option has. Note that we present all theoretical and numerical results for the specic case of Strike Reset Put option. These results can be very easily extended to similar Strike Reset options, for example the Strike Reset Call option and the Strike Reset Asian Call and Put options. This thesis is structured as follows. In chapter 1, we present a description of the Strike Reset option. Then we extend the Least Squares approach to price the Strike Reset Put option. Moreover we present theoretical results for estimating the sensitivities of this option using Likelihood Ratio Method and Pathwise Sensitivities Approach. In chapter 2, we present numerical results for modelling the Strike Reset Put option. This thesis ends by a conclusion and a suggestion for possible extensions...|$|E

40|$|Component-based {{programming}} {{frameworks for}} industrial control logic development promise to shorten development and modification times, {{and to reduce}} programming errors. To get these benefits, it is, however, important that the components are specified and verified to work properly. This work introduces Reusable Automation Components (RACs), which contain not only the implementation details but also a formal specification defining the correct use and behaviour of the component. This formal specification uses temporal logic to describe time-related properties and has a special structure developed to meet industrial control needs. The RAC can be formally verified, {{to determine whether the}} implementation fulfils the specification or not. A RAC prototype development tool has been developed to demonstrate this capability. The main difference between the RAC and other frameworks for formal verification of control logic is the specification modeling. In RAC, not only the implementation but also the specification is based on the structure and languages of conventional control logic, aiming at being easy to comprehend for control logic engineers. Several industrial examples are discussed in this paper, showing the benefits and potential of the <b>framework.</b> <b>Note</b> to Practitioners-Today robots and machines in automated production are usually controlled by a special industrial computer called Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Although PLC programs are widely used in manufacturing industry, current programs tend to be difficult and time-consuming to modify when needed. They are also often tested to work first on the real equipment, which may be expensive since the regular production is stopped for code testing and error resolving. In this work, we introduce Reusable Automation Components (RACs), to facilitate PLC program development. Reusing components may speed up the development and also reduce the number of errors, if the components are already verified to work properly before the reuse. To achieve this, the RACs can be richly specified, defining the correct use and behaviour of the components. The specification can then be used to verify, formally, whether the RAC works correctly or not, according to the specification. Formal verification uses math-based models and algorithms to automatically explore all possible behaviours of the component. The RAC can be automatically translated to a tool that performs the formal verification and shows counterexamples if the specification is not fulfilled. The specification and verification of RACs are intended to be useful for control logic engineers. Hence, the specification of the RAC is based on the structure and languages of conventional PLC programs. This paper discusses a number of industrial examples which show the applicability of the RACs. The RAC framework can be further improved, especially by developing guidelines and aid for writing the specifications...|$|E

40|$|This Article re-examines the {{concepts}} of Law and New Governance {{with a view to}} pursuing three cumulative objectives. First, it emphasizes that both law and new governance are deeply contested concepts whose meaning and inter-relationship cannot just be assumed or taken for granted, as is the tendency in some empirical studies of their interconnection. Second, it suggests that both concepts be situated and understood within an explicitly normative framework, one that takes account of the different implicit value assumptions underpinning many existing definitions. Thirdly, from this starting point it seeks to sketch a new framework of the relationship between Law and New Governance. This <b>framework</b> <b>notes</b> first, the tendency of Law to give priority to the meta-value of 'social regularity' and of New Governance to give priority to the meta-value of 'social responsiveness'; but it notes also the inevitability of some balanced recognition of each of these overarching values within all species of normative order, including both Law and New Governance...|$|R
