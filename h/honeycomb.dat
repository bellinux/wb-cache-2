5|$|Tessellations {{in three}} or more {{dimensions}} are called honeycombs. In three dimensions there is just one regular <b>honeycomb,</b> which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular <b>honeycomb,</b> which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>honeycomb</b> {{provides}} a well-known example of tessellation in nature with its hexagonal cells.|$|E
5|$|A uniform <b>honeycomb</b> in {{hyperbolic}} {{space is}} a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral cells. In 3-dimensional hyperbolic space {{there are nine}} Coxeter group families of compact convex uniform honeycombs, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams for each family.|$|E

5|$|In 1619 Johannes Kepler made {{an early}} {{documented}} study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his Harmonices Mundi; he was possibly {{the first to}} explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of <b>honeycomb</b> and snowflakes.|$|E

40|$|A <b>honeycombed</b> zone in a {{concrete}} structure is among the forms of defects {{that can be found}} in concrete structures. In this study, the effects on the shear capacity of {{a concrete}} beam are investigated when a <b>honeycombed</b> zone is present in the high shear region. The <b>honeycombed</b> concrete was simulated using an uncompacted no-fines concrete mix. Tests were carried out on rectangular beams with a <b>honeycombed</b> zone introduced at various locations within the high shear region of the beam. The <b>honeycombed</b> zone was square with the size of {{about a third of the}} effective depth of the beam. Two strengths of normal concrete were investigated. The study found that, in a beam with a <b>honeycombed</b> zone, a diagonal crack could form early and the shear capacity of a beam could be reduced. The severity of these effects varies with the location of the <b>honeycombed</b> zone. Modifications were proposed to an existing plastic analysis method to take into account the strength of the <b>honeycombed</b> concrete. Condition factors derived from the test data were also proposed to be applied to the plastic analysis in assessing beams with a <b>honeycombed</b> zone. A <b>honeycombed</b> zone simulating a construction joint in a beam was also investigated analytically and compared with the data from 4 tests...|$|R

5|$|Other natural {{patterns}} {{occur in}} foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such foams present {{a problem in}} how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic <b>honeycomb</b> with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.|$|E
5|$|The Valkyrie was {{designed}} to be a high-altitude Mach3 bomber with six engines. Harrison Storms shaped the aircraft with a canard surface and a delta wing, which was built largely of stainless steel, sandwiched <b>honeycomb</b> panels, and titanium. The XB-70 {{was designed}} to use supersonic technologies developed for the Mach3 Navaho, as well as a modified form of the SM-64 Navaho's all-inertial guidance system.|$|E
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex <b>honeycomb</b> and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E

5|$|Uses {{for regular}} glass fiber include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, {{electrical}} insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It {{is also used}} to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, pole vault poles, arrows, bows and crossbows, translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper <b>honeycomb.</b> It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a <b>honeycomb</b> support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a <b>honeycomb</b> lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
25|$|This set can {{be called}} the regular and semiregular <b>honeycombs.</b> It {{has been called the}} Archimedean <b>honeycombs</b> by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, {{commonly}} called Archimedean solids. Recently Conway has suggested naming the set as the Architectonic tessellations and the dual <b>honeycombs</b> as the Catoptric tessellations.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this letter}} we report {{a class of}} hierarchically architected <b>honeycombs</b> in which {{structural}} hierarchy can be exploited to achieve prominent wave attenuation and load-carrying capabilities. The hierarchically architected <b>honeycombs</b> can exhibit broad and multiple phononic band gaps. The mechanisms responsible for these band gaps depend on the geometric features of the hierarchical <b>honeycombs</b> rather than their composition. Furthermore, the introduction of structural hierarchy also endows the hierarchical <b>honeycombs</b> with enhanced stiffness. We predict that the proposed hierarchical <b>honeycombs</b> can realize a unique combination of wave attenuation and load-carrying capabilities, thereby providing opportunities to design lightweight and stiff phononic crystals for various engineering applications...|$|R

The hummingbird will appear intermittently and will eat the <b>honeycombs</b> {{on the screen}} in a random order, giving additional points to the player; red <b>honeycombs</b> are worth more points than standard <b>honeycombs.</b> While invulnerable to the spray can's shots, the hummingbird will flee temporarily if it is hit too many times. The spray can's shots will also destroy <b>honeycombs</b> and beehives, forcing the player to aim carefully to avoid losing bonus points.|$|R
5|$|Pliny {{correctly}} {{identifies the}} origin of amber as the fossilised resin of pine trees. Evidence cited includes {{the fact that some}} samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers {{to the way in which}} it exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the queen bee and the use of smoke by beekeepers at the hive to collect <b>honeycomb.</b> He praises the song of the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was {{the first}} {{occasion}} on which all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, {{and it became a}} Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters, and unexploded munitions still <b>honeycomb</b> the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.|$|E
5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum <b>honeycomb</b> structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
40|$|Finite Element {{models are}} {{developed}} for the in-plane linear elastic constants {{of a family of}} <b>honeycombs</b> comprising arrays of cylinders connected by ligaments. <b>Honeycombs</b> having cylinders with 3, 4 and 6 ligaments attached to them are considered, with two possible configurations explored for each of the 3 - (trichiral and anti-trichiral) and 4 - (tetrachiral and anti-tetrachiral) connected systems. <b>Honeycombs</b> for each configuration have been manufactured using rapid prototyping and subsequently characterised for mechanical properties through in-plane uniaxial loading to verify the models. An interesting consequence of the family of 'chiral' <b>honeycombs</b> presented here is the ability to produce negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) response.

5|$|In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales. Riesling was {{the most}} planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly {{increased}} in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in The Great Southern (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongorup), Clare Valley, in particular the areas of Watervale and around the Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden regions. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grape. The grapes ripening in free drain soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that as it matures produces toasty, <b>honeycomb</b> and lime aromas and flavors. It is common for Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation of the wine and followed by earlier bottling.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in <b>honeycomb</b> built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E
