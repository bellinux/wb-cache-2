25|$|Gravure {{printing}} is an {{intaglio printing}} technique, where the image being printed {{is made up}} of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade.</b> Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} belt is {{critical}} to the function of the belt press filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a belt press filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths. Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade.</b> Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.|$|E
50|$|Of necessity, the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> must be {{easy and}} quick to replace. On many machines, the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> holder is easily {{removable}} {{from the machine}} and the replacement of a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is done by removing the blade holder from the machine; discarding the old blade; inserting the new blade; and then replacing the blade holder + new blade in the machine.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the unique}} {{attributes}} of LaRC-SI is that when it is exposed to temperatures above its softening point of 250 °C, it cannot be redissolved, yet it maintains its amorphous character and melt processability. As an amorphous thermoplastic, the LaRC-SI can be reformed at elevated temperature and pressures. It can be applied {{in the form of}} a spray, spin, dip coating, paint, or spread with a <b>doctor's</b> <b>blade.</b> The LaRC-SI has excellent adhesive and dielectric properties. It can also be recycled.|$|R

50|$|A Yankee dryer is a {{pressure}} vessel {{used in the}} production of tissue paper. On the Yankee dryer, the paper goes from approximately 42-45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG cylinders or Yankee dryers are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The Yankee cylinder can be equipped with a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby crêping the paper. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade,</b> speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Used <b>doctor</b> <b>blades,</b> from gravure {{and other}} {{printing}} and coating processes, may be inspected using a goniometer, typically {{with a built-in}} light source, to examine the blade edge {{to see whether the}} blade has worn at the desired angle and whether there are signs of wear at other angles. A difference in angle from that set on the machine may indicate excessive pressure, and a range of angles ("rounding") probably indicates a lack of stiffness, or wear, in the blade holder assembly.|$|R

50|$|The ink is {{controlled}} in the flexographic printing process by the inking unit. The inking unit {{can be either}} of fountain roll system or <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system. The fountain roll system is a simple old system yet if {{there is too much}} or too little ink this system would likely control in a poor way. The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> inside the anilox/ceramic roller uses cell geometry and distribution. These blades ensure that the cells are filled with enough ink.|$|E
5000|$|Important process {{variables}} in gravure coating & printing are the rotational position {{at which the}} blade wipes the cylinder; the angle that the blade makes with the tangent to the cylinder at the contact point; and the pressure applied to the blade. [...] Fine adjustment of in-and-out position, independently on left and right, must also be possible, in order to compensate for any misalignment between blade geometry and cylinder axis. These requirements are fulfilled by a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> assembly which includes a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> holder.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. In this thesis, {{two methods}} of {{creating}} multi-layer porous films for DSSCs are examined. They {{have been designed}} as possible alternatives for screen printing in laboratory settings. The same precursor chemicals used for screen printing are employed in both the alternative methods, which are designated multi-layer doctor-blading and stamping. Both alternatives are simple and inexpensive, costing $ 0. 86 and $ 0. 89 per DSSC, respectively. Multi-layer <b>doctor</b> <b>bladed</b> cells {{can be made with}} up to three layers, while stamped cells can be made with up to eight. The cells produced by these two methods are compared to a sample screen printed cell, with mixed results. The multi-layer <b>doctor</b> <b>bladed</b> cells exhibit lower current densities than a screen printed cell, 68. 0 A/m 2 compared to 68. 9 A/m 2. The best performing stamped cell demonstrates a higher current density than the screen printed reference, reaching 82. 7 A/m 2. It also has a slightly higher efficiency. However, the results from the stamped cells are inconsistent. In order for it to truly become an effective method for creating DSSCs in laboratory settings, the source of this variation must be found and standardized...|$|R
50|$|During casting it is {{important}} to cast a perfectly flat surface without streaks, for this different casting mechanisms have been designed to minimize slip streams in the slurry. The blades that flatten and thin the casted surface are called <b>doctor</b> <b>blades.</b> These come in different shapes such as thick or thin flat cutting surfaces, rounded edges and knife blade-shaped edges. For tapes that are cast thinner than 50 micrometer, the coating is not applied from the top, but from the side (slot-die coater) or bottom (lip coater and micro gravure coater).|$|R
50|$|Kadant {{engages in}} mainly four segments: stock {{preparation}} systems, fluid handling systems, roll doctoring, cleaning and filtration, and fiber-based s.Kadant provides custom-engineered systems (e.g. recycling and approach flow systems) and equipment (e.g. virgin pulping process equipment). The company also provides fluid-handling systems (e.g. rotary joints, syphons, turbulator bars, precision unions) {{widely used in}} the dryer section of the papermaking process, {{and the production of}} corrugated boxboard, metals, plastics, rubber, textiles, chemicals, and food. In addition, the company offers doctoring systems (e.g. <b>doctor</b> <b>blades),</b> profiling systems, shower and fabric-conditioning, formation, and water filtration systemsKaden also provides individual components, widely used in pulping, de-inking, screening, cleaning, refining recycled. The company supplies biodegradable absorbent granules from papermaking byproducts for some agriculture uses.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary ink {{metering}} systems {{employ a}} self contained system {{known as a}} chambered <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll. Ink is pumped through a hose(s) to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by end seals and doctor blades.One blade work as a retaining blade, simply holding ink within the chamber. The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.Chambered <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.|$|E
50|$|Sealed ink cup systems {{employ a}} sealed {{container}} which {{acts as the}} ink supply, flood bar and <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> {{all at the same}} time. A ceramic ring with a highly polished working edge provides the seal against the printing plate.|$|E
50|$|Open ink well systems, {{the older}} method of pad {{printing}}, used an ink trough for the ink supply, which was located behind the printing plate. A flood bar pushed {{a pool of}} ink over the plate, and a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> removes the ink from the plate surface, leaving ink on the etched artwork area ready for the pad to pick up.|$|E
40|$|Slot die coaters {{especially}} designed for low material consumption and <b>doctor</b> <b>blades</b> {{were used to}} process small molecule solutions for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Optimum process parameters were developed for the large-scale coating techniques to generate stable single and multiple layers only a few nanometers thick. Achieving a multilayer architecture for solution-processed OLEDs is the most challenging step. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy sputter depth profiling was performed to determine defined interfaces between coated organic layers. Commercially available small molecules NPB (N,N’-Di(1 -naphthyl) -N,N’-diphenyl-(1, 1 ’-biphenyl) - 4, 4 ’-diamine) and BAlq (Bis(8 -hdroxy- 2 methylquinoline) -(4 -phenylphenoxy) aluminum), originally developed for vacuum deposition, were used as hole, respectively electron transport material. Defined double-layers were processed with both scalable coating methods using the orthogonal solvent approach. The use of non-orthogonal solvents resulted in complete intermixing of the material. The results are explained by calculations of solubilities and simulating drying and diffusion kinetics of the small molecule solutions...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} about experimenting and {{developing}} {{uses for the}} new thermal plastic developed by Dr. Robert Bryant called the 'Langley Research Center - Soluble Imide' (LaRC-SI).

50|$|Given that a blade is {{necessary}} to remove the excess ink from a cylinder which is continuously running, the blade/cylinder combination is designed such that it is (chiefly) the blade which wears away, not the cylinder. The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is cheap and disposable and the gravure cylinder or flexo anilox is relatively expensive. Typical materials for the blade are steel or plastic: gravure cylinders are normally hard-chrome plated and aniloxes may be chromed or ceramic.|$|E
50|$|Other {{possible}} deposition {{methods include}} methods utilizing particle self-assembly by solvent evaporation, <b>doctor</b> <b>blade,</b> {{chemical vapor deposition}} and transfer printing. Some of these methods like solvent evaporation are extremely simple but produce low-quality films. Other methods such as the chemical vapor deposition are effective for certain types of particles and substrates but are limited in particle types {{that can be used}} and require heavier instrumentation investments. Also hybrid methods such as combining self-assembly to Langmuir-Blodgett have been used.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{fabricated}} RGO/MWCNTs/NiO composite {{and applied}} it in DSSC as a CE by <b>blade</b> <b>doctor</b> method. High PCE of 8.13  % was achieved in such DSSC, {{which is much}} higher than that of NiO (2.71  %), RGO (6.77  %) and RGO/NiO (7.63  %). Also, {{it was found that the}} RGO/MWCNTs/NiO-CE has less charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte/CE interface and higher catalytic activity for reduction of I 3 − to I−. The improved performances maybe attribute to the enhanced electrode conductivity, the increased effective interfacial area between RGO/MWCNTs/NiO and electrolyte, as well as the contact area between RGO/NiO and other materials by MWCNTs.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{performance}} of {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSC) {{as reported in the}} literature varies even when the materials and/or methods cited are essentially the same. DSC performance even varies significantly within a single lab from researcher to researcher, as has been observed in our lab. To better constrain the sources of the variability and determine which materials and techniques yielded the best DSC performance, various materials and techniques for fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells were evaluated for their effect on DSC performance. Materials investigated included two types of TiO 2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide ® P 25 and a nanoparticle synthesized in our lab) as well as two different electrolytes (Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte and an electrolyte synthesized in our lab). Results in the literature suggest that nanoparticle dispersion during screen printing paste fabrication is important for the dye loading and optical properties of DSCs, so dispersion techniques including mortar grinding, sonication, roller milling, and ball milling were investigated. DSC fabrication and assembly techniques were also suspected to be important. Comparisons were made between <b>doctor</b> <b>bladed</b> and screen printed films, dye loading of the TiO 2 films under ambient pressures and vacuum, and various sealed and unsealed cell testing configurations. Results from the material and assembly technique comparisons showed varying degrees of impact on DSC film quality and performance. Ball milling was found to be an effective method of disaggregating P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles for screen printing pastes, whereas mortar grinding left large TiO 2 clusters and yielded variable cluster size distributions from batch to batch. The presence of TiO 2 clusters increased film cracking, film peeling, and light scattering and consequently reduced DSC performance. Vacuum-assisted dye loading was not found to improve DSC performance. A comparison of gasket-sealed, epoxy-sealed, and unsealed DSCs did not show consistent differences in performance, though unsealed cells showed poor stability over short time periods. Both screen printing and doctor blading of TiO 2 films yielded films of uniform thickness and DSCs of comparable performance. Finally, a lab electrolyte was found to yield DSCs with a higher short circuit current compared to DSCs that used Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte. The electrolyte performance difference is partially due to higher charge transfer resistance at the TiO 2 -electrolyte interface...|$|R
