40|$|Over 50 {{years ago}} Edward Dąbrowski ended few seasons {{excavations}} of the stronghold in Połupin. From {{that time it}} is one of these early medieval sites located in nowadays Lubuskie voivodship, around which quite large literature has grown (see below), {{and at the same time}} much controversy connected especially with stronghold chronology and origin of the famous, bronze, small plate. Verification of Edward Dąbrowski’s conclusions was seriously impeded by the lack of full study and publishing of the sources discovered there. The filling of this gap was therefore the main aim of of this publication. Besides of the old findings analysis, enriched with specialized studies results, in the book we present also the results of studies of the reconstruction of original natural environment of the closest surroundings of the stronghold, as well as the site in Połupin against the broader settlement context. The essential part of this publication were also devoted to the issues connected with the chronology, based on the comparative analysis of the sherds and other artefacts (spurs and beam), and verified by the 14 C dating. The site 2 was discovered in the summer of 1961, during the detailed surface survey conducted by the expedition members, who were excavated the nearby stronghold in Krosno Odrzańskie. This summer from the half of July till the mid of September, Edward Dąbrowski conducted the excavations on the newly discovered site. The research was aimed to answer few questions about function of this feature, its size and chronology. Due to the complete lowering of the rampart constructions, basically it was not assumed that the studied feature might have been the relics of the stronghold. In total, during three seasons, the area of 2, 5 ares in 7 trenches was excavated, recognizing the stratigraphy of cultural layers, mainly in the north-south axis (with circa 10 ° to the east), what was documented on numerous colour outlines. Available documentation from the excavation is complemented by monochrome photographs, especially of the feature outlines. Publishing of this book was possible thanks to the financial support provided by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, within the program of the archaeological artefacts protection, priority 5. Part of presented here results, primarily those concerning 14 C dating, was financed within the grant of the National Center of Science. The stronghold in Połupin, site 2, was built in the Middle Odra River Valley, in th zone of upper edge of the left slope of the valley. Połupin surroundings are very characteristic place in the latitudinal Odra River Valley, which functioned in the late of last Glacial as a part of the Berlin-Warsaw <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>valley.</b> Located here narrowing of the valley, clearly visible in the morphology, in which its broadness is dropping to circa 2 km. The position of defensive settlement allowed to control the situation in the bottom of the valley, which most likely was used as a main communication artery, joining with the northern Lusatia and Brandenburg on the west and Greater Poland and further Masovia on the east. The place for the stronghold location was chosen very carefully. It was built over 40 m over the valley bottom, what assured undisturbed look into the valley and gave opportunity for its continuous monitoring. The stronghold was located between two, well-formed denudative valleys, on the narrow denudative spur, driving between them, taking form of characteristic “tip”. The topography of the stronghold area and the closest surroundings played with certainty substantial role. There were some natural, defensive obstacles in form of steep, in some places even rugged, slopes of denudative spur and slope of the Odra River valley. The specific location of the stronghold in Połupin was affected on the one hand by encountered natural terrain relief characteristic, which in natural way guaranteed the defensive position and on the other hand the surface of the denudative spur was flat, what made easier carrying out all construction works. The geographical environment in the stronghold surroundings was pretty much diverse. What can be assumed, it offered to the early medieval society sufficient climate for farming and in many places also appropriate water conditions, however the living relief of left slope of the Odra River valley most likely excluded carrying out any economic activity on this area. This was only possible on the nearby bottom of the Odra River valley. There were some good natural conditions for creating meadow lands and grazing, for carrying out breeding, pastoralism and inland fishery. Good communication between the lands of economic activity in the bottom of valley and the place of people’s living on the denudative spur was provided by not strongly inclined numerous denudative valleys. Due to the modest slopes of the bottoms of denudative valleys it was easy to reach between the Odra River valley and adjacent hill (wysoczyzna). Thanks to small slopes of the bottoms of denudative valleys it was possible to access between Odra River valley and adjacent hills. Considering poor sandy-gravel ground and developed from them soils of low class of fertility and in order of lack of permanent, surface water, hill (wysoczyzna) fluvioglacial hill near the Odra River valley was most likely not very attractive area for the early medieval society. In order to reconstruct natural, basic environment a palynological analysis were carried out. A core of mineral and organic sediments was drilled from an oxbow in Odra valley. Samples for pollen analysis were taken every 4 or 2 cm in the upper part of the core. Pollen diagram reveals changes in regional and local plant communities during the last 3000 years BP. Mixed pine-oak forest and deciduous forests with Querus, Carpinus betulus, Ulmus and Corylus avellana were the main types of regional ecosystems. On local habitats expansive areas of Alnus communities were found. There were only some open plants communities. Three phases of human activity were found. The first took place in the Bronze Age, the second one during the Roman Period. The last phase is related to the early middle ages when an embankment existed nearby to the research site. The landscape changed significantly. Clear deforestation is observed and first of all Alnus forest diminished. The area was occupied by anthropogenic ecosystems instead. A lot of open plant communities appeared. Presence of many herbs like Rumex or Plantago lanceolata indicates significance of meadows and pastures. Cultivation of cereals and other crops was not so important. Proportions and quantity of appearance of particular groups of indicators in relation to presence and human activity suggest that economic of society from Połupin was mostly based on breeding and cultivations was rather a supplement ensuring dietary enrichment. Zooarchaeological analysis shown that animal breeding had crucial impact on overall economic of inhabitants of the stronghold in Połupin. The excavations carried out in Połupin had provided crucial information about the development of the area surrounded by the rampart. Due to the incomplete preserved documentation, it was not possible to precisely situate the location of some features, however it did not prevent to distinguish few characteristic elements of development, both residential, economic and defensive. Residential part of the stronghold was most likely located along the inner part of the walls, i. e. in the safest place in the stronghold, in so called blind spot of fire. The courtyard, besides few, most likely, residential features (pits 1 and 2), was occupied by the features of processing function (probably birch-tar pit and smoke pit) and by the close undefined constructions, from which only post holes remained. Basing on the NMT analysis one can propose a hypothesis that the stronghold was surrounded from the west, south and east by horseshoe-like rampart, and from the north, i. e. Odra River valley, another kind of defensive system functioned, in form of stone enforced terraces incised in the strongly steep slope. However to verify this hypothesis further excavations are required. Post deposit processes caused almost complete destruction of the relics of walls. Their remains were traceable only in the south-western and south-eastern part of the stronghold, although we cannot say much about its construction. This remark concerns also construction techniques used in building of the elements of the courtyard development. The choice of location place of the stronghold was based on the defensive characters offered by the nature. The place where it was build was limited from the west and east by deep denudative valleys, which besides defensive feature, could have been also used as a communication routes between stronghold and used for economic activities, the Odra River valley. The northern foreground, besides hypothetical, artificial terraces system, was limited by wet river valley. Significant reason for which one decided to elaborate archive finds from the stronghold in Połupin was the need for verification the chronology of the fortress and discovered there artefacts. The most numerous category of sources are fragment of vessels. Basing on the macroscopic analysis (study of style, form and technology of manufacture) and using specialist investigations we believe that that ceramic discovered in Połupin represents two pottery styles. First, traditional one, corresponds to the older phases of the Middle Ages. These include: small range of coating, lack of decoration, poor profile and appearance of mainly undeveloped rims. Second, progressive stream, are the vessels perfectly, technologically produced, manufactured from especially prepared mass of clay, based on selected, fine-grained temper. This course is represented by vessels of mainly stocky, vase-like forms. Their characteristic feature is decoration in form of plastic rollers (from one to few), placed under the rim. Their origin can be traced primarily in Merovingian pottery workshops, which had produced, mainly in the 7 th century, the so called Knickwandtőpfe. Using the data concerned of vessels style and technique of manufacture, which were gathered during the study of numerous collections of pottery from the Middle Odra River Area, we can try to establish chronological position of discovered assemblage of vessels. The analysis indicates quite high percentage of coated vessels (circa 65...|$|E

The database includes about 1600 sites from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, NW Russia, Poland, Sweden {{and was used}} to create a GIS-based palaeogeographical reconstructions {{on the development of the}} Baltic Ice Lake (BIL). The formation of thehighest shoreline of the BIL in Estonia was connected with the development of the Pandivere <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> zone (Estonia) and the lowest with the Salpausselkä ice-marginal formations (Finland).

40|$|The {{limit of}} active ice, {{accurate}} to within 49 m, is extracted from SAR {{imagery of the}} Barnes Ice Cap, using a sequence of image speckle filtering, image texture analysis, supervised image classification, image segmentation and edge detection. Overall classification accuracies of the <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> environment are between 42 and 53 %. Despite misclassification of some proglacial landforms {{it is possible to}} detect the limit of active ice as these surfaces are separated from the ice cap by supraglacial debris cover, an elevated ice cored debris ridge and perennial snowbeds. [...] Comparisons of opposing look angles reveal that 'downglacier' illumination produces the highest classification accuracies of <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> features and debris covered ice surfaces, whereas illumination from an off-ice perspective, looking 'upglacier', is found to produce higher classification accuracies for proglacial surfaces. Comparisons of standard and fine mode imagery conclude that 25 m spatial resolution yields higher classification accuracies than 8 m spatial resolution. Quantitative analysis of surface roughness demonstrates that the dominant grain size of surficial materials is the best method for relating surface cover to radar brightness. [...] Second order texture measures mean, homogeneity and correlation are found to be effective variables for maximum likelihood classification of <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> SAR imagery.

40|$|High {{resolution}} seismic {{data from}} the Dogger Bank in the central southern North Sea has revealed that the Dogger Bank Formation records a complex history of sedimentation and penecontemporaneous, large-scale, ice-marginal to proglacial glacitectonic deformation. These processes {{led to the development}} of a large thrust-block moraine complex which is buried beneath a thin sequence of Holocene sediments. This buried glacitectonic landsystem comprises a series of elongate, arcuate moraine ridges (200 m up to > 15 km across; over 40 – 50 km long) separated by low-lying <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> to proglacial sedimentary basins and/or meltwater channels, preserving the shape of the margin of this former ice sheet. The moraines are composed of highly deformed (folded and thrust) Dogger Bank Formation with the lower boundary of the deformed sequence (up to 40 – 50 m thick) being marked by a laterally extensive décollement. The ice-distal parts of the thrust moraine complex are interpreted as a “forward” propagating imbricate thrust stack developed in response to S/SE-directed ice-push. The more complex folding and thrusting within the more ice-proximal parts of the thrust-block moraines record the accretion of thrust slices of highly deformed sediment as the ice repeatedly reoccupied this <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> position. Consequently, the internal structure of the Dogger Bank thrust-moraine complexes can be directly related to ice sheet dynamics, recording the former positions of a highly dynamic, oscillating Weichselian ice sheet margin as it retreated northwards at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum...|$|R

40|$|The Late Wisconsinan {{advance of}} the Laurentide Ice Sheet started from a Middle Wisconsinan interstadial minimum 27 – 30 14 C ka BP when the ice margin {{approximately}} followed the boundary of the Canadian Shield. Ice extent in the Cordillera and in the High Arctic {{at that time was}} probably similar to present. Ice advanced to its Late Wisconsinan (stage 2) limit in the northwest, south, and northeast about 23 – 24 14 C ka BP and in the southwest and far north about 20 – 21 14 C ka BP. In comparison to some previous reconstructions of ice extent, our current reconstruction has substantially more Late Wisconsinan ice in the High Arctic, where an Innuitian Ice Sheet is generally acknowledged to have existed, in the Atlantic Provinces, where ice is now thought to have extended to the Continental Shelf edge in most places, and on eastern Baffin Island, where ice probably extended to the fiord mouths rather than to the fiord heads. Around most of the ice margin, the Late Wisconsinan maximum ice extent either exceeded the extent of earlier Wisconsinan advances or it was similar to the Early Wisconsinan advance. <b>Ice</b> <b>marginal</b> recession prior to 14 14 C ka BP occurred mainly in deep water and along the southern terrestrial fringe.

50|$|A lake (lacustrine) terrace {{represents}} the former shoreline of either a nonglacial, glacial, or proglacial lake.

Given the smaller size of lakes relative to the size of typical marine water bodies, lake terraces are overall significantly narrower and less well developed than marine terraces. However, not all lake terraces are relict shorelines. In case of the lake terraces of ancient ice-walled lakes, some proglacial lakes, and alluvium-dammed (slackwater) lakes, they often represent the relict bottom of these lakes.

Here, we use wind, wave, turbulence, and ice measurements to evaluate {{the response of the}} ocean surface to a given wind stress within the <b>marginal</b> <b>ice</b> zone, with a focus on the local wind input to waves and subsequent ocean surface turbulence. Observations are from the Beaufort Sea in the summer and early fall of 2014, with fractional ice cover of up to 50 %. Observations showed strong damping and scattering of short waves, which, in turn, decreased the wind energy input to waves. Near-surface turbulent dissipation rates were also greatly reduced in partial ice cover. The reductions in waves and turbulence were balanced, suggesting that a wind-wave equilibrium is maintained in the <b>marginal</b> <b>ice</b> zone, though at levels much less than in open water. These results suggest that air-sea interactions are suppressed in the <b>marginal</b> <b>ice</b> zone relative to open ocean conditions at a given wind forcing, and this suppression may act as a feedback mechanism in expanding a persistent <b>marginal</b> <b>ice</b> zone throughout the Arctic...|$|R

Five main morphological groups have been analysed: (a) Volcanic or diapiric submarine hills; (b) Tectonic features on the continental slope (linear scarps and a rhombohedral depression) related to normal faults; (c) Submarine venting at top of diapirs initially triggered circular depressions; (d) Sedimentary instabilities (gullies, canyons, mass transport deposits) are present specially on the Fuerteventura-Lanzarote ridge; and (e) Contouritic bottom features both erosive (central <b>valley,</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>valleys)</b> and depositional (plastered drifts) are on {{the central part of}} the passage, and are generated by the interaction of MW and the interface MW-AAIW with seafloor.

40|$|Turbidity mapping and {{prediction}} using {{remote sensing}} has had limited {{success in the}} past. Previous research efforts have been conducted in temperate and even tropical climates where too many confounding factors affect the remote sensing signal. My research {{is focused on the}} development of an accurate and repeatable algorithm to predict turbidity in northern, glacial lakes using electro-optical satellite data. From an evolutionary perspective glacial environments are highly immature. Lakes found in these environments are typically classified as extremely oligotrophic resulting from their relatively recent formation and the surrounding harsh, northern climate. Unlike temperate or tropical lakes, northern glacial lakes do not contain significant amounts of biological material. Instead, these lakes are dominated by rock flour – suspended sediment originating from glacial rock weathering. This lack of biological influence makes satellite turbidity mapping and prediction more straightforward and potentially more accurate than similar efforts in temperate or tropical environments where biology typically drives these systems and strongly affects the remotely-sensed, electro-optical signal. The study site for my research was an <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> lake at the Bering Glacier located in coastal, south central Alaska. In situ turbidity data, collected using an autonomous robot buoy, was used to develop a model-based turbidity algorithm. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted using different Landsat 7 ETM+ bands to determine the best predictor(s) of turbidity in glacial lakes. The final algorithm utilized Landsat 7 ETM+ Band 3 (red portion of the electromagnetic spectrum) and Band 4 (near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum) data to predict turbidity concentrations. Turbidity maps created using the algorithm can be used to help determine inter- and intra-annual sediment dynamics of Vitus Lake. This information could be used to help researchers predict significant glacial events such as outburst floods or surge events. The turbidity maps could also provide insight into the hydrologic routing of the Bering Glacier system by showing where the Glacier is discharging sediment-laden freshwater into Vitus Lake through subsurface conduits. The turbidity algorithm also has broader applicability to other glacial lakes in south central Alaska and potentially glacial lakes worldwide.

40|$|Active {{and passive}} {{microwave}} and physical properties of Arctic sea <b>ice</b> in the <b>marginal</b> <b>ice</b> zone were measured during the summer. Results of an intercomparison of data acquired by an aircraft synthetic aperture radar, a passive microwave imager and a helicopter-mounted scatterometer indicate that early-to-mid summer sea ice microwave signatures {{are dominated by}} snowpack characteristics. Measurements show that the greatest contrast between thin first-year and multiyear sea ice occurs when operating actively between 5 and 10 GHz. Significant information {{about the state of}} melt of snow and ice is contained in the active and passive microwave signatures...|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} {{interpret}} {{the results of a}} series of tracer experiments conducted on an Alpine glacier over a diurnal discharge cycle. For these injections, a moulin was used into which an <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> lake was draining, providing a relatively constant discharge. Measured tracer transit speeds show two diurnal maxima and minima. These findings are qualitatively different from existing observations from two series of injections at another site using a moulin fed by supraglacial meltwater with a high diurnal variability, which displayed one diurnal maximum and minimum. We use a simple two-component model of the glacier drainage system, comprising a moulin and a channel element, to simulate the measured transit speeds for all three injection series. The model successfully reproduces all the observations and shows that the same underlying processes can produce the qualitatively different behaviour depending on the different moulin input discharge regimes. Using the model, we asses the relative importance of the different measurement parameters, show that frequent measurements of moulin input discharge are indispensable and propose an experiment design to monitor the development of the drainage system over several weeks...|$|R
40|$|Skyggestein is {{a gravel}} pit on the <b>ice</b> <b>marginal</b> deposit Geiteryggen in Skien municipality, Telemark County. The deposit {{belongs to the}} Ås-Ski sub stage and was {{deposited}} about 11 400 years ago. The deposit was built up to the marine limit at Skyggestein and a small remnant of the delta flat is still visible in the area. Distally several shore lines is visible and gullies are found in marine deposits on both sides. Geiteryggen is included in regional overviews of areas of Quaternary geological natural values. Five defined areas have been given priority and suggested for protection. The planned extension impacts one of these areas. The natural values of the area are described as regional to national and the values impacted by the plans are defined as medium to large. The plans will let parts of the delta flat remnants and distal shorelines intact and the impact is therefore described as medium to small negative impacts. Possible mitigation is linked to small adjustments in the plan and {{to the process of}} securing the delta flat remnant that borders the existing gravel pit...|$|R
