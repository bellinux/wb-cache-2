5|$|The Pact of Olivos {{diminished the}} electoral {{strength}} of the UCR, leading {{to the rise of}} the Frepaso. Both parties united in a political coalition, the Alliance, which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections. It was the PJ's first national defeat since 1985. The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections. De la Rúa stood for the UCR; the whole party, including Alfonsín, supported him. The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide, who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province. De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin. In the primaries, De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995. Despite his victory, Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR. They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa's ticket; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him. Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez, leader of the Frepaso, saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise. It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance: except for Meijide, the Frepaso did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> figure who may run with good chances for governor of the Buenos Aires province. Had she run for vicepresident, Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate.|$|E

25|$|If the {{majority}} of Puerto Ricans were to choose the Free Association option - and only 33% voted for it in 2012 - {{and if it were}} granted by the US Congress, Puerto Rico would become a Free Associated State, a virtually independent nation. It would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> and economical treaty of association with the U.S. that would stipulate all delegated agreements.

25|$|While {{up until}} the end of the Parthian period in the 3rd century CE, the idea of “Irān“ had an ethnic, linguistic, and {{religious}} value, it did not yet <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> import. The idea of an “Iranian“ empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely Sasanian one. It was the result of a convergence of interests between the new dynasty and the Zoroastrian clergy, as we can deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to the idea of an Ērān-šahr “Kingdom of the Iranians,” which was “ēr“ (Middle Persian equivalent of Old Persian “ariya“ and Avestan “airya“).|$|E

25|$|When the {{exchange}} is immediate, as in barter, {{it does not}} create a social relationship. When {{the exchange}} is delayed, it creates both a relationship {{as well as an}} obligation for a return (i.e. debt). Hence, some forms of reciprocity can establish hierarchy if the debt is not repaid. The failure to make a return may end a relationship between equals. Reciprocal exchanges can also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> effect through the creation of multiple obligations and the establishment of leadership, as in the gift exchanges (Moka) between Big Men in Melanesia. Some forms of reciprocity are thus closely related to redistribution, where goods and services are collected by a central figure for eventual distribution to followers.|$|E
25|$|Iceland was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> party formed and led entirely by women. Known as the Women's List or Women's Alliance (Kvennalistinn), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women. After {{participating}} in its first parliamentary elections, the Women's List helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15%. Although it disbanded in 1999, merging with the Social Democratic Alliance, it left a lasting influence on Iceland's politics: every major party has a 40% quota for women, and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female, compared to the global average of 16%. Following the 2016 elections, 48% of members of parliament are female.|$|E

25|$|In mid-2013 police across China {{announced}} the arrests {{of hundreds of}} people accused of spreading false rumors online. Chinese authorities have said the crackdown is directed at abuses such as fraud, fakery, and slander. But the accusations against many of the arrested microbloggers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> edge {{with many of the}} rumors called outrageously false by the government dealing with the sins of officials: corruption, venality, and sexual escapades. The suspicion is that the crackdown is intended to break up online networks of like-minded people whose ideas could challenge the Communist Party. Some of China's most popular microbloggers have been arrested. In September 2013 China’s highest court and prosecution office issued guidelines that define and outline penalties for publishing online rumors and slander. The rules give some protection to citizens who accuse officials of corruption, but they say that a slanderous message forwarded more than 500 times or read more than 5,000 times could result in up to three years in prison.|$|E

500|$|A broad issue {{affecting}} the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, {{what part of}} the world and man is studied by science.

Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.|$|E

500|$|Colbert's {{performance}} {{received a}} variety of reactions from the media. In Washington, the response from both politicians and the press corps was negative—both groups having been targets of Colbert's satire. The Washington press corps felt that Colbert had bombed. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen found that Colbert's jokes were [...] "lame and insulting" [...] and wrote that Colbert was [...] "rude" [...] and a [...] "bully". Politician Steny Hoyer felt that Colbert had gone too far, telling the newspaper The Hill that [...] " [...] is the President of the United States, and he deserves some respect". Conservative pundit Mary Matalin called Colbert's performance a [...] "predictable, Bush-bashing kind of humor". Columnist Ana Marie Cox chastised those who praised Colbert as a hero: [...] "I somehow doubt that Bush has never heard these criticisms before". She added, [...] "Comedy can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> point {{but it is not}} political action".|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love... Drugs were first coming to public notice. The Stones were busted, and there was that famous leader in The Times. And, you know, {{what are we talking about}} now all the time? Drugs. It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not something he did in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it to not just be a crime story but to also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> background. I was also determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E

500|$|Under Stewart and Karlin The Daily Show {{developed}} a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political {{focus to the}} humor than the show previously exhibited. Then-correspondent Stephen Colbert recalls that Stewart specifically asked him to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy. Colbert says that whereas under Kilborn {{the focus was on}} [...] "human interest-y" [...] pieces, with Stewart as host the show's content became more [...] "issues and news driven", particularly after the beginning of the 2000 election campaign with which the show dealt in its [...] "" [...] coverage. Stewart himself describes the show's coverage of the 2000 election recount as {{the point at which the}} show found its editorial voice. [...] "That's when I think we tapped into the emotional angle of the news for us and found our editorial footing," [...] he says. Following the September 11th attacks, The Daily Show went off the air for nine days.

500|$|By 1928, I. C. Filitti's {{writing was}} moving from sheer {{historical}} research, {{as he was}} taking a stand in political theory. As noted by Ioan Stanomir, Filitti's evolution in this direction marks a final cycle in the history of classical, [...] "Burkean", conservatism in Romania, which did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> aspect, but was complementary and contemporary with the views of his rival Nicolae Iorga. According to Stanomir, the objectivity professed by Filitti the historiographer was at odds with his ambition to rehabilitate Junimea and the Conservative cause, to prolong their relevancy into the 1930s. Some of his core ideas were updated versions of 19th-century Junimist concepts: the praise of moderation and organicity, the rejection of state capitalism and its [...] "pseudo-bourgeoisie", and in particular the critique of generous land reforms. Directly influenced by the agrarian skepticism of Carp and Maiorescu, Filitti argued that the division of large estates into non-lucrative plots had only enhanced endemic problems, such as poverty or an unskilled workforce, and had prevented an organic growth toward good governance. Filitti's diary chides the political establishment of Greater Romania for not obtaining sufficient guarantees of territorial integrity—particularly so against Russia's successor, the Soviet Union—and for deprofessionalizing the diplomatic corps.|$|E
500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|E
