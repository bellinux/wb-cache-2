40|$|Abstract—In a {{best-effort}} publish/subscribe network, publica-tions may {{be delivered}} {{out of order}} (e. g., violating FIFO order). We contend that {{the primary cause of}} such ordering violations is the parallel matching and forwarding process employed by brokers to achieve high throughput. In this paper, we present an end-to-end method to improve event ordering. The method involves the receiver and minimally the sender, but otherwise uses the broker network as a black box. The idea is to analyze the dynamics of the network, and in particular to measure the delivery delay and its variation, which is directly related to out-of-order delivery. With these measures, receivers can determine a near-optimal latch time to <b>defer</b> <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> upon the detection of a hole in the message sequence number. We evaluate the performance of this ordering scheme empirically in terms of the reduction in out-of-order deliveries, the delay imposed by the latch time, and its automatic adaptability to variable network conditions and input loads.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{work has}} {{addressed}} {{the existence of}} link burstiness {{and its effect on}} wireless communication as a local phenomenon. To achieve better end-to-end delay performance in a mission-critical application of wireless sensor networks, such as the infrastructure surveillance system, the routing faces three issues: whether this link burstiness has any mutual impact with other delay factors (such as the local minima and the cycle waiting time) to <b>defer</b> the <b>message</b> <b>delivery,</b> whether a transmission that failed because of the link burstiness is worthy to retry compared with other possible paths in terms of the end-to-end delay performance, how the number of retransmission is determined so that the delay cost can be calculated for the use of an alternative path. In this paper, we provide a fully distributed solution with a new measurement. First, each node prepares a 4 -tuple matric for any path passing through. The larger the value is, the faster the routing will be to reach the nearest destination sink. Then, our routing uses this reference information to select a relatively better successor candidate for each 1 -hop advance. Even though many unexpected changes of link quality or node availability occur in the networks, our routing is still effective and can approach the destination in a local greedy manner. As a result, the cost and the impact of inconsistency in the existing information models can be mitigated to the minimum. Our analytical and experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach in reducing the end-to-end delay...|$|R

30|$|From the {{simulation}} results, {{all of the}} algorithms show that the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate is improving along with the corresponding {{increase in the number}} of nodes in the network. With the number of nodes in the network up to a certain number, the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate is no longer to grow along with the increase of the number of nodes. For Epidemic, its <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate is the highest initially and the growth rate of its <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate is largest along with the {{increase in the number of}} nodes. But if the number of nodes reaches up to 60, the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate begins to fall. For several other routing protocols, along with the growth in the number of nodes, its <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate continues to increase. When the number of nodes is up to the peak, the rate is unchanged basically. The DTSNS algorithm proposed in this paper compared with Epidemic algorithm has lower <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate at the beginning process. But, the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate of DTSNS algorithm has larger rate when the number of nodes reaches up to 80. It indicates that DTSNS algorithm is suitable for large-scale wireless sensor network. DTSNS algorithm compared with other two algorithms has a higher <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> rate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many {{smart grid}} {{communications}} are delay sensitive and have very strict timing requirements for <b>message</b> <b>deliveries.</b> For example, trip protection messages must {{be delivered to}} the destination within 3 ms according to IEC 61850. Such time-critical communications are vulnerable to flooding attacks which attempt to increase <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delay through congesting the network channel and exhausting the computation resources of the communicating nodes. However, {{there is a lack}} of understanding on how much flooding attacks affect <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delays. In this paper, we conduct experimental studies to investigate how flooding attacks affect <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delays for time-critical communications in smart grid. Our experiments are based on both wireless networks in a lab and wired networks in a real, industry-standard electric power facility. Experimental results show that even low-rate flooding attacks can significantly increase the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delays, especially when wireless networks are used. I...|$|R
40|$|Multicopy routing {{strategies}} {{have been considered}} the most applicable approaches to achieve <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). Epidemic routing and two-hop forwarding routing are two well-reported approaches for delay tolerant networks routing which allow multiple message replicas to be launched {{in order to increase}} <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio and/or reduce <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delay. This advantage, nonetheless, is at the expense of additional buffer space and bandwidth overhead. Thus, to achieve efficient utilization of network resources, it is important {{to come up with an}} effective message scheduling strategy to determine which messages should be forwarded and which should be dropped in case of buffer is full. This paper investigates a new message scheduling framework for epidemic and two-hop forwarding routing in DTNs, such that the forwarding/dropping decision can be made at a node during each contact for either optimal <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio or <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delay. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed message scheduling framework can achieve better performance than its counterparts...|$|R
40|$|Group {{communication}} (or multicast) is {{a powerful}} abstraction {{that can be used}} whenever groups of distributed processes cooperate for the execution of a given task. Due to the uncertainties inherent to distributed systems (emerging from communication or process failures), multicast messages may arrive in an inconsistent order at different destination processes. Further complications will arise when groups overlap (i. e. a process is allowed to belong to distinct groups). In this paper, we address the problem of causal order violation in <b>message</b> <b>delivery.</b> We present three causal order protocols for overlapping groups with different trade-offs between message space overhead and <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delays. The first protocol favours message space overhead (small one) with a longer <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delay. The second protocol favours <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delay but with a larger message space overhead. The third protocol is a compromise solution between <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> delay and <b>message</b> space overhead, comparing favourably with respect to existing solutions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> {{capacity}} problem in delay-constrained mobile sensor networks. The <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> capacity specifies the maximum percentage of sensing messages {{that can be}} successfully delivered to sink nodes within a given time constraint. This captures the overall system capacity in terms of successful sensing <b>message</b> <b>delivery.</b> By taking full advantage of sensor mobility and rendezvous during senor node encounters, messages can be delivered to a sink node either directly or through relays by other sensor nodes. In this paper, for the first time, we present the delay-constrained <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> capacity formulation in mobile sensor networks. The objective is to maximize the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> capacity subject to the delay and buffering constraints. We first identify a number of unique challenges involved in such systems including message relay and buffer replacement mechanisms, and we derive the capacity bound under perfect message relay and buffer replacement mechanisms. Due to an unrealistic assumption about the foreknowledge of sensor moving trajectories, we next proceed to propose a practical algorithm to approximate the maximal <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> capacity based on current global network knowledge. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm is proposed to reduce the control overhead for information exchange. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms and examine their sensitivity with respect to delay constraints, buffer size and message relay, and replacement schemes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of a {{practical}} experience on the evaluation of two message-passing middleware platforms for developing distributed applications, i. e. the ACE/TAO Real Time Event Channel (RTEC) and the Maestro/Ensemble group communication toolkit (M/E). In particular, we compare their functionalities and their performances in a simple yet meaningful deployment configuration. The functional comparison points out the different characteristics of the two systems. In particular, M/E simplifies the coding of applications with strong requirements in terms of group membership tracking and ordered <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> guarantees, while RTEC provides users with unreliable <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> between loosely coupled processes. The performance comparison shows that, under stressing conditions, M/E sacrifices throughput stability for enforcing reliable and ordered <b>message</b> <b>delivery,</b> while RTEC offers a more stable throughput of unordered <b>messages</b> sacrificing <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> reliability under heavy load.

40|$|Abstract—A complex {{wireless}} deployment under realistic sce-nario {{is prone}} to failures and it becomes very hard to de-termine when to stop retransmitting a message {{in order to ensure}} proper delivery. In this paper, a simple effective link-attribute estimator is proposed that is capable of identifying the quality of communication between neighboring mobile devices while maintaining the scalability. By relying on our link-quality estimator, a maximum number of attempts is computed which (probabilistically) ensures the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> while maintaining energy-efficiency. Through appropriate adjustments, our esti-mator is capable of obtaining the bounds on the number of retransmission attempts required to increase the <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio. This enables wireless devices to establish a threshold on the number of transmission attempts, thereby avoiding those retransmissions that would only result in wasted energy. Such dynamic threshold helps enforce at least a minimum number of transmission. Simulations prove the effectiveness of our LQ estimator with respect to energy efficiency and <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> reliability. Results indicate that an acceptable <b>message</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio can be maintained while increasing the overall energy efficiency. Index Terms—Energy Efficiency, Link Quality, Reliability.
