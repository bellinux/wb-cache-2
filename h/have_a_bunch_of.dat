500|$|Christ Illusion was {{recorded}} via computer between two studios: NRG Studios, North Hollywood, with assistant engineer Dave Colvin; and Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, where Brian Warwick assisted. [...] Guitarist Kerry King recalls {{nine of the}} eleven songs originally slated for Christ Illusion were demoed in 2004, with Dave Lombardo at the drum kit. However, Lombardo recalls recording with King {{as far back as}} early 2003, when two demos were completed at Lombardo's home. In a July 2004 interview, guitarist Jeff Hanneman reported [...] "Me and Kerry <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> songs," [...] and expressed the band's intent to finish the record that year. Slayer's label American Recordings was at the time negotiating a switch of record distributors from Columbia Records to Warner Bros. Records, meaning the recording would have been temporarily shelved until the issue became resolved. For this reason the group did not finish a record at that time, as the distribution deal with Warner Records was [...] not finalized until late July 2005.|$|E

Angel. Music. Baby.'. And two months ago, Pharrell called me up, he was like, 'Come down to Miami and write some more songs!' And I'm like, 'OK!' I went down there and wrote four songs and played three of them tonight. They're really fresh". In September 2006, during the Fashion Week, MTV News interviewed Swizz Beatz and he said to be working with Stefani as well, claiming: [...] "She's always taking it to the next level. I love her background for music. She likes a lot of Caribbean sounds with hard beats". They worked on [...] "Now That You Got It", which was selected to be the fourth single from The Sweet Escape (2006). For the single version, Stefani enlisted Damian Marley, son of Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley, giving the single a [...] "reggae" [...] feel to it. It was released to mainstream radio in the United States, on August 26, 2007, while in the United Kingdom, it was released on October 15, 2007. Two remixes were included on the CD single, both featuring Marley.

2500|$|The group chose Calliope Studios {{as their}} primary studio, as it was renown to promote artistic freedom. Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah and Prince Paul with De La Soul and Stetsasonic, were all {{recording}} new music in separate rooms while A Tribe Called Quest recorded People’s Instinctive Travels. Q-Tip later commented [...] "It was exciting. We were kinda left to our own devices. It was just a great environment, conductive for creating.

2500|$|The {{recording}} of The Love Below began at André 3000's Los Angeles home, using Pro Tools software, {{in addition to}} a drum machine, keyboards and various synthesizers. He enjoyed the atmosphere of recording at home instead of a studio, saying to XXL, [...] "it didn't start in the studio because if you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> people around, they're coming from the party and I'm in there singing falsetto... those vibes didn't match." [...] His initial sessions were hampered by his inexperience with Pro Tools and, unaware how to edit his recordings, he opted to record songs such as [...] "Pink & Blue" [...] in their entirety. Other gear used included an Avalon VT737 SP and AD2055 EQ and AD2044 compressors for his vocals. After creating five songs, he informed Big Boi of the solo project he had been working on.|$|E

It's been more than two years now, and I got more ideas and I have done albums with Mikey and have done them without him. It's time to get another record out. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> songs written in my head. I wanted to have time to mourn before people start asking me about touring dates. It was sick.

2500|$|Throughout their career, Die Ärzte {{have often}} been {{compared}} to fellow German punk band Die Toten Hosen; a comparison that has often been stylized as a rivalry by the media despite both bands never having an official feud. The comparisons are mostly drawn because of a similar origin as both bands were pioneers of the German punk rock scene and started {{around the same time}} in the early 1980s, in both cases evolving from earlier locally famous punk bands (Die Ärzte from Soilent Grün and Die Toten Hosen from ZK). Furthermore, both bands are heavily linked to their cities of origin: Die Ärzte from Berlin and Die Toten Hosen from Düsseldorf. While Die Ärzte are known as the first famous Fun Punk band of Germany, Die Toten Hosen also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> humorous songs, mostly about alcoholism. Both bands enjoyed a similar curve of success (with the most notable difference being the 5-year hiatus of Die Ärzte). Due to all these similarities multiple media outlets in Germany tried to establish a Beatles/Stones-style rivalry between both bands even though both bands are amicable towards each other if not poking fun at said [...] "rivalry". Adopting aliases Die Ärzte and Die Toten Hosen have played small club shows together in the past. In 2012 Die Toten Hosen even covered Die Ärzte's Schrei nach Liebe on the bonus disc for their album Ballast der Republik. The same year, they covered the song while headlining Germany's biggest rock festival Rock am Ring. Poking fun at the two bands sometimes being confused, Die Toten Hosen frontman Campino said that [...] "maybe the people just want to hear a good song this time".|$|E

Looking down the Hades of the lemon-house, the many ruddy-clustered oranges beside the path {{remind me of the}} lights of a village along the lake at night, while the pale lemons above are the stars. There is a subtle, {{exquisite}} scent of lemon flowers. Then I notice a citron. He hangs heavy and bloated upon so small a tree, that he seems a dark green enormity. There is a great host of lemons overhead, half-visible, a swarm of ruddy oranges by the paths, and here and there a fat citron. It is almost like being under the sea.|$|E

And the more she looked, the more she LONGED to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> the blossoms she saw, the more fascinated she became with her little vision of ceremony, and the more consumedly shy and self-conscious she grew, till she was almost beside herself. She could not get the idea out of her mind. It was as if some haunting challenge prompted her, and she had not enough courage to take it up. So again she drifted into the green-houses, looking at the lovely roses in their pots, and at the virginal cyclamens, and at the mystic white clusters of a creeper. The beauty, oh the beauty of them, and oh the paradisal bliss, if she should have a perfect bouquet and could give it to Gudrun the next day. Her passion and her complete indecision almost made her ill.|$|E
6000|$|... § XI. The form of {{the common}} {{buttress}} must be familiar to the eye of every reader, sloping if low, and thrown into successive steps {{if they are to}} be carried to any considerable height. There is much dignity in them when they are of essential service; but even in their best examples, their awkward angles are among the least manageable features of the Northern Gothic, and the whole organisation of its system was destroyed by their unnecessary and lavish application on a diminished scale; until the buttress became actually confused with the shaft, and we find strangely crystallised masses of diminutive buttress applied, for merely vertical support, in the northern tabernacle work; while in some recent copies of it the principle has been so far distorted that the tiny buttressings look as if they carried the superstructure on the points of their pinnacles, as in the Cranmer memorial at Oxford. Indeed, in most modern Gothic, the architects evidently consider buttresses as convenient breaks of blank surface, and general apologies for deadness of wall. They stand in the place of ideas, and I think are supposed also to have something of the odor of sanctity about them; otherwise, one hardly sees why a warehouse seventy feet high should have nothing of the kind, and a chapel, which one can just get into with one's hat off, should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> them at every corner; and worse than this, they are even thought ornamental when they can be of no possible use; and these stupid penthouse outlines are forced upon the eye in every species of decoration: in St. Margaret's Chapel, West Street, there are actually a couple of buttresses at the end of every pew.|$|E
