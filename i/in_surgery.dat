5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding <b>in</b> <b>surgery</b> of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E

However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Compared {{with other}} {{clinical}} disciplines, academic general practice is {{in a difficult}} situation with respect to patient care. There {{are at least three}} different possible models of working arrangements for heads of departments of general practice: to work <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> <b>in</b> a medical school; to work <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> <b>in</b> the community, separate from a part-time university post; or to work part-time <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> <b>in</b> the community, separate from a university post. AIM. A study was undertaken to explore these models and to gain an understanding of academic teachers' organization of patient care in Europe. METHOD. A total of 77 heads of departments in universities in 12 European countries were sent a questionnaire enquiring about important characteristics of their department, the number of patients they treated per week and how they allocated their time. RESULTS. Sixty nine heads of department (90 %) responded. Of respondents, 55 % worked part-time <b>in</b> a <b>surgery,</b> separate from a university post, nearly one third worked mainly <b>in</b> a <b>surgery,</b> separate from a part-time university post, and 16 % worked <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> <b>in</b> a medical school. Those working <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> with only a part-time university post spent most time in patient care compared with those working in other models (mean of 57 %). Respondents working <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> <b>in</b> a medical school spent most time on administration (34 %); they spent 22 % of their time on patient care and 20 % on education. Respondents working <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> <b>in</b> a medical school spent 25 % of their time on research, those working <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> separate from a part-time university post spent 12 % of their time on research, and those working mainly in a university with a part-time practice post spent 24 % of their time on research. Those working mainly in a university post spent only 17 % of their time in patient care. CONCLUSION. Working <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> <b>in</b> a medical school represented a well-balanced model of time allocation between patient care, research and education and seemed to be a good approach for the integration of general practice into medical schools. Working part-time <b>in</b> a <b>surgery</b> with a university post is an appropriate model for academic integration, but patient care seemed to be neglected. Those doctors working mainly in the community with a part-time university post were able to provide continuity of care and to come into close contact with the everyday problems of general practitioners. However, they might have to struggle for academic recognition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{quantify}} {{the risk of}} DVT <b>in</b> arterial <b>surgery,</b> and to assess the need for prophylaxis. MethodsA search was carried out through Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify published studies on DVT <b>in</b> arterial <b>surgery.</b> To {{quantify the}} risk of DVT both randomised and prospective non-randomised studies were included for analysis. However, to assess the need for prophylaxis only randomised controlled trials were considered. ResultsTwenty three prospective studies that evaluated DVT <b>in</b> arterial <b>surgery</b> were identified. Ten reported data about DVT <b>in</b> aortic <b>surgery,</b> seven studies evaluated DVT <b>in</b> general vascular <b>surgery,</b> three studied DVT <b>in</b> infra-inguinal vascular <b>surgery</b> and three studied DVT incidence in patients after limb amputations. ConclusionThere is a wide variation in the reported incidence of DVT <b>in</b> arterial <b>surgery</b> (2 %– 24 %). This is mostly due to the diversity of screening methods used and the inclusion or exclusion of below knee DVT. There is insufficient evidence to make a valid conclusion regarding the routine use of anticoagulants prophylaxis <b>in</b> arterial <b>surgery.</b> However, until such evidence becomes available, DVT prophylaxis in patients undergoing arterial surgery {{will continue to be}} guided by evidence gained from studies of general surgical patients...|$|R
