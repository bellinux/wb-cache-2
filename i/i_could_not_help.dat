Are they to range at large, in every town and every house, preaching their doctrines, and perhaps even buying proselytes?—are Englishmen to be sent to Paris to be witnesses of the successful result of audacious usurpation, and of the elevation of Tom Paine, from a Staymaker to a fine Gentleman, from an Exciseman to a Sovereign, as the reward of the Rights of Man and the Age of Reason—I fear Restriction and Coercion will avail little against the influence of example—but our Ministers have made up their minds, to save Jacobinism, at its last gasp, and the experiment of shaking hands with it...|$|E

[...] "He was small in stature and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> but detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he {{introduced}} himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{and critics}} are divided in their {{views about the}} value of the {{recovered}} excerpts. On the one hand, Josephson is convinced that sufficient material exists for a reconstruction of the entire symphony and eagerly awaits the undertaking of this task. This view is echoed by Stearns: [...] "here's absolutely no reason not to attempt a completion". Others, however, are more circumspect: Virtanen, in particular, emphasises that although the music is irrefutably late Sibelius, it has not been established beyond doubt that any of it belongs to the Eighth Symphony. Sirén, who {{played a major role in}} organising the performance of the fragments, believes that completion is impossible on the basis of existing sketches, and would be dependent on further discoveries. He also surmises that Sibelius, having rejected the work, would not have relished hearing the fragments played, a viewpoint which McKenna endorses: [...] "Watching the performance on YouTube, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> but think how disappointed the composer would have been to hear his unfinished music performed." [...] Reviewing the recorded excerpts in Gramophone, Andrew Mellor remarks that even if further manuscripts should come to light, the Sibelius Rights Holders would have full control over the material and would decide whether performance was appropriate. Mellor concludes: [...] "We've had to wait some 80 years to hear less than three minutes of music, and the mystery of the Eighth isn't set to unfold any more rapidly from here".|$|E

Jimmy used to come round first, and say, 'All serene, Polly,' so kind and jolly, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>help</b> {{laughing}} and being friends right away." ...|$|R

It was Mrs. Maynard that {{proposed}} the sail, but when I saw that you did n't like it I was glad of any excuse for putting it off. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>help</b> wanting to please you, and I couldn't see why you urged us afterwards; but I supposed you had some reason." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “The Mormon system,” wrote Ludlow, “owns its believers — {{they are}} for it, not it for them. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> {{regarding}} this ‘Church’ as a colossal steam engine which had suddenly realized its superiority over its engineers and... had declared once for all not only its independence but its despotism.” Furthermore, “t is very well known in Salt Lake City that no man lives there who would not be dead tomorrow if Brigham willed it so.” Ludlow spent considerable time with Orrin Porter Rockwell, who had been dubbed the “Destroying Angel” for his supposed role as Brigham Young’s assassin of choice. Ludlow wrote a sketch of the man which Rockwell’s biographer, Harold Schindler, called “the best of those left behind by writers who observed the Mormon first-hand.” Ludlow said, in part, that he “found {{him one of the}} pleasantest murderers I ever met.” ...|$|E

[...] "It {{was n't my}} fault that Gus and Frank were there, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>help</b> their {{speaking}} to me. I do as well as I can, and papa need n't be angry; for I behave ever so much better than some of the girls. Don't I, Polly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{n't mean}} to do it the first minute, but look about me a little, and be sure Syd was all right. But Fan's news settled that point, and just now the look in my Polly's face settled the other. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> wait another minute, or let you either, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>help</b> {{stretching}} out my arms to my little wife, God bless her, though I know I don't deserve her." ...|$|R
