50|$|However, {{the health}} of the patient and {{possible}} contra-indications play an important role as well. Due to the development and improvement of cutaneous, myocutanous and <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissue transpositions plastic surgeons are able to successfully restore the defect to its original shape. Nevertheless, functional recovery is not guaranteed in all patients. For the optimal renewal of shape and function, a suitable flap can be chosen to reconstruct the defect. In the case of using a so-called perforator flap, a reliable vascularization and the possibility of sensory (re) innervation can be combined with less donor-site morbidity and limited loss of function in the donor area.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{viability}} of any pedicled flap depends upon its vascularity. When a flap is dissected it becomes relatively ischaemic. Ultimately, the {{viability of}} the flap depends on the vessels incorporated in the pedicle and their perfusion capacity. There are different techniques to evaluate the blood supply of a flap. Aims: This study deals with experimental and clinical efficiency of fluorescein dye technique to evaluate the vascularity of flaps of various compositions. Materials and Methods: The experimental study was conducted on rats to standardize the technique. Thereafter clinical evaluation was conducted for different flaps namely <b>fasciocutaneous,</b> skeletonized perforator based <b>fasciocutaneous,</b> adipofascial, <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap with adipofascial extension, <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap with fascial extension and <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap with split fascial extension. Conclusions: The paper deals in detail with the technique and method of documentation of a fluorescein study on flaps both experimentally and clinically. The appearance of fluorescein on both the surfaces and distal margin of the flap confirmed the adequacy of vascularity soon after dissection of the flaps. It was found to be an easy, safe and reliable objective method...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundIn {{cases of}} total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) threatened by potential hardware exposure, flap-based reconstruction is indicated to provide durable coverage. Historically, muscle flaps were favored as they provide vascular tissue to an infected wound bed. However, data comparing {{the performance of}} muscle versus <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps are limited and reflect a lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these wounds. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the outcomes of muscle versus <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps following the salvage of compromised TKA. MethodsA systematic search and meta-analysis were performed to identify patients with TKA who underwent either pedicled muscle or <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap coverage of periprosthetic knee defects. Studies evaluating implant/limb salvage rates, ambulatory function, complications, and donor-site morbidity were included in the comparative analysis. ResultsA total of 18 articles, corresponding to 172 flaps (119 muscle flaps and 53 <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps) were reviewed. Rates of implant salvage (88. 8 % vs. 90. 1 %, P= 0. 05) and limb salvage (89. 8 % vs. 100 %, P= 0. 14) were comparable in each cohort. While overall complication rates were similar (47. 3 % vs. 44 %, P= 0. 78), the rates of persistent infection (16. 4 % vs. 0 %, P= 0. 14) and recurrent infection (9. 1 % vs. 4 %, P= 0. 94) tended to be higher in the muscle flap cohort. Notably, functional outcomes and ambulation rates were sparingly reported. ConclusionsRates of limb and prosthetic salvage were comparable following muscle or <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap coverage of compromised TKA. The functional morbidity associated with muscle flap harvest, however, may support the use of <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps for coverage of these defects, particularly in young patients and/or high-performance athletes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of soft tissue coverage by either muscle or <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissue on the healing of open tibial fractures in a murine model. An open tibial fracture, stripped of periosteum with intramedullary fixation, was created in mice. Experimental groups were devised to allow exclusive comparison of either muscle alone or skin plus fascia in direct contact with healing bone. To exclusively assess the relative efficacy of muscle and <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissue to promote healing of a fracture stripped of periosteum, a piece of sterile inert material (polytetrafluoroethylene) was positioned anteriorly, excluding skin and fascia (muscle group) or posteriorly, excluding muscle (<b>fasciocutaneous</b> group). Skeletal repair was assessed histologically and quantified by histomorphometry; quantitative peripheral computed tomography (pQCT) and mechanical testing using a four-point bending technique. This standardized, reproducible model allowed characterization of the morphology of open fracture healing. At 28 days postfracture, there was faster healing in the experimental muscle coverage group compared to skin and fascia alone. Furthermore, there was almost 50 % more cortical bone content and a threefold stronger union beneath muscle compared to <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissue (p < 0. 05 by one-way ANOVA). Exclusive comparison of muscle and <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissue in our novel murine model demonstrates that muscle is superior for the coverage of open tibial fractures for both the rate and quality of fracture healing...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{coverage}} with vascularized soft-tissue flaps {{has dramatically}} improved {{the outcome in}} open tibial fractures. However, the ideal tissue for covering open fractures remains controversial. Several clinical studies suggest that muscle is superior to <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissue; this is attributed to the presumed higher vascularity of muscle, although experimental evidence is inconclusive. The authors' previously described novel murine fracture model, which allows exclusive comparison of both tissues, demonstrated enhanced healing beneath muscle. The present study was undertaken to compare the vascularity of muscle and <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissues {{over the course of}} fracture healing. METHODS: Two experimental groups comprised mice with tibial fractures in contact with either muscle or <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissues exclusively. Controls included a nontrauma group and those where soft tissues and periosteum were dissected but the tibia was not fractured. Animals were harvested between 3 and 28 days after fracture (n = 170 in total). The vascular density of the soft tissues was assessed using immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: <b>Fasciocutaneous</b> tissue was found to have a higher vascular density compared with muscle in contact with the fracture site at all time points (p < 0. 0001, two-way analysis of variance), despite accelerated healing of fractures covered by muscle. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' data show that the more advanced healing of fractures covered by muscle compared with <b>fasciocutaneous</b> tissue is not related to the vascularity of the tissues, as the latter had a higher vascular density at all time points. Therefore, provided that a flap has sufficient vascularity to effectively reconstitute the soft-tissue envelope, other factors may be important in specifically promoting fracture healing...|$|E
40|$|Microvascular free-flaps {{have been}} in {{clinical}} use for nearly 3 decades becoming the gold standard in oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction. In this study, a comparison has been made between the radial forearm <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap with the thinned anterolateral thigh cutaneous flap (tALT), showing {{the advantage of the}} anterolateral thigh cutaneous flap in oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction. Between January 2003 and January 2007, 48 reconstructions were performed in patients submitted to surgery for oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma using, in 17 cases, a radial forearm <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap and, in 31, an anterolateral thigh cutaneous flap. In patients treated with the radial forearm <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap, results showed 94. 1 % flap survival; in cases treated with the anterolateral thigh cutaneous flap, 93. 5 % flap survival (p < 0. 9). Functional results, at receiving site, were comparable in both groups. Functional results, at donor site, were less successful in the radial forearm <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap group, with permanent forearm movement impairment in 35. 3 % of cases; in the anterolateral thigh cutaneous flap group, only transitory gait impairment occurred in 12. 9 % of patients. In conclusion, in our experience, the thinned anterolateral thigh cutaneous flap is comparable to radial forearm <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap in terms of functional results at receiving site, but, having no limitation in availability of donor tissue, it allows a more extended resection of the tumour. Moreover, the donor site can be closed primarily with only an inconspicuous curvilinear scar left over the thigh and with significantly reduced functional impairment...|$|E
40|$|Soft tissue defects {{exposing the}} Achilles tendon {{are common in}} {{patients}} who have undergone trauma or in those with pressure ulcers associated with vascular diseases.

40|$|Aim: Defects of {{the foot}} and ankle with exposed tendons or bone require either local or free flap coverage. Several {{publications}} {{in recent years have}} proven popularity of <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps for the coverage of defects {{of the foot}} and ankle. However, complications of these flaps are being discussed rarely in literatures. Material and Method: We used distally based superficial sural artery island flaps, distally based lateral supramalleolar flaps and free thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flaps for the reconstruction of dorsal foot defects in 20 patients between 2005 and 2010. The surgical techniques and complications for each of <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps are discussed. Result: Better results were obtained with free TDAP flaps according to the other <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps. Discussion: As compared to other flaps, the free TDAP flap is a reliable flap with consistent anatomy and a long, constant pedicle diameter. Its versatility, in which thickness and volume may be adjusted, leads to a perfect match for reconstruction of dorsal foot defects...|$|E

40|$|Soft tissue defects of {{the lower}} {{extremity}} that expose underlying bones, joints, and tendons pose challenging problems and generally require free tissue transfer for a successful reconstruction. Historically, muscle flaps were the gold standard choice for lower limb reconstruction. To obviate the unpredictable appearance and high donor-site morbidity of muscle flaps, <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps were introduced. Recently, perforator flaps, such as the anterolateral thigh flap, gained {{a leading role in}} the reconstructive scenario. There is growing evidence in the literature supporting that <b>fasciocutaneous</b> and perforator flaps are comparable to muscle flaps in terms of flap survival, postoperative infection, osteomyelitis, bone union, and ambulation. With the advances of knowledge in perforator anatomy and their mapping, a new era of lower limb reconstruction has begun. Propeller flap could be raised on any suitable perforator vessel and, without the aid of microsurgical anastomosis, used to restore small- to middle-sized soft tissue defects. In this review, we intend to analyze pros and cons of muscle and <b>fasciocutaneous</b> free flaps and the applicability of the propeller flaps in lower limb reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Use {{of local}} <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap is gaining {{popularity}} {{as an effective}} method of treating type III B open tibial shaft fracture in adults. We treated 16 fractures at National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation, Dhaka during the period between March 1993 and December 1994 to evaluate the result of management of type III B open tibial shaft fracture using local <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps in adults. Of the 16 tibial fractures the mean healing time was 6. 13 months (3. 5 to 11 months). The major post operative complications were deep infections (43. 75 %), non-union (31. 25 %) and malunion (12. 5 %). The results were excellent in 18. 75 %, good in 37. 5 %, fair in 18. 75 % and poor in 25 % cases. Salvage of the limb should be the primary aim of management of type III B open tibial shaft fracture. We conclude that use of local <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap is an easy and effective method of management of open type III B tibial shaft fractures...|$|E

Based on these vessels, if a skin flap was designed within the vessels territory (size 5 × 8 cm) it could survive completely, whereas, if designed beyond the vessels territory (size 5 × 14 cm) would result in partial necrosis of the flap. This <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap model closely simulates the human surgery and could be valuable for training and research. Furthermore, this flap could be applied in the veterinary practice for reconstruction of canine forelimbs and cervical area...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: A microangiographical {{technique}} is described, which allows visualization {{of small and}} capillary blood vessels and quantification of <b>fasciocutaneous</b> blood vessels by means of digital computer analysis in very small laboratory animals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The left carotid artery of 20 nu/nu mice was cannulated (26 gauge) and a mixture of gelatin, bariumsulfate, and green ink was injected according to standardized protocol. <b>Fasciocutaneous</b> blood vessels were visualized by digital mammography and analyzed for vessel length and vessel surface area as standardized units [SU] by computer program. RESULTS: With the described microangiography method, <b>fasciocutaneous</b> blood vessels down to capillary size level can be clearly visualized. Regions of interest (ROIs) can be defined and the containing vascular network quantified. Comparable results may be obtained by calculating the microvascular area index (MAI) and the microvascular length index (MLI), related to the ROIs size.

40|$|Elevation of {{the skin}} along with its deep fascia {{vascular}} network is a recent facility for flap design. The longitudinal trapezius <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flap was first introduced in 1996; at that time it did not receive much attention, although it has many significant benefits compared with other available procedures. Sixteen trapezius <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps were elevated in 15 patients for reconstruction of severe scarring of the neck and midface. All flaps {{were based on the}} deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and included the overlying fascia of the trapezius muscle. Delaying was applied for very long flaps. Two flaps developed minimal distal necrosis (10 cm below the muscle border). The results indicate that an extra-long back fascia flap based on the descending branch of the transverse cervical artery could be formed, which would be long enough to reconstruct the entire neck and safely transfer it to the midface.

30|$|Soft tissue defects {{over the}} distal third of lower limb {{are a common}} {{scenario}} faced by orthopaedic surgeons in their clinical practice.

Over the past few decades, many lower limb wound coverage techniques have been described, such as free flaps [1], random local flaps [2], distally based muscle flaps [3, 4], staged and undelayed fascial [5, 6] and <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps [7 – 11] and reverse flow arterial flaps [12, 13]. One such wound coverage technique popularized by Masquelet is the use of neurocutaneous flaps based on distal neurocutaneous perforators or venocutaneous perforators [14]. Since then, reverse sural <b>fasciocutaneous</b> flaps have been described by Hasegawa et al. [15], Rajacic et al. [16] and Nakajima et al.
