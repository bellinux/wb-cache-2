50|$|Gray iron is {{a common}} {{engineering}} alloy because of its relatively low cost and good machinability, which results from the graphite lubricating the cut and breaking up the chips.

40|$|For every mill {{the ideal}} roll can be {{considered}} as one {{that can be used in}} a mill stand indefinitely. Unfortunately for the roll user, such ideal rolls do not exist. One major reason for work roll changes (planned or unplanned) is "wear". In the context of cold rolling and temper rolling, "wear" primarily refers to loss of roughness and/or surface texture. Another limitation to roll performance is the fact that mill incidents - minor as well as major incidents - inflict damage on the work rolls, requiring redressing in the roll shop. If a major defect is present in a <b>forged</b> <b>roll,</b> e. g. due to a mill incident, catastrophic roll failure may occur in a violent, explosive manner. Improvement of the value-in-use of a work roll implies a superior wear resistance, a superior damage resistance, and elimination of the safety risks associated with explosive roll failures. In order to deal with this in a concerted R&D approach, a consortium of two roll users in the steel industry, a leading roll manufacturer, a high-tech supplier of roll damage detection equipment, and specialised research institutes have joined forces. Cold rolling trials have been performed, using pilot mills as well as industrial mills, with both novel <b>forged</b> HSS work <b>rolls</b> and conventional <b>forged</b> 3 - 5 %Cr steel work rolls. Separate trials have been designed to focus on either the aspect of roughness evolution or damage resistance. Complementary data from various laboratory tests and industrial mill and roll shop data have been collected. Models have been developed for damage evolution in a roll, and for roughness evolution of the roll surface. In addition, novel non-destructive detection systems and sensors have been designed and tested. This paper provides a concise overview of the results achieved. © EDP Sciences...|$|R

40|$|Five {{coloured}} totemic sculptural works (up to 4 meters high). Exhibited in {{a variety}} of locations, the steles act as standing stones with no instructional message or commemorative edict, allowing for interpretative flexibility. The Steles engage with the contemporary subject of sculpture, whilst simultaneously testing the limits of the social use of objects. ‘Steles’ began with standard metal bars, which were <b>forged,</b> <b>rolled</b> and then rendered in giant form with a PU elastomer coating. The simple forging processes applied pressure to the hot steel, producing an asymmetrical squeezed effect as well as extruded ‘ears’ at the top, where the original bar corners were. The edges, where the organic and the man-made collide, echo calligraphic standing stones – hence ‘stele’. Whilst the original steles were produced by carving flat faces across rocks, Wilson’s forging processes produce a bulge which effects a similar meeting of face and edge. The literal squeeze is reintroduced in Wilson’s larger pieces with a bevelled zotefoam edge, the overspilling sandwich-filling between two plate steel faces. The elastomer coating is flexible enough for this squeeze to be still in evidence in the final work, an intimate and surprising point of contact for anyone brave enough to touch. There is a precise reversal of the normal hierarchical relation between macquette and final work here – the smaller version in this instance being the ‘truer’ one. The finished forms are worked up in a factory which usually produces shipping buoys, making for a high visibility object, densely pigmented, saturated with colour. This process also places the work in conversation with New Generation sculptors of the sixties, especially with the painted steel works that appeared to promise to be forever freshly painted, forever new. The twist here is that eventually these stele works will lose their gloss, the pigment will fade and the surface will pit – it will be as if they gradually turn to stone...|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{was invented in}} the late 1980s by Charles Lewton-Brain, an English-born goldsmith who lived and studied in Tanzania, the United States, and Germany before moving to Canada. Outside of the Industrial Revolution, the method represents the first major innovation in metalworking in thousands of years. In the 1980s, the technique of foldforming metal was developed by Charles Lewton-Brain, who from a young age was interested in art and was inspired to pursue his interest in jewelry by his girlfriend's mother. In 1974 {{he went to the}} Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, where he studied jewelry-making and metalsmithing. After his college career, Christian Gaudernack, one of the NASCAD professors and a Norwegian goldsmith, inspired Lewton-Brain to continue his education, and he went on to attend the Fachhochschule fur Gestalstung, an art and design university in Pforzheim Germany. Lewton-Brain worked as a part-time goldsmith. During his time in the metals program, he was instructed by Klaus Ullrich, a postwar metalsmith. Ullrich was the person that helped Lewton-Brain to develop the foldforming technique. Ullrich emphasized to his students the importance of comprehending the properties of metal in order to understand how metal forms. Charles Lewton-Brain was able to develop his foldforming technique by seeing the characteristics of the metal as it is folded, unfolded, <b>forged,</b> <b>rolled,</b> annealed, and worked on. He brought about a new style of metalworking that had some connection to nature. His technique focused on the metal's natural reaction to being hammered and heated, based on his understanding of the metals elastic and ductile characteristics that were part of his instruction by Klaus Ullrich. Lewton-Brain continued to teach the foldforming technique to people at workshops and at Alberta College of Art and Design as the Head of Metals and Jewelry, having been part of this institute since 1986. By 1991, Lewton-Brain was winning awards for the technique and in 1997 workshops demonstrating the technique were {{at the core of the}} [...] "Touch the Future" [...] portion of the JCK International Jewelry Show in Orlando, Florida.|$|R
