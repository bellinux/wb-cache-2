40|$|Offices {{have long}} been networked, but the home is {{becoming}} an increasingly electronic and networked place. As the public demands (and governments mandate) an energy-efficient home, and everything from TVs to printers and refrigerators becomes networked, the energy consumption of these devices becomes critical. Most of these networked edge devices spend {{the majority of their}} time idle, but still need to remain present on the network. This creates the need for a new energy conservation technique—minimizing power while network-connected and idle—but the devices still need to be ready to respond at a moment’s notice. This paper analyzes the nature of embedded computing systems, reviewing system-level power optimizations to minimize <b>network</b> <b>standby</b> power. Then, in the context of low-power embedded systems in the home and office, we investigate and propose three ways to handle the network traffic {{at the heart of a}} lowpower <b>network</b> <b>standby</b> system—packet classification, packet accumulation and autorespond proxies. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{electricity}} demand of our increasingly digital economies {{is growing at}} an alarming rate. While data centre energy demand has received much attention, of greater cause for concern is the growing energy demand of billions of networked devices such as smart phones, tablets and set-top boxes. In 2013, a relatively {{small portion of the}} world’s population relied on more than 14 billion of these devices to stay connected. That number could skyrocket to 500 billion by 2050, driving dramatic increases in both energy demand and wasted energy. Being connected 24 / 7 means these information and communication technology (ICT) devices draw energy all the time, even when in standby mode. This publication probes their hidden energy costs. In 2013, such devices consumed 616 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity, surpassing the total electricity consumption of Canada. Studies show that for some devices, such as game consoles, up to 80 % of the energy consumption is used just to maintain a network connection. Implementing best available technologies could reduce the energy demand of network-enabled devices by up to 65 %. In the absence of strong market drivers to optimise the energy performance of these devices, policy intervention is needed. Building on its experience in setting international policy for standby energy consumption of stand-alone devices, the International Energy Agency uses this publication to set the stage for tackling the much bigger challenge of <b>network</b> <b>standby.</b> In exploring both policy and technology solutions, the book charts a path forward and identifies which stakeholders should take the lead in particular areas. An underlying message {{is that there is a}} need for international cooperation across all parts of the ICT value chain. M ore...|$|R

40|$|Protecting control {{planes in}} {{networking}} hardware from high rate packets {{is a critical}} issue <b>for</b> <b>networks</b> under operation. One common approach for conventional networking hardware is to offload expensive functions onto hard-wired offload engines as ASICs. This approach is inadequate <b>for</b> OpenFlow <b>networks</b> because it restricts {{a certain amount of}} flexibility <b>for</b> <b>network</b> control that OpenFlow tries to provide. Therefore, we need a control plane protection mechanism in OpenFlow switches as a last resort, while preserving flexibility <b>for</b> <b>network</b> control. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to filter out Packet-In messages, which include packets handled by the control plane in OpenFlow networks, without dropping important ones <b>for</b> <b>network</b> control. Switches record values of packet header fields before sending Packet-In messages, and filter out packets that have the same values as the recorded ones. The controllers set the header fields in advance whose values must be recorded, and the header fields are selected based on controller design. We have implemented and evaluated the proposed mechanism on a prototype software switch, concluding that it dramatically reduces CPU loads on switches while passes important Packet-In messages <b>for</b> <b>network</b> control...|$|R
