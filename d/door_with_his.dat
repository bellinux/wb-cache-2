5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. We saw this courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Neighbours {{started out}} with three {{families}} created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said {{that he wanted to}} show three families living in a small street, who are friends. Max Ramsay (Francis Bell), his wife Maria (Dasha Blahova) and their sons Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie) lived at No.24 Ramsay Street. Single father, Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) lived next <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> children, Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), Scott (Darius Perkins) and Lucy (Kylie Flinker). His mother-in-law, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) also lived with him. Bachelor Des Clarke (Paul Keane) invited Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to live at No. 28 with him and they were later married. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history in the street and they were often involved in an ongoing rivalry. When Network Ten picked up the show and revamped it, they brought in new and younger actors including Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell and Jason Donovan, who replaced Darius Perkins as Scott Robinson. Many families, including the Alessi, Bishop, Hancock, Hoyland, Rebecchi, Scully, Timmins and Willis families have moved {{in and out of the}} street over the years.|$|E

50|$|He was {{initially}} charged with publishing {{information about the}} assassinations, imprisoned in December 2000, and was released after a month pending trial. In February 2002, he was tried in a military court behind closed <b>doors</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> solicitor present; the presiding judge was a prosecutor with the JOAF. While in detention, Zarafshan's office was reportedly searched, and weapons and alcohol were allegedly found.|$|R

5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses dispute this account, {{saying that}} Tabatabainejad {{had begun to}} walk toward the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{backpack}} when an officer approached him and grabbed his arm, whereupon Tabatabainejad told the officer several times to let go.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Scorsese {{made his}} first feature-length film, {{the black and white}} I Call First, which was later retitled Who's That Knocking at My <b>Door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fellow {{students}} actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semiautobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included a later film, Mean Streets.|$|E
60|$|This {{was indeed}} a most unaccountable Step, {{but there was a}} {{necessity}} to plead, for he was at their very <b>Doors</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Forces; and this Neighbouring People, who they call Mogenites, could not resist him without help from the Solunarians, which they were very backward in, notwithstanding the earnest Sollicitations of their Prince, and notwithstanding they were oblig'd to do it by a solemn Treaty.|$|R

25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog's real master. Superman has {{gone to great lengths to}} train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E
500|$|In January 1887 Commodore Perry Owens {{took office}} as Sheriff of Apache County, Arizona. He sent two deputies to arrest Ike Clanton. Clanton had instigated the Gunfight at the OK Corral and {{was charged with}} the later ambush {{shooting}} of Virgil Earp. Wyatt Earp searched for Ike Clanton in his vendetta, but never found him - Ike moved north to Apache County to continue rustling cattle and killing. Owens' two deputies killed Ike Clanton; Phin Clanton was arrested; three other gang members were killed; and the Clanton gang was done. Then Sheriff Owens {{turned his attention to}} the Blevins family, the other rustling gang in the county. In June 1887 Old Man Blevins disappeared, presumably killed by the Tewksbury faction of the Pleasant Valley War. The Blevins sons searched for their father and in August Hamp Blevins and another were killed by the Tewksbury side. So Andy Blevins (aka Cooper) ambushed and killed John Tewksbury and Bill Jacobs in revenge. Blevins returned to Holbrook and was heard bragging about his killings. Sheriff Owens had inherited a warrant for Andy Blevins' (Cooper) arrest for horse theft so he rode to Holbook on September 2, 1887. Sheriff Owens had hunted buffalo for the railroad and could shoot his Winchester from the hip with great accuracy. Cradling his Winchester rifle in his arm, Sheriff Owens knocked on the Blevins' door. Andy Blevins answered with a pistol in hand, the lawman told him to come out, that he had a warrant for arrest. Blevins refused and tried to close the door. Owens shot his rifle from his hip through the door, hitting Andy Blevins in the stomach. Andy's half-brother, John Blevins, pushed a pistol out the door to Owens' right and fired at the Sheriff. He missed and Owens shot John Blevins in the arm, putting him out of the fight. Owens saw Andy Blevins in the window moving to shoot back. Owens shot through the wall, striking Andy in the right hip - he died that night. Mose Roberts, boarding with the family, jumped out of a side window with a pistol. Sheriff Owens shot him through his back and chest, killing him. Fifteen-year-old Samuel Houston Blevins ran out the front <b>door,</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother's revolver, and yelled [...] "I'll get him." [...] His mother ran out after him. Owens shot and Sam fell backward, dying in his mother's arms. The shootout took less than one minute and made Owens a legend. In eight months Sheriff Owens had rid Apache County of two notorious gangs of rustlers and killers.|$|E
2500|$|On {{one of the}} occasions, he led a squad {{to arrest}} gang chieftains Owney Madden and Tanner Smith at their {{headquarters}} known as the Winona Club. The gangsters were warned by one of their informants and had barricaded themselves in the building by the time O'Connell and his men had arrived. When O'Connell knocked on the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> club, a gun was fired out a window with the shot [...] "grazing a police officer's skull". The detective sergeant then ordered his men to withdraw around a corner and sent two patrolmen to gain entry to the building from the rear {{while the rest of}} the squad were marched across the street in full view of the gang. O'Connell approached the club once again and began arguing with Madden and Tanner, and {{while the rest of the}} gang crowded around the front windows to watch their leaders taunt the police, a rear window was left unguarded allowing the two patrolmen to sneak into the building.|$|E

6000|$|Andrew {{could not}} bear to think of it, and quickened his pace to catch him up. But Blackie was in great form, humming [...] "Scots wha hae." [...] With head thrown back, staff {{revolving}} and chest inflated, he sang himself into a martial ecstasy, and, drumming cheerily on the <b>doors</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fist, strutted along like a band of bagpipers with a clan behind him, until he had played himself out of Andrew's sight.|$|R
50|$|In 726, {{the emperor}} Leo the Isaurian issued {{a series of}} edicts against the veneration of images, {{ordering}} the army to destroy all icons - ushering {{in the period of}} Byzantine iconoclasm. At that time, all religious pictures and statues were removed from the Hagia Sophia. After a brief reprieve under Empress Irene (797-802), the iconoclasts made a comeback. The Emperor Theophilus (829-842) had two-winged bronze <b>doors</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> monograms installed at the southern entrance of the church.|$|R
2500|$|One sketch {{featured}} {{an employee}} (McCulloch) at a counter who loans a customer (McDonald) his ballpoint. After conducting his business, the customer absentmindedly pockets {{the pen and}} walks off. The employee sets off in a mad pursuit, all the while screaming [...] "MY PEN!" [...] The employee chases the customer outside, {{in time to see}} him climbing into a taxi. He has horrific fantasies of the customer sticking the pen into his ear, using it to stab a bystander, and reinserting the bloody pen into his own ear. The employee chases the taxi down the street and, leaping through the air, lands on the vehicle, holding onto the passenger side <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> finger tips. After a drive around town, the taxi pulls over, the customer issues a cursory apology before returning the pen, after which the employee curls up with it in the street, and some of his co-workers come out with a comfort blanket to collect him. The sketch ends with another customer asking for the pen, only for the audience to see that the employee now wears a large, weighty helmet with a chinstrap and a chain attached at the forehead, the other end of which secures the pen. [...] This short film, as well as many other The Kids in the Hall shorts, was directed by Michael Kennedy.|$|E

Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously, they were still waiting, and an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information. [...] "Are all {{the doors of the}} house shut?" [...] asked Marvel. [...] "He's going round--prowling round. He's as artful as the devil." ...|$|R
