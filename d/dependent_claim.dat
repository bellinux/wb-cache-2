5000|$|Clarification/broadening of the {{independent}} claim: Independent claims are typically written with very broad terms, to avoid permitting competitors to circumvent the claim by altering {{some aspect of the}} basic design. But when a broad wording is used, it may raise a question as to the scope of the term itself. If a <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> is specifically drawn to a narrower interpretation, then, at least in the U.S., the doctrine of claim differentiation states that {{the independent}} claim must be different from, and therefore broader than, the <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> [...] The doctrine dictates that it [...] "is improper for courts to read into an independent claim a limitation explicitly set forth in another claim." [...] This means that if an independent claim recites a chair with a plurality of legs, and a <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> depending from the independent recites a chair with 4 legs, the independent claim is not limited to what is recited in the <b>dependent</b> <b>claim.</b> The <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> protects chairs with 4 legs, and the independent claim protects chairs with 4 legs as well as chairs having 2, 3, 5 or more legs. Similarly, it may be unclear whether a [...] "base" [...] includes a [...] "set of legs." [...] A <b>dependent</b> <b>claim,</b> including the phrase, [...] "wherein said base comprises a set of legs," [...] if allowed by the patent examiner, clarifies that the word base in the independent claim does not necessarily include legs. In practice, dependent claims are often used to home in on the inventor's preferred embodiment of the invention (e.g., the actual product design that the inventor intends to use.) The independent claim broadly describes the invention; <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> #1 describes the invention in a narrower aspect that more specifically describes the preferred embodiment; <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> #2 is narrower still; etc.|$|E

5000|$|In some jurisdictions, once {{a patent}} is issued, the patent holder may request a [...] "reissue" [...] of the patent to correct {{mistakes}} in the issued patent. Such [...] "reissue applications" [...] must typically be filed within a particular period of time following issuance of the original patent. In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, the patent holder may even seek to broaden {{the scope of the}} invention defined in the claims by filing a reissue application, although a broadening reissue in the USA must be filed within 2 years from grant. Also, in the United States, only the patent holder may file for reissue. The case of In Re Tanaka established the principle that a patentee can add narrow <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> to an issued patent through the reissue process, because a patent with narrower <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> is less subject to invalidation when litigated.

5000|$|Possible {{invalidity}} of base claim: It {{is impossible}} to know, when beginning the application process and even {{at the time of}} patent issuance, if a patent claim is valid. This is because any publication dated before the application's priority date and published anywhere in any language can invalidate the claim (excluding publications by the inventor published during the grace period in certain countries such as U.S., Canada and Japan). Furthermore, even applications that were not yet published at the time of filling, but have a priority date prior to the priority date of the application, can also invalidate the claim. As it {{is impossible to}} gain an absolute and complete knowledge of every publication on earth, not to mention unpublished patent applications, there is always some degree of uncertainty. If the independent claim is determined to be invalid, however, a <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> may nevertheless survive, and may still be broad enough to bar competitors from valuable commercial territory.|$|E
5000|$|Browning also co-designed the FN Browning Hi-Power, {{announced}} in 1922, {{during the last}} years of his life, working on this design until his death in 1926. It was a 9 mm Luger semi-automatic pistol capable of holding 13 rounds (plus one chambered) in the magazine. The Savage 1907 Pistol 32 ACP featured a 10-round magazine which is of staggered-column design, and predates the Browning patent filing,issued as U.S. patent #1,618,510, dated 22 Feb. 1927 for the large-capacity 9 mm pistol by some 18 years as the Savage was patented in 1905, Whether the staggered magazine featured in the Savage 1905 was a focal point of the patent is unclear. In a review of the Browning patent dated 22 Feb. 1927, it is equally unclear as to the staggered magazine being either a primary or a <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> of the patent as issued. However, the existence of a staggered magazine in 1905 is indisputable, as many of these Savage pistols were produced and survive to this day. Browning could well have come into contact with this concept during the military trials of 1911, as a version of the Savage design in [...]45 cal was also under consideration alongside the Browning/Colt design.) The earlier, single-column magazine design is still used today, however, especially for deep-concealment semi-automatic pistols such as the Kel-Tec P-32.|$|E

Thus, if the claim depends from three former claims, it is counted for fee purposes as three <b>dependent</b> <b>claims.</b> In light of the [...] "excess claim" [...] fees currently imposed by the USPTO, this tactic can quickly become expensive.

40|$|Patent claims play an {{important}} role in every patent case and it is the core for evaluation of infringement, validity or originality. There are two main types of claims: the independent claims (stand on their own), and the <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> (depending on a single/several claim/claims). Axiomatic design is a design theory that is based on the axioms. The axiomatic design theory makes use of corollaries and theorems which guide/help designers mapping functional domain to physical domain. The relation between functional requirements and design parameters is assured by so called design matrix. In an ideal design the number of design parameters is equal to the number of functional requirements, and the functional requirements are always kept independent from each other. When there are more design parameters than functional requirements, the design is a redundant design. A coupled design can became decoupled by selecting different set of design parameters. The idea of construction of patent claims using Axiomatic Design is based on the assumption of independent claims as a part of an ideal design and <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> as a part of a decoupled design...|$|R

In contrast, the Black-Scholes model essentially only allows an explicit representation when the underlying claim is differentiable (in some sense), in which case the strategy is defined in terms of Clark-Haussmann's Formula. Hence, attention is restricted to the case when the claim is differentiable. The strategy is then shown to be convergent and a (very simple) version of Clark-Haussmann's Formula is established.

Protection of wood against Basidiomycetes involves treatment with an animal blood serum-metal complex. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A wood protecting composition contains 80 - 99. 5 wt. % animal blood serum (preferably of foodstuff quality and especially obtained from bovine or porcine whole blood) and 0. 5 - 20 (preferably 0. 6 - 4) wt. % metal salt selected from salts of iron, copper and/or aluminum. (N. B.

An INDEPENDENT CLAIM relates to a method for the prophylactic protection of wood against degradation and decomposition by Basidiomycetes without contact with soil, by treating the wood with an animal blood-metal complex (no specific metals given). USE - The compositions are active as antifungal wood protectants. The weight loss w as determined on incubation of pine sapwood samples for 4 weeks with the wood-rotting fungus Serpula lacrimans or Gloeophylium sepiarum. For incubation with S. lacimans at 20 deg.

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the compound Poisson risk model involving two types of <b>dependent</b> <b>claims,</b> namely main claims and by-claims. The by-claim is induced by the main claim with a certain probability and the occurrence of a by-claim may be delayed depending on associated main claim amount. Using Rouché’s theorem, both of the survival probability with zero initial surplus and the Laplace transform of the survival probability are obtained from an integro-differential equations system. Then, using the Laplace transform, we derive a defective renewal equation satisfied by the survival probability. An exact representation for the solution of this equation is derived through an associated compound geometric distribution. For exponential claim sizes, we present an explicit formula for the survival probability. We also illustrate the influence of model parameters in the dependent risk model on the survival probability by numerical examples.|$|R
40|$|In {{classical}} risk theory, {{the surplus}} {{process is a}} very important model for understand-ing how the capital or surplus of an insurance company evolve over time. By adding to the previous surplus the current premium flow and deducting the claims made during the period, the process gives the value of the capital that is available to the insurer at each point in time. Each period is tracked so that the surplus never gets below zero because if it does, it provides an indication of ruin, that is, the company is in a position of negative cash flow. However, the first time that ruin occurs is im-portant and the company must ensure this does not happen because it can leave the company inoperable. This time to ruin is so much a function of the initial capital and the pricing structure of the insurer’s book of business, although how claims evolve over time can also directly impact the level of surplus. Claims generally are out of the company’s control, but it can manage its surplus so that it can predictably estimate the level of claims that will emerge over time. One distinguishing feature of a typi-cal mathematical structure of the surplus process is the assumption that individual claims do arise independently. We know that this assumption of independence is no longer realistic and reasonable because individual risks, are usually homogeneous and share common characteristics that claims from one can induce claims of another. In other words, the risks do not exhibit independence. In this paper, we investigate the effects of <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> on the probability of ruin and the time-to-ruin, given ruin occurs. However, unlike the case of independence where there may be a more tractable solution, it is not straightforward to get closed form solutions to the proba-bility of ruin. Instead, we apply simulation procedures to provide us insight into the statistical distribution of the time to ruin when <b>claims</b> are <b>dependent.</b> We find that in the presence of <b>dependent</b> <b>claims,</b> the time to ruin occurs faster. ...|$|R
