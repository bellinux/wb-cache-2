5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|Artillerymen wore similar {{clothing}} to the cavalry: mostly black in colour with a koller and black trousers. They were additionally <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> standard hussar sword {{should they have}} need to defend their guns.|$|E
5|$|Chesham {{also had}} {{extensive}} goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mobile 5-ton crane, {{replaced by a}} fixed 8-ton crane between 1898–1900. The outward transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bay platform for passenger trains, {{to allow it to}} accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 and is now a garden.|$|E

5|$|Service on the Lake Shore Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach seating and Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a dining car service. As the Erie station is not <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> waiting room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown circulator, provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound Lake Shore Limited.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hot stage (sample holder <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E

5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crane {{to retrieve}} the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of the funnel.|$|E
5|$|Differential {{fields are}} fields <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> derivation, i.e., allow to take {{derivatives}} of {{elements in the}} field. For example, the field R(X), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.|$|E
