25|$|On November 11, 2011, Apple {{announced}} the iPod Nano (1st <b>generation)</b> <b>Replacement</b> Program, intended to address concerns over overheating batteries. Customers with affected devices can {{fill out a}} claim form to confirm eligibility for replacement. Defective devices will be replaced within six weeks and will carry 90-day warranties. Customers who have personalized iPod Nano devices {{will not be able}} to receive personalization on their replacement devices. During the replacement process, there have been several reports of users receiving an iPod Nano 6th generation as replacement instead of the expected 1st generation device that users sent in during the recall. Because using the iPod nano 6th generation with a Mac computer requires iTunes 10 or higher, which in turn requires Mac OS X Leopard system software, Apple will upgrade the system software of participants running earlier versions of OS X, on request but this leaves users that do not have access to iTunes without a working device (because Apple changed the hashing of the music database which prevented the 6th generation iPod Nano from being used with open source software via libgpod).|$|E

5000|$|In September 1999, the Federal CIO Council {{published}} the [...] "Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework" [...] (FEAF) Version 1.1 for developing an Enterprise Architecture (EA) within any Federal Agency {{for a system}} that transcends multiple inter-agency boundaries. It builds on common business practices and designs that cross organizational boundaries, among others the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model. The FEAF provides an enduring standard for developing and documenting architecture descriptions of high-priority areas. It provides guidance in describing architectures for multi-organizational functional segments of the Federal Government. At the time of release, the Government's IT focus on Y2K issues and then the events of September 2001 diverted attention from EA implementation, though its practice in advance and subsequent to this may have ameliorated {{the impact of these}} events. Interim releases since that time have provided successive increases in definition for the core reference models (see below), as well as a very robust methodology for actually developing an architecture in a series of templates forming the Federal Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM) and its next <b>generation</b> <b>replacement,</b> the Collaborative Planning Methodology (CPM), which was designed to be more flexible, more widely applicable, and more inclusive of the larger set of planning disciplines.|$|E
5000|$|Mantaro Muscle (also {{known as}} Kid Muscle—Mantaro Kinniku in the Japanese version) is the spoiled son of superhero wrestler King Muscle (Kinnikuman in the Japanese version). After 28 years of peace, the Seigi Choujins' (Muscle League) old enemies regroup and form the Demon Manufacturing Plant (dMp, {{known in the}} English version as Destruction, Mayhem and Pain). The Muscle League has lost its edge and are {{overwhelmed}} by the young, well-trained fighters. Recognizing their weakness, the Seigi Chojin reopen the Hercules Factory (a school for superheroes) and begin training {{a new generation of}} heroes to take on the dMp. At first unwilling, Mantaro (Kid Muscle) is one of the young heroes and defeats his father to prove his readiness to graduate. He and the other new Seigi Choujin defeat several members of the dMp and meet Kevin Mask, who quits dMp when he discovers their lack of honor. They also battle Sunshine and his pupils, who destroy the dMp after developing a renewed respect for the fighting spirit of the Seigi Choujins. The manga continues with the New <b>Generation</b> <b>Replacement</b> Tournament, Mantaro's challenge to master his inherited potential (Kajiba no Kuso Chikara, [...] "burning inner strength" [...] or [...] "the fire"), the return of the Chojin Olympics, a fight with the Demon Seed (a villainous group), a backstory for Robin Mask and a tag-team tournament set in the past. Although the manga begins as a fairly lighthearted, humorous (albeit violent) story, later arcs (the No Respect and Demon Seed storylines in particular) have a darker tone and frequently deal with psychological trauma.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{variation}} among Y chromosomes {{in natural}} populations of Drosophila melanogaster was assayed by a segregation study. A total of 36 Y chromosomes was extracted and ten <b>generations</b> of <b>replacement</b> backcrossing yielded stocks with Y chromosomes {{in two different}} genetic backgrounds. Eleven of the Y chromosomes were from diverse geographic origins, and the remaining 25 were from locally captured flies. Segregation of sexes in adult offspring was scored for the four possible crosses among the two backgrounds with each Y chromosome. Although the design confounds meiotic drive and effects on viability, statistical partitioning of these effects reveals significant variation among lines in Y chromosome segregation. Results are discussed in regards to models of Y-linked segregation and viability effects, which suggest that Y-linked adaptive polymorphism is unlikely...|$|R

The sensitivity evaluation is carried out by means of a simulation procedure which combines a standard Monte Carlo approach and a new probabilistic version of a recent data perturbation procedure called Sample <b>Generation</b> by <b>Replacements</b> (SGR, Lombardi, Pastore and Nucci, 2004). Probabilistic SGR (PSGR) will be used to generate data perturbations based on three differ-ent models of faking: fake-uniform, fake-good (deception) and fake-bad (malingering).

40|$|Primary {{objective}} of this work was the assessment of natural regeneration processes in the Norway spruce natural forest at its upper limit in the National Nature Reserve Kosodrevina. Dynamics of regeneration processes was quantified by numbers of individuals per hectare, specified by five height categories for each experimental plot. The evaluation of natural regeneration in the experimental plots involved analysis of growth medium impact as well (soil or coarse woody debris). The impact of seedbed was examined in 2006. Analysis of regeneration processes in the natural Norway spruce mountain forest confirmed that initial phase of breakdown stage generates optimal conditions for a continuous <b>generation</b> <b>replacement.</b> The number of individuals recorded in this stage ranged from 3. 501 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 2006) to 1. 800 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 1986). But on the other hand, research on regeneration dynamics in optimal stage showed that suitable conditions for germination, establishment and partial growth of seedlings were in advanced phase of this stage. From 2. 167 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 1996) to 1. 034 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 2006) were found in this plot. In the growth stage, from 257 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 1976) to 57 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 1996) were found. Low values of abundance in this stage suggest that recruitment of new trees is permanently discontinuous. At the upper forest boundary, coarse woody debris as a growth medium has the unsubstitable function for a continuous developmental stage replacement. Proportion of individuals that used CWD for seedbed was 59. 45 % in initial phase of breakdown stage, whereas in optimal stage it was 7. 4 %...|$|E
