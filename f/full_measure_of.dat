5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister Iris {{in the small town}} of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his <b>full</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and places her hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E

It {{is true that}} the U.S. has not utilized the <b>full</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> resources available for Zaire, nor responded to Mobutu's requests for arms and ammunition. This restraint by the Administration is commendable, but if Mobutu qualifies for neither arms nor ammunition, then he should not qualify for any form of military assistance, lest the United States be drawn into the hapless conflict in Zaire, inch by inch.|$|E

In 1998, he was elected with a cumulative seven-vote margin on the second round of the first ballot. By contrast, his successor, Václav Klaus, has required the <b>full</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> the process. He narrowly won election on the third ballot at the 2003 election and on the sixth (second attempt, third ballot) in 2008. Both his elections were won in the third round.

25|$|Chadwick's {{impact on}} the British art scene {{as an artist and}} teacher helped pave the way for the Young British Artist (YBA) generation. Her {{expanded}} use of materials can be seen carried through the work of many these artists. Without Chadwick's Cacao, for example, it is impossible to imagine Anya Gallacio's chocolate and flower installations. Since Chadwick's Barbican organised retrospective, the <b>full</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> her contribution to the trajectory of contemporary British art is starting to be realised. The Richard Saltoun Gallery in London represents the estate of Helen Chadwick and has continued to show the artists work. Works From The Estate (2013) marked what would have been the artists 60th birthday, showing some of Chadwick's most famous works. The following year Bad Blooms (2014) exhibited Chadwick's Wreaths of Pleasure (1992–93).|$|E
25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a <b>full</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E

The New Yorker critic Anthony Lane criticized Glatzer and Westmoreland for [...] "flinch" [...] {{when it came to}} showing Alice's {{deterioration}} and its effect on her family, and found the film's sentimental aspects [...] "manipulative—and effective". The Austin Chronicles Josh Kupecki gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, finding it clichéd and melodramatic, and likening it to a public service announcement. Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, described Moore as giving [...] "a four-star performance in a two-star movie", drawing attention to the [...] "intrusive" [...] score and the [...] "maddeningly overwrought and heavy-handed" [...] storytelling.|$|E

Powell admitted to being [...] "amazed" [...] with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering {{it to be a}} very important moment in his career. He said, [...] "After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink. Here was a character with flesh, blood and sinews.

[...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film's development as [...] "pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented [...] "there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision.

[...] David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, considered the film not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be, concluding, [...] "Inception is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else." ...|$|E
40|$|Copulas are <b>full</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> {{dependence}} among {{components of}} random vectors. Unlike the marginal {{and the joint}} distributions which are directly observable, a copula is a hidden dependence structure that couples the marginals and the joint distribution.

40|$|If {{international}} atrocity {{crimes are}} acts so egregious that their impunity cannot be legally tolerated, why don 2 ̆ 7 t we punish States that commit them? The rise of {{international criminal law}} is celebrated as an achievement of the international rule of law, yet its advance effectively may {{come at the expense}} of holding States accountable for their role in mass violence. Transitional justice has emerged as the dominant normative framework for how the international community responds to mass violence. Liberalism strongly influences transitional justice, which has produced individual criminal accountability as the desired form of legal accountability for atrocities. Transitional justice rejects punishing States for atrocities as illiberal (collective punishment) and illegitimate (lack of positive law). In fact, transitional justice theorization of justice largely ignores legal accountability for States. Without legal accountability, States enjoy moral and legal impunity for their crimes. States escape their legal obligations to repair the injury they cause and to institute reforms that secure a <b>fuller</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> justice and peace. This Article examines how international law and transitional justice have developed conceptually to effectively prevent legal accountability for States that commit atrocity crimes, and argues that a new politics of transitional justice is necessary to harness the productive potential of State legal accountability to achieve a <b>fuller</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> international justice...|$|R
