Both {{in terms of}} the reasons given for making <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes and the frequency of <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes, the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> policies of Martin and Greenspan were very similar, as were those of Burns and Volcker. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> policy of Chairman Miller differed from either of these groups. Measured by the money market's response to <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes, the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> policy of Burns and Volcker was the most effective and Miller's the least effective.

5000|$|Stern's {{approach}} to discounting has been debated amongst economists. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> allows economic effects occurring {{at different times}} to be compared. Stern used a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in his calculation {{of the effects of}} [...] "business-as-usual" [...] climate change damages. A high <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> reduces the calculated benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using too low a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> wastes resources because it will result in too much investment in cutting emissions (Arrow et al., 1996, p. 130). Too high a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> will have the opposite effect, and lead to under-investment in cutting emissions.

40|$|Purpose – Venture capitalists {{typically}} use <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in {{the range}} of 30 - 70 percent. During the startup stage of venture-capital financing, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> between 50 and 70 percent are common. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> decreases from the first through fourth stage: from 60 to 30 percent. These rates of return are high compared to historical returns on common stocks or small stocks (12. 1 and 17. 8 percent, respectively). Such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> cannot also be explained in the context of any existing asset pricing theory; that is, any reasonable risk-adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are not consistent with <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in the order of 30 - 60 percent. The paper provides a rational economic explanation why venture capitalists (VC) use such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Let the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> of a venture project be 15 percent; this <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the systematic risk of the cash flows from the project given that the project is successful. Using the procedure, a VC who estimates the probability of eventual success of the project between 60 and 40 percent will impose a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> between 42 and 74 percent. These <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are quite similar to the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> charged by VC in their startup and first stages. Findings – The high rates of return charged by VC reflect the fact that not all their projects succeed in that they have no net cash-inflows. Adjusting for the probability of success of the project provides estimates of <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> comparable. Originality/value – The paper argues that reported rates of return of common stock are relevant for projects that have succeeded in that they have net cash-inflows...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> {{are used}} in calculating the value of future costs and benefits. However, standard <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> may not accurately describe the decision-making of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). These patients often choose the long-term risks of immunosuppressive therapy over the short-term risks of colectomy, demonstrating very high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> for future health. In this study we aimed to measure the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in UC patients and identify variables associated with the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Methods: We surveyed patients with UC and patients who were postcolectomy for UC to measure their valuations of UC and colectomy health states. We used Standard Gamble (SG) and Time-Trade-Off (TTO) methods to assess current and future health state valuations and calculated the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: Participants included 150 subjects with UC and 150 subjects who were postcolectomy for UC. Adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> varied widely (0 %– 100 %), with an overall median rate of 55. 0 % (interquartile range [IQR] 20. 6 – 100), which {{was significantly higher than}} the standard rate of 5 %. Within the normal range of <b>discount</b> <b>rates,</b> patients' expected <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> increased by 0. 80 % for each additional year of age, and female patients had <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> that averaged ≈ 8 % less than their age-matched counterparts and approached statistical significance. Conclusions: The accepted <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> of 5 % grossly underestimates UC patients' preference for long-term over short-term risk.
