5000|$|In telecommunication, a Berger code is a {{unidirectional}} error detecting code, {{named after}} its inventor, J. M. Berger. Berger codes can detect all unidirectional errors. Unidirectional errors are errors that only flip ones into zeroes or only zeroes into ones, {{such as in}} asymmetric channels. The check bits of Berger codes are computed by summing all the zeroes in the <b>information</b> <b>word,</b> and expressing that sum in natural binary. If the <b>information</b> <b>word</b> consists of [...] bits, then the Berger code needs [...] "check bits", giving a Berger code of length k+n. (In other words, the [...] check bits are enough to check up to [...] information bits).Berger codes can detect any number of one-to-zero bit-flip errors, as long as no zero-to-one errors occurred in the same code word.Similarly, Berger codes can detect any number of zero-to-one bit-flip errors, as long as no one-to-zero bit-flip errors occur in the same code word.Berger codes cannot correct any error.|$|E

5000|$|The {{format of}} Control Space is {{determined}} by a 5-bit Subframe mode identifier transmitted in the Framing <b>Information</b> <b>word.</b> This communicates the Subframe length {{and the number of}} control Slots.

Adding the limitations that the number of control Slots must be less than the Subframe length produces 26 valid combinations. A special encoding for [...] "100% Control Space", in which case the Subframe length is unimportant, produces 27 valid modes. (Modes 1-3, 20 and 30 are not valid.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Ambiguous {{information}} is “a piece of <b>information</b> (<b>word,</b> message, or view) with multiple interpretations.” [...] In {{our daily lives}} we often come across ambiguous input when we don’t {{have all of the}} necessary information to make an accurate interpretation. Adults not only have the awareness to realize when ambiguity exists, but they also have strategies to deal with ambiguous input. Young children have difficulty with recognizing ambiguity and understanding how to handle it. Typically, it is not until the age of 6 or 7 that children have the ability to successfully deal with ambiguous input. However, it seems in certain contexts with certain tasks, younger children also display some ability to deal with ambiguous information.|$|E
5000|$|The {{grammatical}} {{agent is}} often {{confused with the}} subject, but these two notions are quite distinct: the former is based explicitly on {{its relationship to the}} action or event expressed by the verb, whereas the latter is based on the flow of <b>information,</b> <b>word</b> order, and importance to the sentence. In a sentence such as [...] "The boy kicked the ball", [...] "the boy" [...] is the agent and the subject. However, when the sentence is rendered in the passive voice, [...] "The ball was kicked by the boy", [...] "the ball" [...] is the grammatical subject, but [...] "the boy" [...] is still the agent. Many sentences in English and other Indo-European languages have the agent as subject.|$|E

Constable Odo (René Auberjonois) begins an investigation as Sisko, Kira and Worf head to Jeraddo. Once there, the trio discover a mural at the temple. Returning to the station, they have the mural analyzed and find that it depicts the three Orbs of the Pah-wraiths and the wormhole, but offers no solid <b>information.</b> <b>Word</b> then arrives from Cardassia that Provost Dejar of the Carnellian Circle is on her way to investigate the dead bodies, who are believed to have been members of Gul Dukat's elite personal guard.

At this point, the sealed Cardassian laboratory is discovered, with the Orb still in statis inside. Sisko takes Dejar to the lab, but soon learns that Dejar is in fact an Obsidian Order operative, Prefect Terrell. She steals the Orb and escapes with it.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{word space}} models is usually local {{in the sense}} that it only {{considers}} words that are deemed very similar by the model. We propose a global evaluation scheme based on clustering of the words. A clustering of high quality in an external evaluation against a semantic resource, such as a dictionary of synonyms, indicates a word space model of high quality. We use Random Indexing to create several different models and compare them by clustering evaluation against the People’s Dictionary of Synonyms, a list of Swedish synonyms that are graded by the public. Most notably we get better results for models based on syntagmatic <b>information</b> (<b>words</b> that appear together) than for models based on paradigmatic <b>information</b> (<b>words</b> that appear in similar contexts).
