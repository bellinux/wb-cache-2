40|$|Background: Research on the {{aetiology}} of late-life depression has typically {{focused on}} either risk factors from the psychosocial stress-vulnerability domain or degenerative biological changes (for instance, vascular disease). We examined whether vascular risk factors {{could be interpreted}} within the stress-vulnerability model of depression. Methods: The data came from a case-control design, nested in a community survey of elderly people. We compared 83 persons with a recently started episode of major or minor depression with 83 controls, {{with respect to the}} occurrence of stressful life events, long-term difficulties, neuroticism, and vascular risk factors (hypertension, heart disease, stroke). Results: The (nonsignificant) association of vascular risk factors and onset of depressive episodes was not modified by neuroticism or the presence of long-term difficulties. Quite unexpectedly, vascular risk factors seemed to neutralize the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of stressful life events. The effect of vascular risk was significantly stronger in depressive episodes not preceded by a life event than in onsets following an event. Conclusions: Vascular risk factors cannot be interpreted within the stress-vulnerability model, but represent another pathway to depression. Why vascular risk factors reduce the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of stressful life events is not clear. Replication is critical to exclude the possibility of a chance finding.

40|$|Background: Stressful {{life events}} {{increase}} {{the probability of}} depressive problems in early adolescence. Several genetic and environmental risk factors may change individual sensitivity to the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of these events. We examined modification by parental depression and gender, and mediation of the former by temperament and family environment. Methods: Data were collected {{as part of a}} longitudinal cohort study of (pre) adolescents (n = 2127). During the first assessment wave at approximately age 11, we assessed parental depression, family functioning, perceived parenting behaviours, and temperamental frustration and fearfulness. At the second wave, {{about two and a half}} years later, stressful life events between the first and second assessment were assessed. Depressive problems were measured at both waves. Results: Adolescents with parents who had a (lifetime) depressive episode were more sensitive to the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of stressful events than adolescents without depressed parents. Furthermore, girls are more sensitive to these effects than boys. The modifying effect of parental depression was not mediated by temperament, family functioning and perceived parenting. Limitations: Life events were assessed without consideration of contextual information. Depressive problems were measured by questionnaires that did not directly represent DSM-IV criteria. The measure of parental depression was unspecific regarding severity and timing of depressive episodes. Conclusion: The results suggest that gender and parental depression are associated with increased sensitivity to depression after experiencing stressful life events during adolescence.

40|$|Abstract Response styles theory {{promotes}} rumination as {{a central}} cognitive construct driving negative mood and depres-sion, and past research suggests that {{at least part of}} the mechanism driving rumination’s <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> is through inhibiting the individual’s ability to shift attentional focus away from negative environmental stimuli.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we have {{investigated}} the effects of silymarine on depression and the possible role of serotonergic system in these effects. The rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine hydrochloride {{and placed in a}} Stoelting stereotaxic instrument. A stainless steel guide cannula (22 -gauge) was implanted in the third ventricular region. The third ventricular region was infused by means of an internal cannula (27 -gauge), terminated 1 mm below the tip of the guide cannula. Forced swimming test was used for evaluating the depression. The results obtained from this study showed that oral administration of silymarin (35, 70, 140 and 280 mg/rat) for two weeks increased the immobility time in forced swimming test, indicating an increase in depression level of the treated rats. Intra-third-ventricle (Intra-TV) infusion of 5 HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (25 and 10 ng/rat) decreased the immobility time indicating an anti-depression effect, while injection of 5 HT 1 A receptor antagonist NAN 190 (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 µg/rat) had no significant effect on immobility time. An effective dose of 8 -OH-DPAT (10 ng/rat) co-administered with silymarin (140 and 280 mg/rat) decreased the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of silymarin.

40|$|CONTEXT: Genetic {{moderation}} of the depression-inducing {{effects of}} {{stressful life events}} (SLEs) has been reported, but findings suggest that genes may not moderate the effects of SLEs per se but instead may moderate the risk of depression associated with the stable tendency to develop negative emotions in response to minor environmental experiences. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a functional polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene (5 -HTTLPR) moderates the association between negative affectivity (neuroticism) and depression and to what degree this can explain previous findings involving SLEs. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study involving 1 baseline and 4 follow-up measurements in 15 months analyzing change in self-reported depressive symptoms across time {{as a function of}} negatively attributed SLEs, neuroticism, 5 -HTTLPR, and their interactions. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based sample of 374 ethnically homogeneous young adult female twins. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A continuous score of self-reported depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of SLEs in the 3 months before interview was significantly greater in women with 2 short (S) alleles compared with women with 1 or none. However, this effect disappeared after accounting for the effect of SLEs conditional on neuroticism. Similarly, the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of neuroticism was progressively greater with number of S alleles, and this was unchanged after accounting for the effect of neuroticism conditional on SLEs. CONCLUSIONS: Genotype x environment interactions in depression may be more productively interpreted by involving mechanisms more proximal to psychological experience itself. The probability that stress-related cognitive vulnerabilities for depression result in symptom formation may be moderated by a neurobiologic phenotype characterized by altered processing of negative emotions associated with variation in 5 -HTTLPR. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} depressive symptoms in older Dutch citizens (N = 3, 020) across religious denominations. Reformed Calvinists had the lowest depressive scores (CES-D); Protestants from liberal denominations the highest; Roman Catholics, Dutch Reformed, and nonchurch members were in between. Two types of explanatory mechanisms are examined: (a) social integration and (b) positive self-perceptions, which both help to prevent depression. Alternatively, strict Calvinist doctrines are hypothesized to enforce negative self-perceptions, facilitating depression. For 2, 509 respondents, complete data were available on social integration and self-perceptions, {{as well as on}} the parental religious denomination. Explanatory effects were tested using hierarchic regression models. The negative association between Calvinist background and depressive symptoms was partly explained by size of social network, and between Roman Catholic background and depressive symptoms by self-esteem.

40|$|Background: Depressive {{symptoms}} can {{be triggered}} by negative social experiences and individuals' processing of these experiences. This study focuses on the interaction between temperament, perceived parenting, and gender in relation to depressive problems in a Dutch population sample of preadolescents. Methods: The sample consisted of 2230 ten-to-twelve-year-olds from the North of the Netherlands. Perceived parenting (overprotection, rejection, emotional warmth) was assessed by the EMBU (a Swedish acronym for My Memories of Upbringing) for Children, temperament (fearfulness and frustration) by the parent version of the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised, and depressive problems by the Child Behavior Checklist (parent report) and the Youth Self-Report (child report). Results: All parenting and temperament factors {{were significantly associated with}} depressive problems. Frustration increased the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of parental overprotection and lack of emotional warmth. Fearfulness increased the effect of rejection in girls, but not in boys. Furthermore, the association between frustration and depression was stronger in boys.

40|$|Background: Although the {{etiology}} of clinical depression is unknown, {{women are more likely}} to suffer from major depressive disorder than men. The biological basis of gender differences in stress response and recovery still remain poorly understood. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate the gender specific behavioral, physiological and neurochemical aspects of rats exposed to chronic stress paradigm along with the recovery using antidepressant drug treatment in rats using Learned Helplessness (LH) model of depression. Methods: Stress induction was applied on rats through inescapable footshocks and subsequent shuttle-box escape test. Fluoxetine hydrochloride as antidepressant drug was used for recovery. Body weight and adrenal gland weight were measured. BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic factor) level in hippocampus was measured by sandwich ELISA. Estrous stages in female rats were also examined. Results: Rats of both sexes exhibited marked alteration in BDNF level, body weight and adrenal weight along with their escape latency. After antidepressant drug treatment restoration of normal behavior was also observed. In estrous cycle analysis the depressed female rats exhibited significant variations.

40|$|Background: Respiratory sinus {{arrhythmia}} (RSA) {{has been}} proposed as a physiological marker of emotion-regulation capacity, and shown to be cross-sectionally associated with depression. Little {{is known about the}} role of RSA as a predictor of (subclinical) depressive symptoms over time and as a modifier of the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of stressful life events (SLEs). Methods: In a longitudinal population-based study with data collected in 1653 adolescents twice (at age 11 and 13. 5 years, respectively), RSA was assessed in supine position at the first assessment wave. Depressive symptoms were assessed at both waves and SLEs experienced between the two waves at the last wave. Results: Low levels of RSA were not associated with concurrent or future depressive symptoms, and did not enhance the depressogenic effects of SLEs. Conclusions: In a normal population of young adolescents, a low level of RSA does not identify adolescents at risk for depressive symptoms when confronted with SLEs. In post hoc analyses, among those reporting high exposure to stressful life events, higher RSA tended to predict less self-reported anxiety and more self-reported somatic symptoms as compared to those with lower RSA.

40|$|Self-criticism {{has been}} shown to be a {{vulnerability}} factor that can lead to and maintain depression. We examined the moderating effect of fear of receiving compassion from others on the positive association between self-criticism and depression. Self-report measures were administered to four separate samples (total N = 701) varying in age (students and community adults) and cultural context (Canada, England, and Portugal). Two different measures of self-criticism and of depression were administered to investigate the generalizability of results. Self-criticism, depression, and fear of compassion from others were positively related to one another in all samples. As predicted, fear of compassion from others exerted a moderating effect on the relationship between self-criticism and depression. Low fear of compassion from others weakened the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of self-criticism, while high fear of compassion from others exacerbated the effect. Thus, a self-critic's ability to be open and responsive to care and support from others protected against depression. The aggregate moderating effect across the four studies was of medium size (d + =. 53) and highly significant, indicating a robust phenomenon. Implications for working with self-critical depressed patients are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rimonabant is a {{cannabinoid}} type 1 receptor (CB 1) antagonist formerly used {{to treat}} obesity, but which was withdrawn from the market in late 2008 because of its association with psychiatric adverse effects such as depression and anxiety. Previously, we showed that a single dose of rimonabant produced a negative bias on an emotional word memory task, {{in the absence of}} subjective mood effects. The present study investigated whether a similar effect on emotional processing could be seen after 7 days' daily treatment with rimonabant 20 mg, using a randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design in healthy volunteers (final n = 21). In comparison with placebo, rimonabant induced a negative bias on a memory recognition task without producing a change in subjective mood.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: Despite recent small {{reductions}} in overall suicide rates, rates among those aged 25 – 44 have remained high. The {{aim of this}} paper was to examine the evidence for a link between alcohol misuse/consumption and suicidal behaviour, explore the reasons for this association, and consider the implications for reducing rates of suicidal behaviour. Methods: A medline search was performed to find relevant research evidence. Results: There is evidence to suggest alcohol misuse predisposes to suicidal behaviour through its <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> and promotion of adverse life events, and both behaviours may share a common genetic predisposition. Acute alcohol use can also precipitate suicidal behaviours through induction of negative affect and impairment of problem-solving skills, as well as aggravation of impulsive personality traits, possibly through effects on serotonergic neurotransmission. Conclusions: Effective interventions for problem drinking may help reduce suicide rates. At a public health level, reducing overall alcohol consumption may be beneficial, and the measures shown to be most effective in this regard are those that aim to restrict availability of alcohol...|$|R
40|$|Stress-borne {{alterations}} in social functioning confer risk for subsequent development of mental disorders. Reports of stress-induced attenuation of incentive-driven behavior propose a plausible underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, and warrant {{exploration of the}} social aspects of the stress-reward connection. In the current study, we investigated the effects of social stress on reward sensitivity by inducing social stress in a laboratory experiment. We then extended this study to real-life by examining the fluctuation in reward experience in relation to exposure to social stress using the experience sampling method. In the laboratory settings, social stress impaired preference for rewards relative to the pre-stress assessment, while sensitivity to punishments remained intact. Simultaneously, exposure to social stress was associated with decreased positive affect and self-esteem. We confirmed these findings in the real world, where social stress was associated with diminished positive affect as well as blunted consummatory and anticipatory reward. These converging results from both experiments add a crucial social dimension to the established <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of stress, exposing a link between social stress and compromised hedonic capacity and volition. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The most {{frequent}} serious psychological {{side effect of}} immune therapies is depression. In the present study, we tested whether social support, as a positive environmental effect, is able to moderate depression or anxiety symptoms in melanoma patients during adjuvant low-dose interferon treatment. METHODS: Hundred and twenty-seven melanoma patients with negative psychiatric history were included in our longitudinal study and followed up for one year. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured six times during treatment: at baseline, at 1 st, 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th and 12 th month of the therapy. In addition, social support was investigated with the Social Dimension Scale. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms significantly increased during the 12 -month follow-up period (p< 0. 001). However, social support significantly moderated the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of low-dose interferon treatment (p< 0. 001). Patients with better social support showed attenuated increase of depression. Anxiety showed no significant changes during the low-dose interferon treatment (p= 0. 230). Social support had no moderating effect on anxiety symptoms (p= 0. 745) during the follow up. DISCUSSION: Our data provide evidence that social support and interferon alpha treatment significantly interact {{in the development of}} depression. In addition, our study emphasises that enhancement of social support can reduce depressogenic side effects and increase compliance during adjuvant interferon treatment, and thus, psychological screening and psychooncological counselling should be incorporated in the treatment protocol...|$|E

NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV XX(X), XXX-XXX, 2010. - Adolescence is characterized by major biological, psychological, and social challenges, {{as well as by}} an increase in depression rates. This review focuses on the association between stressful experiences and depression in adolescence, and the possible role of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex (HPA-) axis in this link. Adolescent girls have a higher probability to develop depressive symptoms than adolescent boys and preadolescents. Increasing evidence indicates that girls' higher risk of depression is partly brought about by an increased sensitivity for stressful life events, particularly interpersonal stressors, which are highly prevalent in adolescent girls. Genetic risk factors for depression, as well as those for stress sensitivity, are often expressed differently in girls and boys. Also environmental adversity tends to affect girls' stress responses more than those of boys. These gender-specific association patterns have been reported for both sensitivity to stressful life events and HPA-axis responses to social stress. Together, the finding suggest that girls are more malleable than boys in response to internal and external influences. This postulated greater malleability may be adaptive in many circumstances, but also brings along risk, such as an increased probability of depression...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Relationship {{between the}} chronic and {{excessive}} ex-posure to glucocorticoids {{and the development}} of psychiatric disorders, including depression, has been described in the liter-ature. We decided to investigate whether a combination of agents with antidepressant activity (i. e., imipramine, ketamine, and Zn 2 +) may influence/reverse the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of dexamethasone therapy. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test in adult mice. The inhibitory activity of dexamethasone was dose-dependent: only the highest tested dose of the glucocorticoid (i. e., 64 μg/kg) given as a single injection increased immobility time, whereas 16 μg/ kg/day of dexamethasone administered repeatedly (for 14 days) induced a significant alteration in animal behavior. Both the acute or sub-chronic administration of the active doses of imip-ramine (10 mg/kg), Zn 2 + (30 mg/kg), and ketamine (30 mg/kg), and the combinations of their per se inactive doses reversed the inhibitory activity of dexamethasone (16 μg/kg/day) adminis-tered for 14 consecutive days. Whereas a single injection of an inhibitory dose of dexamethasone (64 μg/kg) was not able to abolish the antidepressant effect of imipramine (5 mg/kg), Zn 2 + (10 mg/kg), and imipramine-Zn 2 + combination (2. 5 and 5 mg/kg, respectively) given once a day for 14 consecutive days. Our findings indicate that the chronic dexamethasone injection procedure has some potential as an animal model of depression and they further support the theory of interplay be-tween glutamatergic neurotransmission and the chronic or ex-cessive exposition to glucocorticoids...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{anti-apoptotic}} protein Bax inhibitor- 1 (BI- 1) is a regulator of apoptosis {{linked to}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and BI- 1 －/ － mice exhibit increased sensitivity to tissue damage. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the role of BI- 1 in the pathogenesis of chronic mild stress (CMS) -induced depression-like behaviors in BI- 1 －/ － mice. Methods: We delivered CMS for 2 or 6 weeks in BI- 1 -knockout and wild-type mice. Control groups of BI- 1 -knockout and wild-type mice were left undisturbed. The measured parameters were sucrose consumption at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, sponta-neous locomotion, and a forced swimming test (FST) at weeks 2 and 6. Results: Significant decreases in sucrose consumption and increases in immobility time in the FST were observed in both stress groups compared with the non-stress groups. Interestingly, at week 2, but not at week 6, BI- 1 －/－-stress mice showed less sucrose intake and greater immobility time than did BI- 1 ＋/＋-stress mice.

40|$|During the {{transition}} to adolescence, several developmental trends converge to increase the importance of peer relationships, the likelihood of peer-related stressors, {{and the experience of}} depressive symptoms. Simultaneously, there are significant changes in parent–child relationships. The current study sought to evaluate whether positive relationship quality with parents continued to serve a protective effect by buffering the relationship between stressful life events, especially peer stress, and increases in depressive symptoms throughout {{the transition}} to adolescence. Participants in a large (N 692) 2 -site accelerated longitudinal study were recruited in 3 rd, 6 th, and 9 th grade and followed every 3 months for 1 year. At baseline, parents and youth reported on parent–child relationship quality, and every 3 months thereafter reported on their levels of stressors and depressive symptoms. Parent relationship quality moderated the relationship of person-level fluctuations in peer stressors, such that there was a stronger association between peer stressors and increases in depressive symptoms in youth with lower levels of positive parental relationship quality. This effect was specific to peer stressors. These results suggest that low levels of parent relationship quality leave youth particularly vulnerable to the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of peer stressors from childhood through adolescence...|$|R
40|$|A strong {{association}} between functional disability and depressive symptoms in older people has frequently been reported. Some studies attribute this association to the disabling effects of depression, {{others to the}} <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of physical health-related disability. The authors examined the reciprocal effects between depressive symptoms and functional disability and their temporal character in a community-based cohort of 753 older people with physical limitations who were assessed at yearly intervals. They compared structural equation models that differed in terms of direction and speed of effects between patient-reported disability in instrumental and basic {{activities of daily living}} (IADL/ADLs) and depressive symptoms. The {{association between}} disability and depression could be separated into three components: (a) a strong contemporaneous effect of change in disability on depressive symptoms, (b) a weaker 1 -year lagged effect of change in depressive symptoms on disability (probably indirect through physical health), and (c) a weak correlation between the trait (or stable) components of depression and disability. IADL/ADL disability and depressive symptoms are thus mutually reinforcing over time. Compensatory forces like effective treatment and age-related adaptation may protect elders against this potential downward trend. To improve quality of life in elderly adults, treatment should target disability when it is new and depression when it is persistent...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Stressful life events, longterm difficulties, {{and high}} {{neuroticism}} are established {{risk factors for}} depression. Less is known about their role in late-life depression, how they modify or mediate one another's effects, and whether this differs between major and subsyndromal, first and recurrent episodes. Method: The authors used a prospective case-control design nested in a community survey of elderly subjects that included a measure of neuroticism. They compared 83 survey participants who subsequently developed a depressive episode with 83 randomly selected comparison participants. The authors determined dates of onset, history, and severity of episodes and dates of occurrence and severity of stressful life events and difficulties. Results: Stressful life events did not mediate the effects of high neuroticism and difficulties at onset, possibly because of the uncontrollable nature of common stressful life events in later life. Without both high neuroticism and difficulties, stressful life events did not increase risk. High neuroticism and difficulties increased risk, even without a stressful life event. In the presence of high neuroticism and/or difficulties, the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of stressful life events was substantial, suggesting effect modification. The authors found no evidence to suggest etiological discontinuity between major and subsyndromal episodes. First and recurrent episodes showed a discontinuous pattern of associations. Severe stressful life events had weaker associations, but high neuroticism and mild stressful life events had stronger associations with recurrent than with first episodes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the usefulness of a dynamic stress-vulnerability model for understanding late-life depression. Evidence was found suggesting etiological discontinuity between first and recurrent but not between major and subsyndromal episodes...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Pharmacology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Methamphetamine (MA) is a well-known, easily {{accessible}} and powerful psychostimulant, and its abuse {{has become a}} global problem. MA abuse affects millions of people worldwide and places an enormous burden on public healthcare resources. Documented consequences of MA abuse include cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and teratogenic effects, as well as long-term consequences of chronic abuse including affective disorders such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is a highly prevalent mood disorder in both adults and children, documented to contribute to approximately 850 000 suicides annually. This disorder is projected to become the 2 nd leading disease of global burden by 2020, preceded only by ischemic heart disease. Depressive-like behaviour is documented as a symptom of chronic MA abuse and particularly during extensive MA withdrawal. Also, MA abuse during pregnancy is documented to cause neurodevelopmental changes that persist into later life. However, current understanding thereof is limited and warrants further investigation {{of the effects of}} early-life exposure to MA on outcome in adulthood, particularly in terms of mood disorders. The aim of the current {{study was to determine the}} effect of chronic exposure to MA on the depressive-like behaviour later in life in stress-sensitive (Flinders Sensitive Line) and control (Flinders Resistant Line) rats. Rats were exposed during one of the following natal day (ND) age groups: prenatal (ND- 13 to ND+ 02), postnatal (ND+ 03 to ND+ 18), prepuberty (ND+ 19 to ND+ 34) or puberty (ND+ 35 to ND+ 50). These age groups represent different stages in neurodevelopment, as also seen in humans. For prenatal exposure, pregnant dams received 5 mg/kg daily subcutaneously (s. c.), and pups from postnatal, prepuberty and puberty age groups received an escalating dose regimen to simulate “binge-dosing” commonly seen in humans abusing MA. After MA exposure, rats were housed normally until behavioural testing on postnatal day 60 (ND+ 60), which included the novel object recognition test (NOR), open field test (OFT) and forced swim test (FST), measuring cognitive function, locomotor activity and depressive-like behaviour respectively. The FST data showed increased immobility behaviour of saline-treated FSL rats relative to that of FRL rats, in line with previous data validating FSL rats as a genetic rodent model of depression. Practically significant MA-induced increases in immobility behaviour were observed in all FSL and FRL treatment groups in the FST, reaching statistical significance in prenatally treated FRL rats, and in postnatally, prepuberty and puberty treated FSL rats. The data suggest that early-life MA exposure may alter neurodevelopment to predispose the rats to display depressive-like behaviour in early adulthood, and suggests that this detrimental effect of MA may be more expressed in stress-sensitive rats. Furthermore, all FSL groups plus prenatally and puberty treated FRL rats revealed practically and statistically significant decreases in swimming behaviour in the FST, whereas decreases in swimming behaviour in prepuberty treated FRL rats were practically significant but did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that MA-induced depressive-like behaviour in FSL rats may be related to impaired serotonergic neurotransmission, and that this appears to be more robust in FSL rats. Climbing behaviour in the FST was generally not altered by early-life MA exposure, with a notable exception being a practically and statistically significant increase in puberty treated FRL rats. These data suggest that in general early-life MA exposure does not affect noradrenergic neurotransmission in early adulthood, except when normal rats were treated at puberty. The reason for the latter observation is not clear. The data from the NOR test revealed no discernible trends of MA-induced effects on memory and cognition, except for a small albeit practically significant increase in exploration time in prepuberty treated FRL rats and a practically and statistically significant decrease in exploration time in puberty-treated FRL rats. Lastly, locomotor activity in the OFT was mostly unaffected by MA treatments, except for practically significant decreases in locomotor activity in postnatally-and prepuberty-treated FRL rats and practically and statistically significant decreases in locomotor activity of prepuberty treated FSL rats. Altered locomotor activity is therefore not expected to explain any of the immobility results of the FST. In final conclusion, the study confirms that early-life MA exposure results in a <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> later in life in stress-sensitive (FSL) and control (FRL) rats, but appears to be more robust in stress-sensitive animals. Furthermore the data suggest that long-lasting MA-induced depressogenic effects may relate to impaired serotonergic neurotransmission. Master...|$|E

In fact, METH {{is one of the}} most commonly abused substances with an estimated 35 million abusers worldwide and is said to be the second most popular illicit drug. The Western Province of South Africa has seen a dramatic increase in drug abuse in recent years where METH is the primary or secondary drug of abuse. Interestingly, more than 50 % of these individuals are under the age of 20 years. The longer duration of euphoric effects of METH has attracted many users away from cocaine in favour of METH. In addition to the rapid euphoric effect of METH, the direct short-term effects include arousal, reduced fatigue, an increase in blood pressure, reduced appetite as well as sustained attention. Chronic METH abuse may result in debilitating and long-lasting effects that includes mood disorders such as depression. Studies suggest a strong relationship between exposure to adverse environmental factors early in life and the later development of a neuropsychiatric disorder, such as depression. However, these severe consequences do not seem to invoke cessation of the drug. The euphoric and addictive properties of METH causes users to abuse the drug with an increase in frequency and dose, even though it might not have been their original intention. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of early-life administration of METH to stress-sensitive (Flinders Sensitive Line - FSL) and control (Flinders Resistant Line - FRL) rats on depressive-like behaviour and regional brain monoamine levels later in life. The study implemented a sixteen-day period for administration of METH or a vehicle control from postnatal day 19 (PnD 19) to postnatal day 34 (PnD 34). The latter developmental stage corresponds to pre-adolescence in the rat when neurological development are similar to that seen in human adolescents, and represents the stage when drug abuse is most common in humans. Chronic dosing of METH and saline was performed twice daily at 09 : 00 and at 15 : 00. The animals received a sub-cutaneous (SC) escalating dose regimen of METH during the 16 day period (mimicking binging behaviour in humans), with every dose escalating in increments of 0. 2 mg/kg from 0. 2 mg/kg to 6. 0 mg/kg. The study then investigated whether early-life administration of METH would cause depressive-like behaviours directly after the injection period (immediate drug effects before withdrawal on PnD 35) or later in life (after the withdrawal period in early adulthood on PnD 60). The behavioural effects were assessed in a battery of tests and thereafter the rats were sacrificed and the frontal cortex removed and snap frozen for later analyses of altered neurochemistry. The study demonstrated that chronic METH treatment during pre-adolescence induces significant behavioural changes related to depression in humans directly after the injection period (PnD 35) and later in life (PnD 60). The animals displayed antidepressant-like behaviour in the forced swim test (FST) before withdrawal, yet a <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effect</b> was observed 25 days post-withdrawal. This effect also seems to be additive to the congenital depressive-like phenotype of FSL rats, suggesting a role for genetic susceptibility. This observation would be in line with the two-hit hypothesis of depression, suggesting that the manifestation of depression will result when a genetic predisposition is followed by an environmental stressor (i. e. METH) later in life. The data suggests a working hypothesis that individuals that already have a predisposition to depression may be more susceptible to developing depression when abusing METH. The fact that the FSL control rats were more immobile than FRL control rats also confirmed the face validity of the FSL genetic rat model of depression. Locomotor activity assessment indicated that METH treatment decreased locomotor activity in FSL and FRL rats compared to their vehicle controls on PnD 35 but not on PnD 60. It is important to note that the effects observed in locomotor activity could not have contributed to the immobility observed in the FST, confirming that the immobility in the FST indeed reflects psychomotor and not locomotor effects. The study also demonstrated that METH significantly lowers social interaction behaviour in both FRL and FSL rats, both immediately following drug treatment (PnD 35) and after withdrawal (PnD 60). It is therefore clear that this effect of METH is long-lasting, putatively related to neurodevelopmental effects. In addition, the rats investigated the familiar object for a greater amount of time in the novel object recognition test (nORT) on PnD 35 and PnD 60 and may be the result of loss of recognition memory for the familiar object. This data confirms that METH results in cognitive memory deficits probably due to sustained adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Neurochemical analyses of the frontal cortex indicated decreased serotonin (5 -HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels on PnD 35. METH is widely recognised for its pro-inflammatory effects, while the reduced 5 -HT levels observed may have been the result of an increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Neurochemical analyses provided thought-provoking data concerning the role of the permissive hypotheses of depression, indicating that dopamine (DA) is most likely not responsible for the behavioural effects observed, at least under the current study conditions, whereas 5 -HT is decidedly more involved than expected. The data also suggest that depletion in NE plays a role in the development of depressive-like behaviours following METH exposure. Based on these findings, we propose that disturbances in 5 -HT and NE are a crucial mechanism in how METH abuse may precipitate or worsen depressive-like symptoms in individuals who abuse METH. It should be noted that this study does not discard the role of DA in the development of depression after METH exposure, although under the current study conditions it appears that DA does not play a central role. The current study demonstrated that pre-adolescent exposure to METH can reproduce most of the behavioural changes seen in depressed individuals, and that these behavioural data can be used to identify causal neurochemical factors. Environmental stressors such as METH abuse should be regarded as an additional diagnostic criterion and is relevant to an accumulative risk factor hypothesis. Furthermore, although further study is required, the data suggests that early-life exposure to METH may predispose an individual to mood disorders and behavioural abnormalities later in life.

40|$|Stress is an {{important}} risk factor {{for the development of}} depression, but {{little is known about the}} neurobiological mechanisms by which stress might promote depressive symptomatology. The hippocampus and amygdala are susceptible to the detrimental effects of prolonged elevated stress hormone levels and neuroplastic changes within these brain regions have been linked to the onset of depression. Some of the neurobiological changes associated with prolonged elevated glucocorticoids include decreased neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, dendritic morphology, and spine density within the hippocampus and increased dendritic morphology and spine density in the amygdala. Interestingly, recent evidence has described a regulatory role for the extracellular matrix protein reelin in synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neurogenesis, dendritic arborization, and spine density. Moreover, reelin has been shown to be decreased in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Combined, these results suggest that reelin may be an interesting protein to examine in regard to the pathogenesis of depression and to further elucidate potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disorder. The goal of the current research was to provide a comprehensive examination into the role of repeated stress on reelin and neural plasticity in the pathogenesis of depression through multiple preclinical studies. Given the association between reelin and hippocampal plasticity, in chapter 2 the effects of repeated exposure to corticosterone (CORT) or physical restraint on reelin expression in specific hippocampal regions were examined. Results revealed that there was a significant decrease in the number of reelin-positive cells in the CA 1 stratum lacunosum and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in rats that received CORT, but not in rats that received restraint. Interestingly, these results parallel our laboratory’s previous observation that CORT increases depression-like behavior but physical restraint does not. As reelin was decreased in the subgranular zone, it suggests that this protein is in a prime location to influence neurogenesis. Accordingly, chapter 3 focused on assessing the effects of different durations of CORT on behavior, hippocampal reelin expression, and neurogenesis, by subjecting rats to 7, 14 or 21 days of repeated CORT injections (40 mg/kg, s. c.) or vehicle injections. Results revealed that both the 14 -day and 21 -day CORT-treated rats showed increased depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test, significantly fewer reelin-positive cells and decreased neurogenesis compared to the control rats. In chapter 4, mice with a genetic deficit in reelin expression were used to examine their vulnerability to the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of CORT. We hypothesized that heterozygous reeler mice (HRM), with approximately 50 % normal levels of reelin, would be more sensitive to the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of CORT than wild-type mice (WTM). Mice received injections of either vehicle, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/kg of CORT, and then were assessed for changes in depression-like behavior, reelin expression, and neurogenesis. The effects of CORT on behavior, the number of reelin-positive cells, and hippocampal neurogenesis were more pronounced in the HRM than in the WTM, providing support for the idea that mice with impaired reelin signaling are more vulnerable to the deleterious effects of glucocorticoids. As reelin is expressed in GABAergic interneurons and our previous studies consistently revealed decreases in reelin number following CORT exposure, in chapter 5 the effects of repeated CORT and restraint stress on GABAergic and glutamatergic markers in the hippocampus and amygdala were examined. Western blotting analyses revealed that CORT significantly decreased the GABAergic markers, GAD 65 and the α 2 receptor subunit, and increased the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT 2 within the hippocampus. We also found that corticosterone decreased the GABAergic markers, GAD 67 and the α 2 receptor subunit, in the amygdala. Restraint stress had no significant effect in either of these areas. These findings suggest that the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of CORT may be related to alterations in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission within these structures. Together these results support a relationship between glucocorticoid-induced depressive-like behavior and decreases in reelin, neurogenesis and GABAergic signaling and provide support for investigating reelin as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of depression...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increasing {{evidence}} supports that mentalization deficits {{may have a}} role in the genesis of young age depression; however, few studies examined this issue in clinical populations. Methods: Outpatients aged 14 – 21, suffering from various psychiatric disorders, were assessed using the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), using data from age-matched healthy students for comparison. The relationship between CTQ, MZQ, and BDI scores was examined at the cross-sectional level, including mediation analyses, and longitudinally, in a subsample who underwent a psychotherapy intervention. Results: Of 83 subjects, 33 (39. 8 %) had mentalization levels that were 1 standard deviation below those of comparison subjects. In the whole sample, the levels of mentalization were inversely associated with BDI (r = −. 68, p <. 001) and CTQ scores (r = −. 30, p =. 006). Moreover, MZQ scores mediated {{a large part of the}} effect of childhood trauma on depression (total effect: 10. 6, 95 % CI: 5. 3, 15. 9; direct effect: 6. 5, 95 % CI: 2. 1, 10. 8; indirect effect: 4. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 5, 7. 4). This effect was almost entirely explained by the Affect Regulation subscale. In patients re-evaluated after four sessions (n =  37), the decrease in BDI scores correlated with the increase in MZQ scores (r =. 40, p =. 02). Conclusions: In a juvenile clinical sample, deficits of mentalization abilities were associated with the severity of depression and explained part of the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of childhood trauma...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is two-fold: 1) {{to identify}} novel biological pathways implicating individual differences in reward and threat processing {{in the emergence of}} risk and resilience for psychopathology, 2) to identify novel genetic and epigenetic predictors of the inter-individual variability in these biological pathways. Four specific studies are reported wherein blood oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure individual differences in threat-related amygdala reactivity and reward-related ventral striatum (VS) reactivity; self-report was used to measure of mood and psychopathology as well as the experience of stressful life events. In addition, DNA was derived from peripheral tissues to identify specific genetic and epigenetic markers. Results from Study 1 demonstrate that individuals with relatively low reward-related VS reactivity show stress-related reductions in positive affect, while those with high VS reactivity remain resilient to these potentially <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> Heightened VS reactivity was, however, associated with stress-related increases in problem drinking in Study 2. Importantly, this effect only occurred in individuals showing concomitantly reduced threat-related amygdala reactivity. Study 3 demonstrates that using a multilocus genetic profile capturing the cumulative impact of five functional polymorphic loci on dopamine signaling increases power to explain variability in reward-related VS reactivity relative to an approach considering each locus independently. Finally, Study 4 provides evidence that methylation in the proximal promoter of the serotonin transporter gene is negatively correlated with gene expression and positively correlated with threat-related amygdala reactivity above and beyond the effects of commonly studied functional DNA-sequence based variation in the same genomic vicinity. The results from these studies implicate novel biological pathways, namely reward-related VS reactivity and threat-related amygdala reactivity, as predictors of relative risk or resilience for psychopathology particularly in response to stressful life events. Moreover, the results suggest that genetic and epigenetic markers may serve as easily accessible peripheral tissue proxies for these neural phenotypes and, ultimately, risk and resilience. Such markers may eventually be harnessed to identify vulnerable individuals and facilitate targeted early intervention or prevention efforts. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Depression is {{a complex}} {{psychiatric}} illness that affects {{a large proportion of}} the population. Many researchers make use of preclinical animal models to study the behavioural and neurobiological characteristics of this disease. However, although a bias towards maladaptive thinking patterns and emotional responses is a cardinal symptom of depression, these symptoms have been rarely considered in preclinical models. One way to investigate maladaptive thinking is through the use of fear conditioning paradigms. Fear conditioning evaluates emotional memory by assessing a rodent’s ability to associate neutral cues with an aversive experience. It requires the activation of brain structures critically involved in emotion-related learning and memory processes, most notably the hippocampus and amygdala, to successfully learn the task. The primary goal of this dissertation was to gain a better understanding of the consequences of repeated corticosterone injections—a validated preclinical model of depression [...] on emotionally driven behaviour, the involvement of the hippocampus and amygdala in mediating these behaviours, and whether the antidepressant, fluoxetine, can prevent the effects of corticosterone on these behaviours. To begin, in Chapter 2 I confirmed that the <b>depressogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of corticosterone in the forced swim test, which is a traditional behavioural assay for depression in rodents, are not due to procedural differences or non-specific motor effects. I then investigated the impact of repeated corticosterone injections on the learning and memory of delay and contextual fear conditioning. I examined whether altering the order in which rats recall context versus tone cued fear associations determines the magnitude of corticosterone’s effect on conditioned fear. I found that corticosterone dose-dependently increased freezing to contextual cues whereas freezing to tone cues was increased regardless of dose. Furthermore, the order of the presentation of context versus tone cues during recall determined whether corticosterone produced significant enhancements in freezing. In Chapter 4, I investigated whether neuronal activity in the hippocampus and amygdala after recall of contextual or tone cued fear was associated with the effects of corticosterone found in Chapter 3. Recall of contextual cues was associated with neuronal activity in specific sub regions of the amygdala without any observed changes in the hippocampus. In Chapter 5, I investigated whether repeated corticosterone injections would also enhance the learning and memory of trace fear conditioning, a task that is heavily reliant on the hippocampus. I found that corticosterone increased freezing during recall of trace cues and enhanced the acquisition of trace cues. The results from this chapter, taken together with the results from chapters 3 and 4, suggest that repeated corticosterone exposure readily enhances learning and memory processes that evoke emotional arousal. In Chapter 6, I asked whether repeated treatment with the antidepressant, fluoxetine, could prevent increased fear learning produced by repeated corticosterone injections. I found that fluoxetine decreased freezing behaviour in corticosterone rats during recall of tone cues. Overall, the results of this dissertation further our understanding of the effects of corticosterone on learning and memory tasks that evoke emotional arousal, support the use of fear conditioning as a measure of depression-like behaviour, and demonstrate that repeated corticosterone injections reliably produce a depressive phenotype in rats...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances in the {{regulation}} of reward and aversion in the brain may underlie disorders such as obesity and eating disorders. We previously showed that the cannabis receptor subtype (CB 1) inverse agonist rimonabant, an antiobesity drug withdrawn due to <b>depressogenic</b> side <b>effects,</b> diminished neural reward responses yet increased aversive responses (Horder et al., 2010). Unlike rimonabant, tetrahydrocannabivarin is a neutral CB 1 receptor antagonist (Pertwee, 2005) and may therefore produce different modulations of the neural reward system. We hypothesized that tetrahydrocannabivarin would, unlike rimonabant, leave intact neural reward responses but augment aversive responses. Methods: We used a within-subject, double-blind design. Twenty healthy volunteers received a single dose of tetrahydrocannabivarin (10 mg) and placebo in randomized order on 2 separate occasions. We measured the neural response to rewarding (sight and/or flavor of chocolate) and aversive stimuli (picture of moldy strawberries and/or a less pleasant strawberry taste) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Volunteers rated pleasantness, intensity, and wanting for each stimulus. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between groups in subjective ratings. However, tetrahydrocannabivarin increased responses to chocolate stimuli in the midbrain, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and putamen. Tetrahydrocannabivarin also increased responses to aversive stimuli in the amygdala, insula, mid orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, and putamen. Conclusions: Our findings are the first to show that treatment with the CB 1 neutral antagonist tetrahydrocannabivarin increases neural responding to rewarding and aversive stimuli. This effect profile suggests therapeutic activity in obesity, perhaps with a lowered risk of depressive side effects. Keywords: reward, THCv, obesity, fMRI, cannabinoi...|$|R
