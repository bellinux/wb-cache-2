We vaccinated a cohort of two C 3 and 17 late complement component-deficient (LCCD) patients, revaccinated them 7 years later and investigated {{the development of their}} IgG antibodies to the capsular polysaccharides of the meningococcal vaccine. Seven years after the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> levels of IgG antibodies declined compared with the levels present at 6 months after the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination,</b> but were still at least four times higher than before vaccination. Levels of antibodies to Y polysaccharide in serum of complement-deficient patients were rather low but they did not differ significantly from those in serum of healthy non-related controls (P = 0. 07).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of vaccination against gonadotropin-releasing factor (GnRF) on testicular development, testosterone secretion, and physical activity in pubertal bulls. The experiment was performed using 44 bulls aged between 6 and 7 mo. Twenty-three animals were vaccinated twice 4 wk apart with 1 mL of Bopriva (Pfizer, Animal Health, Parkville, Australia) and 21 bulls served as matched controls. Serum GnRF antibody titer and testosterone concentration as well as body weight and scrotal circumference were determined in all bulls for 24 wk from the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> In addition, physical activity was analyzed in 11 vaccinated and in 10 control animals using the ALPRO DeLaval activity meter system (DeLaval AG, Sursee, Switzerland). The results show that vaccination significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced all parameters evaluated except body weight. Antibody titers to GnRF began to rise 2 wk after the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> and reached peak values 2 wk after the second injection. Significant group differences in anti-GnRF titer were present for 22 wk following the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Testosterone concentrations were significantly lower between weeks 6 to 24 after <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> in bulls with Bopriva compared with control animals. In vaccinated bulls testicular development was impaired after the second injection and scrotal circumference was significantly smaller between weeks 8 to 24 after <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Physical activity of vaccinated bulls was reduced after the booster injection with significant group differences for a continuous period of 106 days. In conclusion, vaccination against GnRF with Bopriva in pubertal bulls decreased testosterone levels in peripheral blood, testicular development, and physical activity but did not affect weight gain...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rabies, a {{zoonosis}} {{found throughout}} the globe, {{is caused by a}} virus of the Lyssavirus genus. The disease is transmitted to humans through the inoculation of the virus present in the saliva of infected mammals. Since its prognosis is usually fatal for humans, nationwide public campaigns to vaccinate dogs and cats against rabies aim to break the epidemiological link between the virus and its reservoirs in Brazil. Findings: During 12 months we evaluated the active immunity of dogs first vaccinated (booster shot at 30 days after <b>first</b> <b>vaccination)</b> against rabies using the Fuenzalida-Palacios modified vaccine in the urban area of Botucatu city, Sao Pauto state, Brazil.

40|$|AbstractQ fever is a {{zoonotic}} disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. The pathogen is prevalent in ruminants (goats, sheep, cows), {{which are the}} main sources of human infection. In the cattle industry around the world, animal (15 to 20 %) and herd (38 to 72 %) level prevalences of C. burnetii are high. Vaccination of ruminants against Q fever is considered important to prevent spreading {{of the disease and}} risk of infection in humans. However, published information on side effects of the Q fever vaccination under field conditions is limited for cows. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the phase I C. burnetii inactivated vaccine Coxevac on body temperature and milk yield in dairy cows. In 2 experiments, a total of 508 cows were randomly divided into 2 groups to determine the effect of <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> on body temperature and milk yield. The C. burnetii serostatus of all cows was tested before vaccination with an indirect ELISA. The first experiment took place in the teaching and research barn of the Clinic of Animal Reproduction at the Freie Universität Berlin. Temperature was measured vaginally in 10 cows in a crossover design. The second experiment was conducted on a commercial dairy farm. Milk yield of 498 cows was measured 1 wk before and 1 wk after vaccination. In a subset of 41 cows, temperature was measured rectally. In both experiments, body temperature increased significantly after vaccination (1. 0 ± 0. 9 °C and 0. 7 ± 0. 8 °C). A significant difference was also found in body temperature between vaccinated and control cows. Thirty percent of the vaccinated animals in experiment 1 showed reversible swelling at the injection site as a reaction to the vaccination. The results indicate that vaccination against Q fever causes a transient increase of body temperature that peaks in the first 12 to 24 h and declines after that. In experiment 2, vaccinated cows (26. 8 ± 0. 39 kg/d) produced significantly less milk than did control cows (28. 2 ± 0. 44 kg/d) 7 d after <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The cumulative milk loss after <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> was influenced by an interaction between C. burnetii serostatus and average milk yield 7 d before <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> This was considered as part of the physiological immune response. Three out of 10 vaccinated animals in experiment 1 showed painful swelling of the skin at the injection site, which had a maximum size of 14. 0 × 14. 0 × 1. 1 cm.

40|$|Many case-control {{studies have}} shown a {{protective}} effect of vaccinations on the risk of sudden unexplained death (SUD). In this paper we compare the properties of different statistical methods in this situation, when the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> appears to reduce the overall risk of an event (SUD). The first method is the self controlled case series (SCCS) method, which considers only subjects with an event during the observation time. This method yields unbiased estimates in the situation of non-censoring events. We show by simulation studies that the second method considered, the adjusted SCCS method, underestimates the parameter of interest, {{the effect of the}} first dose, when the general risk of SUD is lower in control periods after the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> than in the period before vaccination. This type of bias could be eliminated by considering only cases who had received at least one vaccination. Additionally, we compare the adjusted SCCS method with the Cox model as a third method. Cox regression can take into account the time before the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination,</b> and this method yields unbiased estimates at modest effect sizes and short risk periods. We applied the SCCS method and Cox regression to data from the German study on sudden infant death (GeSID) and to a case series study from Italy (the HERA study) examining sudden unexpected deaths and <b>vaccinations</b> during the <b>first</b> 2 years of life. We show that the adjusted SCCS analysis with all cases underestimates the vaccination effect, as expected from the simulation analyses.

A cattle-specific anti-GnRH vaccination (Bopriva, Zoetis Australia Ltd., West Ryde, Australia) is approved {{for use in}} heifers and bulls in New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, and Peru. Eleven healthy, cyclic Swiss Fleckvieh cows {{were included in the}} study and vaccinated twice with Bopriva 4 wk apart. Injection site, rectal body temperature, and heart and respiratory rates were recorded before and 3 d following each vaccination. Blood samples were taken weekly for progesterone and estrogen analysis and to determine GnRH antibody titer. Ovaries were examined weekly, using ultrasound to count the number of follicles and identify the presence of a corpus luteum. Thirty weeks after the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination,</b> the cows were subjected to a controlled internal drug-releasing device-based Select-Synch treatment. The GnRH antibody titers increased after the second vaccination and peaked 2 wk later. Estrogen levels were not influenced by vaccination, and progesterone level decreased in 7 of 11 cows up to 3 wk after the second vaccination and remained low for 10 to 15 wk following the second vaccination. The number of class I follicles (diameter ≤ 5 mm) was not influenced by vaccination, whereas the number of class II follicles (diameter 6 – 9 mm) decreased between 7 and 16 wk after the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Class III follicles (diameter > 9 mm) were totally absent during this period in most cows. The median period until recurrence of class III follicles was 78 d from the day of the second vaccination (95 % confidence interval: 60 – 92 d).

A clinical study mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics of Pandemrix® found an increased reactogenicity after the second dose {{in comparison with the}} first dose, particularly in the rate of fever. In the Netherlands, this adverse reaction was a point of concern for the parents or caregivers of these children. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the course and height of fever following the first and second dose of Pandemrix® in children aged from 6 months up to 4 years. The secondary aim was to evaluate the use of an online survey during a vaccination campaign. DESIGN: Survey-based descriptive study. SETTING: Adverse drug reaction reporting database of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre (Lareb). PARTICIPANTS: Parents or caregivers (n = 839) of vaccinated children who reported fever to Lareb following the first immunization with Pandemrix®. Questionnaires were sent by email to parents or caregivers of eligible children following the first and second doses of Pandremix®. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time between vaccination and the occurrence of fever, the maximum measured temperature, the occurrence of other adverse events after <b>first</b> and second <b>vaccination,</b> the decision to get the second vaccination and the social implication of the fever in terms of absence from work, nursery or school, and hospitalization. RESULTS: Following the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> against Influenza A (H 1 N 1), the height of the fever was between 39. 0 and 40. 0 °C in 359 / 639 (56. 2 %) of the children. In most of these children (235 / 639 [36. 8 %]), the onset of fever was between 6 and 12 hours following vaccination. 450 / 639 (70. 4 %) children recovered within 2 days. Of the 539 responders to the second questionnaire, 380 (70. 5 %) received the second vaccination against Influenza A (H 1 N 1) and 213 (56. 1 %) of these children experienced fever again. The height of the fever was significantly lower (t-test; p = 0. 001) and the duration was significantly shorter (Pearson's Chi-square; p = 0. 002) in comparison with the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The height of the fever after the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination</b> was associated with the decision to receive the second vaccination (t-test; p = 0. 000). In the studied group, 342 (53. 5 %) parents or caregivers needed to stay home from work and 405 (63. 4 %) children stayed home from nursery or school due to fever following the <b>first</b> <b>vaccination.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can be used in future vaccination campaigns to be able to inform people in an evidence-based manner about the risks and benefits of the vaccine and to avoid unnecessary concern and negative media attention. This could contribute to improved immunization levels. A web-based survey is demonstrated to be a useful tool to quickly gather information about a current safety concern and consequently inform the public to support an ongoing vaccination campaign...|$|R
