40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores space allocation as a management tool available to Navy Exchanges. A theoretical approach to determining the most economic distribution {{of space to}} items sold in a retail outlet is presented. The theory evaluates the changes in marginal <b>gross</b> <b>profits</b> that occur when space changes are made. When all of the marginal <b>gross</b> <b>profits</b> are equal, space utilization is maximized. A technique in linear programming is presented that would assist in equating marginal <b>gross</b> <b>profits.</b> Operational information relating to the retail departments in Building 301 of the Monterey Exchange is {{used to evaluate the}} strengths and weaknesses of the approach in an Exchange environment. An overview of the attitudes concerning space held by five Monterey Peninsula retailers, and excerpts from an Exchange-wide space utilization survey are presented. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} behavioural {{responses by}} companies {{to changes in}} profit taxation in their home country. It argues {{that as well as}} distinguishing real from shifting responses for profits, it is important to separate the responses of <b>gross</b> <b>profits</b> from those for deductions (such as claims for past or current losses) where these are endogenously related to <b>gross</b> <b>profits</b> declared at home. This occurs in the UK and many other corporate tax regimes. This endogenous response can be expected to differ over the business cycle and, using a microsimulation model of the UK corporate tax regime, it is shown that this can be important for empirical estimates of firms’ overall behavioural responses especially, but not exclusively, during cyclical downturns. It is shown also that endogenous responses of deductions to real or shifting responses for <b>gross</b> <b>profits</b> can be expected to be asymmetrical between periods of above- and below-trend growth. ...|$|R

25|$|Generally speaking, {{energy storage}} is {{economical}} when the marginal {{cost of electricity}} varies more than the costs of storing and retrieving the energy plus the price of energy lost in the process. For instance, assume a pumped-storage reservoir can pump to its upper reservoir a volume of water capable of producing 1,200 MW·h after all losses are factored in (evaporation and seeping in the reservoir, efficiency losses, etc.). If the marginal cost of electricity during off-peak times is $15 per MW·h, and the reservoir operates at 75% efficiency (i.e., 1,600 MW·h are consumed and 1,200 MW·h of energy are retrieved), then {{the total cost of}} filling the reservoir is $24,000. If all of the stored energy is sold the following day during peak hours for an average $40 per MW·h, then the reservoir will see revenues of $48,000 for the day, for a <b>gross</b> <b>profit</b> of $24,000.|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{a simple}} {{accounting}} error to think, that the <b>gross</b> <b>profit</b> share of value-added is equal to true business profit, or that constant capital invested in physical assets (fixed equipment and inventories) represents the capital that an enterprise owns, other than a fund to pay wages, or that profits from product sales are the only net income the corporation has. That can be verified from any corporate balance sheet. If an enterprise borrows or leases capital for production, rather than investing its own, this affects the cost of capital that is tied up at any particular time. How the profitability of capital is accounted for, depends very much on who owns the capital, as distinct from who borrows it, or who uses it. So the rate of profit concept which Marx uses in his theoretical analysis of capitalist production (i.e. S/(C+V)) differs from the actual business concept of the rate of profit, because it disregards all sorts of financial and ownership issues, and because it concerns only part of the total circuit of capital.|$|E

After completion of the main building works, Gibbs created more cash by selling shares in Antony Gibbs & Sons to his nephew Henry Hucks Gibbs (later Lord Aldenham), which enabled him to purchase two adjoining properties– including Belmont to the east from his nephew George Lewis Monck Gibbs– to create a farming estate, founded on dairy production and forestry management.
