50|$|Eutelsat I F-1, {{also known}} as <b>European</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Satellite</b> 1 (ECS-1) was a {{communications}} satellite operated by the European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation. Launched in 1983, it was operated in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 13° East, before moving to several other locations later in its operational life, before it was finally decommissioned in 1996. It {{was the first of}} five satellites launched to form the first-generation Eutelsat constellation.|$|E

This was the first commercial three-axis stabilized communications satellite in geostationary orbit with a bipropellant rocket propulsion system. It also was the first <b>European</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> system. This family of engines have displayed a remarkable competitiveness, still winning many designs (for 2015, {{it is expected to}} fly on Sicral 2, ARSAT-2, Hispasat AG1 and MSG-4.|$|E
5000|$|Murdoch {{described}} {{cable and}} satellite television as being [...] "the most important single advance since Caxton invented the printing press" [...] and {{saw it as a}} way to fulfil his long-held ambition of breaking into the UK television industry. Eventually, Murdoch bought the remaining shares of the company, taking full control. [...] During August, Murdoch outlined plans which saw the broadcasting hours extended to 17.50 to 22.30 each day, with a mix of music, sport, news, comedy and films. Plans were also afoot to start broadcasting from the new <b>European</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> ECS-1 and additional cable operators, allowing it to increase its audience across Europe and gain access to British viewers. By 16 October 1983, the station finally started broadcasting to the UK.|$|E
