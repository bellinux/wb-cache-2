500|$|Co-creators and {{executive}} producers Damon Lindelof and J.J. Abrams wrote the premiere's teleplay {{based upon a}} story by Lindelof. The episode was Abrams' first Lost writing credit since the pilot. They laid out the third season {{with the idea of}} [...] "us versus them"; Carlton Cuse, a showrunner, explained, [...] "And who is us? And who is them? <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we all tend to objectify people who we don't know much about and I think that's the audience's view of The Others right now -- they are bad, they are the malevolent force on the island. But {{over the course of the}} stories we're going to be telling this season on the show we expect the audience's view of The Others to change a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of the single, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, [...] "It took a while, but it’s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} film and the original source material. For example, the comic {{is set in the}} 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski [...] Brothers to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neo-conservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that [...] "here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." [...] Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the [...] "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.|$|E

5000|$|Louise first married John Davis Bacon on November 24, 1926, {{described}} by a friend as [...] "rather much of a playboy. By that <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> he worked very hard at anything." [...] She filed for divorce on March 18, 1931.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was always}} looking for a gag — {{sometimes}} {{to the point where the}} gags involving Richard Pryor went over the top. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> that his going off the top of a building, on skis with a pink tablecloth around his shoulders, was particularly funny.|$|R
2500|$|We were {{surprised}} to see it become as big--I mean, the story became way bigger than our part in it. Or it wasn't really about our record. It was just about that circumstance. For us, none {{of us have a}} real strong position against people sharing music. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's fine. We didn't feel like we were getting ripped off or anything. Everything else related to it, between that writer and his boss..... Whatever else happened, I feel like we're out of it.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated [...] "There was never any fight between us, that {{was a bunch of}} bullshit created by the media. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're a good band. Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all means nothing to me. Those guys in the band are nice people and there's no fight." [...] At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley-era song [...] "We Care a Lot".|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the entail was all wrong, and I shan't take {{advantage}} of it. It's not common sense that I should have everything because of poor Charley's misfortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. At least, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> {{should care}} {{to hand over}} my {{engagement}} ring so easily. It might be misapplied, you know." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a Rolling Stone article dated January 20, 2015, Gumbel said: [...] "There are a {{few things}} I hate more than the (National Rifle Association). <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> truly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're pigs. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they don't care about human life. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they are a curse upon the American landscape. So we got that on the record." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This is an {{unexpected}} meeting, Manuela. I had hardly hoped for it, as {{we set off}} very early to-morrow; but I'm glad we have met, for I should never have got over the feeling that I had been unkind in going off without saying good-bye. Do you make out what <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you understand English better than my bad Spanish." ...|$|E
6000|$|She paused. The calm smile lighted up {{her face}} once more. Then she drew out a pencil. [...] "You think life must lack plot-interest for me," [...] she began, slowly, [...] "because, with certain natures, I can {{partially}} guess beforehand what is coming. But {{have you not}} observed that, in reading a novel, part of the pleasure you feel arises from your conscious anticipation of the end, and your satisfaction in seeing that you anticipated correctly? Or part, sometimes, from the occasional unexpectedness of the real denouement? Well, life is like that. I enjoy observing my successes, and, in a way, my failures. Let {{me show you what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I know what you said to Sebastian--not the words, of course, but the purport; and I will write it down now for you. Set down YOUR version, too. And then we will compare them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Originally, the Beatles {{disliked the}} cartoon; however, {{as time went}} on they grew to like it. In 1972, Lennon commented, [...] "I still get a blast out of {{watching}} the Beatles cartoons on TV." [...] In 1999, Harrison said, [...] "I always kind of liked cartoons. They were so bad or silly that they were good, if you know what <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the passage of time might make them more fun now." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{broke in}} eagerly: [...] "Now I {{know you know}} what <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> men are--devils!" [...] She thrust this word forth, and her little face grew dark and strained. [...] "But the judge kept me from thinking--I never loved my father; he didn't care for me; {{all he wanted to}} do was to make ten {{thousand}} barrels of beer a year and sell it; and the judge seemed like a father to me till she came and destroyed my faith in him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have but}} one wish, dearest, {{and that is}} for your happiness. May God {{preserve}} you from any such fate as Lily's. When I tell you to write kindly to your cousin, <b>I</b> simply <b>mean</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> him to have deserved a kind reply by his honesty." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there is}} a place for Maori culture but why is it that we always use a semi-naked male, {{sometimes}} quite pale-skinned Maori, leaping around in, you know, mock battle? ...|$|E
50|$|Brett Gurewitz: Well, I don't do it anymore. I think crack is {{probably}} the worst poison that has ever been introduced to human beings. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> personally it's worse than heroin because I experimented with heroin quite a bit, and alcohol, and um, although I guess {{it depends on the}} individual.|$|E
5000|$|Vincenzo Natali, who {{directed}} four episodes {{of the third}} season, shared his perspective {{on the relationship between}} Du Maurier and Lecter: [...] "From Bedelia's side, she's approaching it {{a little bit like a}} scientist - she's very much there to observe Hannibal in his natural habitat. And for Hannibal's part, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he really adores her." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Forel turned so {{that she}} could see her companion. [...] "That is not what <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had better talk quite {{straight}} to you. Now I like Mr. Seaforth and Mr. Alton, too, and as Jack is mixed up in some business of theirs {{and they are going to}} stay down in Vancouver we shall probably see a good deal of them. Jack, however, is sometimes a little hasty in making friends, and I want to know the other reason that brought Mr. Seaforth out from the old country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This furniture, sir,' said Young John in a {{voice of}} mild and soft explanation, 'belongs to me.

Free, <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> could not <b>think</b> of letting you have it on any other terms. You're welcome to it for nothing.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Gould {{sets the}} record straight. [...] "No studio musicians. He played, but {{the writing process}} was {{extremely}} difficult because he wasn't really much of {{a fan of the}} music. He wasn't really behind it. He wasn’t really into it. So it was a tough process. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> really, we realized that he wasn’t going to continue while we were making that record because he was just on a different musical page." [...] The dynamic the band was in was similar to that which led to Mosley's termination. [...] "It could not have continued the way it did," [...] Gould says seriously.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{knew what}} I meant," [...] said Marjorie, and Magnet gave a queer sound of relief at her words.

Selina {{is one of the}} best parts of this show and, if she goes, Gotham will be the poorer for it." [...] Kaitlin Thomas of TV Guide wrote, [...] "It can be done and Gotham seems to specialize in the crazy and the extreme, especially when finale time rolls around. You can't blame a girl for being nervous though. Gotham also specializes in chronic uneven storytelling and repeated identity crises. This could really go either way -- so let's just sit back and enjoy the freak show." ...|$|R

5000|$|While 2002's Songs for the Deaf {{was said}} to be {{inspired}} by Josh Homme's tedious drive through the Southern Californian desert, the inspiration for Era Vulgaris came from Homme's daily drive through Hollywood. He described the record as [...] "dark, hard, and electrical, sort of like a construction worker," [...] "…it's like dirt, clearly seen." [...] The album's title Era Vulgaris refers to the Latin term for Common Era. The title was chosen by Homme because he thought [...] "it sounds like 'the Vulgar Era', which I like, because that sounds like something that I would like to be part of… <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we're in it, and I'm stoked".|$|E
5000|$|... "Gangsta Lovin" [...] is {{the lead}} single from Eves third studio album, Eve-Olution (2002).

2500|$|Goodfellas {{inspired}} director David Chase to {{make the}} HBO television series The Sopranos. Chase said [...] "Goodfellas is the Koran for me."

And yet that was the first mob movie that Scorsese ever dealt with a mob crew. ... as opposed to say The Godfather ... which there's something operatic about it, classical, even the clothing and the cars. You know <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> about Goodfellas when they go to their mother's house that night when they're eating, you know when she brings out her painting, that stuff is great. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> The Sopranos learned a lot from that."
