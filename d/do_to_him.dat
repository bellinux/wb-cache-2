5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E
25|$|Wilson then remembers about Amelia's father, Lawrence; a drunk who {{has been}} overprotective of his {{daughter}} since her mother died.

The three often discussed their future, with Wilson and Frank both wanting to become pilots, and Amelia wanting to dance on Broadway. Years later Amelia asks Wilson to do the honorable thing and marry her, but fears what her father will <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> when he found out.

2500|$|Learning {{that his}} {{identity}} was discovered, White was in Phillips County briefly {{before taking the}} first train back to Little Rock.

2500|$|The Mackinnon {{chief was}} later {{captured}} by Government troops {{and spent a}} year in confinement before being put on trial, with his life at stake, in Tilbury Fort.

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they did not execute perjurers in a capital case until after the {{conclusion}} of the trial of the person against whom they testified. The Sadducees taught that they executed perjurers only after the accused had actually been executed, pursuant to the injunction [...] "eye for eye" [...] in [...] The (Pharisee) Sages noted that [...] says, [...] "then shall you <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as he purposed to do to his brother," [...] implying that his brother was still alive. The Sages thus asked what [...] "life for life" [...] meant. The Sages taught that one might have thought that perjurers were liable to be executed from the moment that they delivered their perjured testimony, so [...] says [...] "life for life" [...] to instruct that perjurers were not to be put to death until after the conclusion of the trial.|$|E
2500|$|The Sifra {{taught that}} the {{incidents}} of the blasphemer in [...] {{and the wood}} gatherer in [...] happened at the same time, but the Israelites did not leave the blasphemer with the wood gatherer, for {{they knew that the}} wood gatherer was going to be executed, as [...] directed, [...] "those who profane it [...] shall be put to death." [...] But they did not know the correct form of death penalty for him, for God had not yet been specified what to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> as [...] says, [...] "for it had not [...] been specified what should be done to him." [...] With regard to the blasphemer, the Sifra read [...] "until the decision of the Lord should be made clear to them," [...] to indicate {{that they did not know}} whether or not the blasphemer was to be executed. (And if they placed the blasphemer together with the wood gatherer, it might have caused the blasphemer unnecessary fear, as he might have concluded that he was on death row. Therefore, they held the two separately.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, Rey faced one of {{the worst}} {{challenges}} of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape. The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like [...] "borrowing" [...] money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name. Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, [...] "My Fans Are in Trouble" [...] to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor. What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled might <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business {{at the peak of his}} career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would have a harder time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.|$|E
