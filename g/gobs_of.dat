25|$|In 2003, Comic Relief {{performed}} a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan.

The broadcast of this parody was preceded by a message from J. K. Rowling. French subsequently received a role as The Fat Lady in 2004's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Sara Scribner from Los Angeles Times said that A Thousand Leaves was a {{monotonous}} [...] "experimental, psychedelic record" [...] that felt [...] "like a passionless, less thoughtful shadow of [...] former self". J.D. Considine of Entertainment Weekly stated similar cons, calling the record [...] "the {{sort of thing}} that gives art rock a bad name." [...] Ben Ratliff of Rolling Stone found the songs to be unnecessarily long and sluggish, commenting that the album [...] "really does sound like a demo — eleven songs waiting for better organization and cliché removal". Similarly, Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club felt that the album rarely contained fully formed songs and that the band should start [...] "completing its ideas before recording them for posterity." [...] Orlando Weekly criticized Gordon's [...] "contrived and annoying" [...] vocal delivery, saying that many songs are [...] "merely lengthy feedback collages with pasted-on vocals and <b>gobs</b> <b>of</b> art-school pretension", but also admitted that the album contains some [...] "hidden gems" [...] like [...] "Sunday" [...] and [...] "Wildflower Soul".|$|E

Therefore, the numerical technique has increasingly become the main mean to study the issue. Many scholars {{at home and abroad}} had carried out a number of fruitful research work to solve this problem by using the numerical simulation technique: combined with the laboratory test result of rock strength and the relationship of stress- permeability coefficient, P established CFD three-dimensional simulation, conducting the analytical investigation on gas migration rule and gas distribution rule under extraction conditions for <b>gob</b> <b>of</b> longwall face[1]; established a CFD three-dimensional model, R and other scholars particularly studied the distribution rule <b>of</b> gas in <b>gob</b> under different ventilation and extraction conditions[2], [3]; by using the developed CFD three-dimensional model, Hu, Li and other scholars simulated the flowing ruleof gas in gob [4] and the rhythm rule of gas under the drainage of surface drilling condition[5]; developed the CFD model of oxygen distribution in gob, Shi and other scholars studied the distribution rule of oxidation zone in gob and its relation with the amount of air distribution[6, 7].

According to the characteristic of recovery, the suitable filling material and scheme were chosen to deal with the gob by grouting.
