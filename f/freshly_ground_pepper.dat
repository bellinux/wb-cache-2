40|$|Abstract: Who {{would think}} of cooking a potato in boiling rosin? The origin and {{rationale}} for this interesting cooking behavior is lost in ethno-botanical lore but directions for the practice persisted until recent editions of The Joy of Cooking (Rombauer and Becker 1975). Indeed, the dish can still be obtained at Sweetie Pies Restaurant (Decatur, TX) one day a week. We obtained rosin (Pinerez 1277), produced by Hexion Specialty Chemicals, to duplicate the cooking recipe and to investigate the gustatory effects. The basic recipe involves heating the rosin to 275 0 F and carefully lowering the spud into the pot (see Figure 1). The potato initially sinks in the rosin, but after about 45 minutes, floats to the surface (Rombauer and Becker 1975). The potato is simmered a further 30 minutes, removed from the rosin, and wrapped in heavy brown paper with the ends twisted tightly. The rosin baked potato is cooled for 10 minutes and then slit and served with butter, salt, and <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> <b>pepper.</b> The cooking process must be done outside and the skin must not be eaten. The cooking in rosin provides a baked potato with an exceptional texture that is distinctively flaky. Figure 1.

50|$|Inhalation of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz, when {{compared}} to inhalation of aged quartz, results in {{a significant increase in}} animal lung injury. <b>Freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz has increased reactive silicon-based oxygen radicals, and animals that are exposed to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz have been found to have decreased concentrations of antioxidant enzymes. Activated quartz particles decay with age in ambient air. Quartz dusts containing surface iron as an impurity have been shown to deplete cellular glutathione, contributing to the oxidative damage that is caused by particle and cell-derived ROS. Castranova et al. suggest that <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz dust that is contaminated with trace levels of iron may be more pathogenic than quartz dust alone.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{chemical}} and organoleptical properties of hot red pepper grown in GAP region in Southeast of Turkey were investigated. Four types of hot red <b>peppers</b> (A-Industrial red <b>ground</b> <b>pepper,</b> B-Industrial deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper,</b> C-Traditional deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> sold {{in the market and}} D-Traditional deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> consumed in home only) that were produced from the same pepper variety were taken for analyses. Results obtained indicated that with the exception of sample A, the rest of the samples were found not to contain aflatoxin. No significant differences between test samples were found in terms of chemical properties. Sample A had the highest level of invert sugar (20. 8 %), {{while the rest of the}} samples gave close values to each other. The industrial samples (samples A and B) had higher extractable colour (as ASTA unit) and pungency (as Scoville index) values than their traditional counterparts.

40|$|Purpose: To {{test whether}} or not dentin desensitizing or sealing methods {{influence}} the bond strength of universal resin cements. Materials and Methods: The bond strength of two universal resin cements (RelyXUnicem, Self-adhesive Prototype Cement) to human dentin was assessed after different dentin surface treatments (test). A conventional resin cement (Panavia 21) served as control. The influence of the following pretreatment methods was tested and compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin: dentin desensitizing by means of glutaraldehyde-containing primers (Gluma Desensitizer, Syntac Primer/Adhesive), or dentin sealing by means of bonding agents (Heliobond, ClearfilSE Bond). Additionally, the influence of provisional cement (Freegenol) was analyzed after its application and subsequent mechanical removal. Bond strength after thermocycling was measured in a shear test (n = 10). Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Both test cements exhibited significantly lower bond strength to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin than the control cement. The desensitization methods {{did not affect the}} bond strength of the test cements. Furthermore, the sealing methods significantly increased the bond strength of both test cements as compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. The application and subsequent removal of the provisional cement only had a minor influence on the bond strength of the test cements. The contamination with provisional cement, however, significantly affected the bond strength of the control cement compared to the values achieved on <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. Conclusion: Desensitization or sealing of dentin have a beneficial effect on the bond strength of universal resin cements. The application of a provisional cement prior to adhesive cementation exhibits no significant influence on the bond strength of the universal resin cements...|$|R
