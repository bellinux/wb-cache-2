25|$|Piezoelectric sensors {{are most}} useful in Smart-road {{technologies}} {{that can be}} used to create systems that are intelligent and improve productivity in the long run. Imagine highways that alert motorists of a traffic jam before it forms. Or bridges that report when they are at risk of collapse, or an electric grid that fixes itself when blackouts hit. For many decades, scientists and experts have argued that the best way to fight congestion is intelligent transportation systems, such as roadside sensors to measure traffic and synchronized traffic lights to control the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> But the spread of these technologies has been limited by cost. There are also some other smart-technology shovel ready projects which could be deployed fairly quickly, but most of the technologies are still at the development stage and might not be practically available for five years or more.|$|E

30|$|Congestion {{that affects}} moving bodies can {{propagate}} in space, when congestion in one element spreads to an adjacent element and reduces its own capacity. This process of propagation occurs in stocks of waiting passengers and in passenger flows, {{as well as}} in stocks and <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For a <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> moving bodies, congestion spreads upstream: this phenomenon is called spillback.|$|R

40|$|The wake <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> a <b>vehicle</b> {{significantly}} influences its aerodynamic {{performance and}} the stability during high-speed drive. Therefore, optimization <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> wake <b>flow</b> is {{an effective way to}} improve its aerodynamic performance and further improve the handling stability and fuel economy. In this paper, a new method, the leading edge rotating cylinder, is used to optimize the wake <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> a <b>vehicle.</b> According to the results of simulations, this method can reduce the pressure drag, increase the negative lift force, and strengthen the stability <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> under crosswind. Furthermore, this method optimizes not only the wake <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> with rotating cylinders but also the interactive vehicles in the driving route in overtaking maneuvers or platoon driving. In conclusion, this method effectively optimizes the flow fields around the vehicles, and it significantly helps to improve the handling stability and fuel economy <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{modeling}} is {{a particularly}} active field, the origins {{of which can be}} traced back to the pioneering work of Greenshield in the 1930 s. Greenshield was the first to formulate a structural relation between the speed <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> on a road and the distance between them. This relation between the flow rate/density, at the heart of the so-called fundamental diagram, has been used by all families <b>of</b> traffic <b>flow</b> models developed ever since. These families of models can be grouped into three distinct but strongly interconnected subcategories: macroscopic models, which consider <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> microscopic models, which consider individual vehicles and their interactions, and mesoscopic models, which lie in between the other two categories...|$|R
30|$|The BIG stock-flow {{cohort model}} {{constitutes}} a bottom-up approach to vehicle fleet forecasting. New car registrations follow from a disaggregate discrete choice model based on sales data for individual passenger car models.

This accurate bottom level accounting guards against gross errors of aggregation, without, of course, preventing the model user from producing and presenting results at a much less detailed level.|$|R

It shows the proper time to change the direction of variable guiding lanes, and a new method to clean out the vehicles on the variable guiding lanes. In condition <b>of</b> a low <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> left-turning <b>vehicle</b> but a high <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> straight <b>vehicle,</b> or the opposite situation, the directions of the variable guiding lanes are different. In the certain of the signal cycle, we changed the direction and gave the proper time to clean out vehicle on the variable guiding lanes, and then the <b>vehicle</b> <b>of</b> different directions can run smoothly. Furthermore, it decreases the delay of the whole intersection and the risk of conflicts...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} focused on the role of a {{maritime}} automobile terminal in finished vehicle logistics (FVL). Different drivers that force the management of a maritime automobile terminal to find new solutions in accommodating the increased <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> are described. The analysis of the maritime automobile terminal at Koper indicates the need to further expand the storage area and its delivery zone to support regular clients from the automotive industry. The main research goal of the paper is to elaborate and describe the model where an external storage platform under port’s operation might be used. On this basis the analysis of current inbound and outbound flows is elaborated. The model of Extended Gate Concept (EGC) for a maritime automobile terminal is presented as an option to serve increased outgoing <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> finished <b>vehicles.</b> With proper infrastructure development, established inland connections and secured information flow the presented EGC model can be adopted at the observed maritime automobile terminal. Nevertheless, obstacles hindering EGC implementation {{play a crucial role in}} the model implantation, thus the final consent should be given by the relevant stakeholders in FVL...|$|R
