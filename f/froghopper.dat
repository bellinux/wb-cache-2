40|$|The {{increased}} rate of sugarcane harvest without previous burn {{has provided a}} very favorable environment to the <b>froghopper</b> Mahanarva fimbriolata (Stal, 1854), with high moisture and low temperature variation. Few works have studied the response of sugarcane to this pest, so {{little is known about}} resistant cultivars. Plant phenolics are widely studied compounds because of their known antiherbivore effect. This research aims to determine if the attack of M. fimbriolata nymphs stimulates the accumulation of total phenolics in sugarcane. The experiment was carried out in greenhouse and arranged in completely randomized design, in a 3 X 2 X 4 factorial with three replications. Second instar nymphs of M. fimbriolata were infested at the following rates: control, 2 - 4 and 4 - 8 nymphs per pot (first-second infestations, respectively). Pots were covered with nylon net and monitored daily to isolate the effect of leaf sucking adults. Leaf and root samples were collected and kept frozen in liquid nitrogen until analyses. Infested plants showed higher levels of phenolics in both root and leaf tissues. In roots, the cultivar SP 80 - 1816 accumulated more phenolic compounds in response to the infestation of M. fimbriolata. On the other hand, higher levels were found in leaves and roots of control plants of SP 86 - 42, which might be an indication of a non-preference mechanism. The increase of total phenolics in sugarcane infested with root-sucking <b>froghopper</b> nymphs {{does not seem to be}} useful to detect the resistance to this pest...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many insects jump by storing and {{releasing}} energy in elastic structures within their bodies. This {{allows them to}} release large amounts of energy {{in a very short}} time to jump at very high speeds. The fastest of the insect jumpers, the <b>froghopper,</b> uses a catapult-like elastic mechanism to achieve their jumping prowess in which energy, generated by the slow contraction of muscles, is released suddenly to power rapid and synchronous movements of the hind legs. How is this energy stored? Results The hind coxae of the <b>froghopper</b> are linked to the hinges of the ipsilateral hind wings by pleural arches, complex bow-shaped internal skeletal structures. They are built of chitinous cuticle and the rubber-like protein, resilin, which fluoresces bright blue when illuminated with ultra-violet light. The ventral and posterior end of this fluorescent region forms the thoracic part of the pivot with a hind coxa. No other structures in the thorax or hind legs show this blue fluorescence and it is not found in larvae which do not jump. Stimulating one trochanteral depressor muscle in a pattern that simulates its normal action, results in a distortion and forward movement of the posterior part of a pleural arch by 40 μm, but in natural jumping, the movement is at least 100 μm. Conclusion Calculations showed that the resilin itself could only store 1 % to 2 % of the energy required for jumping. The stiffer cuticular parts of the pleural arches could, however, easily meet all the energy storage needs. The composite structure therefore, combines the stiffness of the chitinous cuticle with the elasticity of resilin. Muscle contractions bend the chitinous cuticle with little deformation and therefore, store the energy needed for jumping, while the resilin rapidly returns its stored energy and thus restores the body to its original shape after a jump and allows repeated jumping. </p...|$|E

40|$|The olive {{quick decline}} {{syndrome}} (OQDS) {{is a disease}} that appeared suddenly {{a few years ago}} in the province of Lecce (Salento peninsula, southeastern Italy). Among the factors that may be involved in its aetiology, the most relevant is Xylella fastidiosa, a quarantine pathogen of American origin, whose presence in Italy represents its first confirmed record in the European Union. X. fastidiosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that invades the xylem {{of a wide range of}} hosts, from which it is acquired by xylem-feeding insect vectors and transferred to other plants. The bacterium multiplies within the plant vessels and occludes them, thus impairing water uptake. Besides olive, the Salentian strain of X. fastidiosa infects in nature a number of woody (almond, cherry) and shrubby (oleander, broom, Acacia saligna, Polygala myrtifolia, Westringia fruticosa, Rosmarinus officinalis, Rhamnus elaternus, Myrtus communis) hosts, with no evidence for grapevines or citrus being hosts. The bacterium was isolated in culture and identified as a genotype of X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca, molecularly identical to an isolate from Costa Rica. Philaenus spumarius (meadow spittlebug), a <b>froghopper</b> quite common in the Salento area where it thrives on olive, was identified as the main vector. Disease eradication and sanitation of infected olives are unfeasible. However, strategies are being enacted for restraining the spread of pathogen and vector(s) within the boundaries of the currently infected zone. © 2015, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging...|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Xylella fastidiosa is ravaging the olive trees of Southern Apulia, Italy (Saponari et al., 2013). The {{bacterium}} causes the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS), a disease showing symptoms of apical and marginal leaf scorching, extensive branch and twig dieback {{and death of}} the trees (Martelli et al., 2016). Transmission tests demonstrated that the Xylella fastidiosa-olive infecting strain is transmitted by the xylem-feeding meadow <b>froghopper</b> Philaenus spumarius (Saponari et al., 2014) whereas genome studies proved that {{it belongs to the}} subspecies pauca, sequence type 53 (Giampetruzzi et al., 2015). Field observations allowed to identify a possible source of resistance in the olive cv Leccino, which reacts with milder symptoms, and hosts a much lower bacterial concentration of bacterial cells than the locally grown cv Ogliarola salentina. A global transcriptome profiling revealed that a higher number of genes is altered upon Xylella fastidiosa infection in the susceptible cv Ogliarola salentina compared to the resistant cv Leccino, with respect to the healthy plants of the same cultivars (Giampetruzzi et al., 2016). Gene expression analysis showed that both cultivars perceive the presence of the bacterium with the involvement of membrane signaling receptors, whose characterization is ongoing. Analysis of altered genes of the susceptible cv Ogliarola salentina (expansin, early-late inducible proteins, late embryogenesis abundant proteins and involvement of the abscissic acid pathway) indicated that plants are subjected to a intense water stress. A further transcriptome analysis of the recently discovered Xylella-resistant olive cv FS 17 ® is in process. Results of these studies will be presented...|$|E

Pela análise econômica observou-se que thiamethoxam a 250 g i. a. ha- 1 aplicado com infestação de 1, 8 cigarrinhas. m- 1 proporcionou o maior lucro, e enquanto aplicado na dose de 250 g i. a. ha- 1, sob infestação de 12, 4 cigarrinhas. m- 1, a menor receita líquida. Análises de regressão permitiram estimar o nível de dano econômico da praga, nas condições do presente experimento, entre 3 e 5 cigarrinhas. m- 1. The economic injury {{level of}} Mahanarva fimbriolata (Stål) to sugarcane was experimentally evaluated {{in a field}} area harvested at November. The inseticide thiamethoxam was applied: 150, 200 e 250 g i. a. ha- 1. Applications started when the pest populations reached of 1. 8 spittlebugs. m- 1 (12 / 04 / 02), 7. 6 spittlebugs. m- 1 (12 / 17 / 02) or 12. 4 spittlebugs. m- 1 (12 / 26 / 02). Untreated plots were maintained as check. After the insecticide applications, infestations of the sugarcane root <b>froghopper</b> were monthly evaluated till 9 / 26 / 03 when the experiment was harvested. Compared with check plots, the pest control resulted in significant increment of sugar productivity. When applied under infestation of 1. 8 (12 / 04 / 02) or 7. 6 (12 / 17 / 02) the productivity was resulted higher than control made with populations of 12, 4 spittlebugs. m- 1. Thiamethoxam was efficient when applied {{in all of the}} three doses. It was observed interaction between dose and time of insecticide application. When the applications had been made in 12 / 04 / 02, under infestation of 1, 8 spittlebugs. m- 1, the treatment with thiamethoxam 250 g i. a. ha- 1 resulted in stalks and sugar productivities higher than the treatment with 150 g i. a. ha- 1. This fact was attributed to the greater amount of residue and better initial control of the pest, obtained with the highest dose. The economic analysis of the data showed that thiamethoxam at 250 g i. a. ha- 1 applied with the infestation of 1. 8 spittlebugs. m- 1, provided the greatest profit, whereas when applied at the dose of 250 g i. a. ha- 1, under infestation of 12. 4 spittlebugs. m- 1, the smallest net income was obtained.

40|$|Many hemipteran bugs {{can jump}} explosively from plant substrates, {{which can be}} very smooth. We {{therefore}} analysed the jumping performance of <b>froghoppers</b> (Philaenus spumarius, Aphrophoridae) and leafhoppers (Aphrodes bicinctus/makarovi, Cicadellidae) taking off from smooth (glass) and rough (sandpaper, 30 µm asperity size) surfaces. On glass, the propulsive hind legs of Philaenus <b>froghoppers</b> slipped, resulting in uncontrolled jumps with a fast forward spin, a steeper angle and {{only a quarter of}} the velocity compared with jumps from rough surfaces. By contrast, Aphrodes leafhoppers took off without their propulsive hind legs slipping, and reached low take-off angles and high velocities on both substrates. This difference in jumping ability from smooth surfaces can be explained not only by the lower acceleration of the long-legged leafhoppers, but also by the presence of 2 - 9 soft pad-like structures (platellae) on their hind tarsi, which are absent in <b>froghoppers.</b> High-speed videos of jumping showed that platellae contact the surface briefly (approx. 3 ms) during the acceleration phase. Friction force measurements on individual hind tarsi on glass revealed that at low sliding speeds, both pushing and pulling forces were small, and insufficient to explain the recorded jumps. Only when the tarsi were pushed with higher velocities did the contact area of the platellae increase markedly, and high friction forces were produced, consistent with the observed jumps. Our findings show that leafhoppers have special adhesive footpads for jumping from smooth surfaces, which achieve firm grip and rapid control of attachment/detachment by combining anisotropic friction with velocity dependence...|$|R
