According to James, the songs were written over an extended period; Syro features both archived and more recent compositions, with the album's oldest track around [...] "six or seven years old". The album was recorded in six different studios, including James' own studio in Scotland, which he spent three years building and which was completed in 2006. One audio engineer spent three months with James, helping him wire together patch panels and [...] "then [...] realized <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> all wrong and had to start again". Describing the overall process as [...] "brutal", James referred to the in-studio technical issues as the catalyst for writing new music that would be featured on Syro.|$|E

500|$|Regardless, Lee {{received}} Goodman's {{approval for}} the name Spider-Man and the [...] "ordinary teen" [...] concept, and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby [...] "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, [...] "I hated the way <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it!</b> Not {{that he did it}} badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic". Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|Henry IV's {{decision}} {{to indulge in}} the practice served as visual evidence to his subjects that God approved of his reign. Royal physicians and others who witnessed these ceremonies insisted that {{at least half of}} all the diseased people he touched were healed within days. The ceremonies took place in other cities and at least four times a year: on Easter, on Pentecost, on All Saints Day and on Christmas. On Easter 1608, Henry IV touched 1,250 scrofulous persons. He complained that the hours-long ceremony exhausted him, but continued the practice and consistently gave the impression that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> only out of concern for the well-being of his subjects. The ceremony was performed {{in the presence of the}} princes of the blood, almoners, bodyguards, and physicians. The latter presented Henry with patients, and he proceeded to make the sign of the cross on his scrofulous subject's cheeks, touched the subject's sores, and exclaimed: [...] "The King touches you, God cures you."

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

As early as 1934 or 1935 Bob Dunn electrified a Martin O-series acoustic guitar while playing with Milton Brown's Brownies. According to Jimmy Thomason, [...] "It happened when Dunn {{was working at}} Coney Island in New York...he ran into this black guy who was playing a steel guitar with a homemade pickup attached to it...hooked up to this old radio or something and was playing blues licks...and he got this guy to show him how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> I never knew this black musician's name but both Bob and Avis {{talked to me about}} him often." ...|$|E

In such theories, the observation of expert models is typically seen as an important instructional tool. Often, multimedia expert models are used to show an expert who is constructing a solution for a realistic problem and explaining how <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> and why <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> in this particular way. Such expert models combine three information sources (i. e., a solution; steps for reaching this solution, and heuristics for selecting useful steps) that must be mentally integrated by the learner and may thus easily yield a high cognitive load that interferes with meaningful learning. This research studies modality effects in relation to learner control over the pacing of multimedia segments that correspond with solution steps. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Psychological warfare {{operative}} Major Colin Wallace corroborated the allegations, {{stating that}} [...] "everything people had whispered about Robin Jackson for years was perfectly true. He was a hired gun. A professional assassin. He {{was responsible for}} more deaths in the North [...] than any other person I knew. The Jackal killed people for a living. The State not only knew that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> Its servants encouraged him to kill its political opponents and protected him".Wallace also named Jackson as having been [...] "centrally-involved" [...] in the Dublin bombings, but like Weir, suggested that the principal organiser had been Billy Hanna. Wallace's psychological operations unit typically targeted loyalist extremists; however, {{during the period of}} 1973 and 1974 he was refused clearance to target principal members of the Mid-Ulster UVF despite an increase in paramilitary activity from the organisation. In June 1974, a month after the bombings, Wallace was denied permission to target key loyalists including Jackson and Hanna, as their names were on a list which excluded them from being targeted for psychological operations. This appeared to indicate that in practice, those members of paramilitaries whose names were listed were also excluded from being targeted for prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|It {{took the}} {{energetic}} 1968 television special Elvis, which the Singer Company sponsored, and a subsequent series of acclaimed recording sessions in Memphis, Tennessee that included {{songs such as}} [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] and [...] "In the Ghetto", to restore Presley's musical reputation. However, the music scene and the culture {{in the latter part}} of the decade had radically changed. The [...] "Singer Special" [...] TV show was not intended to turn out the way it did. Parker was adamant that Presley would wear a Santa suit and other holiday garb and sing Christmas songs, as the show was to be broadcast in December 1968. (Several Presley historians have noted the original title for the special was to be Elvis and the Wonderful World of Christmas.) It was the producer of the show, Steve Binder, who put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits and even the staged section with his old band, Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana, the latter inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley's dressing room. Presley was never one to stand up against Parker, but he knew that this TV show was his one chance at a true comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> [...] "Binder's way." [...] This was the first time in the partnership that Presley fully rebelled against Parker.|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer.

She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>It</b> was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E

2500|$|Pitchfork stated [...] "T.I. {{has always}} been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other {{mainstream}} rapper was talking about drugs, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's [...] (2005) was the album T.I. should've made. Young Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters described the album as a stunning classic saying that [...] "Clifford “T.I.” Harris is one of America’s greatest songwriters. I’m not just talking about hip-hop, either—even if you add in all the other genres that people go all gaga over, T.I. strides this narrow world like a colossus. No one is smarter, no one constructs tighter songs, and no one has more ways to score. This is proven over and over again on King. T.I. is the whole package: gritty, smooth, smart, dangerous, introspective, and wise. And while it’s pretty early in 2006 to talk about albums of the year, this record says it’s time to start talking." [...] Stylus Magazine noted [...] "T.I.’s path to a self-made mythology hinges not just on his ability to trumpet himself, but to make his locale and history vital. King, T.I.’s latest, proves, among other things, that his legacy is tied into his town, and his town, Atlanta, is the true Southern metropolis: primal, spiritual, refined, and delicate at the same time. New Orleans may have the painful religious symbolism, Memphis the working-class spirit, and Houston the expansive, halting sound, but Atlanta is the melting pot of bourgeoisie, aristocracy, and neighborhood hustlers. Lil Wayne may be the chaperone of this coast, but T.I. is the CFO. Song to song production is generally top-shelf. From barn-burning “Top Back” to the slyly tender “Gone,” every chime chimes when it’s supposed to, every snare clacks right into place. Individually, Grand Hustle in-house rising star Toomp gobbles up the lion’s share of the praise: the cataclysmic “What You Know” and ostentatious “Bankhead” both soar. Mannie Fresh and Just Blaze inlay T.I.’s lines with velveteen strings and swirling drums respectively. King isn’t complacent enough to act like all the wars are fought and all the gods are dead; T.I. sees his legacy and city very much up for grabs. A city, a scene and his legacy are unfinished, and while King won’t be T.I.’s last, or, hopefully, best section of his mosaic, it’s the perfection of his aesthetic thus far." ...|$|E
