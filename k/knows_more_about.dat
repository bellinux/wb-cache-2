5|$|Orientalism {{proposed}} that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, {{meant for the}} self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that is to say, the Western Orientalist <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the Orient than do the Orientals.|$|E

25|$|His {{other groups}} {{would include the}} Adrian Rollini Quintette, The Adrian Rollini Trio (primarily late 1930s), and Adrian and his Tap Room Gang based in the Hotel President at 234 West 48th Street in New York City. He managed Adrian's Tap Room, inside the hotel during the early swing era {{starting}} in 1935, as well as leading the small band of 6–8 players. He had the Whitby Grill on West 45th Street. Both of these were indicative of his inseparability of professional and social life. His clientele in each club were {{for the most part}} musicians on a holiday. Rollini could be found on the radio working with artists like Kate Smith. As if he didn't have enough going for him he turned once again to another phase of musical venture, and opened a store for sale and repair of musical instruments, known as White Way Musical Products which was located at 1587 Broadway. It had long been his belief that the artist playing the instrument <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it than the maker concerned only with the mechanics. The shop was a hot spot for autograph hounds who trolled the shop in search of famous band leaders. He was also making excursions between the Georgian Room and the Piccadilly Circus Bar, both in the Piccadilly Hotel. He also began recording for Master and Muzak.|$|E

500|$|Because of her {{striking}} figure, {{newspapers in}} the 1950s routinely published her body measurements, which once led [...] evangelist Billy Graham to exclaim, [...] "This country <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Jayne Mansfield's statistics than the Second Commandment." [...] Mansfield proclaimed a 41-inch bust line and a 22-inch waist when she made her Broadway debut in 1955, though some scholars dispute those figures.

Evangelist Billy Graham once said, [...] "This country <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Jayne Mansfield's statistics than the Second Commandment." [...] As late as the mid-1980s she remained one of the biggest TV draws. As an indication of her impact on popular culture today, there are numerous cultural references to the Hollywood sex symbol and Playboy Playmate in recent films, books, TV and music.

500|$|Insurance is a {{contract}} based upon speculation. The special facts, {{upon which the}} contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in {{the knowledge of the}} insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law, and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use uberrima fides), it is still used in insurance contracts. In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual [...] "good faith," [...] the insuree would have no reason to tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.|$|E

500|$|Author Bob Perelman {{takes the}} {{suspicion}} of empiricism {{one step further}} in his 1994 The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky. Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ABC of Reading that frame Pound's discussion of Chinese ideograms. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of Debussy and another of Ravel. Pound states {{that a person who}} attended both concerts <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the composers than someone who has only read [...] "ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both". Perelman considers the contradiction between [...] "everyone" [...] and [...] "knowledge" [...] to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest can only make do with [...] "a fog of clichés, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness." [...] With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of [...] "scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies" [...] where any mediating written descriptions ("sunfish", [...] "diplodokus") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and [...] "hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism." ...|$|E
