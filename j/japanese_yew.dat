The underwoods abound in berry-bearing plants (e.g. cloudberry, cranberry, crowberry, red whortleberry), red-berried elder (Sambucus racemosa), wild raspberry and Spiraea.|$|E
2500|$|Yagishiri Island {{is noted}} for its dense forest. The island was once {{completely}} covered with trees, but major parts of the forest were used for housing and other construction with {{the start of the}} trade of Pacific herring in the late 18th century. A prohibition was put in place on the cutting of trees on the island in 1880 to prevent the complete deforestation of the island. Shortly afterward, in 1886, two thirds of the forest of Yagishiri was lost to a fire. The island has been significantly reforested, with the Uguisu Valley {{in the center of the}} island remaining untouched by development or fire. Climatic conditions on the Japan Sea keep the canopy of the forest, specifically in the Uguisu Valley, as low as , and the trunks of various species of trees in [...] the forest are correspondingly thick. The forest is homes to 50 species of trees, but Yagishiri Island is {{noted for its}} unspoiled stands of Taxus cuspidata, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>yew.</b> The forest of Yagishiri is a protected natural monument of Japan, and the entirety of the island is protected as a part of Shokanbetsu-Teuri-Yagishiri Quasi-National Park.|$|E

40|$|Jersey, an {{experimental}} deer repellent, was field tested against 2 commercial repellents on <b>Japanese</b> <b>yews</b> (Taxuscuspidata) near Ithaca, New York, during spring 1990. In Experiment 1, plots (nnn = 24) of 4 individually-potted yews were established, with 2 yews at each plot randomly treated with Jersey and 2 left as controls. Plots of 4 (1 x 4, n nn = 12) and 16 (4 x 4, nnn = 2) plants {{were used in}} Experiment 2, with individual plants being treated with Jersey, Hinder”, or Big Game RepellentR (BGRR) or left as controls. Photographs with a grid matrix placed behind each h plant were taken from 2 m {{at the beginning of}} the experiment and after 10 weeks. These photographs were analyzed to produce a cover index of plant size. Plots were monitored weekly to record browsing. In Experiment 1 more control (46 / 48) than treated (7 / 48) plants were browsed (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Controls were browsed earlier (x = 1. 7 wk) than treated yews (x = 4. 4 wk, P 3 ̆c 0. 01). At the end of 10 weeks, control plants were reduced in size more than Jersey-treated plants (P 3 ̆c 0. 001).

50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> plum <b>yew</b> {{was first}} {{considered}} to be a yew when it was partially described by Thomas Andrew Knight in 1839 and as such was named Taxus harringtonii. It was reclassified by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini in 1846 with a new specific name, Cephalotaxus drupacea. Some botanists consider C. koreana and C. sinensis to be synonymous with C. harringtonii. Although normally found under the name Cephalotaxus harringtonia, that name violates the grammar rules of Botanical Latin and in 2012 was corrected to Cephalotaxus harringtonii. However, this opinion is still not universally accepted by taxonomists and therefore it is acceptable to use Cephalotaxus harringtonia until a definitive position has been agreed.|$|R
40|$|Cephalotaxine is {{the major}} {{constituent}} of the alkaloidal fraction obtained from several Cephalotaxus species (<b>Japanese</b> plum <b>yew).</b> Various (alpha) -hydroxysuccinate esters of cephalotaxine known as the harringtonines are also isolated and {{have been shown to}} have pronounced antileukemic activity. The compounds are characterized by spiro-fused five membered rings annular to a benzazepine ring system. The ultimate goal of this research is the total synthesis of cephalotaxine and the various members of the harringtonine family. The immediate goal was the synthesis of cephalotaxinone via the appropriately functionalized tetracyclic keto-enamine, 2 -desoxy- 11, 12 -(DELTA) -cephalotaxinone. The same keto-enamine should serve as a precursor to 11 -hydroxycephalotaxine, which could be used to synthesize the harringtonines via a synthetic scheme involving intramolecular transesterification. ^ The synthetic strategy to be employed for the construction of the cephalotaxine ring system is via intramolecular cyclization of suitably functionalized (alpha) -aryl,(beta) -alkyl cyclopentenones. Development of flexible methodology for a general synthesis of enones has been achieved by a triply-convergent synthesis utilizing (beta) -epoxy sulfones as doubly-charge inverted ynone synthons previously unreported. ^ The one or two pot synthesis involves: (1) Conjugate addition of hard organometallic reagents (pk(,a) 3 ̆e 25) to (gamma) -oxygenated (alpha),(beta) -unsaturated sulfones in a stereospecific fashion; (2) Alkylation in situ of the resultant (alpha) -sulphonyl carbanion; and (3) Oxidation-elimination to the desired enone.

50|$|The pea-gravel {{driveway}} {{is lined}} with maturing pin oaks and red maples. The formally landscaped terrace is surrounded by <b>Japanese</b> <b>yew,</b> Chinese juniper, and dwarf hemlock. The trees of The Breakers' grounds act as screens that increase the sense of distance between The Breakers and its Newport neighbors. Among the more unusual imported trees are two examples of the Blue Atlas Cedar, a native of North Africa. Clipped hedges of <b>Japanese</b> <b>yew</b> and Pfitzer juniper line the tree-shaded foot paths that meander about the grounds. Informal plantings of arbor vitae, taxus, Chinese juniper, and dwarf hemlock provide attractive foregrounds for the walls that enclose the formally landscaped terrace. The grounds also contain several varieties of other rare trees, particularly copper and weeping beeches. These were hand-selected by Ernest W. Bowditch, a landscape architect and civil engineer based in the Boston area. Bowditch’s original pattern for the south parterre garden was determined from old photographs and laid out in pink and white alyssum and blue ageratum. The wide borders paralleling the wrought iron fence are planted with rhododendron, mountain laurel, dogwoods, and many other flowering shrubs that effectively screen the grounds from street traffic and give visitors a feeling of seclusion.|$|E
50|$|Yews {{are widely}} used in {{landscaping}} and ornamental horticulture. Over 400 cultivars of yews have been named, {{the vast majority of}} these being derived from European yew (Taxus baccata) or <b>Japanese</b> <b>yew</b> (Taxus cuspidata). The hybrid between these two species is Taxus media. A popular fastigiate selection of the European yew (Taxus baccata 'Fastigiata') is often called the Irish yew, which often complements the fact of the difficulties with common names. A few cultivars with yellow leaves that are being propagated, collectively are known as golden yews, which is another nomenclature blunder.|$|E

The yew was chosen in 1966, because it is the tree used to make ornamental sceptors for the emperor, many of which came from the Hida district. The snow grouse was chosen in 1961, as the birds live up in the Japanese alps and is a nationally-protected species. Ayu were chosen in 1989, because the fish is found in many prefectural rivers and is prized for its sweet taste.|$|E

50|$|The shaku {{originally}} had {{a strip of}} paper attached to the back containing instructions and memoranda for the ceremony or event about to take place, but it later evolved into a purely ceremonial implement meant to add solemnity to rituals. According to the Taiho Code, a set of administrative laws implemented in the year 701, nobles of the fifth rank and above had to use an ivory shaku, while those below that rank were to use oak, <b>Japanese</b> <b>yew,</b> holly, cherry, sakaki, Japanese cedar, or other woods. Ivory, however, was too hard to obtain, and the law was changed.

50|$|The Hu was {{originally}} used at {{court for the}} taking of notes and was usually made of bamboo.

The hu can be made of different material according to the holder's rank: sovereigns used jade (similar to, but not the same as, the ceremonial jade scepter gui 圭), nobles used ivory, and court officials used bamboo.
