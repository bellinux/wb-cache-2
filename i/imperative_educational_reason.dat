50|$|The Waldorf School of New Orleans (formerly The Hill School) {{was founded}} in 2000 by {{a small group of}} parents who felt Waldorf {{education}} was an <b>imperative</b> <b>educational</b> experience meant for their children. The school had been enjoying steady and healthy growth since its inception and had grown 50 students strong, but when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29, 2005, the school was devastated. Not only was its location flooded and its student body scattered across the nation, but upon homecoming, enrollment deflated to only half what it was. Once again a group of steadfast parents decided to press on. They found a new location in the Irish Channel and reopened.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} what parents consider when choosing {{child care and}} how their level of satisfaction is affected by their choice. Much {{of the literature on}} child care provides a hegemonic definition of quality care which suggests that quality care is educationally focused. Educational care is pitted against custodial care and other reasons for choosing care are not explored. Also, other characteristics that may contribute to a quality setting from a parent's point of view are not discussed. This thesis challenges the discourse that informs the definition of quality child care and finds the middle ground between educational and custodial care. This study argues that <b>educational</b> <b>reasons</b> for choosing care will not be the only reason contributing to an increase in parent's satisfaction levels. Several of the hypotheses from this study were supported. <b>Educational</b> <b>reasons</b> for selecting a provider did not have a significant affect on satisfaction levels when compared to custodial reasons but alternative benefit reasons did. This shows that future research is needed to examine how parents actually define quality child care. Keywords: Child care, Quality, Education, Choosing care, Alternative benefit...|$|R

Relevant theoretical texts and studies, (Dewey, 1934. Gardner, 1990.

The models of approaching and understanding art for <b>educational</b> <b>reasons,</b> as presented and analyzed by Feldman, Brondy, Anderson and Perkins, are presented in the second part. The method “Transformative Learning through an aesthetical experiences”, has been grounded and developed by A. Kokkos, and is presented in the third part.
