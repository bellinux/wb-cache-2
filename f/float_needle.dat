50|$|The {{rocker arm}} oil supply pipe was steel, and would {{fracture}} from vibration (later improved). The head steady would also fatigue and fracture from vibration (later improved). The Amal carbs had <b>float</b> <b>needle</b> leakage from vibration, {{which led to}} flooding and fires, exacerbated by having the ignition points located under the right hand carb (relocated {{to the right side}} of the engine after the first year). And the carburetors wore out prematurely from vibration (persistent problem).|$|E
50|$|The new {{front-wheel-drive}} {{was a vast}} {{improvement over}} the old Megola design. The weight of the engine was lower. The front wheel with integrated engine had a combined weight of 50 kg (110 lb). Additionally, a custom carburetor without a <b>float</b> <b>needle</b> didn’t have the problems caused by vibration. And finally, the light-weight battery ignition allowed trouble-free engine starts and helped to keep the engine weight low. The distributor and the points were located in the hub. The technicians originally intended to build a dynastarter. These improvements {{would have been impossible}} to add to the old Megola design.|$|E

50|$|The typical Chinese {{navigational compass}} {{was in the}} form of a {{magnetic}} <b>needle</b> <b>floating</b> in a bowl of water. According to Needham, the Chinese in the Song Dynasty and continuing Yuan Dynasty did make use of a dry compass, although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass. Evidence of this is found in the Shilin guangji ("Guide Through the Forest of Affairs"), published in 1325 by Chen Yuanjing, although its compilation had taken place between 1100 and 1250. The dry compass in China was a dry suspension compass, a wooden frame crafted in the shape of a turtle hung upside down by a board, with the lodestone sealed in by wax, and if rotated, the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction. Although the European compass-card in box frame and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by Japanese pirates in the 16th century (who had in turn learned of it from Europeans), the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century. However, according to Kreutz there is only a single Chinese reference to a dry-mounted needle (built into a pivoted wooden tortoise) which is dated to between 1150 and 1250, and claims that there is no clear indication that Chinese mariners ever used anything but the <b>floating</b> <b>needle</b> in a bowl until the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{a compass}} as a {{direction}} finder underground was pioneered in the Tuscan mining town Massa where <b>floating</b> magnetic <b>needles</b> were employed for tunnelling, and for defining {{the claims of the}} various mining companies, as early as the 13th century. In {{the second half of the}} 15th century, the compass became standard equipment for Tyrolian miners. Shortly afterwards the first detailed treatise dealing with the underground use of compasses was published by a German miner Rülein von Calw (1463-1525).|$|R

40|$|Floating {{of bodies}} {{heavier than the}} {{supporting}} liquid is discussed. Floating of cylindrical, ellipsoidal bodies and rectangular plates possessing lateral dimensions smaller than the capillary length is treated. It is demonstrated that more elongated bodies of a fixed volume are better supported by capillary forces, due {{to the increase in}} the perimeter of the triple line. Thus, <b>floating</b> of metallic <b>needles</b> obtains reasonable explanation. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|The larch ball is a {{structure}} created when Western Larch <b>needles</b> <b>floating</b> {{in a lake}} become entangled in a spherical shape due to the action of waves. They are most commonly known to form in Seeley Lake, Montana, however, they have also been known to form in similar regions such as Clark Fork. Typical specimens are 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10 cm) in diameter more rarely larger ones are found.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} details of the {{construction}} and calibration of an ultra sensitive surface rheometer, inspired by the setup described in [C. F. Brooks et al Langmuir 15, 2450 (1999) ], which makes use of high resolution video tracking of the motion of a <b>floating</b> magnetized <b>needle</b> and is capable of measuring the viscoelastic response of a Langmuir monolayer with an accuracy of 10 ^- 5 N/m. This instrument is then employed for the rheological characterization of a Langmuir monolayer of a photosensitive azobenzene polymer, which can be brought out of equilibrium by a suitable photoperturbation. The complex dynamic shear modulus G= G' + i G" is measured as a function of temperature and illumination power and wavelength. The reversible rheological ch anges induced in the film by photo-perturbation are monitored during time, observing a transition from a predominantly elastic (G' > G") to a viscoelastic (G' ≈ G") regime. These results are confirmed by comparison with independent measurements performed by us using other rheological techniques. Finally a discussion is made, taking into account the results of a recent x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy experiment on the same polymer in equilibrium and out of equilibrium.

5000|$|Gower and {{his family}} removed to Nova Scotia House at Ipswich in 1817. There he devoted himself to the invention, patenting, design and {{building}} of a remarkable series of novel vessels including three vessels named Transit, a fly boat, two yachts the Unique and the Gower, the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, {{and a number of}} other inventions. He entered, but did not win, a competition for a novel form of lock for the Regents Canal. He suggested that, to protect coastal traffic, cruisers be stationed along the coast in communication with signal stations to provide a concerted defence system. He proposed a form of vertical-vaned windmill; an eye shade; various ship's logs and a [...] "double-barrelled" [...] capstan to do two jobs at once. He suggested a non-elastic substitute for imported hempen standing rigging to be made of wooden cylinders joined together by iron straps. He devised a method of keeping ships at proper distances by using the mast as a base line. He invented a mode of dropping a guess warp anchor with such accuracy that its end could be easily found and lifted. He devised a novel method of fidding a topgallant mast and several contrivances for the [...] "better nipping and stopping a cable". He designed a long catamaran for forming a life raft and a form of floating sea anchor, or drogue anchor (he called it a [...] "propeller") like an umbrella. He created a set of signals, that could be seen from all angles, using shapes instead of flags. He also suggested using a <b>floating</b> compass <b>needle</b> to find North. He experimented with various designs of paddle wheel on the River Lee Canal that anticipated the design of the wheels used by steam paddlers many years later. He invented and built the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, which carried up to 25 people and was virtually unsinkable. He proposed fitting canal barges with 'spud wheels' that could propel the vessel by catching on the canal bottom. He saw that a combination of paddle wheels and spud wheels could take vessels over mud flats at various conditions of the tide. Gower also constructed a twin hulled catamaran, just ten feet long, on which he mounted a barrel of water that drained to underwater by a curved pipe pointing aft. His twin floats achieved two miles per hour apparently without the need for power from sail or steam. He thus demonstrated water jet propulsion. He anticipated that a steam water pump, so contrived, could propel vessels without the need for paddles. He gives credit to Dr Franklin (probably Benjamin Franklin) and a Mr Rumsay of Philadelphia for this idea and hoped that his little experiment would encourage others to pursue the notion.|$|R
