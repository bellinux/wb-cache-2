40|$|Living radical {{polymerisation}} has witnessed an unprecedented interest from polymer and materials scientists. Traditionally, polymers tended to replace natural {{materials such as}} wood, cotton and glass, and were used primarily for their structural features and performance and cost advantages. New functional polymers are essential for the manufacture of cell phones, lap-top computers, new cosmetics, and many pharmaceuticals. It {{is important to be}} able to control how monomers are put together within the macromolecule for the design at the molecular level for specific applications. Living polymerisation allows for end group control, polymer chain length and relatively narrow polydispersity polymers. In nature, the ability to control monomer distribution and chain length is obvious with approximately 20 amino acids being the monomers for polymers as diverse as hair, insulin and haemoglobin. Living {{radical polymerisation}} solves many of the problems in the use of monomers that contain heteroatoms and functional groups. These tend to be reactive towards strong nucleophiles and electrophiles which are required in <b>ionic</b> <b>polymerisation.</b> Protecting group chemistry as used in small molecule organic synthesis is not practical in polymer synthesis. Thus radicals that are inert to most functional groups and in particular protic species seem to be the answer. The mechanism of the transition metal mediate systems is extremely complicated with a range of organometallic species present in the reaction mixture. Solvents and coordinating monomers drastically affect the ideal reaction conditions and it is impossible to predict the optimum conditions for each synthesis without certain experiments being carried out. Nevertheless, catalyst systems are available which are acceptable and work well {{enough to be able to}} make a plethora of different macromolecules for a diverse range of applications /properties...|$|E
40|$|The first area {{of study}} {{is the use of}} skin {{adhesive}} bioelectrode hydrogels as ground plate electrodes for ophthalmic iontophoresis applications. The work provides a basis of understanding the relative contributions made by ionic monomers (such as sodium s-(acrylamide) - 2 -methyl propane sulphonate and acrylic acid-bis-(3 -sulfopropyl-ester, potassium salt) and neutral monomers (such as acryloymorpholine, N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N-vinyl pyrrolidone) to adhesion, rheology and impedance of bioelectrode gels. The general advantage of neutral monomers, which have been used to successfully replace ionic monomers, is that they enable more effective control of independent anion and cation species (for example potassium chloride and sodium chloride) unlike <b>ionic</b> monomers where <b>polymerisation</b> produces an immobile polyanion thus limiting cation mobility. Secondly, release from a completely neutral hydrogel under the influence of mechanical shaking was studied for the case of crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing low concentration of linear soluble PVA in a contact lens application. The soluble PVA was observed to be eluting by reptation from the lens matrix due to the mechanical action of the eyelid. This process was studied in an in vitro model, which in this research was used as a basis for developing a lens made with enhanced release polymer. The third area of work is related to the factors that control drug release (in particular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) from a hydrogel matrix. This links both electrotherapy applications, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, in which the passive diffusion from the gel could be used in conjunction with enhanced transmission across the dermal surface with passive diffusion from a contact lens matrix and the development of therapeutic contact lenses.
