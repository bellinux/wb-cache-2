5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an {{advertising}} sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to symbolise man's harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} military program, the , wherein fifty randomly selected classes of third-year junior {{high school students are}} kidnapped, dropped into a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.|$|E

25|$|Blighty is a slang {{word for}} Britain {{derived from the}} Hindustani word bilāyatī ("foreign"). Depending on the user, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> either affectionately or archly. It was often used by British {{soldiers}} abroad in the First World War to refer to home.|$|E
25|$|In this view, {{prayer is}} not a conversation. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, {{this has been the}} {{approach}} of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph B. Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p.XIII).|$|E
25|$|The Royal Canadian Mint {{issues the}} first silver dollar in 1935. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> {{to commemorate the}} Silver Jubilee of His Majesty King George V. The coin’s reverse design is sculpted by Emanuel Hahn and portrays a Voyageur and an {{aboriginal}} paddling a birch-bark canoe. The faint lines in the background are meant to represent the Northern Lights. This design would be utilized on the dollar until 1986.|$|E

25|$|Another story {{surrounding}} the Fling claims that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to imitate a stag; {{the story goes}} that a boy who saw a stag was asked to describe it by his father. He lacked the words, so danced instead; {{the position of the}} hands resembles the head and antlers of a stag. This urban legend hides the fact that Highlanders used to snap their fingers as they danced.|$|E
25|$|In this view, {{prayer is}} not a conversation. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the {{approach}} of Rabbenu Bachya, Yehuda Halevy, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph Dov Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p.XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).|$|E
25|$|A new sight called Dynarange is {{currently}} being procured {{as part of the}} German Infantryman of the Future project. Essentially this is a computer controlled aiming sight with range finder. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to cope with the fact that some soldiers have had difficulties with the regular sight, as its scope is quite complex to the untrained eye. It would increases the weapon's effective range to 600 m (2,000ft) against moving and stationary targets. Dynarange is already in service with the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps and the Dutch Army.|$|E

25|$|In {{the latter}} part of the twentieth century, {{research}} trends shifted to more intense study of spaces like manifolds which are locally well understood (being locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space) but have complicated global behavior. By this <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> that although the basic point-set topology of manifolds is relatively simple (as manifolds are essentially metrizable according to most definitions of the concept), their algebraic topology is far more complex. From this modern perspective, the stronger property of local path connectedness turns out to be more important: for instance, in order for a space to admit a universal cover it must be connected and locally path connected. Local path connectedness will be discussed as well.|$|E
25|$|One concern {{regarding}} {{the intersection of}} medical ethics and humanitarian medical aid is how such assistance can be as harmful as {{it is helpful to}} the community being served. One such example being how political forces may control how foreign humanitarian aid can be utilized in the region <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to be provided in. This would be congruous in situations where political strife could lead such aid being used in favor of one group over another. Another example of how foreign humanitarian aid can be misused in its intended community includes the possibility of dissonance forming between a foreign humanitarian aid group and the community being served. Examples of this could include the relationships being viewed between aid workers, style of dress, or the lack of education regarding local culture and customs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of {{liberalisation}} in 2002/03, there were only 180 ADMARC outlets. By 2009/10, the number of ADMARC-operated markets had grown to 788, and in 2010/11 the figure rose to 904. It remains {{under the control of}} politicians, and this has led to claims of corruption and the public perception that ADMARC does not act {{in the best interests of}} those <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to assist. ADMARC expanded in the decade after 2002 and still exists because of the failure of the agro-dealer programme to create an efficient private sector marketing system. This does not mean that ADMARC is efficient, it was heavily criticised in early 2013 for allowing stored grain to rot in its silos as many went hungry for lack of maize in ADMARC markets. Had that maize been released on the market before it spoiled, it was claimed, it would have helped to lower prices and prevented many having to queue for scarce maize.|$|E
60|$|For him himself I have no fear. We have {{committed}} him to God. <b>It</b> may <b>be</b> {{that he has}} committed himself to God. <b>It</b> may <b>be</b> that he has already learned lessons which God alone can teach. <b>It</b> may <b>be</b> that those lessons will bring forth hereafter royal fruit right worthy of a royal root. At least we can trust him in God's hands, and believe that if this great woe <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to ennoble us <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to ennoble him; that if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to educate us <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to educate him; that God is teaching him; and that in God's school-house he is safe. For think, my friends, if we, who know him partly, love him much; then God, who knows him wholly, loves him more. And so God be with him, and with you, and with your prayers for him. Amen.|$|R
