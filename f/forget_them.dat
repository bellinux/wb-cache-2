25|$|Different {{emotions}} {{have been}} shown to affect memory. Life events that have stronger emotions attached will be remembered more vividly. In studies looking at emotional events and the reminiscence bump, older adults tend to remember more positive events than younger adults. Typically, during the reminiscence bump only happy memories and memories of important events are recalled. It is postulated that sad events are easier to forget because there may be an increased motivation to <b>forget</b> <b>them.</b> Conversely, individuals are more likely to recall and relive happy events because they produced pleasurable memories. A second explanation suggests that remembering positive events can help regulate emotions and even enhance moods. It is also possible to regulate emotions through remembering negative events and comparing these events to present positive events. Positive or negative events {{can also be used to}} share life experiences with others and compare life events.|$|E
25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to <b>forget</b> <b>them.</b> To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E

500|$|In February 1971, after a one off {{performance}} at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album.

500|$|In the conclusion, the soloist {{repeats the}} earlier phrase, {{but this time}} the chorus finally joins {{in the words of the}} appellation. The soloist {{introduces}} a new wording [...] (<b>Forget</b> <b>them</b> not, the dead). The chorus repeats this phrase, marked espressivo, dolcissimo, on the melody of the chorale , five stanzas of which Bach used in his St Matthew Passion. The melody is not repeated as in the original, but continued for half a line. Reger is known for quoting chorales in general and this one in particular, most often referring to its last stanza , which Bach included in the Passion right after the death of Jesus. The corresponding text would then be [...] (When I must depart one day, do not part from me then. When the greatest anxiety...).|$|E

500|$|During the [...] "Year of Hell", Chakotay is {{captured}} by the Krenim scientist Annorax (Kurtwood Smith) on a Time Ship. The two first attempt to work together as Annorax agrees to restore the now damaged Voyager if Chakotay complies with his demands. After Annorax wipes out a species, though, he helps to disable the ship, allowing Captain Janeway to destroy it by ramming Voyager into it. This results in the timeline being reset, and {{the events of the}} episode were undone. In [...] "", he falls in love with Kellin (Virginia Madsen), a member of a xenophobic race who have developed a technology to prevent others from forming long-term memories of them. As such, he is informed that they were previously in love when she was on Voyager a month earlier, and rekindle their relationship despite Chakotay not remembering the earlier encounter. Another member of her race removes Kellin's memories of Chakotay and installs a virus to remove all records of their race. Chakotay takes to writing out his memories of Kellin on paper so that he will not <b>forget</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gaga did not spare any {{free time}} for the song's {{recording}} and would usually start the sessions after the Born This Way Ball show performances were over. Madeon noted: [...] "She would still give everything – even on the demo take! She's really impressive." [...] Madeon's production on Artpop differs from his usual work. According Dylan Farella of Dancing Astronaut, the song [...] "take the mood of Artpop from ballad to anthem". On French radio Hit West, Madeon recalled that in September 2012 {{he had gone to}} see Gaga at her Born This Way Ball show at Paris' Stade de France. After the performance, Gaga took Madeon to her hotel room. He played her some chords he had been working on for sometime. Gaga immediately started singing the main melody of [...] "Gypsy", and then the main song [...] "flowed out", leading them to write a demo the same night. Since Madeon had brought his computer with him, he recorded the ideas developed with Gaga so he would not <b>forget</b> <b>them.</b> Afterwards, the song went through various changes, and more musicians were added for the final version on the album.|$|E
500|$|In 1840 {{the playwright}} Friedrich Hebbel wrote a poem in German titled [...] "Requiem", its Latin title {{alluding}} to [...] "" [...] (eternal rest), {{the first words}} of the Mass for the Dead. The poem opens with an apostrophe to a [...] "soul" [...] in a plea, [...] "" [...] (Soul, <b>forget</b> <b>them</b> not, soul, forget not the dead). These words appear to echo various psalms, such as , [...] "Bless the Lord, O my soul". Hebbel, however, evokes an [...] "eternal rest" [...] that is distinctly non-religious: the poem offers no metaphysical reference, Christian or otherwise, but calls for remembrance {{as the only way}} to keep the dead alive. The first lines, in which the speaker calls upon the soul not to forget the dead, are repeated in the centre of the poem and again at its conclusion, as a refrain that sets apart two longer sections of verse. The first of these sections describes how the dead, nurtured by love, enjoy a final glow of life. In contrast, the latter section portrays a different fate for souls that have been forsaken: who are relegated to an unending, desolate struggle for renewed existence. The musicologist Katherine FitzGibbon notes that the speaker of this narrative is not identified, but may be [...] "a poetic narrator, divine voice, or even the dead".|$|E

Hamlet protests he cannot make promises of love one day, only to <b>forget</b> <b>them</b> the next. His heart is not that of a woman. Ophélie is distraught at the insult, and Hamlet begs forgiveness.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hence our clemency {{perceives}} {{the need}} of keeping watch over the pagans and their heathen enormities, since by natural depravity and stubborn lawlessness, they forsake the path of true religion. They disdain {{in any way to}} perform the nefarious rites of sacrifice and the false errors of their baleful superstition by some means or other in the hidden solitudes, unless their crimes are made public by the profession of their crimes to insult divine majesty and to show scorn to our age. Not the thousand terrors of laws already promulgated nor the penalty of exile pronounced upon them deter these men, whereby, if they cannot reform, at least they might learn to abstain from their mass of their crimes and the multitude of their sacrifices. But their insane audacity transgresses continually; our patience is exhausted by their wicked behavior so that if we desired to <b>forget</b> <b>them,</b> we could not disregard them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 Stieglitz read a {{commentary}} about his photography by Waldo Frank that suggested {{the strength of}} his imagery was {{in the power of the}} individuals he photographed. Stieglitz was outraged, believing Frank had at best ignored his many photographs of buildings and street scenes, and at worst had accused him of being a simple recorder of what appeared in front of him. He resolved immediately to begin a new series of cloud studies [...] "to show that (the success of) my photographs (was) not due to subject matter – not to special trees or faces, or interiors, to special privileges – clouds were there for everyone…" [...] He said [...] "I wanted to photograph clouds to find out what I had learned in forty years about photography. Through clouds to put down my philosophy of life –…My aim is increasingly to make my photographs look so much like photographs that unless one has eyes and sees, they won't be seen – and still everyone will never <b>forget</b> <b>them</b> having once looked at them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{that same}} year, Stuart left Universal and joined Twentieth Century-Fox. Her first {{assignment}} {{from the studio}} head, Darryl F. Zanuck, was in Professional Soldier supporting the child star Freddie Bartholomew and Academy Award winner Victor McLaglen (the year before, McLaglen won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in John Ford's The Informer). Frank S. Nugent noted: [...] "There is a minor romance along the way between Gloria Stuart, the king's noble governess, and Michael Whalen, the professional soldier's part-time assistant, but no one should take it seriously." [...] In 1936, John Ford chose Stuart to co-star with Warner Baxter in The Prisoner of Shark Island. Playing {{the wife of the}} doctor who treated Lincoln's assassin, Stuart felt privileged to work again with Ford, although the New York Times Frank S. Nugent wrote of Stuart's [...] "...helpful performance..." [...] In Poor Little Rich Girl, Stuart again was asked to support a child star: this time, Shirley Temple. Frank S. Nugent: [...] "Listing [...] supporting players hastily, then, before we <b>forget</b> <b>them</b> entirely, we might mention Miss Faye [...] Gloria Stuart…as having been permitted a scene or two while Miss Temple was out freshening her costume." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the lead}} role of Julien Davenne, Truffaut first wanted to cast actor Charles Denner, {{but he was not}} available. Because of the {{personal}} nature of the film and the character of Julien Davenne, Truffaut decided to play the part, stating that [...] "this film is like a handwritten letter. If you write by hand, it isn’t perfect, the writing may be shaky, but it is you, your writing." [...] This decision was not simply taken because Truffaut embodied the character, but because Davenne’s obsession, what he does throughout the whole film, what defines him, that is, keeping the memory of the dead alive, refusing to <b>forget</b> <b>them,</b> linked in a way to the activity of the director. Specifically, he felt a closeness to the character of Davenne, due to his own valuations of remembrance of the dead as helping in the [...] "struggle against the transience of life". Despite his strong feeling for the character, Truffaut was hesitant about the role and thought he may be perceived as too old. He had a wig made, but ended up not using it.. It was Truffaut's third and last of his own film in which he played a leading role. According to co-star Nathalie Baye, Truffaut almost shut the film down for fear of a bad performance: [...] "He would say to me, 'It's madness; it will never work!' And he came close to wanting to stop everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would <b>forget</b> <b>them</b> in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E

2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and {{do my best to}} record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I'll have a whole bunch of them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually <b>forget</b> <b>them.</b> I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E
