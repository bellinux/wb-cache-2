5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very <b>different</b> <b>in</b> humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|According to phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} the sequences of both the S and M segments, OROV is most {{closely related to the}} clade formed by BAYV, CATV, BCCV, and Muleshoe virus (MUL; from the hispid cotton rat). In 2009, Piet Maes and colleagues proposed that the closely related BAYV, BCCV, and MUL be united into a single species. Chu and colleagues were surprised to find that the same species, Oryzomys couesi, harbored different viruses (OROV and CATV), though noted that the subspecies infected by the two viruses were <b>different.</b> <b>In</b> 2010, Delton Hanson and colleagues suggested on the basis of various lines of evidence, including the presence of different hantaviruses, that western Mexican populations of Oryzomys couesi represent a different species, Oryzomys mexicanus.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite <b>different</b> <b>in</b> {{appearance}} to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of}} an adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly <b>different</b> <b>in</b> color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E

5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably <b>different</b> <b>in</b> composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are <b>different</b> <b>in</b> some respects particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite <b>different</b> <b>in</b> the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
