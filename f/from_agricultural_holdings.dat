The study backed up for results from the system of collecting accountancy data agricultural farms (FADN). This data was collected <b>from</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> with the economic size below 4, 4 - 8, 8 - 16, 16 - 40, 40 - 100 and higher than 100 ESU (European Size Unit) in 2008 and 2009. The field of ob-servation of this article included specialist cereals, oilseed and protein crops farms, specialist permanent crops farms, specialist dairying farms and specialist granivores farms. The indicators of effectiveness and competitiveness was income per FWU (Family Work Unit) and management income. The competitive specialist cereal farms have 16 - 40 ESU and about 100 hectare UAA (utilised agricultural area), specialist permanent crops farms have 40 - 100 ESU and about 7 hectare UAA and specialist dairying farm have 28 dairy cows. Moreover, the competitive specialist granivores farms have 36 cows or 400 - 600 tones of poultry meat from farm. The estimate number of competitive farms in 2010 equalled to two hundred twenty thousands, also their share in total number of farms under 1 hectare amounted to about 14 %.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} deals with an {{appearance}} of peasant-workers in the prewar period in Yugoslavia. The author stresses {{the fact that the}} conditions for the emergence of this mixed social stratum in Yugoslavia were created relatively late, due mainly to specific historical circumstances (frequent wars), which disrupted or postponed the utilization and application of many technical inventions of the modem civilization. For instance, the steam machine and construction of railway roads started at the end and {{at the beginning of the}} second half of the XIX-th century. Before the Second World War the most regions of today Yugoslavia had not developed industrially, so it is quite understandable that the number of peasant-workers in that times were minimal. It is estimated that in Yugoslavia 9. 00 % of the total number of agricultural holdings were mixed (part-time) in 1938. In the second chapter the author analyses the development of mixed agricultural holdings in the postwar period. Due to rapid changes of the social structure of population under the influence of the developing industries and tertiary activities, the number of mixed agricultural holdings has been growing from year to year. Already in 1960. they amounted up to 34. 00 % of the total number of agricultural holdings and today it is estimated that approximately 50. 00 % of the total number employed in nonagricultural sector are coming <b>from</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings.</b> In the third chapter the author considers some causes of the origination of mixed holdings. He particularly analyses the economic reasons, namely the agrarian overpopulation. Among other reasons he mentions aspirations of agricultural population for better life and higher living standard by the employment in nonagricultural activites, need for money accumulation necessary for the realization of certain specific goals, like migration to other richer regions or a town, schooling of children, payments of state land tax or debts and different individual motives. In the fourth chapter the author pleads for more systematic and scientific research of this mixed stratum; differentiation of various substrata on the basis of certain characteristics which can be taken as real hypotheses that essentially influences their different production and cosumption orientation as well as their different behaviour and attitudes towards other social strata is necessary. In this sense the author exemplifies his thesis, citing the data on different size of holdings and different consumption characteristics of mixed holdings (households). He separately points out the regional and local pecularities of mixed households. Here too, we find an explication of preliminary results of the questionnaire on mixed holdings which was carried out by the Agrarian Institute in Zagreb last year. In the last chapter the author critically reviews several more or less already generally accepted views on peasant-workers (as bad agricultural and nonagricultural workers, as the lowest social stratum, as people with no formal group participation etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} will be {{emphasized}} the importance of the other profitable activities (OPA) on the family <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings,</b> according to their economic size within the territory of Republic of Serbia, with special focus on the Vojvodina Region. Economic size of the agricultural holding is recognized by the value of its total standard output (SA). Other profitable activities related to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> include incomes <b>from</b> <b>agricultural</b> products sale, rural tourism, fishery, etc., whether they are performed on or outside the holding. Other profitable activities that are not related to <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> include activities that do not consume resources of the holding, but only the labor, as like in previous case they may be carried on, or outside the holding. According to gained results, average economic size of the holding in the Republic of Serbia is 5. 939 EUR, while the realized economic value on the family <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> (FAH) is 4. 990 EUR. Census of Agriculture in 2012 showed that the highest average economic size of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> has a Vojvodina Region (12. 032 EUR), what is 3, 5 times higher than the value achieved in other regions. From the total sum of 631. 552 <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> in the Republic of Serbia (family <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> (FAH), as well as legal entities (LE) and entrepreneurs) only 78. 301 holdings possess DPA that are in relation to the holding (where 21 % of them are within the economic class in range of 4. 000 - 7. 000 EUR).
