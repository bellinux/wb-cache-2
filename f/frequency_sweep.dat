A single-degree-of-freedom snap-through link model is harmonically forced using a Scotch yoke mechanism.

After, <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps</b> are performed on the system to identify regions of interesting behavior. Then, time series data is collected at specific frequencies of interest to highlight the broad phenomenological behavior of the structural system. A useful tool when modeling structural systems is numerical analysis. An equation of motion is developed to numerically simulate all experimentally observed results. The numerical results include snap-through boundaries, bifurcation diagrams, full initial condition grid basins of attraction, time-lag embedded basins of attraction, <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps,</b> and time series of regions of pathological behavior.

40|$|Small {{amplitude}} oscillatory shear {{is carried}} out during isothermal degradation of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) {{in order to determine}} the evolution of the characteristic relaxation time with degradation time and temperature. After reducing the relaxation time data to a single mastercurve, a 4 -parameter function is fitted to the data to allow prediction of the change in relaxation time following an arbitrary thermal history. The method enables separation of the effects of temperature and of degradation on the relaxation time, both of which lead to a horizontal shift of dynamic data along the frequency axis, and hence enable a correction for thermal degradation during rheometry to be carried out. To validate the method, two isothermal <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps</b> were measured with different temperature histories, producing different mastercurves due to dissimilar in-test thermal degradation. After correcting for thermal degradation using the function and the thermal histories, the two <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps</b> reduce to the same viscoelastic mastercurve in the undegraded pre-test state...|$|R

Critical to the widespread adoption of these new technologies is development of an understanding of their impact on cellular physiology. Here we show the integration of a cell-based sensor, a microfabricated electrical screening platform, and quantitative imaging to enable the first large-scale physiological screens {{of the impact of}} microsystems on cells. To perform physiological screening, we developed a cell-based sensor that reports on stress-mediated transcription (via Heat Shock Factor 1 induced expression of GFP). This cell-based sensor was quantitatively characterized using automated imaging. The integration of this quantitative physiological sensor with a microfabricated system enabled the execution of multiplexed screens across electric field strength, frequency, and application duration.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare {{competing}} adaptive strategies for fast <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps</b> for driven and waveguide-mode problems and give recommendations for practical implementations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper first summarizes the theory of adaptive strategies for multi-point (MP) sweeps and then evaluates the efficiency of such methods by means of numerical examples. Findings - The authors' numerical tests give clear evidence for exponential convergence. In the driven case, highly resonant structures lead to pronounced pre-asymptotic regions, followed by almost immediate convergence. Bisection and greedy point-placement methods behave similarly. Incremental indicators are trivial to implement and perform similarly well as residual-based methods. Research limitations/implications - While the underlying reduction methods can be extended to any kind of affine parameter-dependence, the numerical tests of this paper are for polynomial parameter-dependence only. Practical implications - The present paper describes self-adaptive point-placement methods and termination criteria to make MP <b>frequency</b> <b>sweeps</b> more efficient and fully automatic. Originality/value - The paper provides a self-adaptive strategy that is efficient and easy to implement. Moreover, it demonstrates that exponential convergence rates can be reached in practice...|$|R
