5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E

The study shows that there exists a range of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices</b> in duopolistic equilibria. This range of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices</b> is narrower and lower than the range of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices</b> in duopolistic equilibria under pure absolute profit maximization.

Beginning with Wilson (1979), the theoretical literature has argued that these auctions are subject to possible low <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices.</b> We show that {{this is due to}} the way the asset is being divided. We focus on allocation rules that specify the way the asset is divided in cases of excess demand.

25|$|If {{the demand}} decreases, then the {{opposite}} happens: {{a shift of}} the curve to the left.

25|$|The {{primary action}} of buffer stocks, {{creating}} price stability, is often {{combined with other}} mechanisms to meet other goals such as the promotion of domestic industry.

The price stability itself may also tempt firms into the market, further boosting supply.|$|E
500|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes, the neo-Keynesians, created the [...] "neoclassical synthesis" [...] by combining Keynes's macroeconomics with neoclassical microeconomics. Neo-Keynesians dealt with two microeconomic issues: first, providing foundations for aspects of Keynesian theory such as consumption and investment, and, second, combining Keynesian macroeconomics with general equilibrium theory. (In general equilibrium theory, individual markets interact {{with one another}} and an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> exists if there is perfect competition, no externalities, and perfect information.) Paul Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947) provided much of the microeconomic basis for the synthesis. Samuelson's work set the pattern for the methodology used by neo-Keynesians: economic theories expressed in formal, mathematical models. While Keynes's theories prevailed in this period, his successors largely abandoned his informal methodology in favor of Samuelson's.|$|E

The model is designed to facilitate comparison between competitive <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices</b> and the TELRIC prices that were recently adopted by the FCC for determining universal service subsidies in telecommunications. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices</b> differ from the regulatory prices due to 1) differences in discount factors, 2) differences in the stream of operating costs, and 3) differences in the discounting method applied to the revenue stream. In a calibrated comparison of prices for end-office switching services, {{we find that the}} last difference is the most important, and the net effect of these differences is regulated prices that understate competitive <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices</b> by billions of dollars nationwide in present value terms. We also note that <b>equilibrium</b> <b>prices</b> can be derived without making any assumptions about depreciation methods, contrary to conventional regulatory practice, and that competitive prices cannot be calculated in advance of costs once capital utilization is endogenized...|$|R

2500|$|When {{consumers}} {{increase the}} quantity demanded {{at a given}} price, it {{is referred to as}} an increase in demand. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve D1 to the new curve D2. In the diagram, this raises the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> from P1 to the higher P2. This raises the equilibrium quantity from Q1 to the higher Q2. [...] A movement along the curve is described as a [...] "change in the quantity demanded" [...] to distinguish it from a [...] "change in demand," [...] that is, a shift of the curve. [...] there has been an increase in demand which has caused an increase in (equilibrium) quantity. [...] The increase in demand could also come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute goods, market expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> and quantity. [...] Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> to emerge, resulted in movement along the supply curve from the point (Q1, P1) to the point (Q2, P2).|$|E

2500|$|When {{technological}} progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. [...] For example, assume that someone invents {{a better way}} of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. [...] Otherwise stated, producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve S1 outward, to S2—an increase in supply. This increase in supply causes the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> to decrease from P1 to P2. The equilibrium quantity increases from Q1 to Q2 as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. [...] If the quantity supplied decreases, the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at S2, and shifts leftward to S1, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change (shift) in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pricing</b> model in a dynamic multi-period {{stochastic}} framework with uncertain income streams. In an incomplete market, there exist two traded risky assets (e. g. stock/commodity and weather derivative) and a non-traded underlying (e. g. temperature).

2500|$|... "Integer pricing" [...] as {{explored}} by Huw Dixon. Rather than treat price {{as a continuous}} variable, it is treated as a discrete variable. [...] This means that firms cannot undercut each other by an arbitrarily small amount, one of the necessary ingredients giving rise to the non-existence of a pure strategy equilibrium. This can give rise to multiple pure-strategy equilibria, {{some of which may}} be distant from the competitive <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price.</b> More recently, Prabal Roy Chowdhury has combined the notion of discrete pricing with the idea that firms choose prices and the quantities they want to sell at that price as in Allen–Hellwig.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model is}} {{commonly}} applied to wages, {{in the market}} for labor. The typical roles of supplier and demander are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The demanders of labor are businesses, which try to buy the type of labor they need at the lowest price. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price</b> for a certain type of labor is the wage rate. However, economist Steve Fleetwood revisited the empirical reality of supply and demand curves in labor markets and concluded that the evidence is [...] "at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence." [...] For instance, he cites Kaufman and Hotchkiss (2006): [...] "For adult men, nearly all studies find the labour supply curve to be negatively sloped or backward bending." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marginalist theory, such as above, {{describes}} the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to income and wealth constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject {{to their own}} constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, {{and the price of}} inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares marginal revenue (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the marginal cost of a good, with marginal profit the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop.

2500|$|A firm's cost is an {{increasing}} function of the wage rate, the higher the wage rate, the fewer hours an employer will demand of employees. This is because, as the wage rate rises, it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers (or hire them for fewer hours). The demand of labor curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right. Since higher wages increase the quantity supplied, the supply of labor curve is upward sloping, and is shown as a line moving up and to the right. [...] If no minimum wage is in place, wages will adjust until quantity of labor demanded is equal to quantity supplied, reaching equilibrium, where the supply and demand curves intersect. Minimum wage behaves as a classical price floor on labor. Standard theory says that, if set above the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>price,</b> more labor {{will be willing to}} be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers, creating a surplus of labor, i.e. unemployment. The basic economic model of markets predicts the same of other commodities (like milk and wheat, for example): Artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause the supply of it to increase and the demand for it to lessen. The result is a surplus of the commodity. When there is a wheat surplus, the government buys it. Since the government does not hire surplus labor, the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment, which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them.|$|E
