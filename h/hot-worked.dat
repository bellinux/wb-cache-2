They are developed to endure the severe conditions by high mechanical properties attained by a complex microstructure. Even though the <b>hot-work</b> tool steel has been improved {{over the years by}} alloying and heat treatment, damages still occur. Thermal fatigue is believed {{to be one of the}} most common failure mechanisms in hot forming tools. In this thesis tools used in hot forging and die casting were examined to determine damage, material response, thermal fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Different chromium martensitic <b>hot-work</b> tool steels, heat treated at four different austenitizing temperatures were experimentally tested in thermal fatigue and isothermal fatigue. The materials were then evaluated using X-ray line broadening analysis and transmission electron microscopy to explore the relation between fatigue softening and the change in microstructure. The high temperature fatigue softening was also simulated using an elasto-plastic, non-linear kinematic and isotropic model. The model was implemented in a numerical simulation to support the integration of die design, tool steel properties and its use. It was found that the dominant damage mechanisms in the investigated tools were thermal fatigue and that tool material experiences a three stage softening at high temperature loading. The primary stage was concluded to be influenced by the dislocation density and the second stage by the temper resistance i. e. carbide morphology. The microstructural changes during the softening stages were also connected to the non-linear kinematic and isotropic model.

40|$|<b>Hot-work</b> {{tool steels}} make up an {{important}} group of steels that {{are able to}} perform with good strength and toughness properties at elevated temperatures and stresses. They are able to gain this behavior through their alloy composition and heat treatment, which relies on the precipitation of alloy carbides to counter the loss in strength as the tempered material becomes more ductile. As demand grows for materials that are suitable for even harsher applications and that show improved mechanical qualities, the steel industry must continuously investigate the development of new steel grades. Within this context, the present work focuses on examining the mechanical properties and microstructure of two <b>hot-work</b> tool steels, of which one is a representative steel grade (Steel A) and the second a higher-alloyed variant (Steel B), at different tempering conditions. To complement the experimental work, precipitation simulations are used to monitor the progression of secondary carbide precipitation and to examine the predicted microstructural changes through varying the alloy composition. The study finds that Steel B does not actually have improved properties with respect to Steel A and suggests that the precipitation behavior of both steels is virtually identical. Despite this, the simulation work reveals that this behavior can change dramatically to favor more positive hardness contributions by increasing the alloy content of V. In short, with the project being part of an ongoing investigation, there remain several areas of analysis that need to be completed before offering a complete picture that can ultimately play a part {{in the development of a}} new <b>hot-work</b> tool steel grade...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The investigations steels were made using the specimens made from the experimental steel, for which the working 47 CrMoWVTiCeZr 16 - 26 - 8 denotation was adopted, similar to the ones used in the ISO Standard on using the standard alloy <b>hot-work</b> tool steel X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1. Both investigated steels were melted in a vacuum electric furnace. Specimens made from the investigated steels were heat treated with austenitizing in salt bath furnaces for 30 minutes in the temperature range of 970 - 1180 °C with gradation of 30 °C. Next, the specimens were tempered twice in the temperature range of 450 - 660 °C for 2 hours. Findings: The 47 CrMoWVTiCeZr 16 - 26 - 8 steel quenched from the temperature of 1120 °C has the martensitic structure with the small portion of the retained austenite and alloy carbides partially dissolved during austenitizing (about 3. 5 %), including the MC type carbides (based on ZrC, TiC, (Ti,V) C and VC, with differing chemical compositions and crystallographic lattice parameter) and of the M 2 C 3 type (based on Ce 2 C 3).

40|$|Performance of {{indexable}} insert {{cutting tools}} {{is not only}} about the performance of cutting inserts. It is also about the cutting tool body, which has to provide a secure and accurate insert positioning as well as its quick and easy handling under severe working conditions. The common damage mechanisms of cutting tool bodies are fatigue and plastic deformation. Cutting tools undergo high dynamic stresses going in and out cutting engagement; as a result, an adequate level of fatigue strength is the essential steel property. Working temperatures of tool bodies in the insert pocket can reach up to 600 °C, why the tool steel requires high softening resistance to avoid plastic deformation. Machinability is also essential, as machining of the steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a cutting tool. The overall aim of the study is to improve the tool body performance by use of an advanced steel grade with an optimized combination of all the demanding properties. Due to the high-temperature conditions, the thesis concerns mostly <b>hot-work</b> tool steels increasing also the general knowledge of their microstructure, mechanical properties and machinability. Knowing the positive effect of sulphur on machinability of steels, the first step was to indentify a certain limit of the sulphur addition, which would not reduce the fatigue strength of the tool body below an acceptable level. In tool bodies, where the demand on surface roughness was low and a geometrical stress concentrator was present, the addition of sulphur could be up to 0. 09 wt%. Fatigue performance of the cutting tools to a large extent depended on the steel resistance to stress relaxation under high dynamic loading and elevated temperatures. The stress relaxation behaviour, material substructure and dislocation characteristics in low-alloyed and <b>hot-work</b> tool steels were studied using X-ray diffraction under thermal and mechanical loading.  Different tool steels exhibited different stress relaxation resistance depending on their microstructure, temper resistance and working temperature. <b>Hot-work</b> tool steels showed to be more preferable to low-alloyed tool steels because of their ability to inhibit the rearrangement and annihilation of induced dislocations. High-temperature softening resistance of the <b>hot-work</b> tool steels was investigated during high-temperature hold-times and isothermal fatigue and discussed with respect to their microstructure. Carbide morphology and precipitation were determined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Machinability of a prehardened <b>hot-work</b> tool steel of varying nickel content from 1 to 5 wt% was investigated in end milling and drilling operations. Machining the higher nickel containing steels resulted in longer tool life and generated lower cutting forces and tool/workpiece interface temperature.

In the case of investigations of the microstructural changes, quenched samples were heated with a heating rate of 0. 05 °C/s to the temperatures of 150, 280 and 650 °C. The microstructure of investigated steel were examined using light microscope Axiovert 200 MAT, scanning electron microscope Stereoscan 120 and transmission JEM 200 CX microscope. The measurements of hardness were performed with the Vickers HPO 250 apparatus. Findings: Heating of the investigated steel from the as-quenched state resulted in the occurrence of 4 primary transformations: precipitation of ε carbide, M 3 C precipitation, transformation of retained austenite and precipitation of alloy carbides of MC and M 2 C type, nucleating independently.

The microstructure of as-clad coating showed a refined dendritic structure due to fast cooling and rapid solidification. X-ray diffraction (XRD) phase identification revealed that the coating consisted of a majority of martensite phase plus certain amount of retained austenite phase (2 ̆ 23 c 20 vol...|$|R
