25|$|It is safest to longe in an {{enclosed}} area. If the horse escapes, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to catch, and {{an enclosed}} area {{will make him}} easier to control on the longe. Ideally, a 60 to 70-foot (20–25 m) round pen is used. However, the corner of any enclosed arena or small field may also be used. For safety, it is best {{if there is no}} one riding in the longeing area.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient's body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, microwave, and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, {{as well as of}} developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians also hope to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real time—heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. In magnetic hyperthermia or magnetic fluid hyperthermia method, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to control temperature distribution by controlling the velocity of ferrofluid injection and size of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E

500|$|Proposals to {{give the}} UNGA {{legislative}} power–including the [...] "binding triad" [...] idea which would have made UNGA resolutions binding if passed by countries constituting a supermajority of the world's states, population, and economic production–have made little headway. According to Heinrich, once the UNPA is established, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to gather support for empowering it. The assembly's own members {{can be expected to}} play a major role in pushing for its evolution by seeking a UN Charter amendment to make it a [...] "principal organ" [...] in parallel with the General Assembly.

2500|$|Advocates of {{the idea}} argue that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> for parents and {{employers}} to block the entire TLD, rather than using more complex and error-prone content-based filtering, without imposing any restrictions on {{those who wish to}} access it.

2500|$|While {{his appeal}} against the {{sentence}} was still pending, Childers was executed on 24 November 1922 by firing squad at the Beggars Bush Barracks in Dublin. Before his execution he {{shook hands with}} the firing squad. He also obtained a promise from his then 16-year-old son, the future President Erskine Hamilton Childers, to seek out and shake the hand of every man who had signed his death sentence. His final words, spoken at the firing squad, were: [...] "Take {{a step or two}} forward, lads, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of Autumn 2013, all CUNY {{undergraduates}} {{are required}} to take an administration-dictated common core of courses which have been claimed to meet specific [...] "learning outcomes" [...] or standards. Since the courses are accepted University wide, the administration claims <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> for students to transfer course credits between CUNY colleges. It also reduced the number of core courses some CUNY colleges had required, to a level below national norms, particularly in the sciences. The program is the target of several lawsuits by students and faculty, and {{was the subject of a}} [...] "no confidence" [...] vote by the faculty, who rejected it by an overwhelming 92% margin.|$|E

[...] However, a 2002 published California appellate court decision (the Salinas case) {{made it clear that}} stormwater fees and charges are not exempt from the constitutional election requirement for property-related fees under Proposition 218 in stating: [...] “We conclude that article XIII D [...] required the City to subject the proposed storm drainage fee to a vote by the property owners or the voting residents of the affected area.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association {{states that}} some local governments, {{in an effort}} to {{increase}} the chances of passing a tax, will propose a temporary tax instead of a permanent tax. The general strategy is once a temporary tax passes, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> for the local government to either extend or increase an already existing tax in the future. Based on historical election statistics, once local government voters pass a “temporary” tax, it is generally easier to obtain subsequent voter approval for a tax extension or a tax increase. [...] The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association also states that local governments rarely allow temporary taxes to expire on their own without at least an effort to extend and/or increase the tax, and that voters should assume that any proposed temporary tax will not end at the specified expiration date, but will instead either be extended for an additional period of years or be made permanent.|$|E
2500|$|On December 11, 2010, the Gawker group's 1.3 million {{commenter}} {{accounts and}} their entire website source code {{was released by}} a hacker group named Gnosis. Gawker issued an advisory notice stating: [...] "Our user databases {{appear to have been}} compromised. The passwords were encrypted. But simple ones may be vulnerable to a brute-force attack. You should change your Gawker password and on any other sites on which you've used the same passwords". Gawker was found to be using DES-based crypt(3) password hashes with 12 bits of salt. Security researchers found that password cracking software [...] "John the Ripper" [...] was able to quickly crack over 50% of the passwords from those records with crackable password hashes. Followers of Twitter accounts set up with the same email and password were spammed with advertisements. [...] The Gnosis group notes that with the source code to the Gawker content management system they obtained, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to develop new exploits.|$|E
