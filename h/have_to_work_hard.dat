25|$|A {{free flow}} helmet {{supplies}} a continuous flow of {{air to the}} diver, and he breathes this as it flows past. Work of breathing is minimal, but flow rate must be high if the diver works hard, and this is noisy, affecting communications and requiring hearing protection to avoid damage to the ears. This type of helmet is popular where divers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> in relatively shallow water for long periods. It is also useful when diving in contaminated environments, where the helmet is sealed onto a dry suit, and the entire system is kept at a slight positive pressure by adjusting the back-pressure of the exhaust valve, {{to ensure that there}} is no leakage into the helmet. This type of helmet is often large in volume, and as it is attached to the suit, it does not move with the head. The diver must move his body to face anything he wants to see. For this reason the faceplate is large and there is often an upper window or side windows to improve the field of vision.|$|E

He left several unpublished manuscripts, including a novel, Behind the Veil: More than Just a Tale; a 67-page text, Passion and Protein; and a 392-page edition of Eight Passion Proteins, which, Carter writes, was rejected by Oxford University Press in 1971.|$|E
500|$|The celebratory mood {{continued}} into the next preseason, when Adams sent the team for two weeks of training camp in Hawaii. Rymkus was upset by the distractions caused by the decision. [...] "We {{found it hard to}} think football around the palm trees", he said. [...] "A preseason camp has to be hard, and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard.</b> You can't do it in a place like Hawaii." [...] The team got off to a 1–3–1 start in 1961, and Adams fired him on October 14. Adams said the decision was [...] "based on the conclusion the material on hand has not been used to its fullest potential". Wally Lemm was given the head coaching job, but the shake-up prompted Speedie to resign. Under Lemm, the Oilers regrouped to win their second consecutive title.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Stefani's then-husband Gavin Rossdale {{speaking}} in French and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics describe Stefani talking about [...] "flying first class" [...] and [...] "livin' like a queen". She talks about being luxuriously in love and calls her lover Limousine and Treasure Chest. She talks about the increasing passion {{between her and her}} partner, and says, [...] "Our passion it just multiplies" [...] and [...] "got in the fifth gear, baby". In the chorus she tells that love is getting expensive and she and her partner <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> night and day to be rich in love, and after working hard, when they lay back together, they get the payback. After the second verse, the song gets slower and Stefani repeats [...] "Cha-ching, cha-ching" [...] four times alternated with lines talking about getting [...] "hooked up with the love" [...] and [...] "hydroponic love". The song ends with Rossdale speaking more lines in French.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel." [...] However, Observer television reviewer Kathryn Flett criticised the plot as unrealistic: ...|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adelaide was {{established}} as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress, and realised that the eastern colonies suffered {{from a lack of}} available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals. Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen. [...] Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants, who would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land. As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share the convict settlement history of other Australian cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart.|$|E
