40|$|Two {{factors which}} limit the {{complexity}} of GaAs MESFET VLSI circuits are considered. Power dissipation sets an upper complexity limit for a given logic circuit implementation and thermal design. Uniformity of device characteristics and the circuit configuration determines the electrical functional yield. Projection of VLSI complexity based on these factors indicates that logic chips of 15, 000 gates are feasible with the most promising static circuits if a maximum power dissipation of 5 W per chip is assumed. While lower power per gate and therefore more gates per chip {{can be obtained by}} using a popular E/D FET circuit, yields are shown to be small when practical device parameter tolerances are applied.

40|$|AbstractVitesse has {{received}} a $ 6 m DARPA contract to develop InP ICs for military communications, in collaboration with BAE Systems and the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC). It will develop advanced manufacturing processes and communication ICs using its sub-micron VIP- 2 InP HBT technology. The initial 18 -month contract contains option phases, which, if implemented, would bring {{the total value of}} the contract to more than $ 15 m. The contract allows Vitesse to enhance the capabilities of its VIP- 2 process, selected for its ability to enhance speed, power, performance, circuit reliability and production-worthy manufacturing practices required for the DARPA specification. InP technology allows direct digital synthesis of high-frequency signals, simplifying the system design and reducing the number of discrete components required in advanced satellite, aircraft and terrestrial communication systems. Vitesse will collaborate with BAE Systems on the design of communications circuits; initially, these are for direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) for electronic warfare and radar applications. UIUC will focus on research for the next-generation transistor structures meant to further <b>extend</b> <b>circuit</b> performance and applications. A factor of two improvements in critical performance parameters has already been attained in early VIP- 2 experiments at 0. 45 μ. Further scaling is planned, incorporating UIUC’s findings, the ultimate goal to shrink device geometry to 0. 25 μ. This will result in static flip-flop toggle frequencies of 150 GHz.

The possibility of stable carry trades emerges. In high interest rate, hedge economies, powerful banks invest surplus loan interest. With speculation, banks lobby to enter investment markets and the system is precariously liquid/illiquid. In a Ponzi economy, where loans never get repaid, solvency is a balance between increasing reserves, reducing interest rates and rebuilding banks’ balance sheets during systemic crises. Simulating bank bailouts, household bailouts and a Keynesian boost suggests that bank bailouts are the least effective intervention, exerting downward pressure on wages and household spending: austerity.

40|$|SummaryNeural {{circuits}} for essential natural {{behaviors are}} shaped by selective pressure to coordinate reliable execution of flexible goal-directed actions. However, the structural and functional organization of survival-oriented circuits is poorly understood due to exceptionally complex neuroanatomy. This is exemplified by AGRP neurons, which are a molecularly defined population that is sufficient to rapidly coordinate voracious food seeking and consumption behaviors. Here, we use cell-type-specific techniques for neural circuit manipulation and projection-specific anatomical analysis to examine the organization of this critical homeostatic circuit that regulates feeding. We show that AGRP neuronal circuits use a segregated, parallel, and redundant output configuration. AGRP neuron axon projections that target different brain regions originate from distinct subpopulations, several of which are sufficient to independently evoke feeding. The concerted anatomical and functional analysis of AGRP neuron projection populations reveals a constellation of core forebrain nodes, which {{are part of an}} <b>extended</b> <b>circuit</b> that mediates feeding behavior...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This circuit generates and {{controls}} a low-noise bias voltage for avalanche photodiodes (APDs) used in optical communications. The variable voltage controls the avalanche gain of the APD to optimize sensitivity in a fiber-optic receiver. The circuit employs a low-noise fixed-frequency PWM boost converter with an inductor operating in discontinuous-current mode. Slow switching {{of the internal}} MOSFET reduces high-frequency spikes for low-noise performance. A complete circuit is provided, and an <b>extended</b> <b>circuit</b> is suggested. The latter employs an ADC for digital control allowing a microcontroller to read a thermistor to provide temperature compensation by referring to a lookup table. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are used as receiving detectors in optical communications. The APD's high sensitivity and wide bandwidth make it popular with designers. APDs operate with a reverse voltage across the junction that enables the creation of electron-hole pairs in response to incident radiation. The electron-hole pairs are then swept by the applied field and converted to a current that {{is proportional to the}} radiation intensity. Applying a variable reverse-bias voltage across the device junction creates a variable avalanche gain during APD operation. In turn, varying the avalanche gain optimizes sensitivity in the fiber-optic receiver. To achieve satisfactory levels of avalanche gain, however, many APDs require high reverse-bia...|$|R

Geometrical bases are certain bases of this column matroid. We establish connections between the bases of matroids M(σ) and the geometrical bases of A with respect to F.

We also consider a matroid M and the incidence relation between what we call the <b>extended</b> <b>circuits</b> of M and the bases of M. Applying the technique above we obtain the matroids M(σ) on the set of bases of the matroid M.
