5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{prepared}} by dissolving <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> in water. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> {{can be generated}} in many ways, and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist. The large-scale production of hydrochloric acid is almost always integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|CuCl is {{used with}} carbon monoxide, {{aluminium}} chloride, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> in the Gatterman-Koch reaction to form benzaldehydes.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> {{and the formation of}} titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> fluoride, <b>chloride</b> and bromide {{are also}} {{volcanic}} gases.|$|R
30|$|The melting and boiling {{points as}} well as the Kow {{increase}} with increasing substitution of <b>hydrogen</b> by <b>chloride.</b>|$|R
5|$|Thulium {{reacts with}} <b>{{hydrogen}}</b> <b>chloride</b> to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride. With nitric acid it yields thulium nitrate, or Tm(NO3)3.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{can also}} be used to introduce aldehyde groups onto aromatic rings, for example via the Gattermann-Koch reaction which uses carbon monoxide, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> and a copper(I) chloride co-catalyst.|$|E
5|$|H2 {{reacts with}} every {{oxidizing}} element. Hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently {{at room temperature}} with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> and hydrogen fluoride, which are also potentially dangerous acids.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we report data on {{solubility}} of choline chloride and choline acetate in shortchain linear alcohols (ethanol, 1 -propanol and 1 -butanol) at various temperatures. Furthermore, we synthetized two choline derivatives: <b>hydrogen</b> choline <b>chloride</b> glutarate ([CholGlut][Cl]) and <b>hydrogen</b> choline <b>chloride</b> succinate ([CholSucc][Cl]). Their characterization and solubility in short-chain alcohols {{as a function}} of temperature are also included. Activity coefficients were calculated and their comparisons with ideal solutions were discussed. The experimental data were correlated successfully by means of the semi-empirical Grant equation...|$|R
5000|$|Vomiting {{results in}} the loss of {{hydrochloric}} acid (<b>hydrogen</b> and <b>chloride</b> ions) with the stomach contents. In the hospital setting this can commonly occur from nasogastric suction tubes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the above}} scheme, the reductive {{cyclisation}} is effected by Raney nickel and hydrazine. Palladium-on-carbon and <b>hydrogen,</b> stannous <b>chloride,</b> sodium hydrosulfite, or iron in acetic acid are also effective reducing agents.|$|R
5|$|Hazards {{posed by}} {{titanium}} tetrachloride generally {{arise from the}} release of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> (HCl). TiCl4 is a strong Lewis acid, exothermically forming adducts with even weak bases such as THF and explosively with water, releasing HCl.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid is a corrosive, strong {{mineral acid}} with many {{industrial}} uses. A colorless, highly pungent solution of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> (HCl) in water, when it reacts with an organic base {{it forms a}} hydrochloride salt.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> gas {{may be made}} by drying {{the acid}} with {{concentrated}} sulfuric acid. Deuterium chloride, DCl, may be produced by reacting benzoyl chloride with heavy water (D2O).|$|E

50|$|By {{formally}} substituting the <b>hydrogen</b> atom, cyanoformyl <b>chloride,</b> ClC(O)CN, and cyanoformyl bromide, BrC(O)CN are obtained.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, sodium ions are {{actively}} reabsorbed. This {{means that the}} majority of secreted K+ and Na+ ions return to the cytoplasm. In the canaliculus, secreted <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>chloride</b> ions mix and are secreted into the lumen of the oxyntic gland.|$|R
5|$|Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> is a {{weak acid}} when {{dissolved}} in acetic acid. This is because acetic acid {{is a much}} weaker base than water.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} the hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride.</b> It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>hydrogen</b> ion, <b>chloride,</b> and 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate upon the oxygen binding of {{hemoglobin}} may be satisfactorily described by an allosteric model employing three affinity states. The allosteric two-state model {{does not provide}} even an approximate description except under defined extreme conditions. In particular, the two-state model cannot provide a correct interpretation of recently reported electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance data...|$|R
40|$|The {{myeloperoxidase}} – <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide – <b>chloride</b> (MPO-H 2 O 2 -Cl) {{system is}} an antimicrobial system of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. We {{demonstrated that the}} MPO-H 2 O 2 -Cl system is fungicidal for Trichophyton rubrum, Fungal growth of synchronous cell culture of T. rubrum germlings was assayed by measuring the uptake of tritiated N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and {{the viability of the}} fungi was assayed by counting colony-forming units. Cytotoxins produced by the interaction of myeloperoxidase with <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide and <b>chloride</b> ion were fungicidal for T. rubrum. Growth inhibition was abolished in the presence of catalase ro L-methionine. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes through the MPO-H 2 O 2 -Cl system may prevent invasion and sepsis by dermatophytes {{even in the absence of}} specific immunity...|$|R
5|$|Some non-aqueous {{solvents}} can {{behave as}} acids. An acidic solvent will increase basicity of substances dissolved in it. For example, the compound CH3COOH {{is known as}} acetic acid because of its acidic behaviour in water. However it behaves as a base in liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride,</b> a much more acidic solvent.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} gases released during {{volcanic activity}} are water, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride.</b> These sulfur and halogen gases and metals {{are removed from}} the atmosphere by processes of chemical reaction, dry and wet deposition, and by adsorption {{onto the surface of}} volcanic ash.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{procedure}} {{described in the}} 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.|$|E
30|$|The {{geometry}} of isomeric pyridines were studied by X-ray crystallography (Kubiak et al. 2002), microwave spectroscopy (Ford 1975) and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (Arenas et al. 1993). DFT vibrational studies of 5 -bromo- 2 -nitropyridine (Sundaraganesan et al. 2005), pyridinium complexes (Tayyari et al. 2010), and 2 -chloro- 5 -bromopyridine (Hiremath et al. 2010; Kishor and Bhoop 2013) were reported. Tautomerization and rotamerization of aminopyridines {{has been reported}} (Davoodnia et al. 2011; Alkorta and Elguero 2002; Pietrzycki et al. 1993). The vibration (IR and Raman) spectra of aminopyridines, methyl-substituted aminopyridines and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chlorides</b> of aminopyridines had been determined experimentally by Spinner (Spinner 1962). However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, according to literature survey there is no results based on quantum chemical calculations, on tautomerization, transition state structures and FT-IR/FT-Raman spectral studies on (2 A 3 MP) and (2 A 4 MP). Hence in the present work, we reported detailed tautomeization, transition state activation energies and interpretations of the infrared and Raman spectra based on the experimental and theoretical results. Reconsidering the vibrational analysis of (2 A 3 MP) and (2 A 4 MP) with more accurate FT-IR machine and highly accurate simulation programs lead to new improved vibrational assignments.|$|R
2500|$|Lacking {{the ability}} to form <b>hydrogen</b> bonds, acid <b>chlorides</b> have lower boiling and melting points than similar {{carboxylic}} acids. [...] For example, acetic acid boils at 118°C, whereas acetyl chloride boils at 51°C. Like most carbonyl compounds, infrared spectroscopy reveals a band near 1750cm−1.|$|R
30|$|Sodium {{alginate}} (medium viscosity) from {{brown algae}} and chitosan (low molecular weight, degree of deacetylation 75 – 85  %) {{were obtained from}} Sigma-Aldrich (Spruce Street, St. Louis, USA). Polyethylene glycol 4000, disodium <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate, sodium <b>chloride</b> and calcium chloride were supplied by Merck specialities (Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai), India.|$|R
5|$|In the 20th century, the Leblanc {{process was}} {{effectively}} {{replaced by the}} Solvay process without a hydrochloric acid by-product. Since hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications, the commercial interest initiated other production methods, {{some of which are}} still used today. After the year 2000, hydrochloric acid is mostly made by absorbing by-product <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> from industrial organic compounds production.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It {{can be prepared}} by introducing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about 500°C. This green solid has a melting point of 600°C, and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride. Upon heating to nearly melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common salt {{is converted to}} soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} {{is produced}} industrially from <b>hydrogen</b> cyanide, ferrous <b>chloride,</b> and calcium hydroxide, {{the combination of}} which affords Ca2Fe(CN)6 · 11H2O. This solution is then treated with potassium salts to precipitate the mixed calcium-potassium salt CaK2Fe(CN)6, {{which in turn is}} treated with potassium carbonate to give the tetrapotassium salt.|$|R
50|$|Phosphate-buffered saline (abbreviated PBS) is {{a buffer}} {{solution}} {{commonly used in}} biological research. It is a water-based salt solution containing disodium <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate, sodium <b>chloride</b> and, in some formulations, potassium chloride and potassium dihydrogen phosphate. The osmolarity and ion concentrations of the solutions match those {{of the human body}} (isotonic).|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{ferrocyanide}} {{is produced}} industrially from <b>hydrogen</b> cyanide, ferrous <b>chloride,</b> and calcium hydroxide, {{the combination of}} which affords Ca2Fe(CN)6.11H2O. A solution of this salt is then treated with sodium salts to precipitate the mixed calcium-sodium salt CaNa2Fe(CN)6, {{which in turn is}} treated with sodium carbonate to give the tetrasodium salt.|$|R
