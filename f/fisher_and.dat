40|$|<b>Fishers</b> <b>and</b> divers are {{the major}} {{resource}} users of Caribbean coral reefs. On Curaçao and Bonaire, reef condition is good relative to the Caribbean average, but fishes and corals have greatly declined {{over the last few}} decades. We interviewed 177 <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> 211 professional SCUBA divers to assess their views on the extent and causes of degradation. Fishers know fish stocks are severely depleted and declining, whereas divers were aware of declines but had ‘‘shifted baselines’’ and consider the reefs healthy. <b>Fishers</b> <b>and</b> divers differ in perceptions of the causes and appropriate remedies for decline. Fishers generally blame external factors such as changes in climate, currents, or industrial fishing offshore, whereas divers primarily blame overfishing and coastal development. Nevertheless, the great majority of both <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> divers support more management of both fishing and diving. Thus the social climate is ripe for balanced and strong restrictions on both groups for reef recovery and sustainable use. Exclusion of both <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> divers from protected areas of significant size around the islands would be a major step forward towards the long-term conservation of reef resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{marine and}} coastal {{ecosystem}} of Penang experiences problems with water pollution and overexploitation of fish stock {{is not a}} new phenomenon. The degradation of the marine and coastal ecosystem, coupled with natural hazards such as the 2004 tsunami, have affected the livelihoods of the inshore <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> aquaculturists who depend on marine and coastal resources for a living. This study addresses the vulnerability and the coping strategies of the inshore <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> aquaculturists (shrimp, fish and cockle aquaculturists) in Penang by applying the sustainable livelihood framework and resilience theory. In order to gain an in-depth understanding their livelihoods, a qualitative research method was applied. Interviews with the inshore <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> aquaculturists were conducted to explore their perceptions of their access to various capitals, distribution of assets, and challenges in fisheries. It was found that both <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> cockle aquaculturists are more vulnerable than shrimp and fish aquaculturists, who have higher levels of livelihood capitals, which made them more resilient in recovery from shortfalls. This study also reveals the political and economic factors that have worsened the livelihoods of the inshore <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> aquaculturists in Penang, while weakening their chances of coping with various stressors. Stressors from anthropogenic impacts coupled with corruption and policies that favor economic development over the marine and coastal environment have increased vulnerability amongst the inshore <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> aquaculturists in Penang.

Unaware of Cherski's identity, <b>Fisher</b> <b>and</b> Briggs track him to a Voron base in Chittagong and find him living in a nearby apartment.

Encouraging their son's love of music, Fisher's parents gave him piano lessons; he also learned to play the guitar.

Trip satisfaction was modeled {{as a function}} of subjective evaluations of various trip aspects. Satisfaction of <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> nonfishers was related to evaluations of environment quality and weather quality. Satisfaction of fishers was also related to evaluations of fishing quality. There was no effect of evaluation of marine life quality, facilities quality, number of people encountered, number of vessels encountered, or number of wildlife encounters on satisfaction for either group. Results are consistent with the multiple-satisfactions concept of recreation satisfaction, and provide insights into the types of experiences sought by <b>fishers</b> <b>and</b> nonfishers in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop exact {{relationships}} between empirical <b>Fisher</b> indexes <b>and</b> their theoretical Malmquist and Konus counterparts. We begin by using implicit Malmquist price and price recovery indexes to establish exact relationships between Malmquist quantity and productivity indexes <b>and</b> <b>Fisher</b> quantity <b>and</b> productivity indexes. We then show that Malmquist quantity and productivity indexes <b>and</b> <b>Fisher</b> price <b>and</b> price recovery indexes “almost” satisfy the product test with the relevant value change, and we derive a quantity mix function that ensures {{satisfaction of the}} product test. We next use implicit Konus quantity and productivity indexes to establish exact relationships between Konus price and price recovery indexes <b>and</b> <b>Fisher</b> price <b>and</b> price recovery indexes. We then show that Konus price and price recovery indexes <b>and</b> <b>Fisher</b> quantity <b>and</b> productivity indexes “almost” satisfy the product test with the relevant value change, we derive a price mix function that ensures satisfaction of the product test, and we show that this price mix function differs fundamentally from the quantity mix function relating Malmquist <b>and</b> <b>Fisher</b> indexes...|$|R
