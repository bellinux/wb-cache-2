5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian {{surrender}} to the Allies in September 1943, Premuda was still docked in Genoa, and was seized by Germany. Plans to convert <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> radar picket for night fighters were abandoned. In August 1944, following the replacement of her armament, she was commissioned into the German Navy as a Torpedoboot Ausland (foreign torpedo boat) with the designation TA32. The ship saw action shelling Allied positions on the Italian coast and laying naval mines.

5|$|Created by comedian Bill Cosby, Clair {{is based}} on Cosby's own wife, Camille. Cosby {{originally}} intended for the character to be a plumber, but the producers and Camille ultimately convinced him to rewrite <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> lawyer to reflect a family that closer resembled their own. At one point, Clair had also been envisioned as a Dominican housewife who speaks Spanish when frustrated, inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, but this idea was also abandoned. Rashad, originally credited as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, won the role by exhibiting a subtlety in her audition that other candidates lacked. After marrying husband Ahmad Rashad and adopting his surname, Rashad became pregnant with their child during the show's third season, thus requiring her to conceal her pregnancy during episode tapings.|$|E

Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Simón.|$|E
5|$|Fatale {{observes the}} actions of the New Champions as its newest member. She feels uncomfortable {{replacing}} a popular, deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group, but she proves herself to be highly competent and earns the respect of her teammates. Fatale's closest friend on the team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that made her a cyborg, with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans.|$|E

5|$|For {{the third}} option, he quotes Panyasis, who states that King Theias of Assyria had a {{daughter}} called Smyrna. Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite, incurring {{the wrath of the}} goddess, by whom was made {{to fall in love with}} her father; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her identity was discovered. Smyrna fled, but her father later caught up with her. Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible, prompting them to turn <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tree, which was named the Smyrna. Ten months later the tree cracked and Adonis was born from it.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, Coulter {{began dating}} her manager Richard Harrison, and in August 2010, the couple {{went public with}} their relationship. Before meeting Harrison, Coulter was {{considered}} {{a role model for}} curvy girls and stated that she was proud of being a size 14 woman. She has since lost over 30 kilograms, which has transformed <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> size 8. The couple announced their engagement in the 7 January 2013 issue of New Idea magazine. After two years of being engaged, Coulter and Harrison married at the Château Bouffémont in Paris, France on 5 August 2015. Coulter appeared {{on the cover of the}} 17 August 2015 issue of New Idea in her wedding dress.|$|E

60|$|They {{went into}} the drawing-room together, and half an hour had passed when Mrs. Acton beckoned to Nasmyth, and he {{followed}} <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> adjoining alcove. She sat down {{and looked at him}} reproachfully.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the budgetary problems, the senior Italian navy commanders could not agree on {{the shape of the}} post-war Regia Marina. One faction advocated a traditional surface battle fleet, while a second believed a fleet composed of aircraft carriers, torpedo boats, and submarines would be ideal. A third faction, led by Admiral Sechi, argued that a balanced fleet with a core of battleships and carriers was the most flexible option. In order to secure budgetary space for new construction, Sechi drastically reduced the number of older ships in service; he also cancelled the battleships of the Francesco Caracciolo class. Francesco Caracciolo was sold on 25 October 1920 to the Navigazione Generale Italiana shipping company. The firm planned to convert <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> merchant ship, but the work was deemed too expensive, and so she was temporarily mothballed in Baia Bay outside Naples.|$|E

After the nurse had prevented Smyrna from committing suicide, she helped her engage her father in sexual intercourse. When Smyrna became pregnant, she hid in the woods from shame. Venus pitied the girl's fate, changing <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> myrrh tree, from which was born Adonis.|$|E

He separates <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human {{to find a}} cure for a disease. The Voyager crew rescues Torres and restores her to her original state, while she attempts to reconcile with her identity as a half-human half-Klingon. The episode guest stars Rob LaBelle as an unnamed Talaxian prisoner. Actress Joy Kilpatrick was cast as Dawson's photo double to avoid a reliance on split screen.|$|E
