40|$|In {{small sample}} studies with binary outcome data, {{use of a}} normal {{approximation}} for hypothesis testing can lead to substantial inflation of the type-I error-rate. Consequently, exact statistical methods are necessitated, and accordingly, much {{research has been conducted}} to facilitate this. Recently, this has included methodology for the design of two-stage multi-arm studies utilising <b>exact</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>tests.</b> These designs were demonstrated to carry substantial efficiency advantages over a fixed sample design, but generally suffered from strong conservatism. An alternative classical means of small sample inference with dichotomous data is Fisher's exact test. However, this method is limited to single-stage designs when there are multiple arms. Therefore, here, we propose a two-stage version of Fisher's exact test, with the potential to stop early to accept or reject null hypotheses, which is applicable to multi-arm studies. In particular, we provide precise formulae describing the requirements for achieving weak or strong control of the familywise error-rate with this design. Following this, we describe how the design parameters may be optimised to confer desirable operating characteristics. For a motivating example based on a phase II clinical trial, we demonstrate that on average our approach is less conservative than corresponding optimal designs based on <b>exact</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

In addition, it is found that the <b>exact</b> conditional <b>binomial</b> <b>test</b> is conservative and not powerful for testing the hypothesis. Moreover, the asymptotic McNemar’s test is shown to have incorrect size; that is, its size is larger than the nominal level of the test.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{reason that}} the chi-squared distribution is widely used {{is that it is}} a member of the class of likelihood ratio tests (LRT). LRT's have several desirable properties; in particular, LRT's commonly provide the highest power to reject the null hypothesis (Neyman-Pearson lemma). However, the normal and chi-squared approximations are only valid asymptotically. For this reason, it is preferable to use the t distribution rather than the normal approximation or the chi-squared approximation for small sample size. Similarly, in analyses of contingency tables, the chi-squared approximation will be poor for small sample size, and it is preferable to use Fisher's exact test. Ramsey and Ramsey show that the <b>exact</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>test</b> is always more powerful than the normal approximation.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{filtering}} is {{a fundamental}} process in the ecological assembly of communities. Recently developed phylogenetic tools identify patterns associated with environmental filtering across whole communities. Here we introduce a novel method that allows the detection of traits involved in the environmental filtering of species from specific clades in specific habitat types. Our approach identifies nonindependent trait/habitat/clade (THC) associations and also provides a framework for detecting clearly defined two‐way trait/clade, trait/habitat, and clade/habitat associations. The THC method relies on <b>exact</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>tests</b> and differentiates THC associations resulting from a three‐way interaction from those that are generated {{by one or more}} underlying significant two‐way interactions. It can also detect THC associations for which there are no significant two‐way associations (trait/habitat, trait/clade, clade/habitat). To illustrate the THC method, we examine plant pollination and dispersal traits from six habitat types in a fragmented Costa Rican landscape.

40|$|Abstract Background Finding over- or {{under-represented}} motifs {{in biological}} sequences {{is now a}} common task in genomics. Thanks to p -value calculation for motif counts, exceptional motifs are identified and represent candidate functional motifs. The present work addresses the related question of comparing the exceptionality of one motif in two different sequences. Just comparing the motif count p -values in each sequence is indeed not sufficient to decide if this motif is significantly more exceptional in one sequence {{compared to the other}} one. A statistical test is required. Results We develop and analyze two statistical tests, an exact binomial one and an asymptotic likelihood ratio test, to decide whether the exceptionality of a given motif is equivalent or significantly different in two sequences of interest. For that purpose, motif occurrences are modeled by Poisson processes, with a special care for overlapping motifs. Both tests can take the sequence compositions into account. As an illustration, we compare the octamer exceptionalities in the Escherichia coli K- 12 backbone versus variable strain-specific loops.

For large counts, we advise to use the likelihood ratio test which is asymptotic but strongly correlated with the <b>exact</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>test</b> and very simple to use. </p...|$|E

The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) provides a monthly package of USDA commodity foods to low-income seniors, mothers and children. Seniors comprise the vast majority of CSFP participants. CSFP aims to improve the health of participants by providing foods that are rich in nutrients typically lacking in the target population's diets. The question of whether CSFP succeeds in this aim has not been tested, and the paucity of evidence for the program's effectiveness may potentially place it and other similar programs at risk. This study sought to identify whether intake of key nutrients of concern in low-income elderly differ between elderly CSFP participants and eligible nonparticipants, to identify whether adequacy of intake of key nutrients differ between these groups, and to determine whether eligible nonparticipants utilize other food assistance programs to meet their nutritional needs. A food frequency questionnaire was self-administered by 135 volunteer subjects. Data from 64 FFQs were used to test the hypotheses that intake of eleven key nutrients would be higher, and prevalence of inadequacy lower, among CSFP participants (n = 26) compared with nonparticipants (n = 38), and that more nonparticipants would utilize other food programs compared with CSFP participants. Nutrient intake was computed using a Harvard nutrient database. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U <b>tests,</b> <b>exact</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>tests,</b> and Fisher's <b>exact</b> tests were used to test hypotheses. Results revealed no significant difference in intake or prevalence of inadequacy of any key nutrients between CSFP participants and nonparticipants, though participants tended to have lower prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intake compared with nonparticipants (P = 0. 06). A greater proportion of CSFP participants (. 692) received food stamps compared with nonparticipants (. 297), while use of other food assistance did not differ. The results suggest that CSFP provides {{a large portion of the}} DRI for several key nutrients and may be a valuable resource for referrals to other health and nutrition programs. The results indicate a need for targeted nutrition education to increase intake of under-utilized, nutrient-rich CSFP foods.

METHODS: Nineteen subjects with familial Alzheimer disease underwent serial clinical and neuropsychological assessments. Eight of these had undergone presymptomatic assessments. The follow-up period was 1 to 10 years (mean, 5 years). The relative timing of the occurrence of 3 markers of disease onset and progression (onset of symptoms, Mini-Mental State Examination score < or = 24, and impaired scores on a range of neuropsychological tests) were compared using the <b>binomial</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: Neurological abnormalities were not prominent, although myoclonus appeared early in some.

TMD was diagnosed using Axis I of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (2011). Oro-facial functions were evaluated using the Nordic Orofacial Test-Screening (NOT-S), which involves both an interview and a clinical examination. BF was measured using a digital gnathodynamometer. Age and body mass index (BMI) were also considered. the data were analysed by the following tests: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Student's t-test, Spearman and Pearson coefficients, Qui-square <b>test,</b> Fisher's <b>exact</b> or <b>binomial</b> <b>test,</b> as indicated. Moreover, univariate and multivariable logistic regression were applied. for the TMD group, scores associated with NOT-S interview and NOT-S total were higher than for the control group (P= 0 center dot 033 and P= 0 center dot 0062, respectively). No differences in BF between genders or groups (0 center dot 05) were detected. Variables included in the multivariate logistic regression were BMI and NOT-S total. Based on this analysis, NOT-S total was associated with TMDs. Reported sensory function was the specific domain within NOT-S interview that established the significant difference between the groups (P= 0 center dot 021). the TMD group also had a greater number of alterations in the face-at-rest domain of the NOT-S exam (P= 0 center dot 007). Concluding, it did not detect an association between TMDs and either dentition phase or BF. Instead, BF correlated with age and BMI. Oro-facial dysfunction was associated with TMD in the studied sample, but this association may be bidirectional, requiring further researches.
