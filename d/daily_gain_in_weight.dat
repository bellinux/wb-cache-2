40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} aimed on {{verification}} of a posibility of using blue lupin as a proteinic fodder in pig fattening {{and is based}} on a two-phase experiment that corresponds with two-phase fattening. In the first (from 22 to 41 kg) and second (from 41 to 119 kg) phase, the control group was fed with a mixture based on extracted soybean meal, the treatment group was fed with a mix containing 10 % (first phase) and 13 % (second phase) of blue lupin. The observed statistical indicators were average <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight,</b> average daily fodder consumption and average nutrients conversion. The first phase of the experiment resulted in growth of all of the observed indicators. The treatment group showed a nutrients conversion increased by 150 g and average <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> increased by 200 g in comparison with the control group. In {{the second phase of the}} experiment (during first 31 days), the observed indicators of the treatment group showed a drop (additional 350 g of mixture were needed for 1 kg gain in weight compared to the control group, the average daily gain was lower by 130 g). Subsequently a gradual stabilization followed, resulting in a final difference of 160 g in nutritions conversion and 50 g of average daily gain in favor of the control group. The economical effect of 34. 5 CZK per fattened pig was found despite of worse indicator values in the second phase. Blue lupin has potential to be used as a substitute for soybean, but only when assuming self-sufficiency, because its availability is relatively low when compared to soybean...|$|E

However, there are limited available references which define genetic factors relating objective live developmental traits to carcass composition. Weaning and post-weaning weight, height, length, girth, muscle (ratio of stifle to hip width) and fat depth of 1202 progeny from mature Hereford cows (637) mated to seven sire breeds (Jersey, Wagyu, Angus, Hereford, South Devon, Limousin and Belgian Blue) were examined for growth and development across ages. Crossbred Wagyu and Jersey were both lighter <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> and smaller <b>in</b> size (height, length and girth) than purebred Hereford and crossbred Angus, South Devon, Limousin and Belgian Blue. Within the five larger crossbreds, there were significant changes <b>in</b> relative <b>weight</b> from weaning to 600 days. Sire breeds differed in fat depth, with Angus being the fattest (9 % on average fatter than Hereford and Wagyu), and Jersey 5 % less fat than Hereford, followed by South Devon and Limousin (19 % lower than Hereford) and Belgian Blue (39 % lower than Hereford). Direct heritability ranged from 19 to 42 % and was higher than the proportion of total phenotypic variance accounted for by maternal effects (which ranged from 0 to 17 %) for most body measurement traits except for weight (38 v. 18 %) and girth (36 v. 9 %) traits at weaning, an indication of maternal effect on some body conformation traits at early ages. Muscularity (19 to 44 %) and fat depth (26 to 43 %) were moderately to highly heritable across ages.

Individual body weights were measured at birth (B), at weaning (W: mean, 22. 9 d), at the beginning of the performance test (P: mean, 72. 7 d), and at the end of the performance test (T: mean, 152. 4 d). Further, the average <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> body <b>weight</b> (ADG) of 3, 713 pigs were analyzed for the following periods: B to W (DGBW), W to P (DGWP), P to T (DGPT), B to P (DGBP), B to T (DGBT), and W to T (DGWT). Weaning ages ranged from 17 to 34 d, and were treated as fixed (WF), random with (WC) and random without (WU) consideration of an empirical relationship between weaning ages in the models. WF and WC produced the lowest AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and least fractions of error variance components in multi-traits analysis, respectively. The fractions of variances due to diverse weaning age and the weaning age correlations among ADGs of different stages (when no overlapping allowed) by WC ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 35 and from − 0. 03 to 0. 44, respectively. The maximum weaning age effects and optimal {{back fat thickness}}es were attained at weaning ages of 27 to 32 d.

In addition, BFAT was reduced by 0. 106 mm per increased day in weaning age. In conclusion, WC produced reasonable weaning age correlations, and improved the fitness of the model. Weaning age was one of crucial factors (comparable with heritability) influencing growth performance in Berkshire pigs. Further, these studies suggest that increasing weaning age up to 32 d can be an effective management strategy to improve growth performance.

This is rarely achieved in either dairy or beef herds, with average AFC for dairy herds usually between 26 and 30 months. Maintaining a low AFC requires good heifer management with adequate growth to ensure an appropriate BW and frame size at calving. Puberty should occur at least 6 weeks before the target breeding age to enable animals to undergo oestrous cycles before mating. Cattle reach puberty at a fairly consistent, but breed-dependent, proportion of mature BW. Heifer fertility is {{a critical component of}} AFC. In US Holsteins the conception rate peaked at 57 % at 15 to 16 months, declining in older heifers. Wide variations in growth rates on the same farm often lead to some animals having delayed first breeding and/or conception. Oestrous synchronisation regimes and sexed semen can both be used but unless heifers have been previously well-managed the success rates may be unacceptably low. Altering the nutritional input above or below those needed for maintenance at any stage from birth to first calving clearly alters the average <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> (ADG) <b>in</b> <b>weight.</b> <b>In</b> general an ADG of around 0. 75 kg/day seems optimal for dairy heifers, with lower rates delaying puberty and AFC. There is some scope to vary ADG at different ages providing animals reach an adequate size by calving. Major periods of nutritional deficiency and/or severe calfhood disease will, however, compromise development with long-term adverse consequences. Infectious disease can also cause pregnancy loss/abortion. First lactation milk yield may be slightly lower in younger calving cows but lifetime production is higher as such animals usually have good fertility and survive longer. There is now extensive evidence {{that as long as the}} AFC is > 23 months then future performance is not adversely influenced. On the other hand, delayed first calving > 30 months is associated with poor survival. Underfeeding of young heifers reduces their milk production potential and is a greater problem than overfeeding. Farmers are more likely to meet the optimum AFC target of 23 to 25 months if they monitor growth rates and adjust feed accordingly...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{association}} between enteritis and pneumonia during first months of life and subsequent growth and milk production traits of these animals. A total of 1327 calves were followed in this study. Calves were divided into three groups: Group A) healthy calves; Group B) calves that suffered from the enteritis one or more times from the birth to 6 th month of age; and Group C) calves that suffered from birth to 6 th month of age from the pneumonia. Subsequently all animals were observed at the following age stages: calves, heifers and cows. For all groups (age stages) the body <b>weight</b> and <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> calves (in the breeding period from birth to 6 th month of age), the weight and <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> <b>weight</b> <b>in</b> heifers (in the breeding period from 7 th to 25 th month of age) and production parameters of cows in the first lactation (milk in kg, fat in kg and protein in kg) was recorded. Calves in Groups B and C exhibited lower average <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> (690. 40 g, SD = 186. 18, N. S. and 636. 80 g, SD = 221. 19, P < 0. 05 respectively) than healthy calves (Group A, 703. 91 g, SD = 223. 48). Heifers in Group B exhibited increased the <b>daily</b> weight <b>gain</b> (830. 01, SD = 73. 57, N. S.) compared to healthy animals (Group A, 828. 31, SD = 89. 16). The general hypothesis regarding the negative effect of the enteritis (in breeding age animals that suffer from disease) on growth in the Simmental breed has not been confirmed. Heifers that had suffered with the pneumonia (Group C) showed significantly lower average <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> (784. 64, SD = 102. 96, P < 0. 05) than heifers in group A and B. In the evaluation of milk production in the first lactation, average production of 5800 kg per lactation (SD = 3. 96) was recorded in Group A cows. Cows in Group B in the first lactation produced the 5977 kg of milk per lactation on average (SD = 4. 31).

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} {{nutritional}} value of whole and dehulled ground seeds of Lupinus albus L., cv. Butan by the determination of balance digestibility of nutrients in growing pigs at different levels of replacement of soy protein with lupine. The experiment was performed on 25 pigs of hybrid combination Pietrain × (Duroc × Large White × Landrace) with initial body weights of 30. 7 ± 2. 21 kg. The feed compound of the control group contained extracted soybean meal (ESM). In four experimental diets, 50 % and 100 % replacement of soy protein with the inclusion of whole (WL 50, WL 100) or dehulled (DL 50, DL 100) lupine was carried out. Nutrient and amino acid digestibility was determined using the indicator of insoluble ash in 4 M HCl in pigs with a mean live body weight of 48. 9 ± 3. 51 kg. Higher digestibility of crude protein (P < 0. 01), ether extract (P < 0. 01), crude fibre (P < 0. 01), NDF, ADF (P < 0. 05), and cellulose (P < 0. 05) was found for the diet WL 50 compared with the control group ESM. In the diet DL 50, higher digestibility of crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, NDF, and cellulose (P < 0. 01) was recorded compared with the control. Higher digestibility of lysine and threonine (P < 0. 01) was found in the diet WL 50 in comparison with ESM; a lower digestibility of methionine (P < 0. 01) was found in the diet DL 50. Lower digestibility of crude protein, NDF, ADF (P < 0. 01), and cellulose (P < 0. 01) was found at 100 % supplementation of soy protein with whole seed lupine (WL 100) compared to the control. A 100 % replacement of soy protein with dehulled lupine (DL 100) resulted in significantly higher digestibility of dry matter (P < 0. 01), crude protein (P < 0. 05), ether extract (P < 0. 01), crude fibre (P < 0. 01), N-FE (P < 0. 01), organic matter (P < 0. 01), NDF (P < 0. 01), ADF, and cellulose (P < 0. 01) compared with the control diet. In this case, digestibility of threonine (P < 0. 01) and lysine was higher, that of methionine was lower. The highest concentration and daily output of diaminopimelic acid (DAPA) were observed in the diet WL 100. <b>Daily</b> <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> live body <b>weight</b> were nonsignificantly higher in all experimental animals compared with the controls, the most beneficial conversion being a 100 % replacement of soy protein with dehulled lupine (DL 100) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} sward, breed type and sex on lamb growth and carcass {{composition}} were measured at two degrees of maturity <b>in</b> live <b>weight.</b> The three breed types were Scottish Blackface (no. = 60), Suffolk (no. = 59) and their reciprocal crosses (no. = 60). The lambs grazed swards of either ryegrass, clover or a mixed sward intended to contain both. The {{proportion of the}} mixed sward as clover was only 0 · 014. Each lamb was scanned using X-ray computed tomography to measure the weights offat, lean and bone in the carcass at two proportions of mature body weight (0 · 30 and 0 · 45). Live weights were recorded weekly. Average <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> (ADG) <b>in</b> live <b>weight</b> and carcass tissues were calculated for each lamb between the 0 · 30 and 0 · 45 stages of maturity. At the 0 · 30 stage of maturity, breed type differences in carcass composition were small; the Scottish Blackface had 0 · 942 as much bone as the Suffolk lambs (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001), with the cross lambs intermediate. At the 0 · 45 stage of maturity, Scottish Blackface lambs had less fat (0 · 749 times as much; P 3 ̆c 0 · 001), more lean (1 · 065 times as much; P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) and more bone (1 · 055 times as much; P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) than did Suffolk lambs. The values for crossbred lambs were intermediate but closer {{to those of the}} Suffolk. Neither sward nor its interaction with breed type had any significant effect on carcass composition at either the 0 · 30 or 0 · 45 stage of maturity. The effect of sex on carcass composition was significant at the 0 · 45 stage of maturity when castrated male lambs had less fat (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) and more lean (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) than female lambs. There were breed type by sward interactions for ADG <b>in</b> live <b>weight</b> (P 3 ̆c 0 · 05), <b>in</b> carcass <b>weight</b> (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001), and in fat (P 3 ̆c 0 · 001) and bone weights (P 3 ̆c 0 · 05).

40|$|Introduction: Early {{postnatal}} {{weight gain}} {{is associated with}} determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2) in adults born term. We aimed to investigate the association of weight gain during different periods, and <b>weight</b> trajectories <b>in</b> early life after preterm birth, with determinants of CVD and DM 2 in early adulthood. Methods: Associations of first-year growth and tempo of weight gain with determinants of CVD and DM 2 in 162 young adults (18 - 24 yr) born preterm (gestational age < 36 wk) were determined and compared with data of young adults born term (n = 217). Results: <b>Gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> for length <b>in</b> the period from preterm birth up to term age, {{and in the first}} 3 months after term age, was positively associated with body fat percentage and waist circumference at 21 yr. <b>Gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> for length <b>in</b> the first 3 months after term age was also positively associated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in early adulthood. Subjects with the highest <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> from birth to term age (highest quartile) had significantly higher body fat percentage, waist circumference, acute insulin response, and disposition index in early adulthood than the subgroups with moderate and low <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight.</b> Rapid catch-up <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> during the first 3 months after term age resulted in a higher fat percentage, waist circumference, and serum triglycerides level than slower catch-up <b>in</b> <b>weight.</b> Conclusion: Accelerated neonatal <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> relative to length after preterm birth (immediately after birth and during the first 3 months after term age) is associated with determinants of CVD in early adulthood and should therefore be avoided.
