50|$|Early freezer units {{accumulated}} {{ice crystals}} around the freezing units. This {{was a result}} of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing ("defrosting") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for {{a short amount of time}} to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.These older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around , which is suitable for keeping food for a week.|$|E
5000|$|Freezers with {{automatic}} defrosting and combined refrigerator/freezer units which also apply self defrosting to their <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> are called [...] "frost free". The latter usually feature an air {{connection between the}} two compartments with the air passage to the refrigerator compartment regulated by a damper. By this means, a controlled portion of the air coming from the freezer reaches the refrigerator. Some older models have no air circulation between their freezer and refrigerator sections. Instead, they use an independent cooling system (for example: an evaporator coil with a defrost heater and a circulating fan in the freezer and a cold-plate or open-coil evaporator in the refrigerator.|$|E
50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment,</b> and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|E

30|$|To be able {{to display}} {{across-the-board}} information {{for all kinds of}} devices, including some large complicated ones, the household devices are considered to be made up of one or more channels. A channel, in this article, refers to a functional component of a device. Most household devices, e.g. lights and televisions, provide a single function, so they have only one channel, which can display devices’ working states, power use, or some other information on the generic user interface. Some devices are more complex so that they need more than one channel to display their full information. For instance, the dual-temp refrigerator can be considered to contain two channels, which correspond to its refrigerator and <b>freezer</b> <b>compartments,</b> respectively. Another example is the μCHP, where a boiler and a small power plant are combined in a single durable device, so the boiler and the power engine are abstracted to two channels for the μCHP. Sometimes the μCHP can be extended with an electrically driven heating coil as an alternative actuator to produce heat. In this case, a third channel is needed to represent the heating coil. In the HouseholdDevice model, the attribute “deviceChannels” is the collection of all channels about the device. The information about a channel (channelInfo) are put into a list of Information objects. Each object consists of an information name, an information value and a unit about the information. For instance, one information about the boiler channel of a μCHP could be described as “infoName: top temperature, infoValue: 69.5, unit: ∘C”. The information are provided by the underlying building operating systems and further will be displayed on the generic user interface.|$|R

50|$|Automatic icemakers for {{the home}} were first offered by the Servel company around 1953. They are usually found inside the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> of a refrigerator. They produce {{crescent-shaped}} ice cubes from a metal mold. An electromechanical or electronic timer first opens a solenoid valve for a few seconds, allowing the mold to fill with water from the domestic cold water supply. The timer then closes the valve and lets the ice freeze for about 30 minutes. Then, the timer turns on a low-power electric heating element inside the mold for several seconds, to melt the ice cubes slightly so they will not stick to the mold. Finally, the timer runs a rotating arm that scoops the ice cubes out of the mold and into a bin, and the cycle repeats. If the bin fills with ice, the ice pushes up a wire arm, which shuts off the icemaker until the ice level in the bin goes down again. The user can also lift up the wire arm at any time to stop the production of ice.|$|E
40|$|Langley Research Center has {{developed}} electrical-impedance-based ice-thickness gauges and is seeking partners and collaborators to commercialize them. When used {{as parts of}} active monitoring and diagnostic systems, these gauges {{make it possible to}} begin deicing or to take other protective measures before ice accretes to dangerous levels. These gauges are inexpensive, small, and simple to produce. They can be adapted to use on a variety of stationary and moving structures that are subject to accumulation of ice. Examples of such structures include aircraft, cars, trucks, ships, buildings, towers, power lines (see figure), power-generating equipment, water pipes, <b>freezer</b> <b>compartments,</b> and cooling coils. A gauge of this type includes a temperature sensor and two or more pairs of electrically insulated conductors embedded in a surface on which ice could accumulate. The electrical impedances of the pairs of conductors vary with the thickness of any ice that may be present. Somewhat more specifically, when the pairs of conductors are spaced appropriately, the ratio between their impedances is indicative of the thickness of the ice. Therefore, the gauge includes embedded electronic circuits that measure the electrical impedances, plus circuits that process the combination of temperature and impedance measurements to determine whether ice is present and, if so, how thick it is. Of course, in the processing of the impedance measurements, the temperature measurements help the circuitry to distinguish between liquid water and ice. The basic design of a gauge of this type can be adapted to local conditions. For example, if {{there is a need to}} monitor ice over a wide range of thickness, then the gauge can include more than two sets of conductors having various spacings...|$|R

In addition to her passenger cabins, she also had refrigerated and <b>freezer</b> cargo <b>compartments,</b> and 120 tons of cargo fuel capacity.With {{the construction of new}} road access to more communities on the lake and increased access to air travel, the need for the freight and passenger service declined and a focus was put on using the vessel for excursions and vacations by the early 1970s. She was purchased by the Manitoba provincial government in the early 1970s, and was operated by the government as part of Venture Manitoba Tours through the 1978 season. Idle for 1979 in Gull Harbour, she was purchased that year by a group of investors led by Harold Einarson and operated on the lake until through the 1982 season. In 1983, local Winnipeg businessmen Jim Gauthier and Bill Harris purchased the ship and refitted her running it until 1986, when she was purchased by Dr. Joseph Slogan of Selkirk, who operated the ship through the 1990 navigation season on the Red River. It was originally intended to run the ship for the 1991 season, and extensive engineering and mechanical work took place through the winter of 1990/91, but the vessel was idled after a decision was made to run the other two competing river excursion companies - Paddlewheel Riverboats and River Rouge Tours - as a joint venture for 1991 in the face of declining passenger traffic, and to idle the Lord Selkirk II for the season.

50|$|The defrost {{mechanism}} in a refrigerator heats the cooling element (evaporator coil) {{for a short}} period of time and melts the frost that has formed on it. The resulting water drains through a duct at the back of the unit. Defrosting is controlled by an electric or electronic timer: For every 6, 8, 10, 12 or 24 hours of compressor operation it turns on a defrost heater for 15 minutes to half an hour. The defrost heater, having a typical power rating of 350 W to 600 W, is mounted just below the evaporator in top- and bottom-freezer models and below and sometimes also in the middle of the evaporator in side-by-side models. It may be protected from short circuits by means of fusible links. In older refrigerators the timer ran continuously. In newer designs the timer only runs while the compressor runs, so the more the refrigerator door is closed, the less the heater will be on and the more energy will be saved. A defrost thermostat opens the heater circuit when the evaporator temperature rises above a preset temperature, 40°F (5°C) or more, thereby preventing excessive heating of the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment.</b> The defrost timer is such that either the compressor or the defrost heater is on, but not both at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Apple quality after {{freezing}} {{is affected}} by temperature fluctuations during the cold chain storage. Ice recrystallization and sublimation processes occur slowly at constant temperature {{over long periods of}} storage, but more rapidly during temperature fluctuations that are often encountered in the food cold chain. These processes lead to quality changes and reducing their storage life. In this paper, samples of apple cortex tissue were frozen and subsequently stored in three different freezers set at - 12 ± 3 °C, - 18 ± 3 °C and - 23 ± 3 °C. In each <b>freezer,</b> three different <b>compartments</b> were created corresponding to achieve ± 0. 1, ± 0. 75 and ± 2 °C amplitudes of temperature fluctuation.

The results showed that a long period of frozen storage under temperature fluctuation conditions significantly affect the apple quality changes. Quality changes were found to be more pronounced at higher mean storage temperature and larger amplitude of the temperature fluctuation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the improvement in}} the performance of a domestic hybrid refrigerator that combines vapour compression technology for the cooler and freezer compartments, and thermoelectric technology for a new compartment. The heat emitted by the Peltier modules is discharged into the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment,</b> forming a cascade refrigeration system. This configuration leads to a significant improvement in the coefficient of operation. Thus, the electric power consumption of the modules and the refrigerator decrease by 95 % and 20 % respectively, with respect to those attained with a cascade refrigeration system connected with the cooler compartment. The optimization process is based on a computational model that simulates the behaviour of the whole refrigerator. Two prototypes have been built and tested. Experimental results indicate that the temperature of the new compartment is easily set up at any value between 0 and - 4 ºC, the oscillation of this temperature is always lower than 0. 4 ºC, and the electric power consumption is low enough to include this hybrid refrigerator into energy efficiency class A, according European rules and regulations...|$|E

This model solves both the thermoelectric and heat transfer equations, including the phase change equations in the ice cube production. The inputs of the model are: the thermoelectric parameters {{as a function of}} the temperature; dimensions; material properties (thermal resistances and capacities) and the boundary conditions (room temperature and voltage supplied to the Peltier module). The outputs are the values of the temperature for all the elements of the thermoelectric ice-maker and the ice production. In the experimental phase a prototype of a thermoelectric ice maker incorporated in a vapour compression domestic fridge was constructed in order to adjust and validate the computational model, and to optimize the experimental application. This ice-maker has two Peltier modules, some aluminum cylinders, called fingers, where the ice is made, and a component that acts as heat extender and dissipater which connects the hot side of Peltier module with the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment.</b> The ice formation on the fingers is obtained by the cooling on the Peltier modules.

Development of the {{technological}} issues, modernization, {{changing of the}} mankind’s demands induced arising of new products. In addition to this, it affects {{the challenge of the}} household market. Because of the fast improving technology, humans couldn’t spent enough time to their personel requirements. This situation arises new products and apparatus for ordinary devices for people demands made by many companies. This companies produces many practical solutions for tough conditions which makes peoples lives harder. At present, the refregirator device not only store food and drinks fresh, but also it has ice maker for makes small ice cubes from bulk ice, water found for supplying water which is desirable temparature and freezing function for food products spoiled quickly. After, demandings are getting bigger time to time, the users require new products or qualifications to accept new functions in household devices. The combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator avokes due tothe impact of this conditions. Ice cream, mainly contains milk, cream, water, low fat dry milk powder, oil for regulating the mix, materials for colouring the mix. Blending and adding different ratio and types of the contents, using physical and chemical solutions form ice cream products.

The another aim of the investment; increasing the apparatus of the devices and making variety of functional systems in there. When we have looked last 5 years, both the world and Turkiye, the ice cream has fast growing sales values, the market rivalry has gotten strict and the more manufacturing companies are avoked in these time. Eventually, a device which is making this successful product in refregirator compartment, not only improve the functionality of the refregirator, but also it brings this products to foreground in household sector. The other objective of the project is to contribute to producing healthy ice cream products; to prove the capability of making ice cream products liked by people all around the world at their homes. In the market; most of fast consuming ice cream products includes many artificial materials which is called consistency accelerator or regulator. These materials affect human’s health and they accumulate the body and cause cancer. The combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator project is maintained by Arcelik Structural Design Management Department. In this project, product benchmark studies, the detection of reference ice cream products, the design of the alternative concepts, evaluation of the concepts and selection of the best, the study of prototyping, tructural analysis, structural reconstraints according to the analysis, testing of ice cream recipes, sensorial tests are sustained by the same department. The selection of the refregirator which contains ice cream maker devices and the critical terms of cooling, thermodynamic and physical parameters of the refregirator is completed by the assistance of the Arcelik Eskisehir Refregirator Plant. After the prototype was occured, the ice cream samples were tested in Arcelik Nourishment Laboratories. In addition, thanks to Arcelik Research and Development Thermodynamic Department, helps us to understanding refregirator cooling system and characteristic of working style. In the market, {{there are two types of}} devices used to making ice cream products. They are; • Industrial ice cream makers and coolers • Home made ice cream makers Industrial ice cream makers used in demanding high production of the ice cream, also it produces a great deal of products. Moreover, their cooling systems are more complicated than home made devices. Home made ice cream makers are smaller than industrial devices. It makes about one liter ice cream at one time. These devices are seperated two groups. The home made ice cream makers in first group, has only a motor and receptacle which has to took in refregirator <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> about 13 hours before making ice cream. The devices in second group has own cooling systems. It also has compressor, condenser, evaparator and the pipes carried cooling liquid. In these devices, you could make ice cream in 90 minutes. In spite of the fact that it is very quick, the ice cream product made by the device has many ice particles and the mixture gets softer at the center. Consequently, it is not homogeneous and this is the main problem which has to solve in new products. Eventually, In this study, we researched the probability of the making ice cream in the refregirator freezing compartment and we tried to find new solutions about cooling the system, rotating the mixer etc. Then we designed different, alternative concepts. In benchmark stage, we investigated the most popular and successful home made ice cream devices in the market and optimized the system, determined the correct power system and transmission group. We are choosing the correct design showed up by evaluation of different criterias. After this, we design the correct alternative system with every components and we made a prototype accomplished the main function of the ice cream maker system. Finally, we tested the protype and advised the qualifications which makes the device the most useful. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
