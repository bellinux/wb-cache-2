The <b>information</b> <b>sheets</b> complement the checklist by providing installation instructions and material specifications that are accompanied by detailed graphics. The <b>information</b> <b>sheets</b> also identify benefits of recommended energy-efficiency measures and procedures including cost savings and impacts on health and comfort.

Whilst Bashir and O'Brien's adventures in the holosuites in the Battle of Britain and the Battle of Clontarf have been mentioned in episodes, they were simply too expensive to be shown on screen effectively.

2500|$|By 1994, {{primidone}} was {{no longer}} {{one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. Phenytoin was still regarded as the drug of choice for partial seizures due to its long half-life and low cost; but for children, carbamazepine was seen as the best one due to phenytoin's effects on physical appearance. Topiramate was approved two years later. It, along with the others, was mainly used in patients refractory to carbamazepine and valproate. These new agents were often described as having [...] "innovative" [...] and [...] "selective" [...] mechanisms of action; in reality, most of them also worked similarly to older agents. On February 28, 1998, Élan Corporation, plc, bought the trademark and exclusive product distribution rights for Mysoline from Wyeth in Canada and the United States at a cost of $46 million and a royalty on future sales.

40|$|Background: Low health {{literacy}} increases costs and negatively affects outcomes. According to recent surveys, Hispanics comprise the lowest scoring ethnic group. To increase understanding, information {{is provided in}} Spanish. Question: How do select English and Spanish medication <b>information</b> <b>sheets</b> compare? Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether medication information given to a patient in English had the exact same formation and readability level as that given in Spanish. Design: Case Study. Methods: Two drug <b>information</b> <b>sheets,</b> one on Warfarin and one on Amoxicillin from two different pharmacies, were chosen for comparison. We translated the Spanish drug <b>information</b> <b>sheets</b> into English to compare and contrast the information and readability. Results: Many of the English <b>information</b> <b>sheets</b> were easier to read due to page layout and word choice than the Spanish-to-English. Also, some of the information in the English version was different than the Spanish-to-English version. Conclusion: Medical personnel need to be knowledgeable about the information given to their patients in order to provide the best care. They cannot assume that the translated versions contain the same information as the English version. More research needs to be explored about this topic so that practice can be improved...|$|R

The sectoral analysis builds on the overview report and secondary analyses of the fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). The research highlights trends across sectors in terms of working time and work–life balance, work organisation, skills and training, employee representation and the psychosocial and physical environment. It identifies sectors that score particularly well or particularly poorly regarding four indicators of job quality: earnings, prospects, intrinsic job quality and working time quality. Finally, some light is shed on differences between sectors {{in terms of the}} health and well-being of workers and the perceived sustainability of work...|$|R
