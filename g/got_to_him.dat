25|$|Clay Buchholz went 6 innings, {{giving up}} only one run. Junichi Tazawa was handed a 3–1 {{lead in the}} eighth, {{but he could not}} record an out, {{allowing}} three consecutive hits and was ultimately charged with the loss. Brad Ziegler was summoned in a tough spot again, but could not repeat his gem against the Diamondbacks. Boston bounced back, with a stellar 7-innings outing by Rick Porcello, who improved to an AL leading 17 wins, tied with Toronto's J.A. Happ. Hanley Ramírez drove in four of the 10 runs for the Red Sox. Drew Pomeranz earned his second win in the Red Sox uniform, but could only go 5 innings because of a rain delay. David Ortiz drove in the go-ahed and winning run, with a two-run shot in the fifth. Henry Owens made his fourth start of the season and struck out five batters in the first two innings. The Tigers eventually <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for five runs in the third inning and three runs in the fifth. Justin Verlander held the offense to just one run on three hits. The run scored in the sixth after a lead-off triple by Andrew Benintendi, his first three-bagger of his career, and a sacrifice fly by Dustin Pedroia. One innings later, Andrew Benintendi capped a Boston four-run inning with his first career home run and shortened the Tigers lead to five runs in the seventh, but neither team could score again.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} U.S. {{version is}} that bin Laden's location at Abbottabad was {{identified by the}} CIA by tracking an al-Qaeda courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Hersh reports that in August 2010 a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer walked into the office of Jonathan Bank, the CIA station chief at the US embassy in Islamabad and betrayed the secret of bin Laden's whereabouts in return {{for part of the}} $25 million reward, and has since been relocated with his family to Washington and is a consultant to the CIA. The ISI had captured bin Laden in 2006; he had lived undetected from 2001 to 2006 with some of his wives and children in the Hindu Kush mountains. The ISI <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> by paying some of the local tribal people to betray him. Bin Laden was very ill and was living as prisoner under ISI control in the garrison town of Abbottabad less than two miles from Pakistan's National Military Academy at Kakul (equivalent of United States Military Academy at West Point). The Saudi government also knew about Osama's presence in Abbottabad and had advised the Pakistanis to keep him as a prisoner and gave financial assistance. Major Amir Aziz, a Pakistani Army doctor, was ordered to move near his compound to provide treatment. Aziz was also given a share of the $25 million reward because he got the DNA sample which conclusively proved that it was bin Laden. A real casualty in the whole affair was the doctor named Shakil Afridi. His perfectly legitimate hepatitis B vaccination programme was claimed to be the way the US obtained bin Laden's DNA. Afridi became the sacrificial lamb because the US wanted to protect its real CIA informant, Amir Aziz, who had been held by the Pakistanis. Afridi was sentenced to 33 years by the Pakistanis. Other vaccination programmes were canceled once this lie was put forth.|$|E

A short time later, Weylandt's body was airlifted off the descent and taken to a nearby hospital, where the pathologist conducting the autopsy concluded that the Belgian had died immediately upon crashing. Weylandt's death was the first at the Giro in 25 years, and the first at one of cycling's Grand Tours since Fabio Casartelli died during the 1995 Tour de France.|$|E

500|$|In the {{mainstream}} press, Tom Sutcliffe in The Independent praised the episode as [...] "first ingenious and then decidedly poignant", though he felt {{some aspects of}} plot would have wider implications not addressed in the episode, and remained [...] "coldly unfeeling" [...] towards {{the death of the}} Krafayis. [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian liked the episode, considering Curtis' dialogue to be [...] "witty and clever" [...] and, despite feeling that some of the moral sentiments expressed during the episode were [...] "as schmaltzy as sugary gloop", described how the emotion of the episode eventually <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave the episode a B-, explaining that it [...] "didn't quite work" [...] and suffered from tonal problems. Matt Wales on IGN was also mixed, giving it a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He was positive toward Curran and Gillan and that the episode [...] "finally gave us a three-dimensional Amy Pond", but thought the [...] "usually excellent" [...] Smith [...] "didn't get much to work with". He also thought that the Krafayis was [...] "a nice idea" [...] for being a metaphor but was not threatening, and he labelled the emotional ending as [...] "self-indulgently mawkish".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Raymond Ventrone tackled Domenik Hixon after a 14-yard return, giving New York {{the ball on}} their own 17 with 2:39 left and three timeouts remaining. Following two receptions by Toomer for 20 yards, Brandon Jacobs kept the drive going with a 2-yard run on 4th-and-1. Two plays later, on 2nd-and-5, Patriots' cornerback Asante Samuel had a {{potential}} interception on a ball intended for Tyree that would have potentially ended the game go off his hands and out of bounds to stop the clock with 1:15 remaining. On the next play, 3rd-and-5 from the New York 44-yard line, Manning found himself in trouble as the Patriots' pass rush <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> quickly after the snap. He eluded Adalius Thomas, who missed Manning despite having the clearest shot at him, and then broke free from the grasp of Jarvis Green and Richard Seymour, both of whom had Manning by the jersey. In what is now considered {{to be among the}} greatest Super Bowl plays of all time, Manning then righted himself and threw the ball toward the middle of the field, where Tyree and Rodney Harrison went up for the ball. Under fierce coverage, Tyree made a leaping one-handed catch, outjumping Harrison, and maintained possession by pinning the ball against his helmet as he fell to the ground. The play went for 32 yards and kept the drive alive. Three plays later, on 3rd-and-11, Manning found a wide-open Smith for a 12-yard gain to the New England 13, who stepped out of bounds to stop the clock. On the next play, the Giants sent four receivers into the pattern while the Patriots sent six pass rushers after Manning and flipped four pass defenders to {{the right side of the}} field—resulting in Patriots' cornerback Ellis Hobbs being isolated on the left side to cover Giants' wide receiver Plaxico Burress one-on-one. Hobbs bit on a fake slant inside (a [...] "slant-and-go" [...] or [...] "SluGo" [...] route) and Manning lofted a pass to the end zone where Burress caught the ball for a touchdown to complete the 12-play, 83-yard drive and give the Giants a 17–14 lead with 35 seconds left.|$|E
