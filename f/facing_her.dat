5|$|Following the 2008 WWE Draft, Kelly {{was moved}} to the Raw brand on July 7. Kelly had her debut match as part of the brand that same night, teaming with Mickie James to defeat Layla and Jillian Hall. She quickly became {{involved}} in a feud with Beth Phoenix, <b>facing</b> <b>her</b> on multiple occasions in both singles and tag team matches with a variety of opponents, including Mickie James and Candice Michelle. During this time, Phoenix was aligned with Jillian Hall, and in late September, Kelly transitioned into a feud with Hall. At Survivor Series in November, Kelly was part of the victorious Raw Diva team which defeated the SmackDown Divas in a five-on-five elimination match; she eliminated Victoria, before being eliminated by Maryse. The following month at Armageddon, Kelly teamed with Maria, Michelle McCool and Mickie James in a winning effort against Jillian Hall, Maryse, Victoria and Natalya.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Academy {{exhibition}} brought Fuseli and {{his painting}} enduring fame. The exhibition included Shakespeare-themed works by Fuseli, which won him {{a commission to}} produce eight paintings for publisher John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. One version of The Nightmare hung {{in the home of}} Fuseli's close friend and publisher Joseph Johnson, gracing his weekly dinners for London thinkers and writers. The Nightmare was widely plagiarised, and parodies of it were commonly used for political caricature, by George Cruikshank, Thomas Rowlandson, and others. In these satirical scenes, the incubus afflicts subjects such as Napoleon Bonaparte, Louis XVIII, British politician Charles James Fox, and Prime Minister William Pitt. In another example, admiral Lord Nelson is the demon, and his mistress Emma, Lady Hamilton, the sleeper. While some observers have viewed the parodies as mocking Fuseli, {{it is more likely that}} The Nightmare was simply a vehicle for ridicule of the caricatured subject. The Danish painter, Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard, whom Fuseli had met in Rome, produced his own version of The Nightmare (Danish: Mareridt) which develops on the eroticism of Fuseli's work. Abildgaard's painting shows two naked women asleep in the bed; it is the woman in the foreground who is experiencing the nightmare and the incubus — which is crouched on the woman's stomach, <b>facing</b> <b>her</b> parted legs — has its tail nestling between her exposed breasts.|$|E

AM says that the temple contains some of his primary units and is apparently offering {{her a chance to}} destroy him. Ellen suffers from a severe phobia of the color yellow, due to its association with her rape (her rapist, who isolated her in an elevator, wore yellow), preventing her from approaching AM's apparent weak spots. <b>Facing</b> <b>her</b> rapist again in her story, Ellen learns to overcome her fears and fight back.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer term at Meadowbank School for Girls, the most prestigious prep school in England, Miss Bulstrode, the popular but aging headmistress, has {{no reason to believe that}} the {{challenges}} <b>facing</b> <b>her</b> on parent's day will be more than the occasional irate or inebriated parent. She scarcely listens when Mrs Upjohn, a parent, who just happened to have worked in military intelligence, looks out of the window and notices on the school campus someone whom she recognises and whose presence at the school apparently surprises but does not alarm her. Mrs Upjohn is still talking but the crucial moment has passed. After Mrs Upjohn leaves, Miss Bulstrode has a sudden feeling that she has missed something to which she should have paid attention but then dismisses the notion.|$|E
25|$|Ranevskaya's {{failure to}} address {{problems}} <b>facing</b> <b>her</b> estate and family mean that she eventually loses almost everything and her fate {{can be seen}} as a criticism of those people who are unwilling to adapt to the new Russia. Her petulant refusal to accept the truth of her past, in both life and love, is her downfall throughout the play. She ultimately runs between her life in Paris and in Russia (she arrives from Paris at the start of the play and returns there afterwards). She is a woman who lives in an illusion of the past (often reliving memories about her son's death, etc.). The speeches by the student Trofimov, attacking intellectuals were later seen as early manifestations of Bolshevik ideas and his lines were often censored by the Tsarist officials. Cherry trees themselves are often seen as symbols of sadness or regret at the passing away of a certain situation or of the times in general.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of much {{documentary}} evidence, the abbey's art may {{shed some light on}} the values held dear by the community. In the 14th century a number of figures were carved on the previously plain shafts of the arches at the processional entrance to the church and {{at the entrance to the}} chapter house. St Peter and St Paul flank the church entrance used by the canons to enter the church for the Canonical Hours. These were the saints most closely associated with the Papacy, from which both the order and the abbey took their authority. For the chapter house, Augustine of Hippo, eponym of the order, and St John the Evangelist, patron saint of the abbey, were obvious choices. The remaining saints were all illustrative of martyrdom, austerity or spiritual struggle. Thomas Becket, murdered on the orders of Henry II, one of Haughmond's major benefactors, was a martyr whose cult at Canterbury was the focus for medieval England's most important pilgrimage. Catherine of Alexandria, seen as a virgin martyr, is portrayed with her wheel of martyrdom, taking revenge on the Emperor Maxentius. John the Baptist, closely associated with asceticism and speaking truth to power, and a Biblical type for Becket, clutches the lamb and flag symbol of the Agnus Dei. He is accompanied by Margaret of Antioch, who is spearing a dragon, a female counterpart to St Michael. St Winifred, a third virgin martyr, whose relics were kept at nearby Shrewsbury Abbey, is shown with her persecutor Caradog sinking into the ground. <b>Facing</b> <b>her,</b> St Michael the Archangel, armed with spear and shield, treads down and impales a dragon, representing Satan.|$|E

A video for the remix version of the song, featuring American rapper Kid Cudi, debuted later in December 2009. The video starts with Shakira sitting in a steam filled bath house surrounded by other women <b>facing</b> <b>her,</b> all clad in white.

500|$|On 21 March 1815 The Pig Faced Lady of Manchester Square and the Spanish Mule of Madrid, a {{coloured}} print by George Cruikshank, was published. Captioned [...] "Ah!

In the following ODIs, she claimed three wickets, all in the second match, as England claimed the series 2–1. [...] Unrequired to bat during South Africa's solitary victory, she made ducks in both the other matches. [...] She continued her string of ducks in the first-innings of the second Test, falling leg before wicket (lbw) <b>facing</b> <b>her</b> eighth delivery. [...] However, after claiming two English wickets, Brits top-scored for South Africa in the second-innings, making 61 off 67 balls, including 13 fours. [...] Despite this innings, South Africa lost the match by an innings and 96 runs.|$|E

500|$|Scholar Louise Flavin {{has noted}} that Thompson's {{screenplay}} contains significant alterations to the characters of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood: in the novel, the former embodies [...] "sense", i.e. [...] "sensible" [...] in our terms, and the latter, [...] "sensibility", i.e. [...] "sensitivity" [...] in our terms. [...] Audience members are meant to view self-restrained Elinor as the person in need of reform, rather than her impassioned sister. To heighten the contrast between them, Marianne and Willoughby's relationship includes an [...] "erotic" [...] invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair – a direct contrast to Elinor's [...] "reserved relationship" [...] with Edward. Lee also distinguishes them through imagery – Marianne is often seen with musical instruments, near open windows, and outside, while Elinor is pictured in door frames. Another character altered for modern viewers is Margaret Dashwood, who conveys [...] "the frustrations that a girl of our times might feel at the limitations <b>facing</b> <b>her</b> as {{a woman in the}} early nineteenth century." [...] Thompson uses Margaret for exposition in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs. For instance, Elinor explains to a curious Margaret – and by extension, the audience – why their half-brother inherits the Dashwood estate. Margaret's altered storyline, giving her an interest in fencing and geography, also allows audience members to see the [...] "feminine" [...] side of Edward and Brandon, as they become father or brother figures to her. The film omits the characters of Lady Middleton and her children, {{as well as that of}} Ann Steele, Lucy's sister.|$|E
