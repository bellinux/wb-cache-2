5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E

2500|$|Clinton {{administration}} officials, {{torn between}} {{pressure from the}} Republicans to go forward and a reluctance to respond to any Iraqi confrontation (and there was sure to be one) with military force, had tried to convince Butler to postpone the inspection until [...] "a more opportune time." [...] Butler was convinced. To me, he called it a case of [...] "bad timing." [...] I viewed it as something elsean appalling lack of leadership, not only in Washington and London, but also on Butler's part. He was allowing a golden opportunity to slip through his fingers. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> much in a long, critical memorandum that I wrote to him the next day.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> no, <b>as</b> Mrs. Badger's insinuating tone {{seemed to}} require such an answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so, your worship--for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>as</b> to that detestable joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--" ...|$|R

2500|$|In August 1999, at a {{press conference}} in New York City to discuss The Phantom Menace, Lucas {{described}} the [...] "nine year commitment" [...] required to make a Star Wars trilogy. In 2002, he said: [...] "Basically what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> a joke was, 'Maybe when Harrison and Carrie are in their 70s, we'll come back and do another version.' The thing I didn't realize then, and that I do realize now very clearly, is that not only would they be in their 70s, but I would be in my 70s too." [...] In 2007, Lucas described making the films at that age as [...] "an idea that seemed amusing at the time, but doesn't seem realistic now", and suggested that 'off-the-cuff' comments he had made in earlier years had been misconstrued as absolute statements.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Break not {{the thread}} the spider [...] Is labouring to weave.' [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> nor <b>as</b> <b>I</b> eyed her [...] Could dream she would deceive.|$|R

6000|$|... “That’s a lie, Wolf Larsen,” <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> just <b>as</b> {{quietly as}} before. “However, I am aching {{for a chance}} to kill you, so go ahead and cut.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'He came {{to examine}} the premises, I 'm sure of it, {{but we will be}} ready for him,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> fiercely, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> told the family about him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> soon as I could speak, for I {{was finding}} my young friend a trifle overpowering, [...] "this is most satisfactory." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Go slow, friend--go slow, and heave your lead-line! You {{have got}} out of your channel, and are in shoal water. <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> <b>as</b> how <b>I</b> was betrothed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, young lady," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> well as tears would permit; [...] "I am {{a person}} deeply obliged to your uncle. My name is Croftangry." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{half an hour}} since," [...] said De Vaux, with a groan, {{implying}} {{a mixture}} of sorrow and vexation, [...] "and <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>as</b> much for thee!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be {{the simpler}} way to return," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> smiling, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> handed the forged order to the boy. [...] "Come, we shall see now how well it works." ...|$|R
6000|$|Herbert {{said from}} behind (again poking me), [...] "Massive and concrete." [...] So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> boldly, <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had {{originated}} it, and must beg to insist upon it, [...] "Massive and concrete." ...|$|R
