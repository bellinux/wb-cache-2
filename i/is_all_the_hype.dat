The European fuel cell bus trial has been {{extended}} by one year and there has been much talk about the potential for hydrogen powered vehicles working during the London Olympics. These would bring even more people into contact with future fuels on perhaps boats and buses. The Department for Transport (UK) has also announced a major call for more research on hydrogen, clearly indicating a focus on both vehicles and infrastructure. So what <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hype</b> about this fuel and {{what does it mean for}} transport engineers in general? This article tries to address some of those issues by trying to understand hydrogen, and then by looking at how the Icelanders have used this remarkable fuel.

[...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and said, [...] "EXPERIMENTS aren't always successful. Like Dasavatharam , Kamal Haasan's ambitious venture which sees him playing ten roles which include a take on George Bush too. Daring, we'd like to insist; only the make-up and the fake appearance borders more on the comic." [...] The Deccan Herald said, [...] "The ten roles are awfully disparate: they are more like pantomime characters. Kamal appears too flabby and jaded. Sorry, Appu Raja (or shall we say Michael, Madana, Kamarajan) it’s time you start being your age. From start to finish there is a severe decibel assault aided and abetted by Himesh Reshammiya." [...] OneIndia said, [...] "After watching Dasavatharam- the so-called magnum opus of the year- an ardent fan of Kamal Hassan will ask why indeed it is called a magnum opus in the first place. Why <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hype,</b> tension, cases, expectations and unnecessary expenses wasted on this average film.

[...] Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said, [...] "The film would have worked even better had the narrative been tauter and more purposive post-interval" [...] but concluded, [...] "All in all, Dasavathaaram shows that Kamal Haasan has once again taken great pains to make his cinematic projects convincing. The effort has paid off." [...] On the contrary, Rediff praised the film as [...] "spectacular" [...] and a [...] "super human effort", rating it with 4 out of 5 stars. The reviewer concluded that the film will [...] "go down in the history of Indian cinema as a unique experiment in the commercial circuit".|$|R

40|$|Internet {{has played}} {{a vital role in}} this modern world, the {{possibilities}} and opportunities offered <b>are</b> limitless. Despite <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hype,</b> Internet services <b>are</b> liable to intrusion attack that could tamper the confidentiality and integrity of important information. An attack started with gathering the information of the attack target, this gathering of information activity can be done as either fast or slow attack. The defensive measure network administrator can take to overcome this liability is by introducing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in their network. IDS have the capabilities to analyze the network traffic and recognize incoming and on-going intrusion. Unfortunately the combination of both modules in real time network traffic slowed down the detection process. In real time network, early detection of fast attack can prevent any further attack and reduce the unauthorized access on the targeted machine. The suitable set of feature selection and the correct threshold value, add an extra advantage for IDS to detect anomalies in the network. Therefore this paper discusses a new technique for selecting static threshold value from a minimum standard features in detecting fast attack from the victim perspective. In order to increase the confidence of the threshold value the result is verified using Statistical Process Control (SPC). The implementation of this approach shows that the threshold selected is suitable for identifying the fast attack in real time.
