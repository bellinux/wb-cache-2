5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development <b>for</b> <b>Tom</b> Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again considered too expensive in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they said that they were willing to fund it. Since development went slowly at Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award <b>for</b> <b>Tom</b> and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.|$|E

5|$|Clyde began 1974 {{season with}} a 3–0 record, but became embroiled in {{controversy}} following a dispute between new manager Billy Martin and general manager Bobby Brown. Martin and Brown argued about what {{was the best way}} on handling Clyde's future development, which led to Brown's resignation and caused Clyde to miss a month before remaining on the Rangers roster {{for the rest of the}} year. He played in 28 games (21 starts) and finished with 3–9 record, and a 4.38 ERA. He started one game in 1975 (a loss) before injuring his shoulder and was demoted to the Pittsfield Rangers of the Eastern League. He stayed in the minors for three seasons, having a shoulder operation in 1976. The Rangers organization lost so much faith in Clyde's ability that he was left unprotected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but was not chosen. He played for the Sacramento Solons in 1976, and the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League in 1977 where he had 5–7 record with a 5.84 ERA. When the season ended, the Rangers traded Clyde and veteran Willie Horton to the Cleveland Indians <b>for</b> <b>Tom</b> Buskey and John Lowenstein on February 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) goes {{undercover}} to pose as a sympathizer to the cell. She lures a member, Rachel (Rachel Power) to {{the same}} hospital Sarah Lynott is being treated; Sarah would later die from the extent of her injuries. Senior case officer and team leader Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) attempts to persuade her to stop Kane, believing she has little regard for any life. Rachel leaves in haste, but unbeknownst to her, MI5 bug her mobile phone, and record a phone conversation she makes to the cell regarding their next target, Diane Sullivan, a doctor living in London. Tom's team are able to take Sullivan to safety whilst Zoe poses as the target. The team see Kane deliver a bomb to Zoe's car, and prepares to detonate it via mobile phone. To counter the attack, a Bomb Squad jams the signal long enough <b>for</b> <b>Tom</b> to arrest her. During the interrogation, Tom promises to send her to a state in the US where the death penalty does not apply {{in exchange for the}} locations of every cell she runs in the UK. After she cooperates, Tom goes back on the deal and delivers Kane to CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who returns her to Florida to be executed.|$|E
5|$|Nelthorpe was {{released}} by Oxford {{at the end of}} the season and he subsequently signed for fellow Conference Premier club York City on 19 May 2009. He suffered from illness during much of York's pre-season, and during a friendly against FC Halifax Town he was sent off for jumping dangerously with his arm raised. He made his debut as a stoppage time substitute in a 2–1 defeat to former club Oxford on 8 August 2009. After failing to start any matches for York, he requested a loan move away from the club in October 2009. On 10 November 2009, he joined league rivals Barrow on loan until 1 January 2010. He made his debut in a 2–2 with AFC Wimbledon on 14 November 2009, assisting Jason Walker's goal through a corner kick. He scored his first goal for Barrow in a 2–2 draw with Grays Athletic on 24 November 2009 with a free kick and finished the loan spell with six appearances and two goals. He joined Conference Premier rivals Luton Town on trial in January 2010, starting a reserve-team match against Peterborough United, before signing on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season on 22 January. He made his debut a day later as an 83rd-minute substitute <b>for</b> <b>Tom</b> Craddock in a 1–0 victory over Gateshead. His loan period at Luton came to an end on 7 May 2010, having made eight appearances for the club. He finished the season with eight appearances for York and {{was released}} by the club on 18 May 2010.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the major}} port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men {{expelled}} from the military who had decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. By 1969 the Kinsey Institute believed San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the National Institute of Mental Health asked the Institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager <b>for</b> <b>Tom</b> O'Horgan, a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of Hair. McKinley was offered {{a job in the}} New York City production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia, Milk let his hair grow long. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.|$|E
5|$|When the {{producers}} knew Macfadyen would leave, {{the producers}} decided to introduce new cast members, {{one of which}} was Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam Carter, the new protagonist. Early on in the creation of Adam, the producers had an interest in casting Penry-Jones for the role; however, it took the actor three auditions until the producers finally decided to cast him. Unlike Tom, Adam would have a different character dynamic; he has an MI6 background, and is married. A change from the girlfriend/boyfriend storyline <b>for</b> <b>Tom</b> and Ellie Simm in the first series, the producers noted it is common for secret service officers to be in a relationship with others in the same field of work. This led to the introduction of Fiona Carter, portrayed by Olga Sosnovska. Sosnovska was previously approached to appear in the second series, but was unavailable. She later auditioned for Fiona, and was later told she won the part when she was in New York City. The actress was only given a brief on her character—a ball breaker, ultimate professional, cold and calculated—which did not give her much to work with. Sosnovska initially found Fiona irritating in the fourth episode, but later opened up to the character after her return in the seventh.|$|E
