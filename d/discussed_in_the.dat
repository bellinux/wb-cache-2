5|$|As a {{founding}} member of the Association Française pour l'Avancement des Sciences, Lemoine presented what became his best-known paper, Note sur les propriétés du centre des médianes antiparallèles dans un triangle at the Association's 1874 meeting in Lille. The central focus of this paper concerned the point which bears his name today. Most of the other results <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper pertained to various concyclic points that could be constructed from the Lemoine point.|$|E
5|$|Beddard {{states in}} the book that it {{contains}} little that is new, intending instead to give a clear overview of the subject. The main topics covered are camouflage, then called 'protective coloration'; mimicry; and sexual selection. Arguments for and against these aspects of animal coloration are intensively <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E
5|$|Each sermon {{begins with}} a scriptural passage that {{reinforces}} the ideas that will be <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sermon and each was preceded with the same opening prayer (which Swift also delivered). The sermons are plainly written and apply a common-sense approach to contemporary moral issues in Dublin. Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E

5|$|Enhancement of the {{language}} goes along with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for discussion about {{the language}}'s development; specific issues are <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roundup bug tracker maintained at python.org. Development took place on a self-hosted source code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.|$|E
5|$|Further {{possible}} {{development work}} on the R engine was <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> National Archives' file AVIA 13/122, which contains a proposal from the Royal Aircraft Establishment dated October and November 1932, to test four engines to destruction. This document states that there were five engines available for test purposes, the fifth {{to be used for}} a standard Type Test at high revolutions.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Emma Watson {{started a}} feminist Goodreads book club: Our Shared Shelf. The {{goal of the}} club is to share feminist ideas and {{encourage}} discussion on the topic. One book is selected per month and is <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last week of that month. The first book to be selected was My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem, whom Emma Watson would later interview on 24 February at the How to: Academy in London.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{regarding}} Vithoba usually {{focus on}} his devotee Pundalik or on Vithoba's role as a savior to the poet-saints of the Varkari faith. As <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> devotional works section above, the Pundalik legend appears in the Sanskrit scriptures Skanda Purana and Padma Purana. It is also documented in Marathi texts: Panduranga-Mahatmya by a Brahmin called Sridhara; another work {{of the same name}} written by Prahlada Maharaj; and also in the abhangas of various poet-saints.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E

30|$|Recently, special {{attention}} {{was given to}} the use of <b>the</b> geometric properties <b>in</b> modular function spaces. This is due to recent interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dirichlet energy problem which we <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next example.|$|R

5|$|There are {{situations}} in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as is <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.|$|E
5|$|These geopolitical {{calculations}} were debated and <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following years. Historians {{agree that}} the British believed that expressing support would appeal to Jews in Germany and the United States, given two of Woodrow Wilson's closest advisors {{were known to be}} avid Zionists; they also hoped to encourage support from the large Jewish population in Russia. In addition, the British intended to pre-empt the expected French pressure for an international administration in Palestine.|$|E
50|$|We {{believe that}} the {{decision}} to reactivate Blandon as an informant was undertaken without adequate notice or consultation about its impact on our ability to <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> report the critical issue of Blandon's past cooperation with the government. This was an important part of our investigation and report.|$|R

5|$|A {{man from}} Northern Ireland was <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media in {{connection}} with the disappearance. After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. He died in 2013. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.|$|E
5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leading British medical journal The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E
30|$|Generalization of our testing results: We <b>discuss</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} {{whether one}} {{can assume that}} our results remain valid for user-session reconstruction in general, for any RIA. There are several issues that may limit such a generalization.|$|R
