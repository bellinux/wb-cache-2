5|$|Although Bach's {{manuscript}} is lost, {{the work}} is agreed {{to be one of}} the earliest Bach cantatas, probably composed during the year <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> Mühlhausen 1707/1708 as organist of the Divi Blasii church, at the age of 22. Various funerals known to have taken place at this time have been proposed as the occasion for the composition, for example that of his uncle Tobias Lämmerhirt from his mother's family, who died in Erfurt on 10 August 1707, and that of Adolph Strecker, a former mayor of Mühlhausen, whose funeral was 16 September 1708.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, {{in tandem}} with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 to 1914 Jolin {{started to}} paint {{in his own}} naïve {{interpretation}} of Expressionism. By {{the end of the}} 1910s his works became more expressed and the shapes more plastic, but in 1916, Jolin's paintings were still inspired by the years <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> France. That spring, members of the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artists Association) and their young pupils, were invited to present the new style, Expressionism, to the Swedish audience as exhibition number two (number one being Anders Zorn, Bruno Liljefors and Carl Larsson) at the new art venue, the Liljevalchs konsthall, in Djurgården. Participating in the second exhibition were a number of noted Swedish artists at that time, including Leander Engström, Isaac Grünewald, Gösta Sandels, Birger Simonsson and Jolin who exhibited thirteen paintings.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Moore won {{a six-month}} {{travelling}} scholarship which <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> Northern Italy studying the {{great works of}} Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters. During this period he also visited Paris, {{took advantage of the}} timed-sketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and viewed, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, which he had previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

5|$|Mikhail Tanich {{wrote the}} lyrics to every song the group {{performed}} until his death on April 17, 2008. In writing {{the lyrics to}} the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> a Soviet labor camp, during which time he came to empathize with criminals {{from all walks of}} life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical melodies and performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a guitar, drums, accordions, and are often performed with strong vocals.|$|E
5|$|The Allied defeat {{during the}} Greek Campaign {{indirectly}} {{contributed to a}} change of government in Australia. Prime Minister Menzies' leadership had been weakened by the lengthy period <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> Britain during early 1941, and the high Australian losses in the Greek Campaign led many members of his United Australia Party (UAP) to conclude {{that he was not}} capable of leading the Australian war effort. Menzies resigned on 26 August after losing the confidence of his party and was replaced by Arthur Fadden from the Country Party, which was the UAP's coalition partner. Fadden's government collapsed on 3 October and was replaced by an Australian Labor Party government under the leadership of John Curtin.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an {{artificial}} leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life {{in a way that would}} help others find courage.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Hundred Years' War in 1337, Grosmont's attention was turned towards France. He took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later the same year, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for the king's considerable debts. He remained hostage until the next year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release. On his return he was made the king's lieutenant in the north and stayed at Roxburgh until 1342. The next years <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> diplomatic negotiations in the Low Countries, Castile and Avignon.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had ever worked on an album. For most of the recording process, only three other people were in the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> the studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War cost Brown his peak years, which <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> the Royal Australian Air Force. Cricket resumed in 1945–46 and Brown, in Bradman's absence, captained an Australian eleven in a match that was retrospectively awarded Test status. Brown missed {{the entirety of the}} following season because of injury. Upon his return, he was unable to repeat his previous success and was ousted from the opening positions by Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes. Selected for the Invincibles tour, he performed reasonably well in the tour matches but, with Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, he batted out of position in the middle order during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team, never to return. Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland {{until the end of the}} 1949–50 season.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March 1915, Jensen enlisted as {{a private}} in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for service in World War I, and was allotted to the 6th {{reinforcements}} to the 10th Battalion with the regimental number 2389. His reinforcement draft embarked on HMAT Borda at Outer Harbor on 23 June, and joined the battalion at Gallipoli on 4 August. By the time Jensen arrived, {{nearly half of the}} battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. For the remainder of the Gallipoli campaign, the 10th Battalion rotated through various positions in the line defending the beachhead until withdrawn to Lemnos in November. Jensen remained with his unit throughout, except for a week in late September/early October which <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> hospital. The battalion embarked for Egypt late the following month and spent the next four months training and assisting in the defence of the Suez Canal. During their time in Egypt, the battalion was split into two, with one half forming the nucleus of the new 50th Battalion, which was part of the 13th Brigade, 4th Division. In April 1916, Jensen {{and a number of other}} 10th Battalion men were transferred to the 50th Battalion, and later that month Jensen was charged for not being in his tent at tattoo. On 5 June the battalion embarked for France, arriving in Marseilles six days later. The unit then entrained for the Western Front, entering the trenches for the first time on 28 June.|$|E
