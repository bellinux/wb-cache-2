50|$|Adelmidrol is the semisynthetic <b>diethanolamide</b> {{derivative}} of azelaic acid, {{and has a}} symmetrical chemical structure. It classed as an ALIAmide, and is similar to palmitoylethanolamide, the parent molecule in the ALIAmide class of drugs. ALIAmides are group of fatty acid derivatives with cannabimimetic properties, which have antiinflammatory and analgesic effects and are thought to act by reducing mast cell activation.|$|E
50|$|Cocamide DEA, or cocamide diethanolamine, is a <b>diethanolamide</b> made by {{reacting}} {{the mixture}} of fatty acids from coconut oils with diethanolamine.

See cocamide for the discussion of the lengths of carbon chains in the molecules in the mixture. The chemical formula of individual components is CH3(CH2)nC(=O)N(CH2CH2OH)2, where n typically ranges from 8 to 18.|$|E

The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel considered new data and information from previous CIR reports to assess the concerns about the potential for amidases in human skin to convert these <b>diethanolamides</b> into DEA and the corresponding fatty acids. The Expert Panel concluded that these <b>diethanolamides</b> are safe as used when formulated to be nonirritating and when the levels of free DEA in the <b>diethanolamides</b> do not exceed those considered safe by the Panel. The Panel also recommended that these ingredients not be used in cosmetic products in which N-nitroso compounds can be formed.

40|$|The thermotropic and lyotropic liquid {{crystalline}} phase behaviour of {{a series}} of <b>diethanolamide</b> amphiphiles with isoprenoid-type hydrocarbon chains (geranoyl, H-farnesoyl, and phytanoyl) has been investigated. When neat, both H-farnesoyl and phytanoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> form a smectic liquid crystalline structure at sub-zero temperatures. In addition, all three diethanolamides exhibit a glass transition temperature at around 73 1 C. Geranoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> forms a lamellar crystalline phase with a lattice parameter of 17. 4 A˚ following long term storage accompanied by the loss of the glass transition. In the presence of water, H-farnesoyl and phytanoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases, whilst geranoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> forms an L 2 phase. H-farnesoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> forms a ﬂuid lamellar phase (La) at room temperature and up to B 40 1 C.

40|$|The {{neat and}} lyotropic liquid {{crystalline}} phase behavior of three nonionic <b>diethanolamide</b> amphiphiles with C 18 hydrocarbon chains containing one, {{two or three}} unsaturated bonds has been examined. This has allowed the eﬀect of degree of unsaturation on the phase behavior of <b>diethanolamide</b> amphiphiles to be investigated. Neat linoleoyl and linolenoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> undergo a transition from a glassy liquid crystal to a liquid crystal at B 85 1 C, while neat oleoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> undergoes a transition at B 60 1 C to a liquid crystalline material before re-crystallizing at 34 1 C. Oleoyl <b>diethanolamide</b> then undergoes a third transition from a crystalline phase to a smectic liquid crystalline phase at B 5 1 C. In the absence of water, the transition temperature from a smectic liquid crystal to an isotropic liquid decreases with increasing unsaturation. The addition of water results {{in the formation of}} a lamellar phase (La) for all three amphiphiles. The lamellar phase is stable under excess water conditions up to temperatures of at least 70 1 C. Approximate partial binary amphiphile-water phase diagrams generated for the three unsaturated C 18 amphiphiles indicate that the excess water point for each amphiphile occurs at B 60 % (w/w) amphiphile...|$|E
40|$|The {{solid state}} and lyotropic phase {{behavior}} {{of a series of}} nonionic <b>diethanolamide</b> amphiphiles with increasing saturated hydrocarbon chain length (lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, and stearoyl) has been examined. All four saturated <b>diethanolamide</b> amphiphiles form a crystalline solid with two or three different polymorphic crystalline forms at room temperature. Melting points and associated enthalpies for these four amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length. Approximate partial binary phase diagrams have been constructed for each amphiphile/water system by combining Cross-Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM) and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) results. In the presence of water, all four diethanolamides form an La phase, between 10 % and 50 % water content, and an L 2 phase with decreasing hydration and increasing temperature. In addition to the La and L 2 phases, the shorter chain <b>diethanolamide</b> amphiphiles (lauroyl and myristoyl) also display a normal micellar phase (L 1) at higher water contents, occurring to lower temperatures than the La phase. By examining the effect of subtle molecular changes on both neat and lyotropic phase behavior, amphiphiles can be designed with properties tailored to a desired application...|$|E
