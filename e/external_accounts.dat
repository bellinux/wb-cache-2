25|$|After 1950 {{the country}} {{suffered}} economic disruptions {{about once a}} decade; the most serious crisis occurred in the late 1970s. In each case, an industry-led period of rapid expansion, marked by {{a sharp increase in}} imports, resulted in a balance of payments crisis. Devaluations of the Turkish lira and austerity programs designed to dampen domestic demand for foreign goods were implemented in accordance with International Monetary Fund guidelines. These measures usually led to sufficient improvement in the country's <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> to make possible the resumption of loans to Turkey by foreign creditors. Although the military interventions of 1960 and 1971 were prompted in part by economic difficulties, after each intervention Turkish politicians boosted government spending, causing the economy to overheat. In the absence of serious structural reforms, Turkey ran chronic current account deficits usually financed by external borrowing that made the country's external debt rise from decade to decade, reaching by 1980 about US$16.2 billion, or more than one-quarter of annual gross domestic product. Debt-servicing costs in that year equaled 33 percent of exports of goods and services.|$|E

The high variability of copper prices affected the Chilean economy, particularly the <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> and the availability of foreign exchange, in several ways.

5000|$|These {{relationships}} are mirrored in {{the characters of}} Jefferies's late novel Amaryllis at the Fair (1887); and the portraits {{of the family in}} the novel tally with <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> of the Jefferies. [...] James Jefferies, like Iden in Amaryllis, was devoted to his garden, while struggling to make a financial success of the farm. The garden, lovingly recalled in Wood Magic and Amaryllis, also makes a strong impression on the memories of those who knew the Jefferies at the time. [...] Betsy, like Iden's wife, seems to have been dissatisfied with life on the farm: [...] "a town-bred woman with a beautiful face and a pleasure-loving soul, kind and generous to a fault, but unsuited to a country life." [...] The farm was very small, with 39 acre of pasture; and a mortgage of £1500 would later begin a slide into debt for James Jefferies, who lost the farm in 1877 and became a jobbing gardener. [...] But these difficulties were less evident in Richard's childhood. The situation was much as in After London (1885), where the farming and gardening Baron is again based on James Jefferies: [...] "The whole place was thus falling to decay, {{while at the same time}} it seemed to be flowing with milk and honey". One part of the Jefferies family is strikingly missing from the books. In Wood Magic, Bevis and Amaryllis, the hero (or heroine) has no siblings; only After London gives the main character brothers and depicts the imperfect sympathy between them. James and Elizabeth's first child, Ellen, had died young; but Richard had two younger brothers and a younger sister.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{theoretical}} and empirical insights into the effective use of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> by social activists in conflict arenas in order to bring about change. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a longitudinal case study of Action on Smoking and Health UK (ASH) and their use of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> and other activist practices during the period 1999 - 2010. The authors explore these practices from the perspective of one organisation engaged in conflict arenas concerning the (un) acceptability of tobacco production, consumption and governance. The authors conduct the exploration based upon a dynamic conflict arena framework that attends to the range of external accounting and activist practices, tactical intentions and states of conflict used by ASH to confront the tobacco industry and bring about change in tobacco governance. Findings - The study identifies the use of a diverse range of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> and other activist practices. This assemblage of practices was used to confront, counter-act and to co-operate with actors engaged in tobacco-related conflicts. The evidence suggests that the deployment of different types of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> by ASH was aligned to the context of the particular conflict arena involved, and was influenced by the strategy and engagement tactics of the activists and other actors, as well as power dynamics and acceptability of the tobacco governance in the conflict arena. Whilst ASH used different <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> in specific episodes of activism, these individual accounts also contributed to an emerging holistic account of the unacceptable consequences of tobacco production, consumption and governance. Originality/value - This study provides new theoretical and empirical insights into how <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> can contribute to the problematisation of governance and development of social and environmental change agendas. The dynamic conflict arena framework developed in this paper creates new visibilities and possibilities for developing external accounting practices and for researching this fast-developing area of social and environmental accounting.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is {{to contribute to the}} understanding of how changes in the <b>external</b> <b>accounting</b> framework impacts an insurance company’s asset and liability management focusing on the asset side and credit risks. Method: This study has an actor’s approach. The theory and the empirical data have been approached consistently {{with the help of the}} model I designed. The design of the study is a case study with a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews. When collecting and analysing the empirical material the study has been influenced by a qualitative approach. Result & Conclusions: The study indicates that the insurance sector is using economic and solvent risk based valuations to manage and steer their business to profitability.    This study has clearly shown that reality mirrors the theory. However due to the volatility of the insurance market, stress testing supports the ALM requirements which is at the heart of an insurance company. Suggestions for future research: A suggestion would be to focus on internal controls used to implement such changes in <b>external</b> <b>accounting</b> frameworks which impact management accounting.   Such a focus would possibly be quite interesting to study and develop further.   Contributions of the thesis: This study contributed to how changes in the <b>external</b> <b>accounting</b> framework impacts an insurance company’s asset and liability management focusing on the asset side and credit risks.
