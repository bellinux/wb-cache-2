30|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} as to whether migration had <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> personal or professional lives was very homogenous. Most of the participants, 143, answered that migration had <b>improved</b> <b>their</b> personal and professional lives while 10 of them answered the opposite, that migration did not <b>improve</b> <b>their</b> lives. Some of the answers were determined by personal improvements and other answers focused on professional, educational and social improvements.

The Senators would make some progress, <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> record to 14 wins and 37 points, but would again finish last in the League. The Senators would select Radek Bonk with their pick, third overall, in the 1994 Draft.|$|E
5|$|Baseball was a {{reasonably}} popular sport in Australia {{in the early}} 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life. At the time, baseball was generally played in Australia during the winter months, {{as many of the}} leading players were enthusiastic cricketers who viewed the sport as a means of <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> fielding skills. As with cricket, Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School, where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop, later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis {{pulled back}} from all of his outer defenses, except for the Fusilier's redoubt {{on the west side}} of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east. Cornwallis had his forces occupy the {{earthworks}} immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from Clinton that promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches.

5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E

5|$|Shiren the Wanderer was {{developed}} by Chunsoft for the Super Famicom, with the core concept of repeated play, with the player <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> equipment and items each time they play, making progress through several playthroughs. The developers noted that Shiren the Wanderer differed from other Mystery Dungeon titles in that the Chunsoft staff create characters themselves, allowing them to express the Mystery Dungeon series more fully than with the other titles, which are set in already created worlds which Chunsoft cannot change. The game {{was developed}} in parallel with the Game Boy game Shiren the Wanderer GB, which used modified source code from the Super Famicom game.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{entered the}} 2015 season with hopes of <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> 5–11 record in 2014. The team started {{the regular season}} on a poor note, losing their first three games.

However, the Bears then lost the first three games in December, and were officially eliminated from playoff contention in week fourteen by the Washington Redskins. In week sixteen against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Bears improved upon their 2014 record with a 26–21 win. After losing in {{the final game of}} the season to the Detroit Lions, the Bears ended the season 6–10 and last in the NFC North.|$|E
5|$|The male, {{which plays}} {{no part in}} nesting or chick care, leaves the {{breeding}} grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since it reduces feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds as early as possible, <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> chances of successful mating. Male ruffs may {{also be able to}} tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.|$|E

5|$|Wines {{from the}} Languedoc can carry an {{enormous}} number of names, ranging from broad regional designations like Vin de Pays d'Oc to very specific geographical classifications with restrictions on grape variety, like Corbières and Minervois. Since the 1990s, the INAO has been creating smaller AOC classifications which take into account the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livinière, Corbières-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope. While these new appellations have been praised for consistently <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> product, others have criticized the additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades {{through the}} lens of their own {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants saw them as a manifestation of the evils of the papacy, and Catholics viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts could have been more profitably directed towards <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> own countries.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which {{determine the number of}} times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s {{employment}} in the park began to decline as companies closed their premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. Ellesmere Port and Runcorn at {{the western end of}} the Manchester Ship Canal were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment had fallen to 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s. In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (TRAFIC), membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> own areas through landscaping and other environmental improvements. The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester Ship Canal during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service. By 1976, the workforce had fallen to 15,000, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.|$|E

In exchange for ending wars and restoring the ecological balance, and <b>improving</b> <b>their</b> heavily polluted planet, the population would become the personal slaves of Ardra a thousand years later. As the millennium is about to come to a close, the planet has recently begun experiencing mild earthquakes as well as seeing images of Ardra in the skies.
