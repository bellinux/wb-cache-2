50|$|Capillary <b>electrochromatography</b> (CEC) is a chromatographic {{technique}} {{in which the}} mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by electroosmosis. Capillary <b>electrochromatography</b> {{is a combination of}} two analytical techniques, High performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes {{on the basis of their}} mass to charge ratio by passing a high voltage across ends of a capillary tube, which is filled with the analyte. High performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with stationary phase. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and mobile phase lead to the separation of the analytes. In capillary <b>electrochromatography</b> capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage. Separation is achieved by electrophoretic migration of solutes and differential partitioning.|$|E

The molecules are separated by size due to the gel filtration mechanism and by electrophoretic mobility due to the gel electrophoresis mechanism. Additionally there are secondary chromatographic solute retention mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|The <b>electrochromatography</b> {{column is}} a unique glass device {{designed}} to function both as a chromatography column and as an electrophoresis column; {{it can also be}} operated so that both column chromatography and electrophoresis can take place in one simultaneous operation (<b>electrochromatography).</b> When the column is used for <b>electrochromatography,</b> proteins of the same molecular size, but with different electrophoretic mobilities, will be separated by electrophoresis, whereas proteins with the same electrophoretic mobilities but of different molecular size will be separated by molecular sieving. If proteins vary only slightly in these physical properties, separation is greatly enhanced by the action of the electric field on the filtering molecules.

40|$|The {{influence}} of Joule heating on electroosmotic flow velocity, the retention factor of neutral analytes, and separation efficiency in capillary <b>electrochromatography</b> was investigated theoretically and experimentally. A plot of electrical current against the applied electrical field strength {{was used to}} evaluate the Joule heating effect. When the mobile phase concentration of Tris buffer exceeded 5. 0 mM in the studied capillary <b>electrochromatography</b> systems using particulate and monolithic columns (with an accompanying power level of heat dissipation higher than 0. 35 W/m), the Joule heating effect became clearly noticeable. Theoretical models for describing the variation of electroosmotic flow velocity with increasing applied field strength and the change of retention factors for neutral analytes with electrical field strength at higher Tris buffer concentrations were analyzed to explain consequences of Joule heating in capillary <b>electrochromatography.</b> Qualitative agreement between experimental data and implications of the theoretical model analysis was observed. The decrease of separation efficiency in capillary <b>electrochromatography</b> with macroporous octadecylsilica particles at high buffer concentration can be also attributed to Joule heating mainly via the increased axial diffusion of the analyte molecules and dispersion of solute bands by a nonuniform electroosmotic flow profile over the column cross-section. However, within a moderate temperature range, the contribution of the macroscopic velocity profile in the column arising from radial temperature gradients is insignificant. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Pressurized Planar <b>Electrochromatography</b> is a {{fast and}} {{efficient}} planar chromatographic technique that was recently developed at IUPUI. The mobile phase {{is driven by}} electroosmotic flow while the system is pressurized {{in a manner that}} allows heat to flow between the sorbent layer and the pressurizing medium. PPEC retains all of the attractive features of classical Thin-Layer Chromatography. Further advantages of Pressurized Planar <b>Electrochromatography</b> include the ability to separate multiple samples simultaneously, separate samples that have been spotted in a two-dimensional array across the plate, and run separations on multiple plates simultaneously. ^ A prototype apparatus for performing Pressurized Planar Electrochormatography is described in this thesis, and was used to demonstrate that this technique is significantly faster and more efficient than classical Thin-Layer Chromatography. An example is shown in which a 24 -fold enhancement in the speed of separation is achieved with Pressurized Planar <b>Electrochromatography.</b> Reproducibility with this apparatus was poor, and several changes were made to the apparatus and operating procedure to improve this. The second prototype apparatus is described in detail in this thesis. ^ It was shown that the migration distance of neutral analytes increases with applied voltage, percent organic modifier, conditioning temperature, soak time, and buffer concentration, while migration distance decreases with applied pressure. ^ The highest efficiency in Pressurized Planar <b>Electrochromatography</b> is achieved at an intermediate temperature. This behavior is ascribed to high resistance to mass transfer at lower temperatures and increased diffusion at higher temperatures. Efficiency, as measured by the number of theoretical plates increases with increasing migration distance. Under appropriate conditions, efficiencies as high as 94, 000 plates per meter were achieved. This thesis also described the dependence of efficiency in Pressurized Planar <b>Electrochromatography</b> on the applied voltage (used as a surrogate for flow rate), and applied pressure, the temperature, and the buffer concentration and pH of the mobile phase. Results are presented as plots of the height equivalent of a theoretical plate versus applied voltage. With the exception of separations at 0 °C, the highest efficiency is observed at the highest applied voltage. ^ Desorption electrospray ionization is a new mass spectrometry method that allows analytes to be ionized directly from a TLC plate after PPEC. The detection and identification of the analytes of a five component mixture separated in one minute was achieved. ...|$|E

40|$|Photopolymerized sol-gel {{monolithic}} columns {{for use in}} capillary <b>electrochromatography</b> {{were prepared}} in 125 mu m i. d. polyacrylate-coated fused-silica capillaries. The polyacrylate-coating, unlike the polyimide one, is transparent to the radiation used (approximate to 370 nm), and thus, no coating removal is necessary.

40|$|<b>Electrochromatography</b> employs an axial {{electric}} field across a chromatographic stationary phase to separate molecules based on differences in electrophoretic mobility. Although <b>electrochromatography</b> columns have existed for over 40 years, ineffective removal {{of heat and}} electrolysis gases have historically limited the scale-up of these columns to 2. 5 cm ID with sample volumes of less than 0. 5 mL. ^ Several new electrode designs were tested that employed either agarose or polyacrylamide gels. In all cases, the gel based electrodes suffered from excessive heating in the gel. However, an ultrafiltration membrane and platinum gauze electrode design reduced both electrolysis gas formation and heating in the electrode. ^ To study column-heating effects, a new column was designed with thermocouple ports at four axial positions. In each of these ports specially sheathed thermocouples were {{used to measure the}} temperature at the radial center of the column. A transient two-dimensional temperature model was developed to predict the temperature rise in the column. From both model prediction and experimental data, it was determined that heating in the <b>electrochromatography</b> column could be substantially reduced by using a non-conductive methacrylate base stationary phase with a low conductivity (3. 9 mM tris- 47 mM glycine) buffer. The resolving power of this new column (3. 81 cm ID x 38. 1 cm long) was demonstrated by separating mixtures of BSA and myoglobin. ^ Careful selection of operating conditions yielded a separation of 19. 5 mL of a mixture containing BSA and myoglobin on a 400 mL column. Further scale up of the separation experienced problems with excessive heating at the column inlet. The most likely cause of this heating was dissolved CO 2 that entered the column with the sample. However, decreased column heating and increased sample loading was achieved if an injection of 0. 1 M NaCl was made after the initial protein sample injection. Using a second salt injection, a baseline separation of 49 mL of bovine serum albumin and myoglobin was achieved. Lower overall column temperature and higher resolution were obtained over traditional <b>electrochromatography</b> operation. Based on the heat transfer model, this column could be scaled to a 10. 8 cm ID x 38. 1 cm long column capable of processing over 390 mL of sample per run. ...|$|E

Efficient stationary phases need to be developed to promote a widespread use of CEC. Toward this goal, the present work describes the synthesis and the use of organically modified silicates (ormosils) as stationary phases for capillary <b>electrochromatography.</b> Ormosils, made by the sol-gel technique, consist of a silica framework containing organic materials. The chemistry of the sol-gel technique was studied in this work to control the resolutions, the efficiencies and the morphologies of the ormosil stationary phases. The factors affecting these parameters were defined and independently studied by <b>electrochromatography</b> and by electronic and optic microscopy. n-octyl modified silicates were chosen as stationary phases in the investigations and mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were used as the test sample. Based on these results, methods were proposed for the formation of coatings and monoliths inside fused silica capillaries. The corresponding open tubular columns (OTCs) and monolithic columns (MCs) were studied with regard to their applications in CEC. Separations of PAHs, achieved with OTCs, were used to optimize the parameters acting during an electrochromatographic separation. Capillaries coated with ormosils containing different organic moieties were tested to separate several types of analytes.

The separation mechanism of neutral solutes and the influence of mobile phase composition on the separation was investigated. The separation of nitrogen-containing solutes was carried out with this mode and the peak tailing of basic solute was effectively eliminated because the adsorption of basic solute on silica was blocked by the preferred adsorption of CTAB.
