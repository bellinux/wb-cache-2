500|$|Later on August 22, two open {{meetings}} were held {{which ended in}} an abrupt about-face on the basic planetary definition. The position of astronomer Julio Ángel Fernández gained the upper hand among the members attending and was described as unlikely to lose its hold by August 24.

The discussion at the first meeting was heated and lively, with IAU members in vocal disagreement with one another over such issues as {{the relative merits of}} static and dynamic physics; the main sticking point was whether or not to include a body's orbital characteristics among the definition criteria.

5000|$|... 15 June 2005 - At {{a meeting}} of the 1922 Backbench Committee Conservative MPs holds an <b>indicative</b> <b>vote</b> on several {{proposed}} options for electing the leader. A system where MPs select the leader with a formal consultation of members is the preferred option.|$|E
50|$|The {{non-binding}} {{referendum on}} electoral reform {{was held on}} 19 September 1992, to coincide with local body elections. MMP easily won in the vote, with 84% overall wanting a change in electoral system, and 70% backing MMP. However, turn out for this <b>indicative</b> <b>vote</b> was just over 50% of the voting public. Nonetheless, the government drew up the Electoral Act 1993 to replace the previous 1956 legislation, and hold a binding referendum on the electoral system. This was {{to be held at}} the same time as the 1993 general election.|$|E
50|$|Some {{allege that}} voting {{locations}} that used electronic voting machines {{that did not}} issue a paper receipt or offer auditability correlate geographically with areas that had unilateral discrepancies between exit poll numbers and actual results. Exit polling data in these areas show significantly higher support for Kerry than actual results (outside the margin of error). Some are concerned that, from a statistical perspective, this may be <b>indicative</b> of <b>vote</b> rigging, because the likelihood of this happening by chance is less than 1 in 50,000. Others point out this {{could be explained by}} poor exit polling techniques or all discrepancies may be within the margin of error.|$|R
5000|$|Boronia {{contained}} seven polling booths at the 2010 Federal Election—six in {{the electorate}} of La Trobe {{and one in}} Aston. Usually something of a [...] "bellwether" [...] area (that is, fairly competitive and <b>indicative</b> of general <b>voting</b> patterns), the combined results of Boronia's seven booths produced a primary vote result of 41.5% Labor, 41.7% Liberal, and 11.1% Greens. Despite the narrow lead of the Liberal candidate on first preferences, the two-party result after preferences was 53.2% Labor and 46.8% Liberal.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{decision}} to merge the two clubs, there was a conflict regarding the new name of the club. The board had decided that the new name of the club could not be connected {{to any of the}} names of the former clubs. After an <b>indicative</b> <b>vote</b> on the new club's website, the board chose the name [...] "Varden Fotballklubb" [...] after the name of the stadium. [...] "Fotballklubben Fyllingsdalen" [...] received most votes, but the board chose the other name owing to sponsorship interests. The choice of colors was purple, with light blue away shirts.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{examination}} {{of the names of}} MPs voting at each division shows that, of the 305 who voted for the 80% elected option, 211 went on to vote for the 100% elected option. Given that this vote took place after the vote on 80% - whose result was already known when the vote on 100% took place - this showed a clear preference for a fully elected upper house among those who voted for the only other option that passed. But this was nevertheless only an <b>indicative</b> <b>vote</b> and many political and legislative hurdles remained to be overcome for supporters of an elected second chamber. The House of Lords, soon after, rejected this proposal and voted for an entirely appointed House of Lords.|$|E

5000|$|Talks {{continued}} {{about the}} proposed league merger. A {{proposal for a}} merged league body with a 12-12-18 structure was advanced in April 2013. This plan failed when two SPL clubs (Ross County and St Mirren) voted against. The SPL clubs unanimously agreed a revised merger plan a few weeks later, which would retain the same league structure and redistribute more revenues to second tier clubs. The SFL submitted a counter-proposal allowing for more revenues {{to be given to}} third and fourth tier clubs, but this was rejected by the SPL, who stuck with the plan agreed by their clubs. An <b>indicative</b> <b>vote</b> of SFL clubs in May suggested that the SPL plan would be formally rejected. Some of the First Division (second tier) clubs threatened to break away from the SFL and form an [...] "SPL2" [...] (SPL second division). The SPL suggested it would welcome the First Division clubs if they decided to leave the SFL. A formal vote of SFL clubs was taken on 12 June. 23 clubs voted in favour, one more than was needed for the proposal to succeed. The merger was formally agreed on 28 June and football was first played under the new structure in the 2013-14 season.|$|E
