40|$|We have {{developed}} a 'pitch-catch' low frequency-wideband Rayleigh wave EMAT system with a centre frequency of approximately 200 kHz, extending to around 500 kHz and study here its applicability to crack detection in the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks. On {{the head of a}} rail, the generated waves are strictly speaking a type of guided wave mode as the propagation surface is not a flat halfspace. They propagate along the surface of the rail penetrating down to a depth of several millimetres. We have used this approach to demonstrate detection of gauge corner and longitudinal cracking in the rail head. On samples containing machined slots we have shown that crack depth can be estimated by measuring the proportion of the ultrasonic wave at a particular frequency that passes underneath the crack. The approach that we have used is fundamentally different to and has several advantages over conventional ultrasonic contact methods and should ultimately facilitate testing the rail head more thoroughly at higher speeds...|$|E

Therefore, modern railway rails production technology and exploitation in European Community have require a new philosophy and content for the proposals of new European standards for the manufacturing and delivery <b>of</b> railway <b>rails</b> (series pr EN 13674 and other recommendations).

40|$|National audienceIn urban areas, {{vibrations}} {{generated by}} railways {{have great importance}} because they influence {{the quality of life}} of neighbours in terms of ground borne noise. In order to reduce amplitudes of vibrations on the track, grinding of rails has been used for several years on the Parisian network. The main drawback of this method is the generation of several small particles, who decrease air quality in tunnel and subway stations after the operation. Theses particles are a problem for working conditions of operators staff members. In order to reduce this concentration in underground spaces, a new method using milling and vacuum cleaning of samples has been tested. This method generates mush less dust but it modifies the rail profile, creating irregular facets witch may have an impact in terms of vibration generation. In order to evaluate vibration mitigation between grinding and milling methods, measurements have been performed on two sites on ballasted tracks: one on free flied and one in tunnel. Time history of transversal (<b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail)</b> and vertical (under rail) vibrations have been recorded during weeks and results are given in terms of velocity in third octave bands. For free field site, an acoustic measurement is correlated to rail vibration measurements. For tunnel site, a vibration measurement on tunnel wall is correlated to vibration record on the rail. For the two sites, measurements have been recorded for several passages of different rolling stock, and statistical data has been extracted from these measurements. This presentation compares the two methods and presents the benefits for the neighbours in terms of ground borne vibrations in urban areas...|$|E

5000|$|Bullhead rail {{is similar}} to double-headed rail except that the profile <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> {{is not the same}} as that of the foot. Bullhead rail evolved from double-headed rail but, because it did not have a {{symmetrical}} profile, it was never possible to flip it over and use the foot as the head. Therefore, because the rail no longer had the originally-perceived benefit of reusability, it was a very expensive method of laying track.

40|$|The {{realistic}} modelling of a {{heavy haul}} locomotive’s behaviour requires the correct representation of friction contact conditions between each wheel and the rail. Recent discussion has raised the issue that, under traction or braking, a process <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> cleaning by leading wheels might be occurring {{that can lead to}} increased values of friction coefficient between following wheel treads and the crown <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rails.</b> Such a change can improve the tractive effort of a hauling locomotive, which is a key issue for freight rolling stock operations. In this paper, the change of friction coefficients under locomotive wheels due to the effect <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> cleaning are analysed based on expert opinions obtained through a literature review process. Also, some assumptions have been made in order to investigate the effect of variation in friction under individual wheels on locomotive dynamics. These assumptions adopt a progressive increase of the friction coefficient (but in progressively decreasing increments) from the leading to each subsequent following wheel {{on each side of the}} locomotive. For this study, the multibody model and a full electrical system {{of a heavy}} haul locomotive have been used for numerical experiments. The results obtained show that the variation of friction coefficients can have a significant influence on locomotive dynamics under traction...|$|R
