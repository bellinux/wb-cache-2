40|$|A {{video stream}} {{consists}} {{of a number of}} shots each of which has different boundary types such as cut, <b>fade,</b> <b>and</b> dissolve. Many previous approaches can find the cut boundary without difficulty. However, most of them often produce false alarms for the videos with large motions of camera and objects. In this paper, we demonstrate that the shape of the histogram difference between two successive color images, called the structural information, provides an important cue to distinguish <b>fade</b> <b>and</b> dissolve effects from cut effect. Our shot detection method uses an optimal Bayesian classifier weighted by the structural information to model the gradual transitions such as <b>fades</b> <b>and</b> dissolves. The proposed method has been tested for a few golf video segments and shown good performances in detecting <b>fade</b> <b>and</b> dissolve effects as well as cut. 1...|$|R
5|$|After {{a fire at}} Manchester City's Hyde Road {{ground in}} 1920, the club {{considered}} a move to the Belle Vue athletics stadium, but it was deemed too small. At the behest of Belle Vue director John Henry Iles and John Ayrton, Manchester Central, was formed, and played its home matches at the speedway stadium. One of Manchester Central's first matches at Belle Vue was a visit by FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in September 1928. The club attempted unsuccessfully to join The Football League in 1930 and in 1931; with momentum lost, the club <b>faded,</b> <b>and</b> folded in 1934.|$|E

5|$|The Texas League, a {{baseball}} league, {{was founded in}} the 1800s, temporarily discontinued, and then restarted in the early 1900s evolving into a minor league. During the 1930s investors in Galveston, particularly Shearn Moody, established the Galveston Buccaneers baseball team, a successor to the former Galveston Pirates. The Buccaneers won the league championship in 1934 but the team was sold in 1937 after Moody's death. After the war, the new Gulf Coast League was established and the Galveston White Caps team was created. Galveston won the championship in 1953 but the team then <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> was disbanded in 1955 {{as the rest of}} Galveston's economy was collapsing.|$|E

5|$|Following the relegation, Taylor became Director of Football, {{with former}} Watford midfielder Kenny Jackett as manager. After a mid-table finish in Division Two in 1996–97, Jackett was demoted to the {{position}} of assistant manager. Taylor returned as manager, and won the Second Division title in 1997–98 – Watford's second league title under his management. A second successive promotion followed in 1998–99, thanks to a 2–0 play-off final victory over Bolton Wanderers. Watford's first Premiership season started with an early victory over Liverpool, but Watford's form soon <b>faded,</b> <b>and</b> the club was relegated after finishing bottom. Graham Taylor retired {{at the end of the}} 2000–01 season, and was replaced by Gianluca Vialli. Wage bills at the club rose by £4million during Vialli's tenure, and the club finished 14th in the division in 2001–02. Vialli was sacked at the end of the season, following a dispute with the club's board over the wage bill. He was replaced by Ray Lewington, who had joined the club the previous summer as Vialli's reserve team manager.|$|E
5|$|In August 1968, the Polish People's Army {{took part}} in the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Some Polish intellectuals protested, and Ryszard Siwiec burned himself alive during the official national holiday celebrations. The Polish participation in the crushing of the Czech liberal communism (called socialism with a human face, and, according to David Ost, constituting the crowning achievement of Marxist revisionism) further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters. But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> the 5th Congress of the PZPR in November reconfirmed his rule. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his Brezhnev Doctrine, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the fraternal course.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, while Los Angeles {{was known}} for locking and Fresno {{was known for}} popping, several other cities in Northern California had their own local funk styles. Sacramento was known for a style called sac-ing, San Jose for dime stopping, and Oakland for snake hitting. The San Francisco crew Granny and Robotroid {{incorporated}} stepping moves and JROTC rifle drill movements in their dancing to make a unique funk style called Fillmore strutting. This dance was named after the Fillmore district in San Francisco where Granny and Robotroid were from. Granny and Robotroid performed on the Gong Show in 1976. Although strutting had exposure on national television, it (and {{the rest of the}} localized funk styles) <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> never became mainstream.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{military}} potential of pigeon photography for aerial reconnaissance appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in World War I provided encouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile dovecotes for messenger pigeons {{had the greatest}} impact. Owing to the rapid perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War II, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in aerial reconnaissance. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later developed a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain classified.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 Yankees {{held the}} AL East lead {{entering}} August, but <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> ended the year fourth. The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee Stadium before {{the building was}} renovated. The Yankees had become concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium's surroundings. For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving. The city paid $24million to buy Yankee Stadium and the adjacent land, and in 1972 agreed to renovations. Work on the stadium finished in 1976, and the Yankees were required {{to play at the}} Mets' home field, Shea Stadium, in 1974 and 1975. During the first of those seasons, the team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the Orioles in a race that was decided in the final games. The Yankees were helped by an early-season trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss to the team, and improved to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.|$|E
5|$|Following peak intensity, the {{combination}} of increasing wind shear and lowering sea surface temperatures began to slowly weaken Iselle, bringing it below Category4intensity early on August5. Continued wind shear caused the storm to further degrade and its eye to become ragged in appearance. The NHC downgraded Iselle below major hurricane intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 00:00UTC on August6, forecasting responsibility transferred from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC). Although wind shear began to decrease thereafter, abundant dry air caused Iselle to rapidly weaken, dropping to Category1 intensity on August6. However, the suppressed wind shear allowed for the hurricane to reorganize and maintain a large eye as it tracked towards Hawaii, and Iselle reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 100mph (155km/h) at 00:00UTC on August7, making it a minimal Category2 hurricane. Only slow degradation of Iselle's structure followed, though on August7, the storm's eye had <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> the CPHC estimated that Iselle had weakened to a minimal hurricane. Becoming increasingly disorganized, Iselle weakened to a tropical storm the next day before making landfall at 12:30UTC along the Kau coast of Hawaii island with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The mountainous terrain of the island largely disrupted the main cyclonic circulation of Iselle, which manifested {{as a collection of}} small vortices south of the Hawaiian islands. Due to the loss of any sustained thunderstorm activity at the storm's center, the CPHC decided to downgrade Iselle to a remnant area of low pressure on August9; at the time, the disturbance was centered roughly 200mi (320km) west-southwest of Honolulu.|$|E

5|$|Nurmi's {{trip to the}} 1924 Summer Olympics was {{endangered}} by a knee injury {{in the spring of}} 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass. The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> continued their duel. On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.|$|E
5|$|The {{background}} of the Spanish Civil War {{dates back to the}} end of the 19th century, when the owners of large estates, called latifundia, held most of the power in a land-based oligarchy. The landowners' power was unsuccessfully challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors. In 1868 popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. After the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, Carlists and anarchists emerged in opposition to the monarchy. Alejandro Lerroux helped bring republicanism to the fore in Catalonia, where poverty was particularly acute. Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909. After the First World War, the working class, the industrial class, and the military united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful. Fears of communism grew. A military coup brought Miguel Primo de Rivera to power in 1923, and he ran Spain as a military dictatorship. Support for his regime gradually <b>faded,</b> <b>and</b> he resigned in January 1930. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities, and King Alfonso XIII abdicated; the Second Spanish Republic was formed, whose power would remain until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War. Monarchists would continue to oppose the Republic.|$|E
5|$|York were {{fourth in}} the table 12 matches into 1969–70. Their {{promotion}} challenge <b>faded</b> <b>and</b> they finished the season 13th. York reached the fourth round of the FA Cup {{for the first time}} since 1958, and played two Second Division teams; after beating Cardiff City 3–1 at St Andrew's in a second replay, they lost 4–1 to Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park. Barry Jackson, who made a club-record 539 appearances for York, was released at the end of the season. York started 1970–71 strongly, and after faltering midseason they went unbeaten in 16 consecutive matches to enter the top four. Despite losing three of their last four fixtures, York remained in fourth place to earn a third promotion. They also reached the FA Cup fourth round for the second successive season; after drawing 3–3 at home to First Division team Southampton they were beaten 3–2 in the replay at the Dell. York started 1971–72 with three wins from eight matches, but after failing to win in 11 consecutive matches they dropped into the bottom four. They finished 19th on goal average and avoided relegation. In the third round of the League Cup, York played First Division team Sheffield United, losing 3–1 at Bramall Lane. York failed to win any of their first 11 matches in 1972–73, but results improved and they were 10th in the table by early March 1973. Another downturn in form followed before York beat Rotherham United in the last match of the season to finish 18th, avoiding relegation from the Third Division on goal average for the second successive year.|$|E
