The cooling method, pretension element method and tightening method {{used in the}} simulation were analyzed for their computing principle and application situation.

40|$|Within a multi-fastener <b>joint,</b> <b>fastener</b> holes may be {{subjected}} to the combined effects of bearing loads and loads that bypass the hole to be reacted elsewhere in the joint. The analysis of a joint subjected to search combined bearing and bypass loads {{is complicated by the}} usual clearance between the hole and the fastener. A simple analysis method for such clearance-fit joints subjected to bearing-bypass loading has been developed in the present study. It uses an inverse formulation with a linear elastic finite-element analysis. Conditions along the bolt-hole contact arc are specified by displacement constraint equations. The present method is simple to apply and can be implemented with most general purpose finite-element programs since it does not use complicated iterative-incremental procedures. The method was used to study the effects of bearing-bypass loading on bolt-hole contact angles and local stresses. In this study, a rigid, frictionless bolt was used with a plate having the properties of a quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy laminate. Results showed that the contact angle as well as the peak stresses around the hole and their locations were strongly influenced by the ratio of bearing and bypass loads. For single contact, tension and compression bearing-bypass loading had opposite effects on the contact angle. For some compressive bearing-bypass loads, the hole tended to close on the fastener leading to dual contact. It was shown that dual contact reduces the stress concentration at the fastener and would, therefore, increase joint strength in compression. The results illustrate the general importance of accounting for bolt-hole clearance and contact to accurately compute local bolt-hole stresses for combined bearings and bypass loading...|$|E

30|$|Various {{mechanical}} fasteners {{are used}} in timber constructions alone or combined with other fasteners to resist loads and external forces. Timber <b>joints</b> with <b>fasteners</b> of each kind have their unique load–displacement characteristics, which {{make it difficult to}} evaluate the design resistance of combined joints with different kinds of fasteners by a common standard method.

50|$|In {{critical}} <b>fastener</b> <b>joints,</b> embedment {{can mean}} loss of preload. Flattening of a surface allows {{the strain of}} a screw to relax, which in turn correlates with a loss in tension and thus preload. In bolted joints with particularly short grip lengths, the loss of preload due to embedment can be especially significant, causing complete loss of preload. Therefore, embedment can lead directly to loosening of a <b>fastener</b> <b>joint</b> and subsequent fatigue failure.|$|R

These joints are comprised of high-strength steel fasteners and abutments constructed of aluminum alloys familiar to the aerospace industry. A general analytical expression was first arrived at which relates bolt-hole clearance to the bolt shear load required to place all <b>joint</b> <b>fasteners</b> into a shear transferring position. Extension of this work allowed the analytical development of joint load capability {{as a function of the}} number of fasteners, shear strength of the bolt, bolt-hole clearance, and the desired factor of safety.

40|$|The Finite Element Method (FEM) {{has made}} a number of {{otherwise}} intractable problems solvable. An important aspect for achieving an economical and accurate solution through FEM is matching the formulation and the computational organisation to the problem. This was realised forcefully in the present case of the solution of a class of moving contact boundary value problems of <b>fastener</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper deals with the problem of changing contact at the pin-hole interface of a <b>fastener</b> <b>joint.</b> Due to moving contact, the stresses and displacements are nonlinear with load. This would, in general, need an interactive-incremental approach for solution. However, by posing the problem in an inverse way, a solution is sought for obtaining loads to suit given contact configuration. Numerical results are given for typical isotropic and composite plates with rigid pins. Two cases of loading are considered: (i) load applied only {{at the edges of the}} plate and (ii) load applied at the pin and reacted at a part of the edge of the plate. Load-contact relationships, compliance and stress-patterns are investigated. This paper clearly demonstrates the simplification achieved by a suitable formulation of the problem. The results are of significance to the design and analysis of <b>fastener</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
50|$|Joinery {{is a part}} of {{woodworking}} {{that involves}} joining together pieces of timber or lumber, to produce more complex items.

The characteristics of wooden joints - strength, flexibility, toughness, appearance, etc. - derive from the properties of the materials involved and the purpose of the joint. Therefore, different joinery techniques are used to meet differing requirements.

50|$|The {{stress and}} shear in a rivet is {{analyzed}} like a bolted joint. However, {{it is not}} wise to combine rivets with bolts and screws in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other fasteners. The result is that rivets in the same <b>joint</b> with loose <b>fasteners</b> carry more of the load—they are effectively more stiff. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose fit fasteners like bolts and screws. This often causes catastrophic failure of the <b>joint</b> when the <b>fasteners</b> unzip. In general, a joint composed of similar fasteners is the most efficient because all fasteners reach capacity simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|Predicting the {{mechanical}} behaviour {{and the failure}} mechanism of timber <b>joints</b> with dowel-type <b>fasteners</b> requires consideration of several factors, including the geometrical and mechanical properties of the metal fastener, the physical properties of timber and the interaction between such elements. This paper proposes a numerical model where a joint is schematized as an elasto-plastic beam in a non-linear medium with a compression-only behaviour. Unlike the differential approach adopted {{by most of the}} hysteresis models published in literature, this model predicts the load-displacement response using simple mechanical relationships and basic input parameters. Furthermore, the model is capable of reproducing the effect of the cavity formed around the fastener by timber crushing, and simulates the hysteretic behaviour and the energy dissipation under cyclic conditions. Shear tests are reproduced on nailed steel-to-timber joints in Cross-Laminated Timber and results are compared to the experimental test data obtained on similar single <b>fastener</b> <b>joints.</b> Simulations lead to accurate predictions of both {{the mechanical}} behaviour (initial stiffness, maximum load-carrying capacity, global shape of the loading curve and of the hysteresis cycles) and the total energy dissipation observed in the tests...|$|R

The thickness of the walls is 70-80 cm. There are different ornaments and initials (that could belong to the builder) on the small stones stowed inside the outer wall mortar. The renovation {{done in the last}} few years has somewhat changed the exterior look of the building.

Despite {{the influence that}} the long-term behaviour of joints has on the mechanical behaviour of a timber–concrete structure and consequently on its design, {{there is still a}} lack of research in this area. This paper presents experimental research, carried out at the University of Coimbra and Delft University of Technology, on seven joint configurations using different types of fasteners and different materials. For each joint configuration, either four or ten tests were performed resulting in a total of forty tests. A comprehensive description of the test specimens and test setup is given. The experimental creep–time curves were fitted to a creep–time model and used to predict joint creep values over longer timeframes (10 and 50 years).

40|$|A new shear {{connection}} {{system was}} tested {{in order to}} be used in off-site manufactured cassette floor elements made with glulam beams and Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels. The shear connection proposed is made with double-sided punched metal plate fasteners, connecting CLT and glulam members to form a T-cross-section. Due to the lack of withdrawal capacity of punched metal plate fasteners, the shear connection must be secured with screws to resist separations forces which may occur between the members in the floor element. Shear tests were performed on glulam-CLT joints made with double-sided punched metal plate fasteners and with inclined self-tapping screws as reference cases to compare to <b>joints</b> with both <b>fastener</b> types combined. Each fastener type is characterised by a specific load-slip curve and different values for the yield slip, slip at maximum load and failure slip. These parameters can be used to evaluate the compatibility of the different fasteners and their combined effect in a joint. The test results show that there is a significant contribution from both the double-sided punched metal plate and inclined screw fasteners to the strength and stiffness of the combined joints. Due {{to the fact that the}} individual fasteners reach their maximum load for different slip values, the load-carrying capacity of <b>joints</b> with combined <b>fasteners</b> is somewhat lower than the sum of the individual fasteners load-carrying capacities.

In comparison with fastened hybrid <b>joints,</b> <b>fastener</b> free hybrid <b>joints</b> exhibit advantages in terms of joint weight reduction and a more uniformly distributed stress field within the joint. The metal-thermoplastic composite co-consolidation technique shows potential for manufacturing those <b>fastener</b> free hybrid <b>joints</b> in an economic manner. In this technique, the metal parts are essentially co-consolidated with fibre reinforced thermoplastic composite prepreg. The thermoplastic resin present in the prepreg is thus used for bonding and no additional adhesives are employed. However, there is far less understanding {{of the performance of}} metal-thermoplastic composite interfaces as a crucial factor affecting the strength of the entire co-consolidated metal-thermoplastic composite hybrid joint. The performance of the metal-thermoplastic composite interface is governed by a variety of factors, which are promoted by introducing various bonding mechanisms: mechanical interlocking between metal and thermoplastic composite, physical attraction between metal and thermoplastic composite, and chemical bonding between metal and thermoplastic composite. In addition, the thermal residual stress in adherends generated during the consolidation process can impair the interfacial performance. Therefore, with a view to optimising the performance of the interface, the investigation of the effectiveness of these governing factors is significant. The metal-thermoplastic composite hybrid joints studied in this thesis employ grade 5 titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) as the metal component, while the composite components are from the carbon fibre reinforced polyaryletherketone (C/PAEK) family. In this thesis, the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance and the governing factors between titanium and C/PAEK are investigated in the following aspects: • Suitable experimental approaches to evaluate the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance, namely mandrel peel test, have been developed and critically assessed. • The mandrel peel test is subsequently employed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} factors governing the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance. Furthermore, the bonding mechanisms activated by these factors are elaborately investigated by experimental approaches. • The aforementioned experimental approach shows that the mechanical interlocking between titanium and thermoplastic composite is an important factor in the interfacial performance. Therefore a theoretical study, including analytical and numerical models, is carried out to enhance the understanding of the effectiveness of mechanical interlocking on the interfacial performance. In order to apply the co-consolidation technique in practice, the effectiveness of the interfacial performance governing factors on the strength of co-consolidated Ti-C/PAEK joints is further studied. Finally, a guideline for fabricating Ti-C/PAEK hybrid joints by the co-consolidation technique, focusing in particular on optimising the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance of the hybrid joints, is proposed at the end of this thesis...|$|R
