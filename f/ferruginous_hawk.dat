Twined sandals, and bones from the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W.

25|$|The natural area, {{which has}} been named as an Important Bird Area, is studded with cliffs and eroded {{sandstone}} badlands that serve as important nesting and foraging habitat to the area's raptors. Important birds of prey are the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> (Buteo regalis), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), and burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), of which the burrowing owl and <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> are considered endangered in Alberta, and the prairie falcon, a species of special concern. Raptor populations have experienced rebounds since the 1970s when the insecticide DDT was outlawed, but new concerns about other pesticides and PCBs along with habitat degradation and land use conversion are contributing to the decline of species such as the burrowing owl. The prairie falcon is at its northern range limit in southern Alberta and although populations appear to be stable at present, loss of grasslands and subsequent decline in their prey of ground squirrels may lead to reduced numbers of falcons. Endemic to western North America, the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> is under threatened status nationally and {{appears to have been}} decreasing in numbers since at least 1987, possibly due to prey availability, or habitat or land use change; subsequently, nest poles have been erected to facilitate nesting. The Milk River is also home to many pond and wetland birds, and the grasslands are sharp-tailed grouse (Pedioecetes phasianellus) dancing grounds, or leks. Sharp-tailed grouse also appear to be declining in Alberta and are considered a sensitive species due to the increase of land-use conversion to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Ecologists {{consider}} this rodent to be a keystone species. They {{are an important}} prey species, being the primary diet in prairie species such as the black-footed ferret, swift fox, golden eagle, American badger, and <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk.</b> Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also rely on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas. Even grazing species, such as plains bison, pronghorn, and mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Milk River itself being an occasional destination for paddle sports, other recreational uses of the area include hunting and camping, which bring their own potential impacts {{on the environment and}} the area's species at risk. Fire especially is a risk from unattended campfires. Close approach by humans to <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> nests will flush them and can eventually cause nest abandonment. Hunting and/or ammunition restrictions could reduce lead poisoning in golden eagles, possibly caused by ingesting lead shot in their prey.|$|E
25|$|Swainson's hawk, the red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis) and the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> (B. regalis) {{compete for}} territory, and defend territories against each other. In {{many parts of}} the plains these three species nest in the same general area and exploit much the same prey base. Although diets overlap greatly, {{habitats}} may not overlap as much. In Oregon, Swainson's hawk selects nesting trees having a different configuration than those used by red-tailed or ferruginous hawks. In southern Alberta, different nesting habitats help reduce food competition, with Swainson's hawk favoring areas with scattered trees or riparian borders, while red-tailed hawks nest in stands of tall trees, and ferruginous hawks nest on the open plains.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{potential}} danger to themselves and their offspring, almost every other type of raptorial bird readily mobs golden eagles. Gyrfalcons, skuas, and Buteos like rough-legged buzzards, which are normally fierce competitors with each other, have worked together to group-mob golden eagles that have passed their adjacent nesting areas. Occasionally smaller raptors, especially large falcons, will drive eagles to the ground. The eagle typically ignores attacks from smaller species or at least leaves their home ranges, but will occasionally roll and extend talons toward chasing individual often without displaying active predatory behavior. If physical contact occurs, it sometimes ends in injury, death and/or consumption of the attacking species. Remarkably, the nest defense by golden eagles themselves is often rather passive towards other raptorial birds, perhaps since other species may fear predation on themselves if they approach a golden eagle territory. There are exceptions to this, however, when particularly bold, large raptorial birds seemingly range too far into a pair's home range. One pair of golden eagles killed but did not eat three great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), implying that they were killed in nest defense and not in predation. In {{one of the few}} cases of a golden eagle killing but not eating another large raptor, an adult golden eagle was observed killing a <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> which apparently came too close to its nest.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 1800s, large herds of bison grazed the area {{until they were}} extirpated by human hunting, and cattle have — to a degree — taken their place as grazers, {{maintaining}} the grassland ecosystem in a mix of grazed and ungrazed patches. Pronghorn (Antilocapra Americana) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are also present on the grasslands along with deer mice, voles, and Richardson's ground squirrel, an important food source for the <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawk</b> and occasional burrow host to the burrowing owl. The formerly extirpated and subsequently reintroduced swift fox (Vulpes velox), currently listed as endangered provincially and downgraded to threatened nationally in 2009, is resident as well. Swift foxes were originally abundant across the prairies, but population declines caused by land use conversion, trapping, hunting, predation by domestic dogs, competition with coyotes, and rodent control programs led to their elimination from Alberta in 1938 and declared extirpated in 1978. The swift fox was reintroduced to Canada in 1983 from the progeny of a captive breeding program using Colorado and South Dakota stock, a controversial but relatively successful initiative. The current population is estimated at 647 foxes in Canada as of 2006, but predation by coyotes and golden eagles {{continues to be a}} limiting factor, with golden eagles causing 75% of the deaths of swift foxes in 1997. In addition, due to their small size and inability to see above tall vegetation, and their avoidance of agricultural lands and the associated chemical spraying which reduces their insect prey, swift foxes appear to be habitat specialists preferring shortgrass native prairie and land use conversion to agriculture is a continued threat. The area's woodland habitat is home to a herd of elk, along with porcupines, cottontail rabbits, and white-tailed deer.|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} {{of humans and}} their related infrastructure is increasing the likelihood that wildlife will interact with humans. When disturbed by humans, animals often change their behaviour, which can result in time and energetic costs to that animal. An animal's decision to change behaviour is likely related {{to the type of}} disturbance, the individual's past experience with disturbance, and the landscape in which the disturbance occurs. In southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, we quantified probability of flight initiation from the nest by <b>Ferruginous</b> <b>Hawks</b> (Buteo regalis) during approaches to nests by investigators. We tested if probability of flight was related to different disturbance types, previous experience, and the anthropogenic landscape in which individual <b>Ferruginous</b> <b>Hawks</b> nested. Probability of flight was related to the type of approach by the investigator, the number of previous visits by investigators, and the vehicular traffic around the nest. Approaches by humans on foot resulted in a greater probability of flight than those in a vehicle. Approaches in a vehicle via low traffic volume access roads were related to increased probability of flight relative to other road types. The number of previous investigator approaches to the nest increased the probability of flight. Overall, we found support that <b>Ferruginous</b> <b>Hawks</b> show habituation to vehicles and the positive reinforcement hypotheses as probability of flight was negatively related to an index of traffic activity near the nest.

We also tested correlations of territory re-occupancy with oil and gas infrastructure-a leading cause of habitat modification throughout the range of this species of conservation concern. Probability of re-occupancy was not related to any covariates we investigated in 2011, had a strong negative relationship with cover of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) in 2012, was slightly higher for territories with artificial platforms than other nest substrates in 2013, and had a positive relationship with abundance of ground squirrels (Urocitellus spp.) that was strong in 2012 and weak in 2013. Associations with roads were weak and varied by year, road-type, and scale: in 2012, re-occupancy probability had a weak positive correlation with density of roads not associated with oil and gas fields at the territory-scale; however, in 2013 re-occupancy had a very weak negative correlation with density of oil and gas field roads near nest sites (≤ 500 m). Although our results indicate re-occupancy of breeding territories by <b>ferruginous</b> <b>hawks</b> was compatible with densities of anthropogenic infrastructure in our study area, the lack of relationships between oil and gas well density and territory re-occupancy may have occurred because pre-treatment data were unavailable.
