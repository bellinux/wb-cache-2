40|$|Description of Transaction/Event 1. An entity {{may issue}} its own equity {{instruments}} (e. g. shares) as purchase consideration when acquiring an asset. Paragraph 6. 1 of Accounting Standards AASB 1015 and AAS 21 “Acquisitions of Assets ” requires an acquisition {{to be measured}} at {{the cost to the}} acquiring entity. In determining the cost of acquisition, the Standards require equity instruments issued by the acquirer to be measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition. 2. Both AASB 1015 and AAS 21 require that, where an entity or operation is acquired, any difference between the cost of acquisition and the aggregate fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (less, where applicable, the aggregate fair value of the identifiable liabilities assumed) must be accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards AASB 1013 and AAS 18 “Accounting for Goodwill”. 3. The determination of the fair value of equity instruments issued in an acquisition and, therefore, the purchase consideration, has a direct effect on the calculation of any goodwill or <b>discount</b> <b>on</b> <b>acquisition,</b> where an entity or business operation is acquired. 4. Current Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements provide limited guidance on the factors that should be taken into account in determining the fair value of equity instruments which are issued as purchase consideration, particularly those that are not traded in an active and liquid market. 5. Concern has been expressed that, in the absence of authoritative guidance, diverse or unacceptable accounting practices may be applied in determining the fair value of equity instruments issued as purchase consideration (and thus the amount of goodwill or <b>discount</b> <b>on</b> <b>acquisition),</b> and that this will undermine the relevance and reliability of general purpose financial reports...|$|E

30|$|The most {{intriguing}} result {{in this study}} was that the direct and indirect influences of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived apparel quality were both significant, but opposite in direction, resulting in an insignificant total effect. The results of the negative direct effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality may explain why some previous researchers have found a negative effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality (Garretson and Clow 1999), while the results of the positive indirect effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality may explain why some other researchers have found a positive effect (Huang et al. 2014; Rungtrakulchai 2013). In addition, the total effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality was not significant in this study because the opposite direct and indirect effects cancelled each other out. The phenomenon that direct and indirect effects are in opposite directions is referred to as competitive mediation (Shrout and Bolger 2002). These results may explain why a previous study (Grewal et al. 1998 a) found that price discounts had no significant influence on perceived quality.|$|R
