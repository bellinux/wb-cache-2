500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “It's {{hard for}} me to {{describe}} the joy I felt after <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> rode wave in for the first time after the attack. I was incredibly thankful and happy inside. The tiny bit of doubt that would sometimes tell me you'll never surf again was gone in one wave.” –Bethany Hamilton ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramović described it later: [...] "What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{a strange}} social experiment, to be {{responsible}} for all that. It made me self-conscious, which, inherently, I'm not. People would say, [...] "I'm sick of boho", <b>and</b> now <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> say, [...] "But I liked those clothes - it's not my fault that they were copied, you wore them and now you're sick of them. Also, I did not start the trend.".|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm back," [...] he said again. [...] "I've had a beastly time. By God! I came steerage. I've {{got nothing}} but what <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> in, <b>and</b> that bag." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{would not}} have this. [...] "It matters a good deal," [...] he replied with hot resentment, [...] "and it won't happen so long as <b>I</b> can <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> shove a hoe." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ja’far’s widow Asma recalled: “God’s Messenger {{came to me}} and asked, ‘Where are Jafar’s children?’ I {{brought them}} to him and he embraced them and smelled them, then his eyes welled up and he cried. ‘O God’s Messenger,’ I asked, ‘Have you heard {{something}} about Jafar?’ ‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘He was killed today.’ <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, ‘O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!’” Her son Abdullah remembered: “He said, ‘O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja’far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!’” Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatima, “Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for they are preoccupied today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{travelers}} {{described what}} they saw during the attack to reporters. One man stated, [...] "We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 meters away from him." [...] He continued, [...] "We ducked behind a ticket counter but <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting." [...] Lastly he said [...] "He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously {{to see if anyone}} was going to stop him and then went down the escalator ... We heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lucifer. [...] Let it pass! [...] No more, thou Gabriel! What if <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> [...] <b>And</b> strike my brow {{against the}} {{crystalline}} [...] Roofing the creatures,--shall I say, for that, [...] My stature {{is too high}} for me to stand,-- [...] Henceforward I must sit? Sit thou! ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked like}} a Queen stooping to plead. My love for her grew <b>and</b> grew. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> beside her; <b>and</b> {{took her hand and}} said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, no; nothing," [...] Bertram responded cheerfully. [...] "Not a sack to my back. I've {{only what}} <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> in. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> called this morning just to ask as I passed {{if you could}} kindly direct me to an emporium in London where I could set myself up in all that's necessary." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked eagerly in all directions. Not a {{craft of}} any kind was to be seen.|$|E
60|$|I did not trouble {{about any}} civilities. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> asked point blank a {{question}} that came into my head.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> uttered that {{challenge}} aloud in my madness. My voice echoed mournfully up the aisles, {{and the sound}} of the echo chilled me, yet my purpose gathered strength.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, Luka, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> have a look. Yes, {{it is as}} much as {{they will}} do to cut us off. They did not {{calculate}} on our coming along so fast. I will luff up a little more, and we shall pass ahead of them however hard they paddle." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus, I {{knew that}} voice, I heard it, and I {{could not help}} the [...] hearkening: [...] In the room <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> blindly, <b>and</b> my burning heart within [...] Seemed to seethe and fuse my senses till they ran on all sides [...] darkening, [...] And scorched, weighed like melted metal round my feet that stood [...] therein.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] <b>I</b> cried, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> laid my hand {{upon her}} arm, [...] "Tell me {{what is it}} you mean to do. What do you mean to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{staggered}} toward them, and in {{a moment}} my hands went out of water, just {{at the side of the}} scow. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> my head with half my body came up into the air.|$|E
60|$|I was {{recovering}} from the stupefaction into which my sudden emotions had plunged me, when a hail came across the water, first in Mary Phillips's natural voice, and then through a speaking-trumpet. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> answered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Presently I {{thought what}} a fool I {{was to get}} wet. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked round me. A colossal figure, carved {{apparently}} in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else {{of the world was}} invisible.|$|E
60|$|I {{was as much}} {{moved as}} he. ‘I could almost beg you to do otherwise,’ I said. ‘I was a brute to come to you, a brute and a coward. You are a noble enemy; you will make a noble soldier.’ And with rather a happy idea of a {{compliment}} for this warlike youth, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> straight <b>and</b> gave him the salute.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> booted <b>and</b> {{ready to}} descend, {{there came a}} gentle tap at my door, and, in answer to my [...] "Enter," [...] there stood before me a very dainty and foppish figure. I stared hard at the effeminate face and the long fair locks of my visitor, {{thinking}} that I had become the dupe of my eyes.|$|R
5|$|The {{first song}} came on <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> kind of {{walked into the}} other room as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly I heard a whistle. Never {{was sound}} so sweet. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> peered eagerly shoreward. Coming around the [...] "Hole in the Wall" [...] headland, {{on top of}} the cliffs, I saw a boy and a dog. I sent a wild halloo ringing shoreward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] said Tony; [...] "easy enough. I hadn't nuthin to row {{with but}} a bit o' pole, and I got a sorter cross a-gettin' along so slow, and so <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> gin a big push, and one foot slipped, an' over she went." ...|$|E
6000|$|Something {{that was}} like fear beatified came into my heart. It was all right, I knew; but to be alone! <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> met the hot summons of the rising sun, hurrying towards me, as it were, with glad tidings, over the spikes of the barley. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|I {{was as much}} {{moved as}} he. [...] "I could almost beg you to do otherwise," [...] I said. [...] "I was a brute to come to you, a brute and a coward.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> {{beside him}} <b>and</b> looked out. I {{was a little}} flushed, my ears a little reddened, by the {{inconvenience}} of my curiosities, and by my uneasy sense of profound moral differences. He was taller than I. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "I has. And now if {{it be that}} I {{must speak}} before a third party, Mr. Trewillian, I'm ready. It ain't that I'm no ways ashamed. I've done my duty, and {{knows how to do}} it. And let a counsel be ever so sharp, I never yet was so 'posed but what <b>I</b> could <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> hold my own. The Colonel, Mr. Trewillian, got,--a letter,--from your lady,--this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took off}} my gloves, laid them on the seat, and went over all my pockets again. It was not there. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> shook myself, and then looked on the floor. The car was full of people, who were going home from the opera, and they all stared at me, but I was past caring for a little thing like that.|$|E
60|$|The boat {{touched the}} bank. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{carefully}} headed my fish toward the shore, and slid {{his head and}} shoulders out on the lily-pads. One moment he lay there, glowing like mother-of-pearl, a rare fish, fresh from the sea. Then, as Attalano warily reached for the leader, he gave a gasp, a flop that deluged us with muddy water, and a lunge that spelled freedom.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{sent away}} his gentleman, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> offered {{to wait on}} his Highness while he ate; but he {{positively}} refused, and told me, [...] "No; to-morrow you shall be the widow of Monsieur ----, the jeweller, but to-night you shall be my mistress; therefore sit here," [...] says he, [...] "and eat with me, or I will get up and serve." ...|$|E
60|$|A last leap and I {{was in the}} {{depression}} below our handkerchief, a stride, and <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> on our former vantage point within arms' reach of it. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> straight <b>and</b> scanned the world about me, between its lengthening bars of shadow. Far away, down a long declivity, was {{the opening of the}} tunnel up which we had fled, and my shadow reached towards it, stretched towards it, and touched it, like a finger of the night.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wanted to}} kill that bitter pain of suspicion. I thought if <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> before them <b>and</b> cried out that my trust in you was so great, I was willing to marry you {{notwithstanding}} everything--I should at last have peace in my heart.' ...|$|R
50|$|This {{maneuver}} {{prevented the}} regiment from being attacked head-on {{by a group}} of Confederate soldiers. As the Confederates passed by the regiment, Private Peter Schwartz of Company <b>I</b> suddenly <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> opened fire on the Confederates. The regiment quickly followed Schwartz's example, completely destroying the extreme left wing of the Confederate advance. Shortly after this success, during a withdrawal ordered by General Kearny, Col William Brown was shot through the temple by a Confederate sharpshooter. Maj. Wheeler assumed command of the regiment.|$|R
