5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E
25|$|The fall of Jerusalem, and {{the death}} of Sibylla at the Siege of Acre in 1190, led to a dispute over the throne of the kingdom. Balian's {{stepdaughter}} Isabella was now rightful queen, but Guy refused to concede his title, and Isabella's husband Humphrey—who <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> cause down in 1186—remained loyal to him. If Isabella were to succeed, she needed a politically acceptable and militarily competent husband, the obvious candidate being Conrad of Montferrat, who also had some claim as Baldwin V's paternal uncle. Balian and Maria seized Isabella and talked her into agreeing to a divorce. There were precedents: the annulment of Amalric I's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, and the unsuccessful attempts to force Sibylla to divorce Guy.|$|E
2500|$|When {{confronted by}} Lewis, {{who was also}} woken by the presidential guards that morning, Epstein {{dismissed}} his suggestion and that of Leslie Minford, a chargé d'affaires at the British Embassy, that the Beatles should make an exception for the First Lady of the Philippines. The Beatles were equally adamant; when told by the guards that President Marcos was among the dignitaries awaiting their arrival, Lennon retorted: [...] "Who's he?" [...] The band learned of the offence that Imelda Marcos had taken at their nonappearance while watching television at the hotel before leaving for the first concert. Footage from the palace was broadcast of the empty seats reserved for the four Beatles, children crying in disappointment, and the First Lady saying that the visiting musicians <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> down.|$|E
60|$|Lady Scatcherd {{began to}} declare that she would willingly have got a pony if Mary would <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> alone. I <b>have</b> neither {{spoken to}} her nor written to her. She does not {{mean to say that}} I have troubled her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless the child! why didn't {{she come}} and call? I'd <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> in; though usually I avoid stage-struck girls as I do reporters,' laughed Miss Cameron.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And so {{the poor}} creetur's dead! I'm sorry for it. She warn't a bad-disposed 'ooman, if them shepherds <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> alone. I'm wery sorry for it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is beautiful," [...] said Maggie, who <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> work fall, and was {{listening}} with keen interest. [...] "I never knew any {{one who did}} such things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think anything's queer but you!" [...] Delia had retorted; and she <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> father {{know that}} she had left Francie in {{the very act of}} [...] "handling" [...] Mr. Flack.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't <b>'ave</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> in, only she's {{been three}} times, {{and she seemed}} that upset at not finding you, so I told her she could wait." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANKLYN. I <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> alone; {{and look}} at the result! Like all the other young people who <b>have</b> been <b>let</b> alone, she becomes a Socialist. That is, she becomes hopelessly demoralized.|$|R
6000|$|Herrero laughed maliciously. [...] "She {{is not for}} sale. You {{should not}} <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> slip through your fingers. It is {{possible}} you could have made terms with Lamartine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{they seem}} to suspect the {{neighborhood}} of the occupants of the cabin?" [...] asked Margery, when the bee-hunter <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> know {{the manner in which}} the savages had taken possession of her late dwelling.|$|E
60|$|Allie's legs {{began to}} grow weak under her. The strain, the suspense, the longing grew {{to be too much}} for her and occasioned a revulsion of feeling. She <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> hopes carry her too high.|$|E
6000|$|... "I owe to her all {{the charity}} and {{tenderness}} I know. She taught it to me in those months. I might have learned more if I <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go on teaching. It {{was the only way}} she knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is safe, {{reading to}} Mrs. Coffinkey," [...] said Ellen. [...] "I {{did not know}} Robert was at home, or I should not <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> come without me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{are we to}} {{get food}} then?" [...] rejoined his wife; [...] "you ought not to <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> leave us. You do nothing, Warner. You get no wages yourself; and you <b>have</b> <b>let</b> the girl escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Gibson {{looked into}} Camilla's face doubtingly, inquisitively, almost piteously. [...] "You <b>had</b> better <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go on," [...] said Camilla. [...] "She {{will make a}} great many mistakes, no doubt, but you <b>had</b> better <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{go on to the}} end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Annie, {{and with}} a thrill of dismay she asked herself how much she <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> manner betray that she had {{supposed}} he was a book agent. [...] "I shall be very glad indeed, Mr. Brandreth." ...|$|E
60|$|At about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather pale, and {{somewhat}} wretched. He was miserable, {{though he did}} not know it, because he <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go alone. Since she had gone, he had not enjoyed his wakes.|$|E
6000|$|Tom <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go on {{with her}} short gentle sentences, because he knew not how to answer; but at last she said, 'Forgive me, and do not think of it, if I have asked what I ought not, or would be troublesome.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} I would have done," [...] said Mrs. Crowder, her eyes very bright; [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> kill me. I {{would never have}} consented for thee to marry the wretch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{never said}} {{anything}} against you. Do you think I would <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her?</b> No; it was I that said it, and I blamed you. It was because I thought that you were--you were--" ...|$|R

6000|$|Norman {{yielded the}} point rather reluctantly. He gave Faith an {{exciting}} drive home, behind his wild two-year old, {{and when he}} <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> out at the kitchen door of the manse and dumped his cargo on the back veranda he drove away shouting, ...|$|E
6000|$|Roderick {{turned his}} head slowly and looked at her. He <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> take his hand, which she pressed tenderly between her own. He gazed at her for some time in silence. [...] "Poor mother!" [...] he said at last, in a portentous tone.|$|E
6000|$|The book Mrs. Meyrick {{had before}} her was Erckmann-Chatrian's Historie d'un Conscrit. She had just {{finished}} reading it aloud, and Mab, who <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> work fall on the ground while she stretched her head forward and fixed {{her eyes on the}} reader, exclaimed-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{a double}} misfortune," [...] she replied, evenly. [...] "It's too bad both came at once. It {{seems to me}} if I were a cowboy and--and felt so toward a girl, I'd <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But you shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her.</b> That's {{the only}} way with these fanciful women that chaw high--innocent or guilty. She'd have come round in time. We all do! Custom does it! It's all {{the same in the}} end! However, I think she's fond of her man still--whatever he med be of her. You were too quick about <b>her.</b> I shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go! I should have kept her chained on--her spirit for kicking would have been broke soon enough! There's nothing like bondage and a stone-deaf taskmaster for taming us women. Besides, you've got the laws on your side. Moses knew. Don't you call to mind what he says?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, say, I wish I could <b>'ve</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> know I {{was going}} earlier, Miss Zapp. I didn't know it myself, {{but it does}} seem like a mean trick. I s'pose I ought to pay her {{something}} extra." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has made}} a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and the dear little soul shall have a jolly time {{in spite of her}} fuss and feathers. But I do wish she <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> hair alone and worn that pretty hat of hers." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} the tent and Carrie smiled at the others. Jim was {{conscious}} of keen relief {{and a touch of}} annoyance. Although Carrie had saved the situation, he <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> undertake an awkward task that was properly his. Then the surveyor came back and gave her a document.|$|E
60|$|It its {{unnecessary}} here {{to repeat}} the moral persuasion which Virginia used to get her aunt up and dressed. That lady, when she had heard the whistle and the gongs, <b>had</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> imagination loose. Turning {{her face to the}} wall, she was in the act of repeating her prayers as her niece entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{as long as}} you like; {{she wants}} a rest. I've been talking to Gratian. We oughtn't to <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go on after a shock like that--my fault, I'm afraid. I thought that work might be best." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHORUS [...] Although I {{have heard}} her voice, [...] The pity is that I cannot see her. [...] And I <b>have</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go by [...] Without divulging my name. [...] This {{is the true}} love of a father.|$|R
