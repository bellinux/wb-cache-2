Diffusion of water within the polymer, as measured by gravimetry, {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the Carter and Kibler model. Physical properties decreased with increasing water content. A correlation was found between the decrease of bulk and adhesive joint properties. Fracture surfaces have also been explained using the Carter and Kibler model. Given the various types of failure, the extent of each depending on time of immersion, a simple model is proposed to estimate overall energy of adhesion, G* (an effective average linked to three distinct types of failure), as a function of ageing time...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, and Fe 3 + ions and glucuronic acid on the viscosity, after dry or <b>humid</b> <b>ageing,</b> of two different cellulosic materials, cotton linters and dissolving pulp. The quantity of added metal ions {{was similar to that}} found in pulp. In the cotton linters sheets, especially in those containing Mg 2 +, increased 5 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl furfural (HMF) and 2 -furaldehyde (furfural) concentrations were accompanied by decreased viscosity under dry conditions at 180 C (pH 5). This indicates that Mg 2 + ions can promote the Lewis-acidcatalyzed degradation of cellulose. For cotton linters and dissolving pulp sheets, adding Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions is detrimental when ageing at 180 C under dry conditions (pH 5). Adding glucuronic acid increases the viscosity of cotton linters sheets, especially when Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions are present. Due to formation of complexes between the Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions and glucuronic acid, these ions reduce pulp viscosity to a smaller degree...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to identify the 3 D behaviour of an adhesive in an assembly, and {{to take into account the}} effect of ageing in a marine environment. To that end, three different tests were employed. Gravimetric analyses were used to determine the water diffusion kinetics in the adhesive. Bulk tensile tests were performed to highlight the effects of <b>humid</b> <b>ageing</b> on the adhesive behaviour. Modified Arcan tests were performed for several ageing times to obtain the experimental database which was necessary to identify constitutive models. A Mahnken–Schlimmer type model was determined for the unaged state according to a procedure developed in a previous study. This identification used inverse techniques. It was based on the unaged modified Arcan results and on a coupling between an optimisation routine and finite-element analysis. Then, a global inverse identification procedure was developed. Its aim was to relate the unaged parameters to the moisture concentration and overcome the difficulties usually associated with ageing of bonded assemblies in a humid environment: a non-uniformity of the stress state and a gradient of mechanical properties in the adhesive. This procedure was similar to the one used in the first part but needed modified Arcan results for several ageing times. It also required an initial assumption for the evolution of the Mahnken–Schlimmer parameters with the moisture concentration...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} aging at 580 °C in wet air (<b>humid</b> <b>aging)</b> on the oxygen adsorption {{on the surface of}} SnO 2 particles, the electric properties and the sensor response to hydrogen in dry and humid atmospheres for SnO 2 resistive-type gas sensors were evaluated. The electric resistance in dry and wet atmospheres at 350 °C was strongly increased by <b>humid</b> <b>aging.</b> From the results of oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electric resistance, the oxygen adsorption equilibrium constants (K 1; for O− adsorption, K 2; for O 2 − adsorption) were estimated {{on the basis of the}} theoretical model of oxygen adsorption. The K 1 and K 2 in dry and wet atmospheres at 350 °C were increased by <b>humid</b> <b>aging</b> at 580 °C, indicating an increase in the adsorption amount of both O− and O 2 −. These results suggest that hydroxyl poisoning on the oxygen adsorption is suppressed by <b>humid</b> <b>aging.</b> The sensor response to hydrogen in dry and wet atmosphere at 350 °C was clearly improved by <b>humid</b> <b>aging.</b> Such an improvement of the sensor response seems to be caused by increasing the oxygen adsorption amount. Thus, the <b>humid</b> <b>aging</b> offers an effective way to improve the sensor response of SnO 2 resistive-type gas sensors in dry and wet atmospheres...|$|R

40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} reaction mechanism of phosphite antioxidants is investigated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The phosphites were chosen because they differed in chemical structure and phosphorus content. Dopant assisted-atmospheric pressure photoionization (DA-APPI) is {{chosen as the}} ion source for (lie ionization of the compounds. [it our previous work, DA-APPI was shown to offer an attractive alternative to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) since it provided background-ion free mass spectra and higher sensitivity [M. Papanastasiou, et al., Polymer Degradation and Stability 91 (11) (2006) 2675 - 2682]. In positive ion mode, the molecules are generally detected in their protonated form. In negative ion mode, the phosphites are unstable and only fragment ions are observed: these however, are characteristic of each phosphite and {{may be used for}} the identification of the analytes in complex mixtures. The analytes under investigation are exposed to accelerated <b>humid</b> <b>ageing</b> conditions and their hydrolytic pathway and stability is investigated. Different substituents around the phosphorus atom are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the stability of the phosphites, with phenol substituents producing very hydrolytically stable structures. Alkanox P 24 and PEP- 36 follow a similar hydrolytic pathway via the scission of the first and then the second P-O-phenol bonds, eventually leading to the formation of phenol, Phosphorous acid and pentaerythritol as end products. HP- 10 exhibits a rather different Structure and the products detected suggest scission of either the P-O-hydrocarbon or one of the P-O-phenol bonds. A phenomenon similar to that of autocatalysis is observed for all phosphites and is attributed to the formation of dialkyl phosphites as intermediate products. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{influence}} of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Fe 3 + ions and glucuronic acid {{on the dry}} and humid heat-induced (120  180 C) discoloration of cotton linter sheets was investigated. The quantity of the added metal ions {{was similar to that}} of metal ions found in wood and pulp. Heat-induced ageing (120  150 C, pH 5) under dry conditions caused only slight discoloration of the reference sheets and of the sheets impregnated with the metal ions. However, during ageing at 180 C, the presence of Mg 2 + ions accelerated the discoloration. An initial pH in the range of 3  8 had no great influence on the discoloration of the reference sheets, but a low pH in combination with Mg 2 + ions increased the discoloration drastically. Under <b>humid</b> <b>ageing</b> conditions at 180 C (< 30 min), the sheets discolored approximately twice as much as under dry conditions; the difference in discoloration caused by the metal ions was less than in dry ageing. Adding glucuronic acid to the sheets caused extensive discoloration under dry ageing conditions (120  180 °C), while Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions decreased the glucuronic acid induced discoloration. Under humid conditions (180 °C), however, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ions did not prevent the discoloration caused by glucuronic acid. An increase in the absorption coefficient was observed at 285 nm, most likely due to the formation of 5 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-furaldehyde (HMF) and 2 -furaldehyde (furfural). GC-MS analysis reveals increased formation of HMF in the sheets impregnated with Mg 2 + ions. Degradation of the cellulose in which the alkaline earth metals act as Lewis acids is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho foi investigado o mecanismo de fotodegradação de polímeros e também a ação de agentes estabilizantes. Foi investigada a degradação oxidativa de polímeros solúveis em água como poli(vinilpirrolidona), PVP; poli(acrilamida), PAM e poli(etilenoglicol), PEG na presença de peróxido de hidrogênio, reagente de Fenton e sal de ferro. O PVP apresentou a menor fotoestabilidade enquanto a PAM apresentou a maior fotoestabilidade. O sal de ferro não promoveu a degradação. As soluções de PEG foram fotooxidadas com os sistemas UV/H 2 O 2, Fenton e foto-Fenton e as amostras foram analisadas por GPC e HPLC. A análise por GPC das soluções de PEG mostrou que em todas as condições oxidativas usadas, a fotooxidação leva a uma queda acentuada da Mw, caracterizando um mecanismo de quebra de cadeia aleatório. Para os três sistemas usados, a polidispersidade aumenta após a degradação, confirmando o mecanismo de quebra aleatória de cadeia. As medidas de GPC também mostraram que a velocidade de degradação é muito maior com o sistema foto-Fenton (kd = 1, 010 - 4 mol. g- 1. min- 1), seguida pelo sistema UV/H 2 O 2 (kd = 3, 610 - 5 mol. g- 1. min- 1). O uso do reagente de Fenton apresentou a menor velocidade de degradação (kd = 1, 110 - 6 mol. g- 1. min- 1). Os produtos de degradação do PEG, nos três sistemas analisados, foram analisados por HPLC, sendo identificados produtos de menor peso {{molecular}}, entre eles, EG, 2 EG, 3 EG, 4 EG, e os ácidos glicólico e fórmico. O mecanismo envolve um processo consecutivo em que os etilenoglicóis de maior peso molecular dão origem aos de menor peso molecular. Etilenoglicóis de cadeia curta foram usados com sucesso como moléculas modelo para prever o mecanismo de fotodegradação do PEG. Fenóis primários combinados com antioxidantes secundários contendo fósforo são os sistemas estabilizantes mais efetivos, amplamente usados na estabilização do processamento e na aplicação de olefinas a longo prazo. O mecanismo de reação de hidrólise dos antioxidantes fosfito, escolhidos para diferenciar na estrutura química e no conteúdo de fósforo, é investigado através da espectrometria de massas. Substituintes diferentes em torno do átomo de fósforo mostram um efeito significativo na estabilidade dos fosfitos com substituintes fenol, produzindo estruturas hidroliticamente estáveis. The aim of {{this work}} was to investigate polymer photodegradation mechanisms and stabilizing agents. The course of photooxidative degradation of some water soluble polymers (poly(vinylpyrrolidone), PVP; poly(acrylamide), PAM and poly(ethylene glycol), PEG) {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide, Fenton reagent and iron salt has been investigated. PVP showed the lowest photostability while PAM had the greatest photostability. Iron salt was not efficient promoting degradation. PEG has been photooxidized in Fenton, photo-Fenton and UV/H 2 O 2 systems. Samples were analysed using GPC and HPLC. GPC analysis of PEG solutions showed that in all oxidizing conditions used, the photooxidation of PEG aqueous solutions leads to an abrupt decrease of Mw, which means that the degradation of PEG implies a random chain scission mechanism. Polydispersity increases after degradation in all the systems used, confirming a random chain scission mechanism. GPC analysis also showed that the rate of degradation is much higher for the photo-Fenton system (kd = 1, 010 - 4 mol. g- 1. min- 1), followed by UV/H 2 O 2 system (kd = 3, 610 - 5 mol. g- 1. min- 1). Fenton reagent has the lowest degradation rate (kd = 1, 110 - 6 mol. g- 1. min- 1). The degradation products of PEG in all oxidizing systems, were analyzed by HPLC and lower molecular weight products were detected, i. e., EG, 2 EG, 3 EG, 4 EG, glycolic and formic acids. The mechanism involved a consecutive process, were the larger ethyleneglycols gave rise, successively, to smaller ones. This suggested that the mechanism involved successive scissions of the polymer chain. Ethyleneglycols were successfully used as model molecules to predict PEGs photodegradation mechanism. Primary hindered phenols in combination with phosphorous-based secondary antioxidants {{are one of the most}} effective stabilizing systems, widely used in the processing stabilization and long-term application of polyolefins. The hydrolysis reaction mechanism of phosphite antioxidants, chosen to differ in chemical structure and phosphorus content, is investigated by mass spectrometric means.

Three composite types - AP-PBAN, AP-Al-PBAN, and AP-(Al-Mg) alloy- PBAN - have been studied. The burning rates of all three propellant types were unaffected by aging. The calorimetric values of composites containing aluminum-magnesium alloy decreased on aging, and the lattice parameter of the alloy decreased to a value close to that of aluminum. Water absorption in all of the samples increased with increases in the temperature, relative humidity, and aging time. The compression strength of the nonmetalized and aluminized samples decreased on aging, whereas that of the composites containing the alloy increased. The latter effect has been traced to reaction of residual carboxyl groups on the polymer chains with magnesium, leading to cross-linking. The reaction between the -COOH groups and magnesium has been proved using infrared spectroscopy. (Author...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} remain an {{integral}} part of providing the world’s propulsion and power generation needs. The continued use of gas turbines requires increased temperature operation to reach higher efficiencies and the implementation of alternative fuels for a lower net-carbon footprint. This necessitates evaluation of the material coatings used to shield the hot section components of gas turbines in these new extreme environments in order to understand how material degradation mechanisms change. Recently, the US Navy has sought to reduce its use of fossil fuels by implementing a blended hydroprocessed renewable diesel (HRD) derived from algae in its fleet. To evaluate the material degradation in this alternative environment, metal alloys are exposed in a simulated combustion environment using this blended fuel or the traditional diesel-like fuel. Evaluation of the metal alloys showed the development of thick, porous scales with a large depletion of aluminum for the blend fuel test. A mechanism linking an increased solubility of the scale to the blend fuel test environment will be discussed. For power generation applications, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants can provide electricity with 45 % efficiency and full carbon capture by using a synthetic gas (syngas) derived from coal, biomass, or another carbon feedstock. However, the combustion of syngas is known to cause high water vapor content levels in the exhaust stream with unknown material consequences. To evaluate the effect of increased humidity, air-plasma sprayed (APS), yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is thermally aged in an environment with and without humidity. An enhanced destabilization of the parent phase by <b>humid</b> <b>aging</b> is revealed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Microstructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning-TEM (STEM) indicate an enhanced coarsening of the domain structure of the YSZ in the humid environment. The enhanced destabilization and coarsening in the <b>humid</b> <b>aging</b> environment is explained mechanistically by water-derived species being incorporated into the YSZ structure and altering the anion sublattice.

40|$|Foams are {{cellular}} structures, {{produced by}} gas bubbles formed during the polyurethane polymerization mixture. Flexible PU foams meet {{the following two}} criteria: have a limited resistance to an applied load, being both permeable to air and reversibly deformable. There are two main types of flexible foams, hot and cold cure foams differing in composition and processing temperatures. The hot cure foams are widely applied and represent the main composition of actual foams, while cold cure foams present several processing and property advantages, e. g, faster demoulding time, better <b>humid</b> <b>aging</b> properties and more versatility, as hardness variation with index changes are greater than with hot cure foams. The processing of cold cure foams also is attractive due to the low energy consumption (mould temperature from 30 degrees to 65 degrees C) comparatively to hot cure foams (mould temperature from 30 degrees to 250 degrees C). Another advantage is the high variety of soft materials for low temperature processing moulds. Cold cure foams are diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) based while hot cure foams are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) based. This study is concerned with Viscoelastic flexible foams MDI based for medical applications. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to characterize the cure kinetics and Dynamical Mechanical Analisys to collect mechanical data. The data obtained from these two experimental procedures were analyzed and associated to establish processing/properties/operation conditions relationships.

30|$|The {{severity}} of simulated aging tests {{is caused by}} the extreme conditions of the treatment, particularly those involving liquid water, such as boiling, soaking, spraying, and vacuum pressure soaking. Therefore, several studies have attempted to use vapor water conditions in their aging tests. Chiu and Biblis [23] and Pu et al. [24] have reported on <b>humid</b> conditions in <b>aging</b> tests over short periods, which involved several hours of cycles that were evaluated using destructive bending tests. However, researchers have recognized a key shortcoming of the destructive testing: once the specimen is broken, it cannot be used again and many specimens are needed to conduct the test. Non-destructive evaluation has been well investigated for wood products, and some (e.g., Zhenbo et al. [25], and Bos and Casagrande [26]) have focused on wood-based panels. Nevertheless, there are few studies that focus on non-destructive evaluations under accelerated aging tests. However, Sun and Arima [27] have performed these tests using particleboard and oriented strandboard as specimens. The specimens were treated with boiling water for 60  min and then evaluated for strength properties and dimensional stability over several time periods. We observed that elongated cycle times with milder aging treatments led to only small losses in the product’s properties. Thus, this method may effectively degrade a product in ways that emulate environmental conditions. Furthermore, using non-destructive test helps to gather information about the degradation behavior of the wood panels {{over the course of the}} treatment.|$|R

Typical HDM species include Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae and Blomia tropicalis. Conventional skin-prick testing (SPT) panels only test for Dermatophagoides. B. tropicalis has been described in the tropical and subtropical regions, but is not routinely tested for in SA. OBJECTIVE. To ascertain the significance of B. tropicalis as an aeroallergen in northern coastal KwaZulu-Natal Province (KZN), a tropical environment, and in Johannesburg in the highveld, where the climate is milder and less <b>humid.</b> METHODS. Children <b>aged</b> 1 - 18 years with features of {{allergic rhinitis}} and/or asthma were recruited over a 6 -month period from Alberlito Hospital in northern KZN and the Clinton Clinic in Johannesburg. SPTs included Dermatophagoides and B. tropicalis. Sensitisation was defined as a wheal 3 mm greater than the negative control. RESULTS. Eighty-five subjects were included, 50 in northern KZN and 35 in the Johannesburg arm; 52 % of subjects in northern KZN and 3 % in Johannesburg were sensitised to B. tropicalis, with a significant difference between these centres (p< 0. 05). Of the 52 % sensitised to B. tropicalis in northern KZN, half were sensitised only to B. tropicalis. CONCLUSION. There is a high prevalence of B. tropicalis allergy in the tropical northern KZN region and a much lower prevalence in the Johannesburg region. Routine testing for B. tropicalis allergy should be employed in northern KZN. [URL]...|$|R

A comparison of the depositional- and tectono-stratigraphy reveal strong similarities, much greater that those shared between the Fundy basin and other rifts in eastern North America. Both the Argana and Fundy basins are comprised of four, mostly unconformity-bound, tectonostratigraphic sequences (TS I-IV) probably controlled by pulses of extension: TS I, is Permian in age and the depositional facies of the Argana basin looks more <b>humid</b> than the <b>age</b> equivalent in the Fundy basin and the latter {{may not be a}} rift sequence; TS II, is early Late Triassic (Carnian) in age and is the most humid looking facies in both basins; TS III, is late Late Triassic (Norian and Rhaetian) in age and is much more arid in both basins with abundant aeolianites and evaporites; TS IV, is latest Triassic and earliest Jurassic (late Rhaetian - early Hettangian) and shows an increase in the range of variability in climate-sensitive facies - its basal part contains the Triassic-Jurassic boundary an overlying basalt flow sequence and additional fluvial and lacustrine strata on top.

40|$|Mediterranean {{wetlands}} are characterised by two factors: (1) {{a remarkable}} seasonal fluctuation {{in the water}} table and (2) {{a long history of}} anthropisation. Being exceptional archives for palaeoenvironmental and archaeological research, humid areas have been thoroughly studied to assess the interplay between people and the environment during the Holocene. We present here the study of a sedimentary sequence from a Mediterranean wetland: the Les Arenes floodplain (Tortosa, NE Spain). Fully dry to date, Les Arenes is documented as a partially drained floodplain in the 12 th century records. With the aim of assessing the climatic and anthropic contribution to its desiccation, we report here the results of bulk sediment analyses, environmental magnetism, soil micromorphology and AMS dating of this sedimentary sequence, plus a review of the available historical records. The outcome is a clearer understanding of the evolution of this Mediterranean floodplain during the 1 st millennium AD, which implications may be extrapolated to other floodplain wetlands in the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean. Wet conditions and a low to medium-energy depositional environment are attested in Les Arenes between the 1 st and 7 th centuries coinciding with the Iberian-Roman Humid Period (IRHP) and the Dark <b>Age</b> <b>Humid</b> Period (DAHP). Drier conditions between the 7 th and 10 th centuries concur with enhanced fluvial dynamics, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the first arrival of Arabic-Berber populations in the Iberian Peninsula (al-Andalus, starting in AD 711). Results suggest that although the shift from wet to dry conditions in Les Arenes complies with major climatic trends, the construction of the first drainage canals by Arab-Berber groups likely contributed to the enhancement of on-going climate-related environmental processes.

40|$|Mimetic seeds {{simulate}} {{the appearance of}} fleshy fruits and arilled seeds without producing nutritive tissues {{as a reward for}} seed dispersers. In this strategy of seed dispersal, seeds may remain attached to the mother plant for long periods after maturity, increasing their availability to naive seed dispersers. The hypothesis that seed coat impermeability in many tropical Fabaceae with mimetic seeds serves as an exaptation to protect the seeds from deterioration and rotting while awaiting dispersal was investigated. Seed coat impermeability was evaluated in five mimetic-seeded species of tropical Fabaceae in south-eastern Brazil (Abarema langsdorffii, Abrus precatorius, Adenanthera pavonina, Erythrina velutina and Ormosia arborea) and in Erythrina speciosa, a `basal` species in its genus, which has monochromatic brown seeds and no mimetic displays. Seed hardness was evaluated as a defence against accelerated <b>ageing</b> (<b>humid</b> chamber at 41 degrees C for 144 h). Seed development and physiological potential of O. arborea was evaluated and the effect of holding mature seeds in pods on the mother plant in the field for a period of 1 year under humid tropical conditions was compared with seeds stored under controlled conditions (15 degrees C and 40 % relative air humidity). All five mimetic-seeded species, and E. speciosa, showed strong coat impermeability, which protected the seeds against deterioration in accelerated ageing. Most O. arborea seeds only became dormant 2 months after pod dehiscence. Germination of seeds after 1 year on the plant in a humid tropical climate was 56 %, compared with 80 % for seeds stored in controlled conditions (15 degrees C, 45 % relative humidity). Seedling shoot length after 1 year did not differ between seed sources. Dormancy acts in mimetic-seeded species as an exaptation to reduce seed deterioration, allowing an increase in their effective dispersal period and mitigating the losses incurred by low removal rates by naive avian frugivores.

40|$|The sedimentology, salt {{mineralogy}} {{and stable}} oxygen- and carbon-isotope signatures of a mid-lake sediment sequence from hypersaline Lake Bogoria in Kenya reveal marked climate-driven changes in water-column mixing regime and salinity {{over the past}} 1700 years. Combined with sedimentological data on short sediment sequences from nearby lakes Nakuru and Elementeita, {{this results in a}} preliminary reconstruction of hydroclimatic variability in the central Kenya Rift Valley since ca. 300 AD. Stratigraphic analyses of bulk sediment composition, texture and magnetic susceptibility of all three cores; and smear slide, XRD and stable-isotope analyses on carbonate minerals in the Bogoria sequence allowed to define a succession of sedimentary units, corresponding to distinct phases in lake history. In the lowermost unit, four characteristic trona layers (Na 3 (HCO 3) (CO 3) · 2 H 2 O) are attributed to predominantly dry conditions {{during the second half of}} the first millennium AD and the period equivalent to the Medieval Climate Anomaly, until the first half of the 12 th century AD. Lake Bogoria was probably polymictic at that time, its surface level standing significantly lower than today. The second unit displays uniform deposition of nahcolite (NaHCO 3), indicative of a strongly stratified lake where a layer of less saline surface water (near-) permanently covers a hypersaline water mass with high pCO 2. We propose that this depositional phase reflects the rising lake level related to the transition from dry to more humid climate conditions at the onset of the Little Ice Age, as previously documented for other parts of equatorial East Africa. The third, uppermost Bogoria unit contains only sporadic depositions of magadiite (Na 2 Si 14 O 29 (OH) 3 · 11 H 2 O) and various sodium carbonate minerals. This, together with low magnetic susceptibility, is interpreted to indicate <b>humid</b> Little Ice <b>Age</b> conditions, with highest lake level and reduced salinity around the late- 15 th to early- 16 th century AD. From the late- 18 th to early- 19 th century and again in the 1870 's, the region experienced two episodes of drought more severe than any recorded in historical time. Tentative evidence for these events in the Bogoria record is not well constrained in time, but dated desiccation surfaces in the Nakuru and Elementeita records confirm their widespread nature across eastern equatorial Africa. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The rate of {{oxidation}} {{is important}} to the long-term performance of reducing salt waste forms because the solubility of some contaminants, e. g., technetium, is a function of oxidation state. TcO{sub 4 }{sup −} in the salt solution is reduced to Tc(IV) and has been shown to react with ingredients in the waste form to precipitate low solubility sulfide and/or oxide phases. Upon exposure to oxygen, the compounds containing Tc(IV) oxidize to the pertechnetate ion, Tc(VII) O{sub 4 }{sup −}, which is very soluble. Consequently the rate of technetium oxidation front advancement into a monolith and the technetium leaching profile as a function of depth from an exposed surface are important to waste form performance and ground water concentration predictions. An approach for measuring contaminant oxidation rate (effective contaminant specific oxidation rate) based on leaching of select contaminants of concern is described in this report. In addition, the relationship between reduction capacity and contaminant oxidation is addressed. Chromate (Cr(VI) was used as a non-radioactive surrogate for pertechnetate, Tc(VII), in Cast Stone samples prepared with 5 M Simulant. Cast Stone spiked with pertechnetate was also prepared and tested. Depth discrete subsamples spiked with Cr were cut from Cast Stone exposed to Savannah River Site (SRS) outdoor ambient temperature fluctuations and moist air. Depth discrete subsamples spiked with Tc- 99 were cut from Cast Stone exposed to laboratory ambient temperature fluctuations and moist air. Similar conditions are expected to be encountered in the Cast Stone curing container. The leachability of Cr and Tc- 99 and the reduction capacities, measured by the Angus-Glasser method, were determined for each subsample as a function of depth from the exposed surface. The results obtained to date were focused on continued method development and are preliminary and apply to the sample composition and curing / exposure conditions described in this report. The Cr oxidation front (depth to which soluble Cr was detected) for the Cast Stone sample exposed for 68 days to ambient outdoor temperatures and <b>humid</b> air (total <b>age</b> of sample was 131 days) was determined to be about 35 mm below the top sample surface exposed. The Tc oxidation front, depth at which Tc was insoluble, was not determined. Interpretation of the results indicates that the oxidation front is at least 38 mm below the exposed surface. The sample used for this measurement was exposed to ambient laboratory conditions and humid air for 50 days. The total age of the sample was 98 days. Technetium appears to be more easily oxidized than Cr in the Cast Stone matrix. The oxidized forms of Tc and Cr are soluble and therefore leachable. Longer exposure times are required for both the Cr and Tc spiked samples to better interpret the rate of oxidation. Tc spiked subsamples need to be taken further from the exposed surface to better define and interpret the leachable Tc profile. Finally Tc(VII) reduction to Tc(IV) appears to occur relatively fast. Results demonstrated that about 95 percent of the Tc(VII) was reduced to Tc(IV) during the setting and very early stage setting for a Cast Stone sample cured 10 days. Additional testing at longer curing times is required to determine whether additional time is required to reduce 100 % of the Tc(VII) in Cast Stone or whether the Tc loading exceeded the ability of the waste form to reduce 100 % of the Tc(VII). Additional testing is required for samples cured for longer times. Depth discrete subsampling in a nitrogen glove box is also required to determine whether the 5 percent Tc extracted from the subsamples {{was the result of the}} sampling process which took place in air. Reduction capacity measurements (per the Angus-Glasser method) performed on depth discrete samples could not be correlated with the amount of chromium or technetium leached from the depth discrete subsamples or with the oxidation front inferred from soluble chromium and technetium (i. e., effective Cr and Tc oxidation fronts). Residual reduction capacity in the oxidized region of the test samples indicates that the remaining reduction capacity is not effective in re-reducing Cr(VI) or Tc(VII) in the presence of oxygen. Depth discrete sampling and leaching is a useful for evaluating Cast Stone and other chemically reducing waste forms containing ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) or other reduction / sequestration reagents to control redox sensitive contaminant chemistry and leachability in the near surface disposal environment. Based on results presented in this report, reduction capacity measured by the Angus-Glasser Ce(IV) method is not an appropriate or meaningful parameter for determining or predicting Tc and Cr oxidation / retentions, speciation, or solubilities in cementitious materials such as Cast Stone. A model for predicting Tc(IV) oxidation to soluble Tc(VII) should consider the waste form porosity (pathway for oxygen ingress), oxygen source, and the contaminant specific oxidation rates and oxidation fronts. Depth discrete sampling of materials exposed to realistic conditions in combination with short term leaching of crushed samples has potential for advancing the understanding of factors influencing performance.
