5|$|<b>Econometric</b> <b>analysis</b> of DSGE models {{suggested}} that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained {{only a small}} part of the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy can have a stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E

If the rich people in Pakistan are shifted to solar energy {{that they should}} be forced to purchase solar panels, the shortfall can be controlled. this will make the economy boost again as before 2007. According to an <b>econometric</b> <b>analysis</b> published in Quality & Quantity by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich and his colleague Muhammad Shahbaz, economic growth in Pakistan leads to electricity consumption but not vice versa.|$|E

An <b>econometric</b> <b>analysis</b> studied the impact of Facebook on the economy {{in terms of the number}} of jobs created and the economic value of those jobs. The conservative estimate was that the app development platform of Facebook added more than 182,000 jobs in the U.S. economy in 2011.

Our analytical tool is quantile regression which allows us to describe the conditional distribu- tion for any quantile including the (conditional) median representing " behavior. As an illustrative example we use the demand for beer and wine. The paper shows quite distinct patterns regarding price and income e®ects for di®erent goods which leads us to an extended characterization of household demand. <b>econometric</b> demand <b>analysis,</b> Engel curve, demand system, micro data...|$|R
25|$|Although Robert Barro, an American {{economist}} from Harvard University, did {{not directly}} respond to the arguments posed by the book, his research {{on the relationship between}} democracy and growth disagrees with the argument that inclusive institutions give rise to economic growth. According to Barro's 1996 paper Democracy and Growth, the <b>econometric</b> <b>analysis</b> reveals a weak relationship between democracy and growth in a study of 100 countries from 1960 to 1990. After fixing factors like rule of law and free market, democracy has a statistically insignificant influence on economic growth. At the same time, raising the standard of living—including health service, education—will substantially raise the probability of political freedom. Barro is essentially arguing the reverse of Acemoglu and Robinson: that economic growth gives rise to better political institutions, especially when a country is poor.|$|E

At the same time, sovereign debt levels would be significantly lower with, e.g., Greece's debt level falling below 110% of GDP, more than 40 percentage points below the baseline scenario with market-based interest levels. Furthermore, banks {{would no longer be}} able to benefit unduly from intermediary profits by borrowing from the ECB at low rates and investing in government bonds at high rates.|$|E
