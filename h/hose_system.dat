50|$|A helping hand, {{also known}} as a third hand or X-tra Hands, is a type of {{extremely}} adjustable jig used in soldering and craftwork to hold materials near each other so that the user can work on them. A commonly produced version consists of a weighted base, a pair of twice-adjustable arms ending in crocodile clips, and optionally a magnifying glass, held together by flexible joints. The clips are used to hold a light workpiece in place while the joints allow the user to change the position or angle.

50|$|Officially the FPW {{was not to}} be used {{detached}} from the parent vehicle, unless in an emergency. The operator's manual lists 4 precautions {{that would have to be}} taken to utilize the weapon outside of the vehicle.

50|$|Although {{the hose}} {{refueling}} system {{proved to be}} feasible, in practice the system had the disadvantage in taking {{a long time to}} make the contact and engage the hoses. Once contact was made, the rate of fuel transfer was slow, and the hoses provided a lot of aerodynamic drag which limited the airspeed. Consequently, the <b>hose</b> <b>system</b> was used for only a few years before it was replaced by the Boeing-developed flying boom system installed on the KB-29L. While flying the KB-29 the squadron deployed to RAF Upper Heyford, England from June to September 1952.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) into controlled airspace has generated {{a new era}} of autonomous technologies and challenges.

50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of orbital TIG welding, even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents heat from tinting, even with the most sensitive of materials. For tube diameters between 8 and 275mm, {{it is possible to}} use more manageable open welding heads (except for high purity applications). A flexible <b>hose</b> <b>system</b> is used to supply the welding head with power, inert gas, cooling water and filler wire where required. The need for filler wire during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality weld seams it is essential that tube ends are carefully prepared with the edges of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to prepare the edges more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|E
40|$|At Pacific Northwest {{hydroelectric}} dams, surface containers or <b>hose</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} used to release marked juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. for fish passage studies. Because these release methods introduce marked fish to unknown depths and hydraulic conditions, they may compromise study results. We constructed a canister and frames for releasing marked fish at predetermined depths and locations in the gatewells and forebays of hydroelectric dams. The canister performed as anticipated, avoiding injury to fish and allowing them to acclimate to depth prior to release. Acclimation is accomplished by slowly lowering the canister to the desired depth and holding the canister {{for a period of time}} before release. A total of 1, 000 yearling and subyearling chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were released with this canister over a 2 -year period in studies of guidance and orifice passage systems. About 98 % of these fish were recaptured, with no injury or descaling attributed to the release canister. This release method allows time for acclimation as well as repeatable positioning of the canister for release of fish at depth for studies at hydroelectric dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers...|$|R
