5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide <b>elution</b> sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the <b>elution</b> sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|Further {{separation}} {{was carried}} out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see <b>elution</b> curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the <b>elution</b> product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium {{can finally}} be {{separated}} from the other trivalent actinides using selective <b>elution</b> from a cation-exchange resin column, the eluant being ammonia α-HIB. Using the gas-jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary. The above procedure is the most commonly used one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements.|$|E
30|$|Results The {{number of}} <b>elutions</b> per {{generator}} ranged between 28 and 151, and the generators {{were used for}} periods ranging from 166 to 372 days. Yield within the first month were between 119 % and 133 % of the nominal Ge- 68 activity on the column for generators eluted with 1 M HCl, and 107 to 110 % for those eluted with 0.6 M HCl. By 160 days the yields had decreased to 106 % to 110 % with 1 M HCl <b>elutions</b> and 80 % to 99 % with 0.6 M HCl eluant. Three generators, including those eluted with 0.6 M, showed Ge- 68 breakthrough within the first 10 days of use. By 160 days age, the Ge- 68 breakthrough varied between 0.02 % and 1.0 %, with the lower acidity eluant giving the second highest value. There were no correlation between interval between <b>elutions</b> and Ge- 68 breakthrough and Ga- 68 yield.|$|R
30|$|Aim: Breakthrough of Ge- 68, and {{the yield}} of Ga- 68 are {{important}} aspects of Ge- 68 /Ga- 68 generator function. At the Western Cape Academic PET/CT Centre, SnO 2 -based Ga- 68 generators produced by iThemba LABS are used. These generators are eluted with 0.6 M or 1 M HCL and Ge- 68 breakthrough has been observed. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of the age of the generator, the number of <b>elutions</b> performed, and the interval between <b>elutions</b> on Ga- 68 yield and Ge- 68 breakthrough in order to optimise use of Ga- 68.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: A {{convenient}} and reliable synthesis of [18 F]FFMZ was successfully adapted in an automated module by using two successive isocratic <b>elutions</b> instead of gradient HPLC.

5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct <b>elution</b> properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective <b>elution</b> with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E

Gallium-68's preparation as a pharmaceutical is chemical and the radionuclide is extracted by <b>elution</b> from germanium-68, a synthetic radioisotope of germanium, in gallium-68 generators.|$|E
5|$|In {{reducing}} conditions, mendelevium(III) can {{be easily}} reduced to mendelevium(II), which is stable in aqueous solution. The standard reduction potential of the E°(Md3+→Md2+) couple was variously estimated in 1967 as −0.10V or −0.20V: later 2013 experiments established the value as /Md2+ Reduction Potential Studied with Flow Electrolytic Chromatography |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=21 |pages=12311–3 |doi=10.1021/ic401571h}} In comparison, E°(Md3+→Md0) should be around −1.74V, and E°(Md2+→Md0) should be around −2.5V.

The affinity column method provided a simple, one-step procedure for obtaining quantitative yields of substantially pure immunoglobulin. The <b>elutions</b> from the affinity columns utilized guanidine-HCl allowing the <b>elutions</b> to be performed quickly and under conditions which apparently did not denature the immunoglobulins except perhaps immunoglobulin M.

50|$|Early studies {{suggested}} {{a minimum of}} two RNAPs: one which synthesized rRNA in the nucleolus, and one which synthesized other RNA in the nucleoplasm, part of the nucleus but outside the nucleolus. In 1969, science experimentalists Robert Roeder and William Rutter definitively discovered an additional RNAP that was responsible for transcription of some kind of RNA in the nucleoplasm. The finding was obtained by the use of DEAE-Sephadex ion-exchange chromatography. The technique separated the enzymes by the order of the corresponding <b>elutions,</b> Ι,ΙΙ,ΙΙΙ, by increasing the concentration of ammonium sulfate. The enzymes were named according to the order of the <b>elutions,</b> RNAP I, RNAP II, RNAP IΙI. This discovery demonstrated that there was an additional enzyme present in the nucleoplasm, which allowed for the differentiation between RNAP II and RNAP III.|$|R
40|$|A {{simultaneous}} {{determination method}} for five organic acids in vinegar {{has been established}} by photometric ion chromatography. Both trace components (lactic, gluconic, succinic and pyroglutamic acids) and the major component (acetic acid) in vinegar were separated on a TSK gel IC-Anion-PW column with 0. 45 mM o-aminobenzenesulfonic acid aqueous solution as an eluent. Their <b>elutions</b> were detected as positive peaks before the system peak, and a negative peak after that by a UV monitor. The sensitivities of trace components were enhanced by adjusting their <b>elutions</b> close to the system peak. The lowest detection limits were 10 μM lactic acid, 5 μM gluconic and succinic acids and 3 μM pyroglutamic acid, respectively. The only pretreatment necessary was dilution of vinegar 100 -fold with the eluent. The results obtained by the proposed method were in good agreement with those by the enzymatic one...|$|R
5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide <b>elution</b> sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure <b>elution</b> from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide <b>elution</b> sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium. Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).|$|E
50|$|The {{generator}} is washed of Tc-99 and Tc-99m {{at the end}} of {{the manufacturing}} process of the generator, but the ratio of 99Tc to 99mTc then builds up again during transport or any other period when the generator is left unused.

30|$|The {{breakthrough}} is {{specified by}} the manufacturers of the 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator as 0.0035 % or 35  ppm, which would be equivalent to 64.75  kBq in 1, 850  MBq eluate. For the first <b>elutions</b> after delivery of the generator, the breakthrough does not in fact exceed this limit. But strictly speaking, the limit of 0.001 % suggested by the European Pharmacopeia [18] is slightly exceeded in several eluates from the three generators evaluated in this study.|$|R
5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective <b>elution</b> with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Separation of {{trivalent}} actinides from lanthanide {{fission products}} {{can be done}} by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as eluant. It is usually followed by anion-exchange chromatography using 6 molar HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their <b>elution</b> position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} gentamicin palmitate salt and gentamicin sulfate salt mixed with bone chips after storage at 80 °C. Different concentration rates of gentamicin sulfate and gentamicin palmitate were mixed with human bone chips and stored for 1 – 6 months at 80 °C. Nonstored samples were used as control. The release of the antibiotics from the bone {{was carried out in}} phosphate-buffered saline. Antibiotic concentrations in the <b>elutions</b> were determined with microbiological agar diffusion assay using Bacillus subtilis. Susceptibility tests were carried out using Staphylococci strains. The rate of gentamicin base (GB) released from bone was similar for all gentamicin salts and all storage conditions. The <b>elutions</b> released were efficient on reducing S. aureus and S. epidermidis CFU during all storage time. In resume, the capacity of bone grafts to act as gentamicin carriers has been confirmed in this study. GSþGP showed equivalent efficacy against S. aureus and S. epidermidis compared with GS pure. The lower delivery rate of GSþGP, related to its affinity with fat tissue can be an advantage for longer release times, increasing the local protection against infections.

25|$|There are {{distinct}} differences between displacement and <b>elution</b> chromatography. In <b>elution</b> mode, substances typically {{emerge from a}} column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in <b>elution</b> mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize {{the effect of this}} difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient <b>elution</b> and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to <b>elution</b> mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over <b>elution</b> chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Proteins with {{different}} numbers of polyhistidine tags elute differently from nickel-affinity resin. For proteins {{with a single}} hexahistidine tag, 75 mM imidazole enables <b>elution</b> from Ni-NTA, whereas for proteins with two hexahistidine tags, 100 mM imidazole is required for <b>elution.</b> This step-wise <b>elution</b> {{may be used to}} isolate specific protein assemblies from a mixture, such as defined heteromultimers (e.g. an AB heterodimer from a mixture including AA and BB homodimers, if only subunit B has a polyhistidine tag). Such an approach was used in isolation of monovalent streptavidin.|$|E
25|$|Expanded-bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) chromatography is {{a convenient}} and effective technique for {{the capture of}} proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to <b>elution</b> buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an <b>elution</b> buffer. The mode used for <b>elution</b> (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends {{on the characteristics of}} the feed.

25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic <b>elution</b> mode") or varied ("gradient <b>elution</b> mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic <b>elution</b> is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient <b>elution</b> the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast <b>elution</b> (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E

25|$|To achieve maximum purity in {{a single}} step, {{affinity}} purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an agarose support. If the antigen is a peptide, it is commonly synthesized with a terminal cysteine, which allows selective attachment to a carrier protein, such as KLH during development and to support purification. The antibody-containing media is then incubated with the immobilized antigen, either in batch or as the antibody is passed through a column, where it selectively binds and can be retained while impurities are washed away. An <b>elution</b> with a low pH buffer or a more gentle, high salt <b>elution</b> buffer is then used to recover purified antibody from the support.|$|E

For the generator used in this study, the breakthrough exceeds 100  ppm (10 − 2 %) after a shelf life of 100  days, whereas the values presented by Lin et al. display a lower breakthrough, especially for one of the TiO 2 -based generators investigated by those authors [24].|$|R
