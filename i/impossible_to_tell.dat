5|$|More tornadic {{damage was}} {{reported}} in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, {{but there were some}} minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by shards of glass from a breaking window. Some sources insist that the Wallingford tornado dissipated a few miles west of the town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory {{that it is}} <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), {{as well as the}} New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E

60|$|The change came so entirely {{without warning}} or {{intention}} that I find it <b>impossible</b> now <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the order of}} its phases. What disturbed pebble started the avalanche I cannot trace. Perhaps it was simply that the barriers between us and this masked aspect of life had been wearing down unperceived.|$|R
60|$|Elfride assented pleasantly, even gladly; {{but she saw}} that, by this marriage, {{her father}} and herself had ceased for ever to be the close {{relations}} they had been up to a few weeks ago.

5|$|Because {{the storm}} had blown down {{telegraph}} lines in the area, two riders immediately set off for Roberts, ten miles to the south, and sent messages into St. Paul with news of the tornado. Altogether, the tornado and the subsequent fires that raged throughout the following night destroyed the entire business district along {{with more than half}} the residences in town, which combined added up to more than 300 buildings. The only significant surviving structures were the Lumber and Roller Mills located {{on the banks of the}} Willow River, the latter of which was narrowly missed by the tornado, the town's public school and the Catholic Church, which acted as either makeshift shelters or morgues. Only the extreme northwestern and southeastern portions of the city were spared. The town's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed, so fires ran rampant through the scattered debris. Many bodies found in the aftermath were burnt beyond recognition— it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if they died from the tornado or from being trapped and burned alive.|$|E
25|$|Lacking any tech spec for or {{appearances}} individually, it's <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{how this}} character is related, if at all, to other characters named Red Alert, however, {{the character of}} Discharge was a female Autobot firefighter.|$|E

25|$|After {{the human}} and {{chimpanzee}} genomes were sequenced and compared, it was usually <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether differences {{were the result of}} the human or chimpanzee gene changing from the common ancestor. After the rhesus macaque genome was sequenced, three genes could be compared. If two genes were the same, they were presumed to be the original gene.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} how long each sub-phase lasted, {{but by the}} end of LH IIIB2 the palaces of Mycenae and Tiryns and the citadel at Midea had all been {{destroyed}}.

25|$|May 1850 Revision – in May 1850 Wagner made a third fair copy of {{the text}} (Viertschrift des Textbuches) {{in the hopes of}} having it published. Unfortunately this manuscript, which is {{presently}} in the Bayreuth Archives, is fragmentary, some of its pages having been discarded during the next revision, for which it was the source-text. Among the missing pages are the final few, so it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether either of the marginal verses added to the final page of the second fair copy was incorporated into Brünnhilde's closing speech.|$|E
60|$|There {{remained}} {{the telling of}} Joan Valentine; for it was obviously <b>impossible</b> not <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her. When you have revolutionized your life at the bidding of another you cannot well conceal the fact, as though nothing had happened. Ashe had not the slightest desire to conceal the fact. On the contrary, {{he was glad to}} have such a capital excuse for renewing the acquaintance.|$|R

25|$|Cyclemys {{taxonomy}} and phylogeny {{have been}} historically difficult to ascertain {{due to the}} morphological similarity between species, as well as changes in the color patterns during growth. Until recently, the genus was thought to comprise {{only one or two}} morphologically variable species, C. dentata and C. oldhamii. Subsequent investigation has now put the number of species under the genus to seven, though this remains controversial. The status of C. enigmatica as a valid species is contested, as is the recognition of C. atripons and C. pulchristiata, both of which are nearly <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart morphologically.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of the free port was added to with the smuggling of goods, mainly from France during the wars with France, were in high demand in England. Goods such as brandy, perfume, lace and wine. Even goods such as salt were smuggled, as it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the origin of that commodity, landing salt in England and claiming its manufacture in the Islands and tax free as against French salt, which was taxed. France also had a tax until 1790, the gabelle of 140 times the cost of production, so producers wanted to export. In 1795 England arrested 10,000 people for salt smuggling.|$|E
25|$|Out of the {{approximately}} 150 surviving Irish surnames of princely or comital origins, the Eóganachta and their allies account for approximately 30, or about one fifth. Unfortunately their pedigrees are often hopelessly disorganized and confused {{and so it is}} difficult or <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> in many cases which people belong to which septs, or in fact if they even belong to the Eóganachta at all. There is also great evidence in the pedigrees and regnal lists of repeated modification, outright fabrication, and unceremonious deletion, at least for the early period (all concerned sources), with some criticisms quite severe, although this is also a problem with Connachta and Laigin material.|$|E

25|$|The Philippine Coast Guard {{reported}} on June 24, 2008, that it {{accounted for only}} 115 (48 survivors confirmed, 67 others confirmed dead, 747 missing) of the 862 passengers and crew of Princess of the Stars. Navy divers found no survivors inside the wreck when they entered the upturned hulk of the ferry. They did, however, find 15 bodies inside the ship's dining area and two others in the bridge. It was so dark inside the ferry that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how many more corpses were inside. A helicopter from a U.S. military ship, the , found 12 bodies floating near Masbate island, {{but it was not}} clear if they were from the Princess of the Stars.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century polio {{would become}} the world's most feared disease. The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, {{affluent}} individuals, required long quarantine periods during which parents were separated from children: it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> who would get the disease and who would be spared. The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of wheelchairs, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only {{the lives of those}} who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} wealth of perspectives, {{including}} the commander's, it is difficult if not <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> exactly what occurred. It is clear, however, that the crew felt alienated by their commander, who {{might well have been}} motivated by his pride. Jones believed his intentions were honorable, and his actions were strategically essential to the Revolution. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the mission, Ranger's capture of Drake was one of the Continental Navy's few significant military victories during the Revolution, and was of immense symbolic importance, demonstrating as it did that the Royal Navy was far from invincible. By overcoming such odds, Ranger's victory became an important symbol of the American spirit and served as an inspiration for the permanent establishment of the United States Navy after the revolution.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dick, [...] "it's {{very natural}} {{from my point}} of view.

25|$|Critics {{have claimed}} that, without avian air sacs, modest {{improvements}} {{in a few}} aspects of a modern reptile's circulatory and respiratory systems would enable the reptile to achieve 50% to 70% of the oxygen flow of a mammal of similar size, and that lack of avian air sacs would not prevent the development of endothermy. Very few formal rebuttals {{have been published in}} scientific journals of Ruben et al.s claim that dinosaurs could not have had avian-style air sacs; but one points out that the Sinosauropteryx fossil on which they based much of their argument was severely flattened and therefore it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether the liver was the right shape to act as part of a hepatic piston mechanism. Some recent papers simply note without further comment that Ruben et al. argued against the presence of air sacs in dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|There is no precise {{measurement}} {{of the costs of}} regulation balanced against the harms associated with money laundering, and given the evaluation problems involved in assessing such an issue, {{it is unlikely that the}} effectiveness of terror finance and money laundering laws could be determined with any degree of accuracy. The Economist estimated the annual costs of anti-money laundering efforts in Europe and North America at US$5 billion in 2003, an increase from US$700 million in 2000. Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic capital formation, depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of anti-money laundering systems, it is almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> which anti-money laundering systems work and which are more or less cost effective.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section makes it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{whether or not it}} is twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
