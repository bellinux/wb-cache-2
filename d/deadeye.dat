5|$|Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to {{make plans}} for a {{production}} of Pinafore in America. Carte travelled to New York {{in the summer of}} 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager John T. Ford to present, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, the first authorised American production of Pinafore. In November, Carte returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including J. H. Ryley as Sir Joseph, Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine, Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup, Furneaux Cook as Dick <b>Deadeye,</b> Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe. To these, he added some American singers, including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran. Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan, while his brother François remained in London to conduct Pinafore there.|$|E
25|$|In either 1881 or 1882 {{he joined}} the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a chorus member. In early 1882, he {{appeared}} on tour in the chorus of Claude Duval and, later in the same year, in the chorus of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance. He was promoted to the roles of Dick <b>Deadeye</b> in Pinafore and Samuel in Pirates in August 1882. He also appeared as Mr. Wallaby in the companion piece Quite an Adventure. In November 1882, he created the role of Private Willis in Iolanthe at the Savoy Theatre.|$|E

His {{role of a}} faded one hit wonder rock star {{displayed}} his acting and comedy skills during 101 episodes. English returned to stage musicals to play roles in Simon Gallaher's production company Essgee Entertainment's trilogy of updated Gilbert and Sullivan works: Pirate King in The Pirates of Penzance (1994), Pooh-Bah in The Mikado (1995) and Dick <b>Deadeye</b> in H.M.S. Pinafore (1997). A performance of each production was broadcast on Australian TV, then released on VHS video and later on DVD.|$|E

25|$|In 1877 Temple {{was engaged}} to create the part of Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre in the first {{production}} of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer at the Opera Comique, produced by Richard D'Oyly Carte. The following year, he created the role of Dick <b>Deadeye</b> in the company's long-running international hit, H.M.S. Pinafore. During the original runs of The Sorcerer and Pinafore, Temple also took parts in the short companion pieces that accompanied these longer works. He played Fred Fancourt in the 187778 revival of Dora's Dream, the title role in The Spectre Knight (1878), General Deelah in Cups and Saucers (187879), and Selworthy in After All! (187879).|$|E
25|$|Ayldon {{joined the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company {{as a member}} of the chorus in 1967. The {{following}} season, he began to play the small role of the Associate in Trial by Jury and filled in on occasion as Sergeant Bouncer in Cox and Box, the Learned Judge in Trial, and the Boatswain in H.M.S. Pinafore. In 1968, he began to understudy Donald Adams in the principal bass-baritone roles, appearing on occasion as Dick <b>Deadeye</b> in Pinafore, the Pirate King in The Pirates of Penzance, the Earl of Mountararat in Iolanthe, and the title role in The Mikado. He changed his name to Ayldon because another Equity member was known as John Arnold.|$|E
25|$|During his five-decade tenure {{with the}} company, Lytton played an {{unprecedented}} range of roles (exceeded only by Richard Walker), including Counsel and the Learned Judge in Trial by Jury, Dr. Daly and John Wellington Wells in The Sorcerer, Captain Corcoran, Dick <b>Deadeye</b> and Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Pirate King and Major-General Stanley in Pirates, Bunthorne and Grosvenor in Patience, Strephon and the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, King Gama in Princess Ida, Ko-Ko and The Mikado in The Mikado, Robin in Ruddigore, Jack Point and Wilfred Shadbolt in The Yeomen of the Guard, Giuseppe and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers, King Paramount in Utopia Limited, and Ludwig in The Grand Duke, {{as well as}} roles in many non-Gilbert and Sullivan pieces.|$|E

25|$|Adams {{recorded}} prolifically. With the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and Decca Records, {{he recorded}} Sergeant Bouncer in Cox and Box (1961), the Usher in Trial by Jury (1964), the Notary in The Sorcerer (1953), Sir Marmaduke in The Sorcerer (1966), Dick <b>Deadeye</b> in H.M.S. Pinafore (1960), the Pirate King in Pirates (1958 and 1968), Colonel Calverley in Patience (1961), Mountararat in Iolanthe (1960), Arac in Princess Ida (1955 and 1965), the Mikado in The Mikado (1958), Sir Roderic in Ruddigore (1962), Sergeant Meryll in Yeomen (1964), and King Paramount in Utopia Limited (1964 excerpts). He {{also appeared in}} the title role in D'Oyly Carte's 1966 film of The Mikado and as the voice of Sir Roderic Murgatroyd in the Halas and Batchelor cartoon version of Ruddigore.|$|E
25|$|When Fancourt retired {{at the end}} of the 1952–53 season, Adams {{became the}} company's {{principal}} bass-baritone, regularly playing Dick <b>Deadeye</b> in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Pirate King, Colonel Calverley, the Earl of Mountararat, the Mikado of Japan, Sir Roderic in Ruddigore, Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Arac in Princess Ida (when that opera was revived in 1954). From 1961 to 1963, he also played Sergeant Bouncer in Cox and Box. Although he had admired Fancourt, when he took over the roles, Adams asked Bridget D'Oyly Carte if he could create his own characterisations, which she agreed to, saying she would tell him if he overstepped the mark. Adams continued as the principal bass-baritone of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1969. In 1952 he married D'Oyly Carte soprano Muriel Harding (1920–90).|$|E
25|$|Temple {{returned}} to the Savoy and D'Oyly Carte in October 1894, replacing John Coates as Baron Van den Berg in Mirette. In December 1894 at the Savoy, he created the part of Sancho in Sullivan and Burnand's The Chieftain, and later that month played Sergeant Bouncer when a revival of Cox and Box {{was added to the}} bill. After a year's absence from the company, he {{returned to}} the Savoy briefly in 1896 to give some performances in the title role of a revival of The Mikado, and he also directed the premiere of Charles Villiers Stanford's Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique that year. He then appeared in the first revival of Yeomen in 1897. In December 1898 he filled in as Sir Marmaduke in The Sorcerer, and in 1899 he played Dick <b>Deadeye</b> again in the third revival of H.M.S. Pinafore at the Savoy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, amateur ship model kits became {{available}} from companies such as Bassett-Lowke in Great Britain and Boucher's in the United States.

500|$|Suicide by fire {{is another}} common theme in Vonnegut's works; the author often {{returns to the}} theory that [...] "many people are not fond of life." [...] He uses this as an {{explanation}} for why humans have so severely damaged their environments, and made devices such as nuclear weapons that can make their creators extinct. In <b>Deadeye</b> Dick, Vonnegut features the neutron bomb, designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched. He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices {{at the disposal of}} politicians.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{returning}} to radio, Skelton {{brought with him}} many new characters that were added to his repertoire: Bolivar Shagnasty, described as a [...] "loudmouthed braggart"; Cauliflower McPugg, a boxer; <b>Deadeye,</b> a cowboy; Willie Lump-Lump, a fellow who drank too much; and San Fernando Red, a conman with political aspirations. By 1947, Skelton's musical conductor was David Rose, who {{would go on to}} television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.|$|E

Ralph Rackstraw, [...] "the smartest lad in all the fleet", enters, declaring his love for the Captain's daughter, Josephine. His fellow sailors (excepting Dick <b>Deadeye,</b> the grim and ugly realist of the crew) offer their sympathies, but they can give Ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned.|$|E
50|$|The {{belaying}} {{pins and}} <b>deadeyes</b> aboard USS Constitution {{and many other}} sailing ships were made from lignum vitae. Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the severity of typical marine weathering conditions, and also resisted jamming in their mortise holes. The sheaves of blocks on sailing vessels were made of lignum vitae until the introduction of modern synthetics.|$|R
5000|$|Simple and effective, the {{buntline}} hitch {{dates to}} the age of sail, when it was used to secure buntlines {{to the foot of the}} sails [...] on square-rigged ships. That the buntline hitch was the preferred knot speaks to its security and reliability. [...] Once set, repeated jerking and slatting tend to tighten it further rather than loosen it. [...] Its compact size allowed the foot of the sail to be drawn up as closely as possible to the buntline <b>deadeyes</b> on top of the yard.|$|R
5000|$|Buntlines {{lift the}} middle {{portion of the}} sail; there will usually be four to eight {{buntline}}s across {{the foot of the}} sail. Traditionally they are secured to the sail with buntline hitches. [...] Since buntlines only have to lift a section of canvas, they can be thinner than the clewlines and are not usually fitted with a purchase. A typical arrangement for the buntlines has them running through <b>deadeyes</b> on the yard, upwards to a block fixed to the shrouds a little higher up the mast, and then downwards against the inside of the ratlines to the deck. This provides a good lead but does create a minor obstacle to sailors moving out along the yards.|$|R
500|$|Gilbert's biographer Jane Stedman {{wrote that}} Pinafore is [...] "satirically far more complex" [...] than The Sorcerer. She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads, {{including}} {{the idea of}} gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from [...] "Captain Reece" [...] (1868) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from [...] "General John" [...] (1867). Dick <b>Deadeye,</b> based on a character in [...] "Woman's Gratitude" [...] (1869), represents another of Gilbert's favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding [...] "face and form" [...] makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense. Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, The Gentleman in Black which includes the device of baby-switching.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Vonnegut married Jill Krementz, a {{photographer}} {{whom he met}} while {{she was working on}} a series about writers in the early 1970s. [...] With Jill, he adopted a daughter, Lily, when the baby was three days old. In subsequent years, his popularity resurged as he published several satirical books, including Jailbird (1979), <b>Deadeye</b> Dick (1982), Galápagos (1985), Bluebeard (1987), and Hocus Pocus (1990). In 1986, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in Rodney Dangerfield's film Back to School. The last of Vonnegut's fourteen novels, Timequake (1997), was, as University of Detroit history professor and Vonnegut biographer Gregory Sumner said, [...] "a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency." [...] Vonnegut's final book, a collection of essays entitled A Man Without a Country (2005), became a bestseller.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} The Sorcerer {{paved the way}} for another {{collaboration}} by Gilbert and Sullivan. Carte agreed on terms for a new opera with the Comedy Opera Company, and Gilbert began work on H.M.S. Pinafore before the end of 1877. Gilbert's father had been a naval surgeon, and the nautical theme of the opera appealed to him. He drew on several of his earlier [...] "Bab Ballad" [...] poems (many of which also have nautical themes), including [...] "Captain Reece" [...] (1868) and [...] "General John" [...] (1867). Some of the characters also have prototypes in the ballads: Dick <b>Deadeye</b> is based on a character in [...] "Woman's Gratitude" [...] (1869); an early version of Ralph Rackstraw can be seen in [...] "Joe Go-Lightly" [...] (1867), with its sailor madly in love with the daughter of someone who far outranks him; and Little Buttercup is taken almost wholesale from [...] "The Bumboat Woman's Story" [...] (1870). On 27 December 1877, while Sullivan was on holiday on the French Riviera, Gilbert sent him a plot sketch accompanied by the following note: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} the squall burst upon them. Captain Dettmar, {{springing}} aft, lifted the coiled mainsail halyards from their pins and threw them, ready to run, on the deck. The three islanders swarmed {{from the tiny}} forecastle, two of them leaping to the halyards and holding by a single turn, while the third fastened down the engineroom, companion and swung the ventilators around. Below, Lee Goom and Toyama were lowering skylight covers and screwing up <b>deadeyes.</b> Duncan pulled shut {{the cover of the}} companion scuttle, and held on, waiting, the first drops of rain pelting his face, while the Samoset leaped violently ahead, at the same time heeling first to starboard then to port as the gusty pressures caught her winged-out sails.|$|R
25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and topgallant mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs <b>deadeyes,</b> circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.|$|R
50|$|Her nine spars {{were shaped}} from old growth Douglas fir shipped from a mill in Washington State. She was {{originally}} rigged as a brigantine carrying three {{yards on the}} foremast. She has a bowsprit, jib boom and dolphin striker which carry three sails, the mainmast is gaff rigged with mainsail and gaff topsail, between the masts is the main staysail and fisherman. Her rigging, standing and running, about one mile of it {{was done by the}} McQuistons and son-in-law Dave Wellens using old fashioned <b>deadeyes</b> and wooden blocks. Seventeen months later she went for her first sail in 20 knot winds off San Diego. In 1994 with a crew of six she sailed north for her new home port of Bellingham, WA where she cruised the San Juan Islands, participated in Tall Ships events, raced with schooners up the British Columbia coast and one trip to Alaska.|$|R
