5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a <b>Hearing</b> <b>Officer</b> appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the <b>Hearing</b> <b>Officer,</b> and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E

25|$|In January, 2009, Carlos Alberto Torres was {{scheduled}} for a parole hearing, after serving 29 years behind bars. On {{the eve of his}} hearing, prison authorities accused him and eight of his cellmates of possessing knives which the tenth cellmate had hidden in the light fixture of the cell. On July 28, the Parole board notified Carlos Alberto that they would postpone their decision for at least 90 days, pending resolution of the charges. Two days later, the prison disciplinary <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> held hearings on the weapons charges. Alberto's defense consisted not merely of his statement denying possession. The tenth cellmate appeared as a witness, admitting that the knives were his, and his alone, and that Carlos Alberto and none of the other cellmates knew he had hidden the knives in the light fixture. The guilty party also provided a sworn statement to this effect. The disciplinary <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> nevertheless found them guilty of possessing the hidden weapons.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{officials}} who conduct administrative hearings for aggrieved welfare clients. <b>Hearing</b> <b>officers</b> are charged with ensuring due process for welfare clients, called appellants in the hearing process, who believe that mistakes have been made in their cases and who wish to challenge those decisions. Administrative hearings {{are one of the few}} vehicles that afford clients the opportunity to contest welfare policies and procedures. This study explored welfare <b>hearing</b> <b>officers</b> and their perceptions of their roles in conducting hearings. The concepts of role theory, organizational climate and aspects of professional training were used to examine the role perceptions of <b>hearing</b> <b>officers.</b> Semi-structured interviews, intended to identify officers’ beliefs about their jobs, were conducted with 27 participants who had social services-related degrees. Findings demonstrated that officers strive to be fair and impartial, yet perceive role conflict and ambiguity as a result of several factors related to the players in the hearings process. Findings suggested that organizational climate impacted officers’ feelings about their agencies based on constant changes to agency functions. The benefits of professional training and education on officers’ roles were examined and will also be explained. The paper concludes with a discussion around the study’s findings and concludes with the study’s limitations and implications for social work research, practice, and education...|$|R

2500|$|A {{doctor was}} {{allegedly}} subject to multiple hearings {{for the same}} charges, and his rights to an expedited hearing were allegedly denied while a suspension was in place. On May 15, 2001, the California Medical Association filed an amicus curiae brief to emphasize legal protections meant to prevent physicians being arbitrarily excluded from access to healthcare facilities based on mechanisms such as summary suspension without a speedy hearing. [...] This case was decided on April 18, 2005. [...] The {{court ruled that the}} <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in the case could indeed terminate the physician's peer review hearing based on grounds that the physician refused to cooperate on procedural and other matters necessary for the good conduct of the proceedings. [...] Thus, the physician lost his membership and privileges at the hospital. Ironically, the same physician was brought into a peer review hearing at another facility a short time later. [...] The <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in that case also terminated the proceedings, this time due to the physician's failure to turn over certain evidence for use in the hearing. [...] The physician challenged the termination through the court system arguing, contrary to the Tenet appellate court ruling, that California's peer review statutes never intended the <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in peer review hearings to have such powers of termination. [...] The California Supreme Court reviewed the case and agreed in April 2009. [...] The High Court ruled, among other things, that peer review hearing officers must defer the question of termination to the panel of physicians who sit in judgment of each peer review hearing.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1995, the United States Senate {{asked the}} U.S. Court of Federal Claims to {{determine}} if the United States owed Inslaw compensation for the government's use of Promis. On July 31, 1997, Judge Christine Miller, the <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that all of the versions of Promis were in the public domain and that the government had therefore always been free to do whatever it wished with Promis. The following year, the appellate authority, a three-judge Review Panel of the same court, upheld Miller's ruling; it also determined that Inslaw had never granted the government a license to [...] "modify Promis to create derivative software" [...] although Inslaw was automatically vested with the exclusive copyright rights to Promis. The Review Panel then held that the United States would be liable to Inslaw for copyright infringement damages if the government had created any unauthorized derivatives from Promis, but noted that Inslaw [...] "had failed to prove in court that the government had done so;" [...] moreover, the Board held that the issue of [...] "derivative works" [...] was [...] "of no consequence." [...] Inslaw challenged this interpretation but the Review Panel refused Inslaw's request to reopen discovery. In August 1998, Chief Judge Lorin Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims sent an Advisory Report to the Senate, [...] noting that the court had not found that the United States owes Inslaw compensation for the government's use of Promis, and enclosing the decision of the <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> and the decision of the Review Panel.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{held that}} both District and Appeals Courts were wrong in their {{contention}} that {{the intent of the}} law was to provide for handicapped children's full potentials but rather to simply give them access. They specifically overruled the District Court's finding that [...] "The Act itself does not define 'appropriate education'", with Justice Rehnquist quoting the text of the statute itself: [...] "The term 'free appropriate public education' means special education and related services" [...] followed by further definitions of those terms. Instead, the text of the legislation and the legislative intent show {{that the purpose of the}} law was not to allow each child to achieve their full potential, but to simply provide sufficient resources for handicapped children to access education. Rehnquist pointed to the text of the Act creating a prioritization of how resources are to be allocated: [...] "States receiving money under the Act must provide education to the handicapped by priority, first [...] "to handicapped children who are not receiving an education" [...] and second [...] "to handicapped children [...] [...] [...] with the most severe handicaps who are receiving an inadequate education." [...] In his concurrence, Justice Blackmun disagreed with the majority's finding of legislative intent, quoting his previous concurrence in Pennhurst State School v. Halderman: [...] "it seems plain to me that Congress, in enacting this statute, intended to do more than merely set out politically self-serving but essentially meaningless language about what the handicapped deserve at the hands of state authorities." [...] He agreed with the final judgement of the Court, however, as he, like the majority, believed the District Court should not have prescribed its own remedy but [...] "should have given greater deference than they did to the findings of the School District's impartial <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> and the State's Commissioner of Education".|$|E
