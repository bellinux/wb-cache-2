The system that reads the instruction value from the image is by taking a picture of the measuring instrument with a camera.

40|$|Dentin primer {{is applied}} as a routine {{procedure}} prior to bonding {{to improve the}} sealing properties of direct polymerizing resins. Some primers contain acetone or alcohol that may affect the properties of calcium hydroxide liner which is placed as a direct or indirect pulp cap. If calcium hydroxide is softened or smeared over the cavity walls, the bonding will be impaired. Therefore, if this occurs, the cement must be removed, the walls must be cleansed, and the procedure must be repeated with careful application of dentin primer. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the wear and compressive strength of a calcium hydroxide liner after exposure to different kinds of dentin primers for different periods of time. METHODS: The calcium hydroxide used in this study was Dycal. It was mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and placed in plastic rings of 0. 5 mm x 5 mm and allowed to set at 37 degrees C for 15 min under 500 gm load. To determine erosion, the height for each sample before and after application of primers was recorded using a <b>Digital</b> Height <b>Measuring</b> <b>Instrument</b> "Digmar" 817. Compressive strength specimens were also prepared. RESULTS: Calcium hydroxide treated with Optibond (alcohol based) or Syntac (acetone based) for 1 min or 5 min had the highest erosion values and the lowest compressive strength values.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the length of the root of lower central incisors (LCI), as well as the width and depth of the concavities of their proximal surfaces. Material and methods: The width and depth of root concavities, as well as root length, were evaluated in 90 LCI. All teeth were <b>measured</b> using a <b>digital</b> contour <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> (Contracer®) for the root grooves and a digital calliper for evaluating root length. Results:After statistical analysis (t- Student and Kruskal-Wallis Anova tests, p< 0. 05) it was possible to confirm: the mean root length on its distal surface (13. 88 ± 1. 47 mm) and on its mesial surface (13. 88 ± 1. 47 mm) and on its mesial surface (13. 76 ± 1. 50 mm). Concavities were present in 100 % of the samples; concavities were found 2 mm, coronally from the CEJ, at the CEJ, and at all root surface. The concavities were wider than deeper; on the mesial surface, the greatest width was 1. 717 mm and the greatest depth was 0. 118 mm. Conclusion: The distal surface of the lower central incisor is the longest.
