40|$|One {{challenge}} for plant biology {{has been to}} identify floral stimuli at the shoot apex. Using sensitive and specific gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques, we have followed changes in gibberellins (GAs) at the shoot apex during long day (LD) -regulated induction of flowering in the grass Lolium temulentum. Two separate roles of GAs in flowering are indicated. First, within 8 h of an inductive LD, i. e. {{at the time of}} <b>floral</b> <b>evocation,</b> the GA 5 content of the shoot apex doubled to about 120 ng g− 1 dry weight. The concentration of applied GA 5 required for floral induction of excised apices (R. W. King, C. Blundell, L. T. Evans [1993] Aust J Plant Physiol 20 : 337 – 348) was similar to that in the shoot apex. Leaf-applied [2 H 4] GA 5 was transported intact from the leaf to the shoot apex, flowering being proportional to the amount of GA 5 imported. Thus, GA 5 could be part of the LD stimulus for <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> of L. temulentum or, alternatively, its increase at the shoot apex could follow import of a primary floral stimulus. Later, during inflorescence differentiation and especially after exposure to additional LD, a second GA action was apparent. The content of GA 1 and GA 4 in the apex increased greatly, whereas GA 5 decreased by up to 75 %. GA 4 applied during inflorescence differentiation strongly promoted flowering and stem elongation, whereas it was ineffective for earlier <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> although it caused stem growth at all times of application. Thus, we conclude that GA 1 and GA 4 are secondary, late-acting LD stimuli for inflorescence differentiation in L. temulentum...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} from vegetative to reproductive development establishes new growth patterns required for flowering. This switch {{is controlled by}} environmental and/or intrinsic developmental cues that converge at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) [1 – 4]. During this developmental transition, floral inductive signals cause the vegetative meristem to undergo morphological changes that are essential for flowering [5, 6]. Arabidopsis plants containing null mutations in two paralogous BEL 1 -like (BELL) homeobox genes, PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF), disrupt the {{transition from}} vegetative to reproductive development. These double mutants are completely unable to flower even though the SAM displays morphological and molecular changes {{that are consistent with}} having received floral inductive signals.

However, flowering was reduced by 22 % during the spring following treatment application. As this reduction in flowering was not accompanied by a decrease in budbreak, the long day effect is not consistent with a delay in the onset of winter chilling.

40|$|Jasmonic acid (JA) is {{implicated in}} a wide variety of {{developmental}} and physiological processes in plants. Here, we studied the effects of JA and the combination of JA and ethylenediamine-dio-hydroxypheny-acetic acid (EDDHA) on flowering in Lemna minor in axenical cultures. JA (0. 475 - 47. 5 nmol l- 1) enhanced floral induction in L. minor under long-day (LD) conditions. Under the same conditions, at the concentration of 237. 5 nmol l- 1, JA inhibited floral induction, and at the concentration of 475 nmol l- 1 it prevented floral induction. Under LD conditions with LD preculture, a combination of EDDHA (20, 500 nmol l- 1) and JA (47. 5 nmol l- 1) had a synergistic effect on the promotion of floral induction. Floral induction was enhanced to the greatest extent in experiments with LD precultures. Microscopic examination of microphotographs of histological sections showed that JA and, to an even greater extent, JA+ EDDHA at optimal concentrations promote apical <b>floral</b> induction (<b>evocation).</b> Furthermore, and to an even greater extent JA in combination with EDDHA in an optimal concentration, also promote flower differentiation, especially the development of stamens, as is evident from themicrophotographs. The experimental results show that JA promotes floral induction in other species of Lemnaceae from various groups according to their photoperiodic response. The results support our hypothesis that, in addition to previosly ascribed functions, JA may regulate <b>floral</b> induction, <b>evocation</b> and <b>floral</b> differentiation. Our hypothesis is supported also by the results obtained by quantitative determination of endogenous JA levels in L. minor at three growth stages. The levels of endogenous JA decreased from 389 ng JA g- 1 (fresh weight) of L. minor during the vegetative stage to 217 ng JA g- 1 during the evocation stage, and to 37. 5 ng JA g- 1 during the flowering stage, which proves that JA is used for flowering...|$|R
40|$|Hydrangea macrophylla is a horticultural plant of {{considerable}} commercial interest {{that has been}} widely studied with the aim to more effectively control the different stages of its development during production. However, although floral transformation is a key factor underlying the commercial quality of the product, it remains difficult to control despite these efforts. The floral transformation sequence consists of three successive phases: floral induction (B 1), <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> (B 2), and floral organogenesis (B 3). The first is a phase of vegetative organogenesis without elongation leading {{to the formation of}} a bud composed of eight phytomer primordia under inductive climatic conditions.

The application of IAA to shoot apex also resulted in the inhibition of flowering. Experiments with TIBA, an auxin polar transport inhibitor, and PCIB, an auxin action inhibitor, have shown that auxin polar transport in cotyledones and long-distance auxin transport from cotyledones to shoot apex play an important role in IAA inhibition of flower bud formation.

An inductive treatment comprising 48 h darkness given to 4 d old plants produced. 100 flowering at the shoot terminal meristem. An inhibitory treatment was developed using 5 min RL breaks during the 48 h dark period. This treatment prevented flowering at the shoot terminal apex and discriminated between events essenttat for flowering and changes resulting from shifts from light to darkness and vice versa. It was shown using shading experiments that the shoot terminal apex may be {{directly involved in the}} reception of red-light. Maximal differences in the proportion of cells in G 2 /G 1 (G 2 /G 1 ratio) were recorded at the light/dark transition (i. e. {{at the end of the}} 48 h dark period). Apices were sampled at this time to construct floral and vegetative cDNA libraries. Less growth occurred in the central zone of the shoot apex. For example, the mitotic index of the central zone was consistently lower than that of the peripheral zone in both vegetative and induced apices. Unusual PLM curves were generated which meant that the component phases of the cell cycle were determined from microdensitometric data. The duration of the cell cycle in the peripheral zone was two-fold longer in vegetative apices compared to floral apices. However, the proportion of cycling cells (the growth fraction) was similar in the peripheral zones of both vegetative and floral apices. Following exposure to RL the duration of G 2 in the peripheral zone increased five-fold. mRNA was separately extracted from 40 floral and vegetative shoot apices. The mRNA was copied into cDNA and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified cDNA was then cloned into two A phage cDNA libraries (floral and vegetative).

The floral specification activity of FT is dependent upon two related BELL 1 -like homeobox (BLH) genes PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF) which are required for <b>floral</b> <b>evocation.</b> PNY and PNF interact with a subset of KNOTTED 1 -LIKE homeobox proteins including SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM).

FT and FD also regulate meristem maintenance during inflorescence development. In plants with reduced STM function, ectopic FT and FD promote the formation of axillary meristems during inflorescence development.

40|$|The main factors {{affecting}} cocksfoot panicle production negatively in Finland were divided in three categories. Firstly, the juvenile stage of cocksfoot {{and a short}} favourable for <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> in the fall caused inadequate <b>floral</b> <b>evocation.</b> Therefore the panicle production in the first harvest year remained small when the stand was sown late in the previous season or was established with a late maturing cover crop. Secondly, damages due to low temperatures {{in the absence of}} snow cover and/or ice cover during winter decreased panicle and seed production. Thirdly, frosts during panicle growth stage destroyed panicles and decreased the seed yield. In addition, a long snow cover period may have decreased the seed yield since d tended to be higher when the snow cover period iin the previous winter was shorter than 120. The cultivar strongly affected the ability of a stand to produce panicles in Finnish conditions. The choice of cultivar is important for abundant panicle production. The average seed yield of the standard cv. Haka was 258 kg ha- 1 (range from 0 eltivar trials at the Agricultural Research Centre [...] The average yield per hectare could be raised by establishing the stands without a cover crop early in the growing season. The present situation in Finland with obligatory fallow makes this kind of establishment recommendable. If the stands established with a late maturing cover crop, the yield of first year stand should be taken for fodder and the second year harvest for seed. Fodder and seed production of cocksfoot should be combined since a seed production stand can give a fodder yield in addition to a seed yield. Combination of fodder and seed production would be important because the fodder yield of the stand can still be high although panicle production, and consequently, seed production fails. Seed production areas where the risk of late spring frost is high should be astised on areas where the risk of ice cover and low temperatures in absence of snow cover is small. However, a long snow cover period is also detrimental for the panicle production. The southern Lake District area in Eastern Finland may have favourable climatic conditions for seed production of cocksfoot, therefore seed production should be tried that area.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this research study was to achieve additional information {{on the process of}} flower bud differentiation in two oil olive cultivars of the Tuscan’s germplasm (‘Leccino’ and ‘Puntino’). Moreover, we studied the effect of different crop load on flower bud differentiation. Samples of axillary meristematic apices were excised from the median portion of two types of one-year-old shoots: ‘ON’ (with fruits) and ‘OFF’ (without fruits). The samplings were periodically collected at different phenological stages from endocarp sclerification to early spring. The thin sections were analysed using histological (apex size), histochemical (starch, soluble carbohydrates, RNA) and immunohistochemical (ZR-Zeatin Riboside) techniques. The micromorphological observations and the histochemical procedures, used to characterise the changes in starch and total carbohydrate accumulation, didn’t permit distinguishing the apices sampled from ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ shoots. ZR immuno-assay made it possible to identify a different localisation pattern between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ samples early on. The citokinine appeared distributed at dome level only in ‘OFF’ apices, particularly in July, at the endocarp sclerification phenological stage. At this time, the further strong signal observed for RNA detection could show that these changes are related to the <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> phase...|$|E

Pêra Rio pôde ser acompanhada pelas variações anatômicas nos meristemas apicais e axilares. Com objetivo de determinar a época na qual ocorre a indução e evocação floral, cortes longitudinais de gemas apicais e axilares, corados com pironina Y-methylgreen foram efetuados em períodos regulares de maio a agosto. Através das mudanças no formato da gema, principalmente diâmetro, que aumentou com a indução, foi possível determinar a época do ano na qual gemas vegetativas são induzidas a florescerem. Foram detectadas variações nos diâmetros das gemas no período de início da morfogênese floral (meados até o final de julho). A medição do diâmetro das gemas mostra-se um procedimento eficiente para acompanhar os fenômenos decorrentes da indução, evocação e morfogênese florais. Gemas vegetativas apresentam diâmetro médio de 100 µm, com túnica composta por três camadas, de formato cônico, recobrindo o corpo, ao passo que a reprodutiva é mais achatada, após a iniciação do primeiro primórdio de sépala, exibindo diâmetro médio de 200 µm. Coloração com pironina Y-methylgreen proporciona a captação do fenômeno da evocação floral, pela detecção de regiões mais concentradas em RNA, nas zonas periféricas das gemas; alteração bioquímica esta que precede a emissão das sépalas.

The production of inflorescence stimulus (induction) and emission of first sepals in a bud determined as a flower bud (<b>floral</b> <b>evocation)</b> in Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck cv. Pêra Rio could be observed through the anatomic variations of the apical and lateral meristems. Longitudinal sections, stained with pironina Y-methylgreen were done in regular periods from May to August. The {{time of the year}} in which the vegetative buds are induced to blossom was determined through the bud shape changes, chiefly considering the diameter, which has increased with the induction. Bud diameter variations were detected on the second half of July, the period of floral morphogenesis incipience. The measurement of the bud diameter is an efficient procedure to follow up the phenomena originated from the floral induction, evocation and morphogenesis. Vegetative buds bring out an average diameter of 100 µm with a three-layer tunic in a conic shape, recovering its body. The reproductive bud, in turn, is flatter, after the initiation of the first sepal primordium, showing an average diameter of 200 µm.

Floral development was studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the flowering sequences. Morphological characters were used to clarify the stages of flowering processes. The time of organogenesis and flowering arrangement was established through field observations. <b>Floral</b> <b>evocation</b> occurred in early September, floral initiation occurred {{in the middle of}} September and floral differentiation began in late September.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{the study of}} mutants {{defective}} in floral development has contributed significantly {{to our understanding of}} <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> and morphogenesis. Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus that play key roles in (i) the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase, (ii) the activation of floral development in specific shoots, and (iii) the unique arrangement of floral organs have been identified genetically and in many cases cloned. Many of the genes appear to encode transcription factors that act to select specific developmental programs of division and differentiation for groups of primordial cells. Other genes may be involved in detecting environmental conditions and transducing the signal to the developing meristems. Key questions remaining include how the regulatory proteins are produced in specific temporal and spatial patterns, interact with each other and initiate specific morphological programs. Although current research on floral morphogenesis has been limited to only a few species there is growing evidence that the basic processes are common to all flowering plants. Thus the information and tools currently being generated should be useful for studying a wide variety of flowering species.

40|$|It {{recently}} {{has been shown}} that 12 -hydroxyjasmonate and its sulfonated derivative occur naturally in A. thaliana (Gidda et al., 2003). The enzyme catalyzing the sulfonation of 12 -OHJA is encoded by the AtST 2 a gene, one of the 18 sulfotransferase (ST) -coding genes present in the A. thaliana genome (Gidda et al., 2003). We demonstrate that 12 -OHJA induces <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> in A. thaliana plants growing under inductive photoperiods and that this inducing activity is abolished by sulfonation under non-inductive photoperiods. We also demonstrate that CONSTANS, a putative transcription factor that accelerates flowering in response to long photoperiod, and TERMINAL FLOWER 2, a homolog of Drosophila heterochromatin-associated protein 1, which acts on meristem identity genes to repress the initiation of flowering, promote or repress flowering through the direct or indirect regulation of AtST 2 a expression. We, therefore, propose that AtST 2 a {{is a member of the}} photoperiod-dependent flower induction pathway downstream from CO and TFL 2. In Nicotiana tabaccum 12 -OHJA is found to participate in the determination of flower structures and regulates the expression of NtPLE 36, a flower organ identity gene. The A. thaliana genome contains a sequence (AtST 2 b) that is closely related to AtST 2 a. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two genes share 85 % identity and 92 % similarity. Despite this high level of similarity AtST 2 b did not accept 12 -OHJA as substrate.

40|$|Florigen, {{a protein}} encoded by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and Heading date 3 a (Hd 3 a) in rice, is the {{universal}} flowering hormone in plants. Florigen is transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem and initiates <b>floral</b> <b>evocation.</b> In shoot apical cells, conserved cytoplasmic 14 - 3 - 3 proteins act as florigen receptors. A hex-americ florigen activation complex (FAC) composed of Hd 3 a, 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, and OsFD 1, a transcription factor, activates OsMADS 15, a rice homolog of Arabidopsis APETALA 1, leading to flowering. Because FD {{is a key}} com-ponent of the FAC, we characterized the FD gene family and their functions. Phylogenetic analysis of FD genes indicated that this family {{is divided into two}} groups: (i) canonical FD genes that are conserved among eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots; and (ii) Poaceae-specific FD genes that are orga-nized into three subgroups: Poaceae FD 1, FD 2 and FD 3. The Poaceae FD 1 group shares a small sequence motif, T(A/V) LSLNS, with FDs of eudicots and non-Poaceae mono-cots. Overexpression of OsFD 2, a member of the Poaceae FD 2 group, produced smaller leaves with shorter plasto-chrons, suggesting that OsFD 2 controls leaf development. In vivo subcellular localization of Hd 3 a, 14 - 3 - 3 and OsFD 2 suggested that in contrast to OsFD 1, OsFD 2 is restricted to the cytoplasm through its interaction with the cytoplasmic 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, and interaction of Hd 3 a with 14 - 3 - 3 facili-tates nuclear translocation of the FAC containing OsFD 2.

40|$|A general {{outline of}} the {{cellular}} and metabolic events linked to floral induction in spinach, a LDP, will be presented. A special emphasis will {{be put on the}} chronology of these events in the meristem, in the leaves and in the petioles. The vegetative and the floral states were first characterized by time series studies including electron microscopy, cytochemical and biochemical techniques. The development of the induced state was then kinetically followed. Various inhibitors and promoters of the flowering process have also been used. According to this experimental protocol, it was shown that the first sign of <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> in the meristem is an activation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) which occurs three hours after the critical photoperiod has been reached. The first ultrastructural events (budding and fragmentation of the plastids) are seen only six hours later. In the leaves, newly synthesized proteins, which are specific for the induced state, are detectable nine hours after the critical photoperiod. Earlier physiological markers have been identified. Among them, the R-FR photocontrol of a peroxidase activity is switched to its specific floral response after three hours, while changes in energy metabolism (adenine and pyridine nucleotides ratios) already occur after one hour. In the petioles, the glucose level is immediately and steadily increased and reaches its maximum value when the PPP is activated in the meristem. Other results have shown that the signal transmitted from the leaves to the meristem can be slowed down by a LiCl pretreatment, suggesting that membrane permeability changes could be implied in floral induction. It can, therefore, be proposed that most of the earliest events of the transition to the floral state are rapid biophysical and biochemical modifications of the structures supporting vegetative growth. Changes in hormonal balances, though still not studied, are also considered as part of these early events which finally result in gene activation, the ultimate event of flower induction...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{maintain}} {{a pool of}} stem cells throughout their lives from which they draw to produce the organs of the adult plant. This strictly regulated pool of stem cells is contained within structures known as meristems. There are several signal transduction pathways known {{that are involved in}} meristem homeostasis. While a number of factors reflecting different regulatory pathways controlling meristem function are known, most of these pathways have significant gaps. This thesis research has been to attempt to identify novel components involved in meristem maintenance. Using a variety of approaches, several were identified and characterized. The first novel component, CCI 1, was identified in a protein-protein interaction screen with CLAVATA pathway kinases CLV 1 and BAM 1. CCI 1 is a previously uncharacterized protein with no known or identifiable domains or motifs. I have shown that CCI 1 directly binds to the receptor proteins and has phosphoinositide-binding activity in vitro. I have also shown that CCI 1 partitions into detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) microdomains with other CLV pathway components. This partitioning is essential for CCI 1 interaction with some CLV components, but not others, when tested in transient expression. The second component characterized was a spontaneous, novel missense allele of BLR. BLR is a homeodomain protein of the BELL family of TALE homeodomain proteins, has previously shown to be essential for internode elongation and <b>floral</b> <b>evocation.</b> The mutation I characterized is a unique allele with dominant negative characteristics that disrupt meristem homeostasis. Genetic interaction analyses as well as protein localization and DNA binding studies suggest that this mutant of BLR disrupts function of the SHOOTMERISTEMLESS transcription factor, known to be essential for meristem maintenance. Finally, I characterized two mutants generated in an EMS enhancer screen in the poltergeist (pol) mutant background. While pol pll 1 double mutants lack stem cells, the pol single mutant provides a genetically sensitized background. I mapped two different mutants to AGO 10 and TONSOKU (TSK). Both genes have been shown to play important roles in meristem maintenance. The specific tsk mutation identified is previously uncharacterized; however the impact of tsk mutants on meristem homeostasis may be an indirect consequence of defects in polarized cell divisions...|$|E

The floral meristems of lfy mutants exhibited increased inflorescence characteristics, and constitutive expression of the gene was sufficient to convert lateral inflorescence meristems to solitary flowers in Arabidopsis, tobacco and Populus. Previous work on the determinate plant, Silene coeli-rosa, which required 7 LD for 100 % flowering, concentrated on changes to the cell cycle and peptide composition of the shoot apex during <b>floral</b> <b>evocation.</b> A partial cDNA clone of a Silene LFY homologue (SFL) has been isolated. SFL shows strong homology to other LFY homologue proteins within the two conserved domains, with up to 88 % identical amino acids. It contains highly acidic and basic domains, a glutamine rich region and leucine repeats: all putat 5 ive transcriptional activation domains. Expression studies using quantitative PCR show that SFL was not induced by non-inductive SD conditions, or by a continuous light treatment that inhibited flowering. This is in contrast to the expression patterns observed in vegetative Arabidopsis, pea, petunia, Impatiens, tobacco and tomato, but consistent with the expression of Antirrhinum homologue which is restricted to the floral meristems. During the 7 LD induction period, SFL transcripts were first detected after 5 LD, a treatment which resulted in 81 % of plants flowering, under the conditions used. Fewer than 5 LD failed to induce flowering or SFL expression. SFL was also expressed in apices subjected to an inductive 7 LD treatment followed by 48 h darkness, which delayed flowering and suppressed the synchronisation of the cell cycle which occurs immediately prior to floral initiation. In situ hybridisation revealed the spatial expression of SFL in Silene. No SFL was detected prior to D 7 during floral induction or in non-inductive SD controls. On experimental D 7, SFL mRNA was restricted to the flanks of the primary apical dome and in D 8 apices expression had spread throughout the dome. Importantly, this pattern of expression differs to that observed in the other two determinate species in which LFY has been studied, namely tobacco and Impatiens...|$|E
40|$|Ptilotus nobilis is a {{short-lived}} perennial wildflower, native to semi-arid and arid areas of Australia. Propagation by vegetative means is {{constrained by the}} early onset and a continuous flowering habit. Despite being defined as the main barrier for vegetative propagation no published research on floral induction and initiation was found. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide the first insights into <b>floral</b> <b>evocation</b> in P. nobilis, with the general objectives being to investigate floral induction and initiation, find the means to maintain plants in the vegetative phase, enhance leaf initiation and to gain knowledge of growth and development with an emphasis on light intensity, temperature and daylength. Early experiments aimed to increase the understanding of growth and development. The main cardinal events were identified including the onset of branching (axillary stem growth), visible bud stage, first floret opening and maturity of the inflorescence. To aid future cultivation schedules, four growing degree days (GDD) and one chronological model, using days after sowing (DAS), were established and validated. All GDD models were accurate in predicting first floret opening and maturity, but not in predicting visible bud stage. Best prediction was achieved by using an upper temperature threshold of 18. 2 ºC and an own base temperature of 5. 0 ºC. Days after sowing were an accurate means of prediction, indicating that temperature and other variables such as light intensity regulate development. A series of defoliation treatments investigated the maintenance of P. nobilis plants in the vegetative phase. Within all treatments, reproductive structures were observed and all plants with more than two true leaves entered the reproductive phase. Plants with less than two true leaves showed a delayed floral bud appearance by up to 20 days. Floral development was affected by most defoliation treatments resulting in vegetative growth within the inflorescences. It is hypothesized that plants have a very short juvenile phase and that a constant floral stimulus may be needed for <b>floral</b> <b>evocation.</b> Using scanning electron and light microscopy a template for the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase was developed. Bract initiation was accompanied by a significant increase in meristem area and diameter, and was defined as the onset of flowering. The established template was used in a subsequent glasshouse trial, which revealed that floral initiation occurred very early and at 25 DAS all plants had entered the reproductive phase. Branching and leaf area expansion were identified as post- initiation processes. Plants were exposed to different light intensities (229. 3, 398. 6 and 909. 3 µmol m- 2 s- 1) in a glasshouse. Under low light, final leaf number increased by up to three leaves, indicating that the vegetative phase was prolonged. Cardinal events were delayed but all plants reached maturity. It was concluded that a light intensity of 229. 3 µmol m- 2 s- 1 was not low enough to prevent floral initiation and that a further decrease of light intensity in combination with temperature could be more effective. Interactions of light intensity, temperature and daylength were investigated. Plants were grown under high light and low light (< 1. 2 MJ m- 2) intensities, 25 / 10 ºC and 35 / 20 ºC and daylengths of 11 h and 16 h. During the trial period (42 days), low light intensity suppressed floral initiation and high temperatures maintained more plants (70 %) in the vegetative phase. However daylength treatments had no effect on the time of bract initiation or the percentage of vegetative plants. After 83 days floral buds and axillary stems were observed on some plants under low light intensity, indicating the onset of the reproductive phase and showing that P. nobilis could not be maintained in the vegetative phase indefinitely. Plants under high light were harvested at maturity and effects of temperature and daylength were analysed. Final leaf number increased under 35 / 20 ºC supporting the previously established results that floral initiation was delayed and leaf production enhanced by high temperature. Morphological data was collected to classify the photoperiodic response of P. nobilis. Plants under 25 / 10 ºC and 11 h had the longest inflorescences and greatest number of buds and flowers, which was also reflected in the buds and flowers dry weight, with an increase of up to 3. 4 fold under these conditions. The difficulty of classifying some plants accordingly to their photoperiodic response and the proposal that P. nobilis may be a facultative short day plant under 25 / 10 ºC is discussed. In summary, this study presents the first evidence that P. nobilis has a very short juvenile phase and that growth and development are mainly driven by light intensity and temperature. It was possible to enhance vegetative growth by defoliation, low light intensity and high temperatures, however this did not fully prevent flowering, which indicates that P. nobilis has a very strong flowering response or signal...|$|E
