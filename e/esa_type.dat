40|$|Background The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) in the {{treatment}} of anaemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly variable regarding patient characteristics and doses, includ-ing the equivalence among ESAs stated in the label product. Purpose To evaluate the use of ESAs for anaemia due to CKD in a university hospital. Materials and Methods A descriptive, transversal study was per-formed in patients treated with ESAs for anaemia secondary to CKD in a university hospital over a month. The principle variable was monthly dose of ESA. Secondary aims were to assess: efficacy (defined in terms of haemoglobin levels [Hb]) and safety (defined in terms of percentage of patients with Hb> 13 g/dl). Variables col-lected were: demographic characteristics, <b>ESA</b> <b>type</b> and dose, pre-scribing Service, Hb, serum creatinine (Cr), C-reactive protein, albumin, ferritin, transferrin saturation index, folate, vitamin B 12 and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Results 333 patients were included (52. 6 % female; median age 75. 2 years). 69. 1 % patients were on pre-dialysis, 27. 6 % on haemodi-alysis and 3. 3 % on peritoneal dialysis. The prescription profile was: 23. 4 % epoetin, 41. 4 % darbepoetin α and 35. 1 % CERA. 97. 0 % pre-scriptions from Nephrology Service. Median [p 25, p 75] dose/mont...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project is to {{investigate}} if microgravity has any influence on growth and differentiation of protoplasts. Formation of new cell walls on rapeseed protoplasts takes place within the first 24 hours after isolation. Cell division can be observed after 2 - 4 days and formation of cell aggregates after 5 - 7 days. Therefore, it is possible during the 7 day IML- 1 Mission to investigate if cell wall formation, cell division, and cell differentiation are influenced by microgravity. Protoplasts of rapeseeds and carrot will be prepared shortly before launch and injected into 0. 6 ml polyethylene bags. Eight bags are placed in an aluminum block inside the <b>ESA</b> <b>Type</b> 1 container. The containers are placed at 4 C in PTCU's and transferred to orbiter mid-deck. At 4 C all cell processes are slowed down, including cell wall formation. Latest access to the shuttle will be 12 hours before launch. In orbit the containers {{will be transferred from}} the PTC box to the 22 C Biorack incubator. The installation of a 1 g centrifuge in Biorack will make it possible to distinguish between effects of near weightlessness and effects caused by cosmic radiation and other space flight factors including vibrations. Parallel control experiments will be carried out on the ground. Other aspects of the experiment are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{population}} growth and economic change on the tropical islands of Mauritius have led {{to one of the}} highest rates of urban build-out in the world. Pressure on many of the island's natural features and resources increasingly risks further degradation to the environmental services that they provide to the country. Fourteen types of marine and terrestrial environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) are critical to the nation's sustainable development. Twelve of these <b>ESA</b> <b>types</b> are currently at risk of degradation, owing to their spatial proximity to built-up areas (BUAs) and current use designation. There was a bimodal distribution in proximity; eight of the 12 <b>ESA</b> <b>types</b> analysed had an area-weighted modal peak < 500 m from the nearest BUA, and four ESAs had a modal peak 2 – 3 km from the nearest BUA. Six coastal and marine ESAs had limited protection from urban expansion and over-use. The Mauritian experience reflects trends that are emerging across many tropical developing countries, where the bulk of future global growth in urban area is expected to occur. The approach detailed in this case study is replicable and may be useful in assessing degradation risk as a result of urban expansion in other island countries. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{highlight}} the uncertainties in planning development of ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs) and to analyse the types of knowledge relied on in most of the planning decisions about <b>ESAs.</b> Certain <b>types</b> of knowledge have been excluded from the formal planning system that includes both the policy - or decision-making authorities and the tribunals that test planning decisions. The Wanganui River minimum flows hearings are used as a case study to illustrate the obstacles to the integration of alternative knowledge with science as evidence in the formal planning system...|$|R
5000|$|An {{environmentally}} sensitive area (<b>ESA)</b> is a <b>type</b> of designation for an agricultural area which needs special protection because of its landscape, wildlife or historical value. The scheme was introduced in 1987. Originally it was administered by Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, then the Rural Development Service for the United Kingdom Governments Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and currently Natural England following successive re-organisation of the departments. In 2005 the scheme was superseded by Environmental Stewardship and closed to new entrants. Existing agreements remain active until they expire, meaning the designation will remain active until 2014.|$|R
40|$|HIP 7666 is a {{variable}} star newly discovered during the Hipparcos mission and classified as of unknown <b>type</b> (<b>ESA</b> 1997). During 23 nights between July 2000 and November 2000, over 2300 CCD observations in the V band {{were obtained from}} Hostalets de Pierola and Monegrillo observatories in Spain. These data show that the new variable is a detached eclipsing binary system with an orbital period of 2. 37229 days. In addition, one of the components undergoes very short-period oscillations with a main pulsation frequency of 24. 46 or 25. 47 c/d. HIP 7666 is therefore a new member of the presently very few known detached eclipsing binary systems with a Delta Scuti type component. Comment: 6 pages, 8 Postscript figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the size of a {{wireless}} system, we have proposed the design formulas for an electrically small antenna (ESA), i. e. an antenna whose dimension is much smaller than a wavelength, with a miniaturized matching circuit which connects to a 50 ohm external circuit. We designed a slot dipole antenna with the aid of the simulations using the electrical circuits as well as the electromagnetic field (EM field) simulator. The size of the designed antenna including the matching circuit is 4. 1 mm × 1. 9 mm on MgO substrate with relative permittivity of 9. 6 at the center frequency of 5 GHz, and the designed fractional bandwidth is 13 %@RL= 3 dB. We also made experiments on the slot dipole <b>type</b> <b>ESA</b> with a matching circuit using YBCO thin films on MgO substrates. 1...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIStateful aspects {{can react}} to the trace of a program execution; they can support modular {{implementations}} of several crosscutting concerns like error detection, security, event handling, and debugging. However, most proposed stateful aspect languages have specifically been tailored to address a particular concern. Indeed, most of these languages differ in their pattern languages and semantics. As a consequence, developers need to tweak aspect definitions in contortive ways or create new specialized stateful aspect languages altogether if their specific needs are not supported. In this paper, we describe ESA, an expressive stateful aspect language, in which the pattern language is Turing-complete and patterns themselves are reusable, composable first-class values. In addition, the core semantic elements of every aspect in ESA areopen to customization. We describe <b>ESA</b> in a <b>typed</b> functional language. We use this description to develop a concrete and practical implementation of ESA for JavaScript. With this implementation, we illustrate the expressiveness of ESA in action with examples of diverse scenarios and expressing semantics of existing stateful aspect languages...|$|R
40|$|Main Belt Comets (MBCs) are a newly {{identified}} population, with stable asteroid-like orbits in {{the outer}} main belt and a comet-like appearance. It is believed that they survived {{the age of the}} solar system in a dormant state and that their activity occurred only recently. Water ice is the only volatile expected to survive, and only when buried under an insulating surface. Excavation by impact could bring the water ice (closer) to the surface and trigger the start of MBC activity. The specific science goals of the Castalia mission are: 1. Characterize a new Solar System family, the MBCs, by in-situ investigation 2. Understand the physics of activity on MBCs 3. Directly detect water in the asteroid belt 4. Test if MBCs are a viable source for Earth’s water 5. Use MBCs as tracers of planetary system formation and evolution These goals can be achieved by a spacecraft designed to rendezvous with and orbit an MBC for some months, arriving before the active period begins for mapping before directly sampling the gas and dust released during the active phase. Given the low level of activity of MBCs, and the expectation that their activity comes from only a localized patch on the surface, the orbiting spacecraft will {{have to be able to}} maintain a very close orbit over extended periods - the Castalia plan envisages an orbiter capable of ‘hovering’ autonomously at distances of only a few km from the surface of the MBC. The straw-man instrument payload is made up of: - Visible and near-infrared spectral imager - Thermal infrared imager - Radio science - Dust impact detector - Dust composition analyzer - Neutral/ion mass spectrometer - Magnetometer - Plasma package In addition to this, the option of a surface science package is being considered. At the moment MBC 133 P/Elst-Pizarro is the best-known target for such a mission. A design study for the Castalia mission has been carried out in partnership between the science team, DLR and OHB Systems. This study looked at possible missions to 133 P with launch dates around 2025, and found that this (and other MBC targets as backups) are reachable with an <b>ESA</b> M-class <b>type</b> mission...|$|R
3000|$|In 1983, Kato wrote {{a further}} {{paper on the}} Dirac Coulomb problem [353] (see also [354]) {{which seems to be}} little known (I only learned of it while {{preparing}} this article). To understand Kato’s idea, return to -Δ -β r^- 2 on L^ 2 (R^ν [...]), ν> 5 as discussed in Proposition 7.7 above. If 0 < β<ν (ν - 4) 4, then H(β [...]) can be defined as the operator closure of the operator on C_ 0 ^∞ (R^ν [...]). It is self-adjoint and except at the upper end, we know the domain is that of -Δ. For ν (ν - 4) 4 < β<(ν - 2)^ 24, there is a Friedrichs extension since -Δ -β r^- 2 > 0 on C_ 0 ^∞ (R^ν [...]). Kato notes that the Friedrichs extension is natural from the following point of view: H(β [...]) is an analytic family of operators for 0 < β < (ν - 2)^ 24 and is the unique analytic family from the <b>esa</b> region—it is <b>type</b> (A) if β∈ (0,ν (ν - 4) 4) and type (B) if β∈ (0,(ν - 2)^ 24). (In fact, it can proven that as a holomorphic family, there is a square root singularity at β = (ν - 2)^ 24 and in the variable m = √(β -(ν - 2)^ 24), one has a holomorphic family in [...] Re (m) > - 1; see Bruneau–Dereziński–Georgescu [76]).|$|R
