25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and drift {{down the hall toward}} other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms had no way to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E
500|$|Hill did {{not want}} an {{extensive}} tour because of obligations to her family and the difficulties she experienced touring with the Fugees in 1996, which she found desensitizing and isolating. According to Hill biographer Chris Nickson in 1999, [...] "there was the possibility of more dates being added... but {{it was unlikely that}} Lauryn would be willing to make the tour more grueling and draining. She'd come to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much more to life than a career." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} to [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] {{was directed by}} Shapovalov, and was shot at the Khodynka Field in Moscow between 4–7 September 2000. Preparation for the visual consisted of both Volkova and Katina covering themselves in dark-tanning lotion and getting haircuts. Over 90 people were present on set, including extra actors, whilst some members had designed a large brick wall by painting abstract patterns and colors to it. According to Shapovalov, the wall itself cost approximately $3000 USD. After shooting {{the majority of the}} scenes in Khodynka Field, Shapovalov moved the wall and iron fence to Kutuzov Avenue, Moscow, in order to shot frames of traffic until the camera changed its focus on the girls again. Shapovalov stated that he wanted the viewers to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "world behind the crowd of people." [...] The video was broadcast in Russia and Europe in early December 2000 on MTV.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast on Knots Landing, Mills was {{predominantly}} known for playing [...] "damsel in distress" [...] roles, {{which is why}} the producers didn't initially consider her. Abby's storylines focused on business dealings, affairs and family troubles. Introduced as the sister of Sid Fairgate, she was initially portrayed as a friendly, warm-hearted woman with great love for her children. In due time, she evolved into the series' main antagonist, constantly causing mayhem in others' lives. According to series creator David Jacobs, the producers always intended Abby to be a J.R. Ewing-esque character. Jacobs said, [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, we were looking for a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." ...|$|E

500|$|Abby {{was always}} {{intended}} to be the show's promiscuous seductress. In an interview with Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune, Jacobs said: [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, {{we were looking for}} a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." [...] Author June L. May of Monsters and Critics said, [...] "In season two of Knots Landing, a catalyst moves into the neighborhood in the form of Sid’s sister, the drop dead gorgeous Abby Cunningham. [...] Whether Abby is directly involved, or simply in the neighborhood, she has a detrimental affect on the harmony of couples." [...] Almost immediately, Abby sank her claws into Richard Avery (John Pleshette), one of the neighborhood husbands. Though the affair was brief, it set the stage for what was to come.|$|E
2500|$|Loudhailers {{were used}} to order {{residents}} of High Cape to evacuate, {{as well as in}} the aforementioned areas. [...] The fire had originally spread from the UCT and Rhodes Memorial area to the other end of the mountain within 2 hours.

2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something on radio by Maria.|$|E
2500|$|Dukat {{played a}} {{versatile}} role throughout the series and {{was often a}} nuanced character. In the words of Deep Space Nine co-executive producer Ronald D. Moore, [...] "I don't {{think of him as}} being completely evil through and through ... He can be charming. He can be generous. He can do the right thing. All of that somehow makes his 'evil' actions all the more despicable, because we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> the potential in there for him to be a better person." [...] Ultimately, despite the character's versatility, [...] "Dukat is a bad guy. A very bad guy." [...] Indeed, StarTrek.com describes him as [...] "the most complex and fully developed villain in Star Trek history".|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{was born}} on 18 November 1953, at St Edmond's Hospital in Northampton to a working-class family who he {{believed}} {{had lived in the}} town for several generations. He grew up in a part of Northampton known as The Boroughs, a poverty-stricken area with a lack of facilities and high levels of illiteracy, but he nonetheless [...] "loved it. I loved the people. I loved the community and... I didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything else." [...] He lived in his house with his parents, brewery worker Ernest Moore, and printer Sylvia Doreen, with his younger brother Mike and his maternal grandmother. He [...] "read omnivorously" [...] from the age of five, getting books out of the local library, and subsequently attended Spring Lane Primary School. At the same time, he began reading comic strips, initially British strips, such as Topper and The Beezer, but eventually also American imports such as The Flash, Detective Comics, Fantastic Four, and Blackhawk. He later passed his 11-plus exam, and was therefore eligible to go to Northampton Grammar School, where he first came into contact with people who were middle class and better educated, and he was shocked at how he went from being one of the top pupils at his primary school to one of the lowest in the class at secondary. Subsequently, disliking school and having [...] "no interest in academic study", he believed that there was a [...] "covert curriculum" [...] being taught that was designed to indoctrinate children with [...] "punctuality, obedience and the acceptance of monotony".|$|E

2500|$|He {{focused on}} his {{opposition}} to abortion and gun control, {{as well as his}} support for lower taxes and free-market health care solutions. [...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
2500|$|After it was {{confirmed}} that Taylforth {{was returning to}} EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: [...] "It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy—and lots of Phil [...] involved." [...] Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption [...] "He's on his way...". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it {{was confirmed}} that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: [...] "I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for {{what is going to be}} an exciting time ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers have grown up with Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him back on our screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets." [...] Nicholas later said it was [...] "great" [...] for him to join a [...] "brilliantly produced and very well acted" [...] show, but said it was [...] "quite daunting" [...] as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a [...] "really good insight into where they wanted it to go" [...] and added, [...] "It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch." [...] Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015.|$|E
