Six varieties of Egusi from three species of cucurbit were evaluated for {{the fruit and}} the seed yield at the Agricultural Research Centre of Niaouli (South-Benin). Using randomised blocs, the agronomic characters such as the germination percentage, the fl owering date, the number of fruit per plant, the average fruit weight, the weight of 1, 000 unhulled seed, the weight of 1, 000 <b>hulled</b> <b>seed,</b> the ratio kernel/seed, the fruit yield, the unhulled seed yield and the <b>hulled</b> <b>seed</b> yield (kg. ha- 1) were measured. Out of the six varieties, Aklamkpa (Lagenaria siceraria) showed the highest yield for dehulled and unhulled seed. It is followed by Kilonon and Kakoun (Citrullus lanatus) which yielded more than 200 kg. ha- 1. In contrary Zohan (Cucumeropsis edulis), well appreciated by consumers for its organoleptic qualities, appeared to have the lowest yield {{in addition to the}} fact that it is a late variety. The prediction model analysis indicated that the number of fruits per plant and the average fruit weight are good estimators of the unhulled and <b>hulled</b> <b>seed</b> yield and could effectively contribute to the increase of seed yield in egusi crops...|$|E

The general applicability of GAME was demonstrated with experiments with sesame, linseed, rapeseed, palm kernel and jatropha (hulled and dehulled) at 40 °C and varying mechanical pressures (10 – 70 MPa). Furthermore, the influence of moisture content, temperature and CO 2 -pressure on oil yield and rate of seedbed compaction was investigated. Yields obtained with GAME were up to 30 wt. % higher than conventional expression at the same effective mechanical pressure and temperature. GAME yields for <b>hulled</b> and dehulled <b>seeds</b> were very similar, despite the lower yields for <b>hulled</b> <b>seeds</b> in conventional expression. Up to 10 MPa CO 2 yield increased significantly with CO 2 -pressure. The displacement of oil by dissolved CO 2 was identified as the major cause of increased oil yields for both <b>hulled</b> and dehulled <b>seeds.</b> The entrainment of oil during CO 2 depressurization is another major cause of increasing oil yield for <b>hulled</b> <b>seeds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Wheat with {{hulled grain}} is einkorn (Triticum monococcum L), emmer (Triticum dicoccum Schrank) and spelt wheat (Triticum spelta L). During the wheat harvest spikes {{decompose}} to spikelets {{in which the}} grain (caryopsis) is tightly wrapped in chaffs and glumes. Since this hulled grain is improper for human diet {{it is necessary to}} peel it off mechanically before the use. The seed, i. e. the grain of true cereals, has about a hundred of characteristics, of which 20 % have significance for the market, while 10 - 15 % is officially studied. Hulled grain or <b>hulled</b> <b>seed</b> is the term that exists in the market of world trade. Introduction of hulled wheat into production and its growing presence on the market imposes the need for a clearer presentation of the grain presence in the crowd of hulled grain. As a result of our previous studies on spelt wheat we defined the term - the hull index (HI), that presents the ratio between the weight of un hulled and hulled grain.

40|$|The buffalo gourd (Cucurbita foetidissima), a xerophytic gourd {{indigenous}} to the southwestern United States, has been touted a potential food source, particularly in arid and semi-arid {{regions of the}} world. Protein isolates from seeds of the gourd were prepared according to sophisticated laboratory and rudimentary village procedures. Prior to preparation of the isolates, levels of trypsin inhibitors, lectins, phytates and flatulent oligosaccharides were measured in defatted, <b>hulled</b> <b>seed.</b> These compounds exist, in xerophytic and domestic squashes, in similar or reduced amounts relative to soybean meal and should pose no noxious threat to the food quality of the protein isolates. The efficacy of protein extraction by a monovalent extractant, sodium hydroxide, was compared to a divalent solvent, calcium hydroxide. These species of protein isolates were compared to isolate prepared, in a similar manner, from seeds of Hubbard squash (Cucurbita maxima), a domestic squash. Chemical analyses indicated sodium hydroxide was the most effective extractant, regardless of procedure or species. Protein content was greater in the laboratory procedure, but amino acid levels were comparable in both laboratory and village processes, in both cucurbit species. Lysine and threonine {{were found to be}} limiting amino acids in the isolates compared to the FAO provisional pattern. The amino acid patterns of cucurbit protein isolates were comparable to those of sunflower, safflower and flax but inferior to soybean and rapeseed isolates. When the village procedure, sodium hydroxide extraction, was expanded to a large-scale operation, permitting the production of ample quantities of isolate for animal studies, the amino acid profile became more deficient. The large-scale extraction process was less effective in extracting a high quality protein, albeit the protein and fat content were comparable to the small-scale procedure. Biological evaluation, e. g., total weight gain and PER, of these protein isolates revealed the cucurbit protein isolates were minimally effective as a protein source, whether as a supplementation to sorghum and millet diets or as a sole source of protein.

The seeds of each F 1 {{and the parents}} were harvested on 35 days after flowering. Combining ability was analyzed in 25 combinations made by 5 CMS lines and 5 restorer lines (North Carolina II mating design). The seed dormancy index of F 1 was positively and highly significantly correlated with those of their parents and mid-parent value. Out of the 109 combinations, 82 combinations showed mid-parent heterosis, and 43 heterobeltiosis. Seed dormancy indices of F 1 s and their parents declined dramatically in dehulled <b>seeds</b> compared with <b>hulled</b> <b>seeds,</b> indicating that the hull {{played an important role}} in seed dormancy. However, the trends were similar in <b>hulled</b> <b>seeds</b> and dehulled seeds in terms of relationships between the seed dormancy indicices in F 1 and their parents. The influence of <b>hull</b> on <b>seed</b> dormancy mainly depended on F 1 genotype, not on the hull from maternal parent. The variances of general combining ability (GCA) in female and male parents occupied 59. 2 % and 31. 1 % of total variance, respectively. The variance of specific combining ability (SCA) in combinations occupied 9. 7 % of total variance, indicating that gene additive effects were principal. Among the 5 CMS lines, II 112 A had the highest GCA effect for seed dormancy, followed by D 62 A. Among the 5 restorer lines, IR 112 had the highest GCA effect for seed dormancy, followed by 2786.

40|$|Spelt wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) (spelta group) is an ancient, hulled, {{specialty}} wheat {{which is}} presently grown {{on a limited}} scale as a fall-sown crop in Western Europe. Little {{is known about the}} agronomics and growth characteristics of spring spelt, a potential specialty wheat for western Canada. The main objectives of this study were to compare the yield potential and growth characteristics of spring spelt wheat to that of common spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) in central Saskatchewan, using growth analysis; to investigate the response of spring spelt to seeding date; and to determine the effect of the hulls of spelt on seedling emergence and establishment under adverse temperature and moisture conditions. The seeding rate and growth analysis experiment was conducted in the field using two spring spelt cultivars (CDC Bavaria and PGR 8801) and a common wheat cultivar (Katepwa) at four seeding rates ranging from 150 to 450 seeds/m 2 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1995 and 1996. The response of spring spelt and common wheat to seeding date was measured from late April to early June under field conditions over two years. The role of spelt hulls on seed germination, seedling emergence and crop establishment was studied under field conditions using an early (late April) and a late (early June) date of seeding over two years. Seed germination, seedling establishment and seed water uptake were studied under controlled environment conditions at water potentials ranging from 0 to - 1. 8 MPa, at temperatures of 9, 16 and 23 °C. The field studies indicated that spring spelt can produce grain yield comparable to common wheat. The same seeding rate as common wheat (150 to 250 seeds/m 2) can be used for spring spelt wheat in central Saskatchewan. Spring spelt has a higher leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD) and crop growth rate (CGR) than common wheat, giving rise to 24 per cent higher biological yield for spring spelt compared to that of common wheat. Optimal seeding date for spring spelt is late April to early May; with later seeding spring spelt's grain yield tends to decrease. Seedling establishment for spring spelt is lower and less stable than common wheat, though this variation in seedling plant density does not influence the final grain yield. Controlled environment studies indicated that the hull of spring spelt wheat acts as an obstacle to water uptake, leading to an approximate 25 per cent slower water uptake rate compared to naked seeds. The hull has negative impact on seed germination and seedling emergence. The negative impact of the hull on seed water uptake, seed germination and seedling emergence increases under drought conditions. Thus, only under sufficiently wet soil conditions may using <b>hulled</b> <b>seed</b> as the propagule lead to comparable establishment of spring spelt relative to common wheat. In conclusion, spring spelt can be grown successfully in central Saskatchewan, producing a comparable grain yield to common wheat provided it is seeded before mid-May...|$|E
