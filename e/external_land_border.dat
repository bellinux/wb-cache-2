The Federal Police is also responsible for the security of the railway network, airport security and the protection of federal buildings. However, as the entire title Xa has not been changed after it had been passed in 1968, the term Federal Border Guard is still used in the constitution.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the first {{deployment of the}} Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABITs) to Greece’s <b>external</b> <b>land</b> <b>border</b> with Turkey on 2 November 2010. It argues that the sending of the RABITs to Greece reveals some of the core challenges inherent in Europe’s external border and asylum policies. Most importantly, it signals {{the limits of the}} principle of solidarity and fair-sharing of responsibility and the failure of the EU Dublin System. The paper argues that the sending of RABITs fails to show a long-standing (solidarity-based) answer by the EU to the situation of unrest taking place in Greece on two grounds: First, the deployment is merely of a emergency, temporary and (in) security (police) -driven nature; and second, the strengthening of the common EU <b>external</b> <b>land</b> <b>border</b> between Greece and Turkey may further increase the tensions by enlarging the distance between the external border control practices and Europe’s commitment to the rights and freedoms of asylum-seekers and refugees...|$|E

This situation is determined by the existence of two sectors of EU <b>external</b> <b>land</b> <b>border</b> (Balkan and Eastern), which summarizes 1877, 1 km, representing 60 % of the Romanian state border.

40|$|This volume {{presents}} {{the final results}} of the CHALLENGE research project (The Changing Landscape of European Liberty and Security) - a five-year project funded by the Sixth Framework Programme of DG Research of the European Commission. The book critically appraises the liberties of citizens and others within the EU, and the {{different ways in which}} they are affected by the proliferation of discourses, practices and norms of insecurity enacted in the name of collective and individual safety. It analyses from an interdisciplinary perspective the impacts of new techniques of surveillance and control on the liberty and security of the citizen. The book studies illiberal practices of liberal regimes in the field of security, and the relationship between the internal and external effects of these practices in an increasingly interconnected world, as well as the effects in relation to the place of the EU in world politics.

40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} relict <b>land</b> <b>border</b> between Bohemia and Moravia {{in the context}} of Moravistic {{movement}} which appeared in Czechia after 1989. Aim of the thesis is to assess the existence of relict <b>land</b> <b>border</b> in the minds of people and to reflect the role of the <b>land</b> <b>border</b> in relation to the revival of regionalism and nationalism. The first part of the thesis discusses the theory of relict border, regional identity and nation in the literature. The second part compares the course of the <b>land</b> <b>border</b> with territorial reach of declaring Moravian nationality by inhabitants of the districts adjacent to the border in contemporary censuses and also with the range of the success of Moravistic politic parties in elections. The objective is to compare the border with one of the possible contemporary zones which could delimitate Moravia. The third part of the thesis analyzes the forms and contexts of Moravian identity in two selected municipalities adjacent to the <b>land</b> <b>border.</b> These municipalities represent distinct types of the Czech-Moravian borderland which differ by declaring the nationality, achievements of Moravistic parties in elections, population change after 1945 and inclusion to administrative units in Bohemia or in Moravia. Finally, awareness of the course of the <b>land</b> <b>border</b> in these [...] ...|$|R
