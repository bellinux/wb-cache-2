40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} accuracy of different intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulas for eyes with an axial length (AL) greater than 26. 00 [*]mm. Methods. This study reviewed 407 eyes of 219 patients with AL longer than 26. 0 [*]mm. The refractive prediction errors of IOL power calculation formulas (SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay, Hoffer Q, and Barrett Universal II) using User Group for Laser Interference Biometry (ULIB) constants were evaluated and compared. Results. One hundred seventy-one eyes were enrolled. The Barrett Universal <b>II</b> <b>formula</b> had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and SRK/T and Haigis had similar MAE, and the statistical highest MAE were seen with the Holladay and Hoffer Q formulas. The interquartile range of the Barrett Universal <b>II</b> <b>formula</b> was also the lowest among all the formulas. The Barrett Universal <b>II</b> <b>formulas</b> yielded {{the highest percentage of}} eyes within ± 1. 0 [*]D and ± 0. 5 [*]D of the target refraction in this study (97. 24 % and 79. 56 %, resp.). Conclusions. Barrett Universal <b>II</b> <b>formula</b> produced the lowest predictive error and the least variable predictive error compared with the SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay, and Hoffer Q formulas.

40|$|We {{define a}} notion of Lambda-simulation for coalgebraic modal logics, {{parametric}} on the choice Lambda of predicate liftings for a functor T. We show this notion is adequate in several ways: i) it preserves truth of positive <b>formulas,</b> <b>ii)</b> for Lambda a separating set of monotone predicate liftings, the associated notion of Lambda-bisimulation corresponds to T-behavioural equivalence (moreover Lambda-n-bisimulations correspond to T-n-behavioural equivalence), and iii) in fact, for Lambda-separating and T preserving weak pullbacks, difunctional Lambda-bisimulations are T-bisimulations. In essence, we arrive at a modular notion of equivalence that, when used with a separating set of monotone predicate liftings, coincides with T-behavioural equivalence regardless of whether T preserves weak pullbacks (unlike the notion of T-bisimilarity) ...|$|R
