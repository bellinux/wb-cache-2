6000|$|Allan {{looked and}} spoke with a dogged {{determination}} which was quite new in his old friend's experience of him.

He had overtaken Midwinter on the road; and--after trying vainly first to induce him to return, then {{to find out where}} he was going to--had threatened to keep company with him {{for the rest of the}} day, and had so extorted the confession that he was going to try his luck in London. Having gained this point, Allan had asked next for his friend's address in London, had been entreated by the other not to press his request, had pressed it, nevertheless, with all his might, and had got the address at last by making an appeal to Midwinter's gratitude, for which (feeling heartily ashamed of himself) he had afterward asked Midwinter's pardon. [...] "I like the poor fellow, and I won't give him up," [...] concluded Allan, bringing his clinched fist down with a thump on the rectory table.

"I can {{understand}} that after all your life looking at the captain as your father, and after {{he and his wife}} being everything to you, you would find it mighty hard to regard me in that way. I don't expect it, and I don't want it. If he is not your father by blood, he is your father in right of bringing you up and caring for you and educating you, and it is quite right and quite proper that you should always regard him so. You can look upon me, lad, just as a foster-father--as the husband of the woman who was for a time your nurse, and who would gladly repair the wrongs he did to you. I <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> lad, to make things straight between us. I want us to be friends. I am an old soldier, and you a young one. We are comrades in this expedition.

If I can lend you a helping hand on or off duty, you know I shall do so. So let us shake hands on it, and agree to let the matter drop altogether until this campaign is over. Then we will talk over together what had best be done. A few months longer of this life will do you no harm, and you will make all the better officer for having had two or three years in the ranks. But I will say at once that I think that you are wrong, now you know how the matter stands, in not writing at once to the captain and letting him know the truth. Still there is no harm in its standing over for the present. You must go through the expedition as you are now, and they would be no easier for knowing that you are exposed to danger out here than they are at present when they know nothing of your whereabouts." ...|$|E

You can't get him {{to learn to read}} by telling him that it will improve his mind--but you can by getting him to look at a picture book. You can't get him to drink senna and salts by reasoning with him about its doing him good--but you can by promising him a lump of sugar to take after it. You admit this sort of principle so far, because you're obliged; but the moment anybody wants (in a spirit of perfect reverence and desire to do good) to extend it to higher things, you purse up your lips, shake your head, and talk about Rationalism--as if that was an answer! Well! well! it's no use talking--go your own way--I wash my hands of the business altogether. But now I am at it I'll <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> one thing more before I've done:--your way of punishing the boy for his behavior in church is, in my opinion, about as bad and dangerous a one as could possibly be devised. Why not give him a thrashing, if you must punish the miserable little urchin for what's his misfortune as much as his fault? Why not stop his pudding, or something of that sort? Here you are associating verses in the Bible, in his mind, with the idea of punishment and being locked up in the cold! You may make him get his text by heart, I dare say, by fairly tiring him out; but I tell you what I'm afraid you'll make him learn too, if you don't mind--you'll make him learn to dislike the Bible as much as other boys dislike the birch-rod!" ...|$|E

Meanwhile, new student nurses Sabrina Santiago and Felix DuBois plan with Elizabeth Webber to revive the old annual Nurses' Ball. Valentini had hinted at the return of the ball a few months prior at the annual GH Fan Club Weekend, stating [...] "I’ll <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> I love music and I love Nurses." [...] Valentini later confirmed the revival of the ball, scheduled to coincide with the series' 50th anniversary on April 1, 2013.

By the end of 2012, rating for General Hospital rose to over three million, the highest in two years. Ratings in the target demographic of women 18 to 34 years old were reported to have risen 44% year over year. MSN Money cited General Hospital as leading a revival of the soap opera genre, stating, [...] "Soap fans say the reason for GH's resurgence is simple: The show got a lot better." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide named General Hospital the best soap of 2012, stating, [...] "This time last year, General Hospital was considered dead as disco, a show merely waiting to be officially canceled by ABC. (...) GH was handed to OLTL's head writer, Ron Carlivati, and exec producer Frank Valentini, who quickly amped up the action, humor and romance and energized the cast by adding top stars from GH's past as well as popular refugees from Llanview. Voilà! Dreary, messy GH was suddenly a thrilling, surprise-packed, can't-miss experience." [...] The series gained more press in early January when it was announced Genie Francis would reprise her role as Laura Spencer for an unknown length of time. [...] "We can't say that 'General Hospital' and Port Charles become overwhelmed with vampires, because they don’t. But there is some real concern and some questions and confusion and mistaken identity and all those things make for good plotting. It’s really how does the story fit that story and all the baggage that comes back with people like Lynn Herring and me and Michael Easton and Kelly Monaco?" [...] —Jon Lindstrom (Kevin Collins) on the vampire story arc. On New Year's Eve, a car carrying Connie and Johnny collides with a car carrying Michael, Kristina, Starr, and Trey, then hits Ellie Trout. Trey becomes braindead, and Kristina and Connie take him off life support. Ellie is temporarily thought to be paralyzed. That night Maxie miscarries Dante and Lulu's baby, and becomes pregnant again after sleeping with Damian Spinelli. She keeps it all a secret after Spinelli chooses to be with Ellie. Meanwhile, during February Sweeps, Lucy runs into John McBain and believes he is Caleb Morley, whom she calls king of the vampires. She is sent to Ferncliff after she stabs McBain and asserts that she is a vampire slayer. The storyline references the past spin-off Port Charles, where Michael Easton played Caleb and Kelly Monaco played Livvie Locke. Valentini asserted [...] "we're not doing vampires" [...] and that the story was homage to the actors and characters involved. Carlivati commented, [...] "The story does get pretty over-the-top yet it's still rooted in a certain reality. Lucy may be off-kilter but she's certainly not in Heather Webber territory. Her belief in vampires will be very convincing." [...] Another former Port Charles character, Alison Barrington, arrives with her now teenage son Rafe Kovich, Jr.. McBain is arrested under suspicion of murdering Alison, while Caleb is revealed, seen to be a different person than McBain. A.J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) comes back to town after hearing that his brother Jason (Steve Burton) is presumed dead.|$|E
40|$|Demonstrating {{ideas for}} better {{varieties}} Cue: Year-by-year farmers have more seeds {{to choose from}} as seed companies bring new varieties to the market. And {{what better way to}} see what you will get for your money - than a demonstration plot. In a demonstration, farmers and seed merchants or researchers work together. They collect a good selection of improved - and local - seeds. They decide on a plot where the seed can be grown, and then they invite farmers from the local community to come and see and discuss the results. If, as the saying goes ?seeing is believing?, then seeing the results on the demonstration plots makes seed choice - and the results of storing seed correctly - crystal clear. In Malawi, Wed Chipungu runs dozens of seed demonstration plots in his work with the Pannar Seed Company. As he tells Patrick Mphaka, he believes the benefits can be greatest if farmers are involved in managing the whole thing. IN:		?What we do, we do not manage the demo plots? OUT:		?So that is my advice. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 26 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Wed Chipungu works with the Pannar Seed Company Limited in Malawi to promote demonstration field days. He was speaking to Patrick Mphaka. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Chipungu	What we do, we do not manage the demo plots, it is the local farmers themselves that manage the demos. So the people around that farm can learn from that farmer how to manage the crop and they can choose the variety which is doing better in that area. Mphaka	So in other words what you are saying {{is that it is not}} the seeds which we see but the way they can perform after we have planted them that will tell a good story? Chipungu	Yes a good story because on seed we cannot <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is a good variety without showing a farmer how it performs. But farmers have to know, to see it performing himself not just telling him. That is why we do give some seed to local farmers in the villages to see how it performs themselves. Mphaka	Once you have given that seed to some farmers in the villages to what extent do you think other farmers who have not been given the seed can also learn from the farmer whom you have given the seed to demonstrate? Chipungu	What we do is we distribute some trial seeds in all districts of the country, then during a certain time of the year we conduct field days and we do invite local villages, farmers around that area to attend that field day. So on that day it is when the farmers see themselves, how the varieties are performing and we do ask them to choose which variety they think is better. We want to see the actual thing happening in the field. Mphaka	Taking what you do as a model, what tips would you give farmers? Chipungu	First of all I have to say that a seed is a living thing, they have bought that seed, they have to keep it properly so that it should not die because if they put it on a wet place or at a hot place it will die. So the first thing is to keep the seed safely. 	It is an advice to local farmers, they must not buy seed from, I can say vendors. When I am saying vendors I mean there is no way somebody can just carry seed in a vehicle and start selling like bread. You can buy seed from authorised dealers because if you just buy seed from elsewhere you will regret after a year it is not seed. Mphaka	It might have expired? Chipungu	Expired. Mphaka	Or they might have picked it from a rubbish bin somewhere? Chipungu	Yes that is what people are doing. So that is my advice. End of trackHow farmers can share ideas and learn about improved varieties...|$|E

I would watch Metalocalypse and the little bird logo would come up at the end and chirp and I’d think, 'Who are these lunatics?' We set up a meeting with Titmouse and gave them the script. I was expecting Chris and Shannon Prynoski, who created and run Titmouse, to <b>just</b> <b>say,</b> 'No, <b>this</b> is a stupid idea.' But they said yes, and we went from there. I was super excited that Chris was interested in overseeing the making of it as a feature. Once he said yes he also said yes to directing it, which was great because I’m a huge fan of his." ...|$|R
