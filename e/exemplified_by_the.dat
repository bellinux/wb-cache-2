5|$|Taken together, {{women are}} oftentimes seen less {{valuable}} than men. With lower {{involvement in the}} public sphere—as <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> labour and political participation rates—and the stigma of being less valuable within a family, women face a unique form of gender discrimination.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the British Empire, a similar approach was also gaining popularity in Britain. An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brighton Royal Pavilion, completed in 1823, and the Sezincote House, completed a few years earlier. Both these buildings drew heavily on the Islamic motifs, which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs {{at the time of the}} Prince's visit to England.|$|E
5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC.

5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Parthian art, {{with its}} {{distinct}} use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound {{cultural and political}} changes brought by the Sassanid Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple {{in the same city}} dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.|$|E
5|$|The Umayyad Caliphate had conquered Syria, Egypt, and North Africa {{from the}} {{predominantly}} Christian Byzantine Empire, and Hispania from the Visigothic Kingdom. In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed {{and a number}} of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the Aghlabids, who attacked Italy in the 9th century. Pisa, Genoa, and the Principality of Catalonia began to battle various Muslim kingdoms for control of the Mediterranean Basin, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mahdia campaign and battles at Majorca and Sardinia.|$|E

5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Devotio Moderna movement. The painting is devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The typical Parthian riding outfit is <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> famous bronze {{statue of}} a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9m (6ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped tunic {{fastened}} in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair. His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.|$|E

5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Germany and Italy. Following the invasion the territory of Slavonia was incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi-backed puppet state and assigned as a zone under German occupation {{for the duration of}} the World War II. The regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma populations, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps. Armed resistance soon developed in the region, and by 1942, it controlled substantial territories, especially in mountainous parts of Slavonia. Yugoslav Partisans led by Josip Broz Tito took full control of Slavonia in April 1945.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Germany and Italy. Following the invasion the territory, parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi-backed puppet state. Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Međimurje were annexed by Hungary. The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše. The regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma inhabitants of the NDH, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{starting}} in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded {{to take into account}} the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.|$|E
5|$|Some teleosts are migratory; certain {{freshwater}} species move within river {{systems on}} an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn, salmon and striped bass being examples. Others, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.|$|E

5000|$|Instead {{southern}} Protestants were [...] "penalised and ill-treated" [...] {{for being}} a cultural minority. Nationalism, which was in essence Catholic and Gaelic, took on a triumphalist tone in the state. Social policy during the 1922-1932 government administration was largely based on Catholic beliefs, and {{events such as the}} Eucharistic Congress of 1932, helped reinforce the exalted status the Catholic Church enjoyed. The zenith of this anti-British, Catholic and Gaelic ethos came about after <b>the</b> 1932 election, <b>exemplify</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> newly elected Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, refusal to change or compromise on his views of a united Ireland that emphasised Gaelic and Catholic values.|$|R
25|$|The great {{breadth of}} the Mesoamerican pantheon of deities {{is due to the}} {{incorporation}} of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature. Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted and represented in anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects. The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed {{with the passage of time}} and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups. The gods are at once three: creator, preserver, and destroyer, and at the same time just one. An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: <b>the</b> positive, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> light, <b>the</b> masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and <b>the</b> negative, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> darkness, <b>the</b> feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc. (European ideology, Manichaeism).|$|R
5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E
5|$|The archaic is {{demonstrated}} by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> skull cup had already been established.|$|E
