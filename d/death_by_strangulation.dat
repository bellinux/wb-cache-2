5|$|Following the Rising of the Priests in 1775, {{three of}} the rebellion's leaders were {{executed}} without receiving fair trial. The death penalty was signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of the priests and clerics were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, {{the leader of the}} rebellion. Some of them were condemned to <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>strangulation</b> in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as the priests were not to be subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. Ximenes died a natural death within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy.|$|E
25|$|Compromise of the {{cerebral}} blood flow may occur by obstruction of the carotid arteries, even though their obstruction requires far more force than the obstruction of jugular veins, since they are seated deeper and they contain blood in much higher pressure compared to the jugular veins. Where death has occurred through carotid artery obstruction or cervical fracture, the face will typically be pale in colour and not show petechiae. Many reports and pictures exist of actual short-drop hangings that seem {{to show that the}} person died quickly, while others indicate a slow and agonising <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>strangulation.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Hurwitz {{was convicted}} of the murder 10 years earlier of the Starry Night's 21-year-old {{publicity}} agent, Timothy Moreau, to keep Moreau from alerting authorities to a counterfeit ticket scam at the club. Another club employee, George Castagnola, pleaded guilty to helping Hurwitz kill Moreau. [...] The <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>strangulation</b> occurred {{in one of the}} theater's hallways after a John Lee Hooker concert. After the murder, Hurwitz moved to Vietnam, but in 1997 a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of tax evasion related to the scam. Extradited to the United States and pleading guilty to the tax evasion charges, he was sentenced to a year in federal prison. Publicity generated by the tax-evasion trial led to new information about the murder. Sentenced to 11years in prison after pleading no contest to one count of murder in 2000, Hurwitz was released in 2008 after serving between 7 and 8 years. Meanwhile, to settle a civil wrongful-death suit filed against him by Moreau's parents, Hurwitz in 2001 stipulated to his part in the murder, agreed that a jury would have found him guilty if he had not pleaded [...] "no contest", and agreed to pay the Moreau family $3million in damages.|$|E

500|$|A joyous {{procession}} {{passed through}} the streets of London, with Sheppard's cart drawn along Holborn and Oxford Street accompanied by a mounted City Marshal and liveried Javelin Men. [...] The occasion was as much as anything a celebration of Sheppard's life, attended by crowds of up to 200,000 (one third of London's population). [...] The procession halted at the City of Oxford tavern on Oxford Street, where Sheppard drank a pint of sack. [...] A carnival atmosphere pervaded Tyburn, where his [...] "official" [...] autobiography, published by Applebee and probably ghostwritten by Defoe, was on sale. Sheppard handed [...] "a paper to someone as he mounted the scaffold", perhaps as a symbolic endorsement of the account in the [...] "Narrative". His slight build had aided his previous prison escapes, but it condemned him to a slow <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>strangulation</b> by the hangman's noose. [...] After hanging for the prescribed 15 minutes, his body was cut down. [...] The crowd pressed forward to stop his body from being removed, fearing dissection; their actions inadvertently prevented Sheppard's friends from implementing a plan to take his body to a doctor in an attempt to revive him. [...] His badly mauled remains were recovered later and buried in the churchyard of St Martin's-in-the-Fields that evening.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of offenders {{put to death}} by Canadian civilian authorities were executed by the [...] "long drop" [...] technique of hanging developed in the United Kingdom by William Marwood. This method ensured that the prisoner's neck was broken instantly {{at the end of}} the drop, resulting in the prisoner dying of asphyxia while unconscious, which was considered more humane than the slow <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>strangulation</b> which often resulted from the previous [...] "short drop" [...] method. The short drop sometimes gave a period of suffering before death finally took place.|$|E

2500|$|Zhu {{was soon}} {{planning}} {{to take over the}} throne himself, and he had Jiang and the chancellor Liu Can plan the transition. [...] Jiang advocated slowing down the process {{to try to get the}} people of the empire to gradually accept the coming transition from Tang to a new dynasty, and this displeased Zhu. [...] Meanwhile, Empress Dowager He was having her ladies in waiting Aqiu (阿秋) and Aqian (阿虔) passing messages between her and Jiang, begging him to have her life and that of the young emperor spared when the transition would occur. [...] This led to Wang Yin (王殷) and Zhao Yinheng falsely accusing Jiang being in a conspiracy with the empress dowager to restore Tang imperial power. [...] In late 905, Zhu had Jiang and Liu put to death and replaced Jiang with Wang and Zhao. [...] Wang and Zhao then accused Empress Dowager He of having carried on an affair with Jiang. [...] Zhu had them put the empress dowager to <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>strangulation,</b> with Aqiu and Aqian beaten to death, and had Emperor Ai issue an edict claiming that she was having affair with Jiang and committed suicide to offer alopogy, posthumously demoting her to commoner status.|$|E

That speculation is quite indefensible, although affording a possible explanation of that mystery. In the case of [...] "The Night of Kirk o' Field," [...] on the other hand, I do not think any apology is necessary for my reconstruction of the precise manner in which Darnley met his death. The event has long been looked upon {{as one of the}} mysteries of history--the mystery lying in the fact that whilst the house at Kirk o' Field was destroyed by an explosion, Darnley's body was found at some distance away, together with that of his page, bearing every evidence of <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>strangulation.</b> The explanation I adopt seems to me to owe little to speculation.|$|E

50|$|Chokeholds {{including}} gi-chokes/strangulations (with the lapel), and no-gi. Used {{primarily to}} kill or knock unconscious. In combat, a choking technique might permanently dissociate the windpipe from the ligament supporting it, causing <b>death</b> <b>by</b> asphyxiation. <b>Strangulation</b> techniques may {{also be used for}} non-lethal subduing of an opponent. Fully blocking the bloodflow to the brain will knock an opponent unconscious in 3 to 7 seconds. To kill <b>by</b> <b>strangulation</b> would take just over a minute before brain death occurs. In modern competition, chokes are normally banned (although they are permitted in judo competition). Strangulation is more popular in competition as they can be applied without fatal consequence, so full leverage can be applied to aid restraining of the competitor. In Jujutsu, there are many counters to choking or strangling attacks. This may have contributed to Jujutsu's popularity in self-defence applications.|$|R

50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{countries}} that use hanging (such as Japan or Malaysia) with a complex gallows designed to drop the condemned and break the neck, Iran's gallows are very simple and inexpensive. They consist only of a frame and a stool, with some stools able to hold up to seven people {{at a time and}} having wheels. Public executions are usually carried out by a mobile crane. Sometimes the victim is suspended from the crane, but more often the crane is used as a gallows and the person is pulled off of a stool. Iranian nooses are thick, with 7-10 knotted coils, and are often made of blue plastic rope with little to no drop. <b>Death</b> is caused <b>by</b> <b>strangulation</b> and carotid reflex (where blood vessels to the head are cut off), taking 10-20 minutes.
