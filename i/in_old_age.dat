40|$|Aim To examine {{sexual desire}} <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> {{and the use}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} for sexual enhancement in the context of erectile dysfunction. Background The ability of the older person to fulfil sexual desire has not been well supported in Western society. Design The paper draws on themes that emerged during a phenomenological study of sexual desire <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age.</b> Method Narratives were collected between 2008 – 2010 from in-depth interviews with six men and two women aged 65 – 84 years who were part of a larger Australian study of sexual desire <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age.</b> Findings Emergent themes reveal that for some older people, the biomedicalization of sex can be a disappointing experience. Conclusion The findings illuminate the need for nurses who are at the front line of health care, health policy makers and educators, to consider sexual desire experienced <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> the context of sexual health and healthy ageing. This study will contribute to a growing body of knowledge about sexual desire <b>in</b> <b>older</b> ag...|$|R
5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being <b>in</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E

What is quality of life? What is quality of life <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age?</b> How can quality of life <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> be improved? This book explores {{concepts of}} quality of life <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> the theoretical literature and presents the views of a national sample of people aged sixty- five years or older.

40|$|Abstract Background Suicide {{attempts}} {{have been shown to}} be less common <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups, with repeated attempts generally being more common in younger age groups and severe attempts <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups. Consistently, most studies have shown an increased suicide risk after attempts <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age.</b> However, little is known about the predictive value of age on repeated and severe suicide attempts for accomplished suicide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reduced incidence for initial, repeated, or severe suicide attempts with age in suicide victims and controls by gender. Methods The records of 100 suicide victims and matched controls with severe depression admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Lund University Hospital, Sweden between 1956 and 1969, were evaluated and the subjects were monitored up to 2006. The occurrence of suicide attempts (first, repeated, or severe, by age group) was analysed for suicide victims and controls, with gender taken into consideration. Results There was a reduced risk for an initial suicide attempt by <b>older</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> females (suicide victims and controls) and male controls (but not suicide victims). The risk for repeated suicide attempts appeared to be reduced <b>in</b> the <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups <b>in</b> female controls as compared to female suicide victims. The risk for severe suicide attempts seemed reduced <b>in</b> the <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups <b>in</b> female suicide victims. This risk was also reduced in male controls and in male controls compared to male suicide victims. Conclusion <b>In</b> the <b>older</b> <b>age</b> groups repeated attempts appeared to be predictive for suicide in women and severe attempts predictive in men. </p...|$|R

5|$|Siddhpur, {{historically}} {{known as}} Sristhal. Sidhpur, under {{the rulers of}} Chaulukya dynasty, was a prominent town in the 10th century. In the tenth century (943 AD) Mularaja, {{the founder of the}} Chaulukya dynasty of Gujarat, started the erection of the Rudra Mahalay temple. In his youth, Muladev had slain his maternal uncle, usurped his throne, and murdered the whole of his mother's kindred; and <b>in</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> his crimes hung heavily on his mind. He made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near.

40|$|Unintentional {{weight loss}} (UWL) is common <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> and {{associated}} with adverse outcomes including mortality. The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine psychosocial correlates of UWL. Data were derived from a large, nationally representative study of community-dwelling individuals in the second half of life (40 years and over) in Germany in 2014 (n = 7, 933). Data on UWL were assessed in face-to-face interviews as unintentional loss of more than 5 kg (11 pounds) in weight in the past 12 months, and data on psychosocial factors were recorded in self-administered questionnaires. Multiple logistic regressions revealed that UWL was positively associated with depressive symptoms and positive affect, whereas it was negatively associated with self-esteem. Individuals with UWL were more likely to feel lonely and perceive themselves as socially excluded. The findings of important psychosocial correlates of UWL may help to identify individuals at risk for UWL <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age.</b> This is <b>in</b> particular important since interventions to treat this phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> are available that reduce adverse consequences resulting from UWL...|$|R

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control <b>in</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
