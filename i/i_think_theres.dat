60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. When my {{council in}} Jinghiskahn {{reached the point}} of coming to blows, I used to adjourn the sitting. Let us {{postpone}} the discussion. Wait until Monday: we shall have Sunday to quiet down in. Believe me, I'm not making fun of you; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> something in this young gentleman's advice. Read something.|$|E
5000|$|We {{really love}} what were doing. We still love playing music together. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> a whole {{philosophy}} with our band. When {{you know there}} are a couple thousand people who paid money and just want to have a good night out, and if you think about that for a minute before the show, you get really fired up. Its quite a nice job we have, and a great lifestyle. —Darren MiddletonWhen asked what inspires the band before live performances.|$|E
5000|$|Boseman, {{who plays}} the god Thoth, commenting on the whitewashing, said he {{expected}} the backlash to happen {{when he saw the}} script. He said, [...] "Im thankful that it did, because actually, I agree with it. Thats why I wanted to do it, so you would see someone of African descent playing Thoth, the father of mathematics, astronomy, the god of wisdom." [...] Actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau said, [...] "A lot of people are getting really worked up online about the fact that Im a white actor. Im not even playing an Egyptian; Im an 8-foot-tall god who turns into a falcon. A part of me just wants to freak out, but then <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Theres</b> {{nothing you can do about}} it. You can’t win in that sort of discussion." ...|$|E

But he loves to advertise that. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> a little shark in him there, a little pool hustler in him there. Norman Chad, WSOP commentator On {{the first day of}} the tournament, Moon was dealt pocket aces six times and got three-of-a-kind on the flop three times. He performed well on the first day and continued a successful streak throughout the tournament, although he himself proclaimed it was luck. He eliminated several professional poker players during the tournament, including David Benyamine. He eventually obtained the chip lead and kept it until the seventh day of play. At that time, he fell to tenth place, but won a few big hands to recover and ended the day back in the lead. He eliminated Billy Kopp in one of the biggest hands in the tournament when his [...] led to a higher flush than Kopps [...] Moon entered the final table as the chip leader, holding 58.6 million chips, or about 30 percent of the chips in play.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recurring}} theme {{that has occurred}} several times in Jason and Sams romance is the appearance of stars. The theme of the stars first appeared on November 19, 2004 after Sams daughter was stillborn. Jason and Sam were grieving for her and started talking about heaven. Jason {{said that when he}} is near the ocean, he feels like he is a part of something [...] "bigger than himself." [...] Sam replied that for her it was the stars. [...] Sam: For me its the stars. Just looking up in the sky and feeling just small and important at the same time, scared, yet happy {{to be a part of}} it. Do you think there are stars in heaven?Jason: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> everything youd want for the baby -- love, you know, security, happiness, and stars. Jason and Sam first discuss the stars [...] Sam later went outside to gaze at the stars and feel closer to her baby. However she wasnt completely healed and passed out on the roof. She was found by Alexis, who took her back inside. Stars next appeared on April 20, 2005. Sam and Jason were in Italy looking for Michael and stopped to gaze at a shooting star. Jason promised Sam that he would bring her back to Italy to spend time together. The star gazing later inspired Jason to buy Sam a star shaped necklace, which became a tangible item of the theme of stars in their relationship. Jason later gifted Sam with the star necklace on May 11, 2005 and Sam wore the necklace daily.|$|E
5000|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesnt {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded Houses leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwans novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he {{committed}} suicide. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> a smoking gun. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{only one way}} you can explain {{a lot of things}} around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.|$|R
5000|$|A {{distinguished}} female contract {{killer in}} the world of assassins, and a former acquaintance of John. About the character of Ms. Perkins, Palicki said, [...] "Ms. Perkins is what you think the quintessential assassin would be. She’s cold, heartless, conniving, badass and I think that she has fun with what she does. She enjoys it. I think that she’d clearly do it for a dollar. Ultimately in the film she’s doing it for four million, so its a little different." [...] Originally the character of Perkins was envisioned as a man, but the decision was reversed during a brainstorming session and the desire to create [...] "an authentic female action character." [...] Leitch stated, [...] "You believe this woman could come in and give John Wick a run for his money," [...] so Stahelski, Leitch and Iwanyk changed it and offered the role to Palicki. Palicki spoke most highly of working with Reeves and the inclusion of stunt work on her part, to which she stated, [...] "Chad wanted to make sure I would be willing to do my own stuff in the huge fight sequence that I have with Keanu—and I was all game." [...] Palicki spent months of training learning Judo and Jujutsu. After the films release Palicki revealed background information, [...] "I also think we talked about a backstory. Its likely Perkins and Wick had a history as well, before his marriage. She may have a personal vendetta as well as the money. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> an enjoyment on multiple levels." [...] On what she hopes for with regard to the fan response, [...] "Its a lot of fun. Theyre going to want to see what happens next. Most importantly, I hope they’re rooting for John Wick the way that I did when I read the script." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 17 December 2015, Björk {{appeared}} on the podcast Song Exploder (Episode 60) where she detailed the creation of Vulnicuras opening track, [...] "Stonemilker". [...] "Its about someone whos trying to get emotions out of another person," [...] she said. [...] "I think its equally hard {{for all of us}} and were just all doing our best but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> also a choice. Do you want to try and then maybe fail half of the time and then succeed half of the time or whatever your odds are? Or is it your choice to not even try?" [...] On the creation of the song: [...] "I was walking on a beach, and I was kind of walking back and forth and the lyrics kind of came along kind of without me really editing them.... (Theyre) probably the most obvious lyrics Ive ever written. I actually wrote a whole other lyric to this song, which was really maybe a bit too clever for its own good but something in me said, No, dont touch it. It has to be, like, almost clumsy or naive. Thats sort of the strength and weakness of the song at the same time." [...] When talking about the string arrangements for [...] "Stonemilker", Björk said, [...] "For me it was very important... that the strings were kind of cyclical; this chord cycle that kind of gives you this feeling it can go on and on in circles and gives you this feeling of equilibrium. Like the person whos singing this song is showing some sort of harmony to someone as an example... I had 30 players, and then I would do 2 sets of arrangements so basically there are, in theory, 60 because it needed that sort of panoramic feeling to have that sort of smooth, cream-like perfection." [...] On her collaboration with beat maker and co-producer Arca, [...] "... it was very obvious that song was very simple so we didnt really need a crazy beat thing going on. It just had to be really supportive of the song, and almost acoustic like its a symphony orchestra playing and the beat would come from the kettledrum or something. You know? Like a very soft support which Alejandro (Arca) provided." ...|$|E

If we were not in Europe, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are definite benefits for us in economic terms.|$|R
