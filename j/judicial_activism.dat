5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good {{physical and mental}} condition {{for most of the}} last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of <b>judicial</b> <b>activism,</b> a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E

40|$|For years, {{the predicament}} {{of many of}} the European {{protected}} habitats and species in the Flemish Region, as in many other Member States, passed relatively unnoticed. The lack of proper rules and clear implementation rules fuelled the impression amongst project developers and planning authorities that the impacts of project developments on biodiversity did not really warrant closer assessment. However, in the past ten years, strict national case law has significantly altered this view. Faced with tighter judicial scrutiny, the Habitats and Birds Directives were seen as an important obstacle to project development. Hence mitigation and compensation have now come up as novel approaches to better align spatial aspirations with the conservation of nature. In reality, mitigation was often used as a cover-up for projects that would not fit the strict requirements enshrined in the derogatory clauses. Interestingly, the Belgian Council of State showed itself quite cautious in reasserting the lax view of some planning authorities on mitigation and compensation. In reviewing the legality of several new approaches to mitigation and compensation, the Belgian Council of State, which was initially very cautious in quashing decisions that would actually jeopardise major infrastructure developments, has rendered some compelling rulings on the specific application of mitigation and compensatory measures in a spatial planning context. By letting the objectives of EU nature conservation law prevail in the face of economic interests, the recent case law of the Belgian Council of State {{can be seen as a}} remarkable example of <b>judicial</b> environmental <b>activism...</b>|$|R
40|$|Archibald Cox {{has written}} a short, controversial, and rather {{comprehensive}} analysis of the Warren Court. The book {{is a blend of}} legal analysis covering the 2 ̆ 2 political issues 2 ̆ 2 that have confronted the court, how the court did confront these issues, and how the author agrees or disagrees with the court 2 ̆ 7 s judgment. An added reform dimension to the analysis reveals some of the political subtlety which necessarily underlies many of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional probes. The core question which presents itself traditionally and in this analysis goes to the constant question of <b>judicial</b> passivity or <b>activism.</b> What is the charge of the Constitutional Court in a tripartite 2 ̆ 2 balanced 2 ̆ 2 system of government, and how can the Court meet this charge, which actually it fixes for itself from its own reading of the Constitution and its adherence or nonadherence to past-posited guidelines...|$|R
40|$|After 36 {{years of}} subservience to the Executive, the {{judiciary}} of Bangladesh {{has recently been}} separated to dispense justice independently. This separation happened in 2007 during the term of an interim caretaker government in power with limited constitutional mandates. The caretaker government enjoyed full army support and operated within its proclaimed state of emergency, which resulted in its extraordinary empowerment far beyond the Constitution. Its all-powerful orientation had an encroaching effect on constitutional guarantees and a marginalising effect on judicial independence. Apex court decisions in the post-separation period accorded priority to the emergency power over the Constitution. Insulated by the emergency powers, the law enforcement apparatus abused human rights with impunity. The emergency powers predefined the legal consequences of these abuses to ensure that legal challenges to any emergency measures were unsuccessful. Pending high-profile cases, particularly against former prime ministers,are set to serve as further testing grounds for judicial independence. A preference for <b>judicial</b> restraint over <b>activism</b> during a state of emergency, {{in view of the}} vulnerability of judicial independence, may not be gainsaid in some cases. But a general abdication of judicial impartiality in favour of a pliant role in Bangladesh, where the judiciary is the only forum for enforcing citizens’ rights, is paradoxical to the judiciary’s guardianship of the Constitution. 16 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Canadian conservatives {{claim the}} {{constitution}} {{has resulted in}} too much <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> {{on the part of}} the courts in Canada. It is also heavily criticized by Quebec nationalists, who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any Quebec government and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for Quebec.|$|E
40|$|The {{doctrine}} of reasonable expectations {{has evolved into}} a powerful tool for <b>judicial</b> and regulatory <b>activism</b> and, as a result, a bellwether for the trajectory of the law. The concept has broadened — both in scope and in the range of potential claimants. Yet it has been used to achieve goals that are remarkably consistent across different areas of law: first, to require powerful actors to treat stakeholders fairly, which entails treating them with honesty and avoiding actions that would impose unnecessary or disproportionate costs on them; second, to uphold the integrity of legal or regulatory regimes by remedying actions that frustrate their purpose by allowing an actor to avoid the obligations associated with these regimes. The doctrine is particularly relevant to contemporary society, where legislative processes have become constrained by, among other things, the short-term incentives that inform and motivate political processes. As the tension between public expectations and legislative responsiveness becomes more severe, a growing role has emerged for our courts and independent regulatory bodies to use reasonable expectations to forge new legal pathways. This article outlines what appears to be an accelerating trend — first by reflecting on the nature of “reasonable expectations” and then exploring how the doctrine has been and is likely to be applied...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) came into being due to a perceived need for international judicial settlement, whereas the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was created {{for the purpose of}} specifically promoting international trade by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade. Alternative structures for each institution are also considered, as is the older dispute settlement process of arbitration, by means of cases. It is a voluntary submission by both parties to a dispute, when they have agreed on the issues, but need external assistance to proceed further. As a type of judicial settlement, it is binding, can permit third party or non-state involvement, and is a precursor of international tribunals. In the WTO, one aim is to use cases to test conceptual points. The specific aspects of dispute settlement including the application of rules and procedures, and implementation and processes, will be discussed. The working procedures of the Appellate Body (AB) will be analysed in detail. Another aim is to compare with the ICJ, wherever possible. Legal concepts such as jurisdiction, judicial aspects of reasoning, the burden of proof, and the standard of proof will be discussed. The Appellate Body’s (AB’s) standard of review of panel recommendations and rulings will be analysed. Compliance and enforcement are compared between the two organisations. Economic and political considerations will also be touched on when relevant to this study. In the ICJ, the application of concepts such as <b>judicial</b> restraint and <b>activism</b> will be assessed, including the degree of inconsistency found in different cases. The implications of the different types of agreements between states that can lead to or have led to the ICJ’s jurisdiction will be examined, and the impacts assessed. The ambiguity involving provisional measures will be studied in detail. The ICJ’s relationship to the UN Security Council will also be assessed. The lack of monitoring or enforcement, and of no stated compliance timeframe are considered. The thesis will end with various future recommendations...|$|R
25|$|Many {{contemporary}} Republicans voice {{support of}} strict constructionism, the judicial philosophy that the Constitution {{should be interpreted}} {{as close to the}} original intent as is practicable. Most Republicans point to Roe v.

25|$|On the court, Murphy {{was known}} for his radicalism and <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b> However, his final years were marred by {{persistent}} allegations of corruption. He was convicted of perverting the course of justice in 1985, but had the conviction overturned on appeal and was acquitted at a second trial. In 1986, a commission was established to determine whether he was fit to remain on the court, but it was abandoned when Murphy announced that he was suffering from terminal cancer.|$|E
25|$|Tort law in India is a {{relatively}} new common law development supplemented by codifying statutes including statutes governing damages. While India generally follows the UK approach, there are certain differences which may indicate <b>judicial</b> <b>activism,</b> hence creating controversy. Tort is breach of some duty independent of contract which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to civil cause of action and for which remedy is available. If there is no remedy it cannot be called a tort because the essence of tort is to give remedy to the person who has suffered injury.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b> Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, conservatives and libertarians began {{to criticize the}} ACLU for being too {{political}} and too liberal. Legal scholar Joseph W. Bishop wrote that the ACLU's trend to partisanship started with its defense of Dr. Spock's anti-war protests. Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b> Critics claimed that the ACLU's support of controversial decisions like Roe v. Wade and Griswold v. Connecticut violated {{the intention of the}} authors of the Bill of Rights. The ACLU became an issue in the 1988 presidential campaign, when Republican candidate George H. W. Bush accused Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis (a member of the ACLU) of being a [...] "card carrying member of the ACLU".|$|E
500|$|Goldstone's {{career as}} a judge was characterised by bold acts of <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> that soon {{attracted}} national and international interest. He was described as [...] "an outstanding commercial lawyer who had shrewdly and inventively applied the law to secure justice in politically controversial and human rights cases." [...] Employing the bench {{as a means of}} making ordinary South Africans aware of the iniquities of apartheid, he gained a reputation as a committed, compassionate, legally meticulous and politically astute jurist who championed international human rights and sought to temper the effects of South Africa's apartheid laws. He sought to retain his independence, refusing to kowtow to the authorities. As [...] puts it, Goldstone [...] "emerged as one of the leading 'liberal' judges who never showed any propensity towards the then prevailing executive-mindedness".|$|E
500|$|While {{some writers}} like Linda Gugin and legal {{historian}} William Radcliff have given high praise to Minton's logic in his written opinions, {{they point out}} that his positions had little long-term impact. Other legal historians, like Bernard Schwartz, have more negative opinion of Minton's judicial career. Schwartz wrote that Minton [...] "was below mediocrity as a Justice. His opinions, relatively few for his tenure, are less than third rate, characterized by their cavalier approach to complicated issues." [...] Schwartz went on to say, [...] "he ranks near the bottom of any list of Justices." [...] Most of the precedents Minton helped establish were overturned by the Warren Court in the years immediately following his retirement. In total he wrote sixty-seven majority opinions along with several of the dissenting opinions. Gugin authored a work in rebuttal to Schwartz's harsh critique, saying that Minton's rulings were [...] "predictable based on the principles of deference, precedent, and strict interpretation"; she attributed his poor ranking to the bias of reviewers in favor of <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b>|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, at common law, natural {{justice is}} taken to be a {{procedural}} concept that embodies the twin pillars of audi alteram partem (hear the other party) and nemo iudex in causa sua (no one should be a judge {{in his or her}} own cause). In the United States, due process has both procedural and substantive components. Substantive due process involves the courts assessing the reasonableness of executive actions and legislation using rational basis review if a fundamental right is not implicated and strict scrutiny if it is. The question thus arises whether substantive fundamental rules of natural justice may be developed by local courts. However, a line of Malaysian cases has expressed the view that the concept of substantive due process is not applicable to Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). There is also academic commentary that rejects the notion of [...] "substantive natural justice", arguing that it is too vague and leads to problems in application. Another argument against substantive natural justice is the fear that it may become an avenue for judges to invalidate laws on the basis of their own subjective opinions, leading to unbounded <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b>|$|E
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has been}} criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by {{engaging}} in <b>judicial</b> <b>activism,</b> rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> are not confined to any particular ideology. An often cited example of conservative <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which {{has been criticized}} by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts, and which was reversed in the 1930s. [...] An often cited example of liberal <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion in part {{on the basis of the}} [...] "right to privacy" [...] inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous. Legal scholars, justices, and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater. More recently, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations. Lincoln warned, referring to the Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became [...] "irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers." [...] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> with these words: [...] "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up." [...] During different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different directions. Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead. Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano, Phyllis Schlafly, Mark R. Levin, Mark I. Sutherland, and James MacGregor Burns. Past presidents from both parties have attacked <b>judicial</b> <b>activism,</b> including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: [...] "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless." [...] Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about <b>judicial</b> <b>activism,</b> [...] "their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like." [...] One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects [...] "certainly a legislative body." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{judiciary}} {{has been}} criticised for being overly activist and overstepping its jurisdiction.

2500|$|Associate Justice Pierce Butler filed a dissenting opinion, {{joined by}} Associate Justice James McReynolds, {{in which he}} argued the {{majority}} had engaged in <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b> He asserted the majority had completely rewritten the two questions presented in the petition for certiorari as a constitutional question, when there really was no constitutional issue.

Justice Potter Stewart, who joined with the majority, viewed the Roe opinion as [...] "legislative" [...] and asked that more consideration be paid to state legislatures.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote three {{paragraphs}} {{accusing the}} majority of <b>judicial</b> <b>activism,</b> claiming the case was [...] "decided upon an economic theory which {{a large part of}} the country does not entertain."

2500|$|This {{criticism}} {{is related to}} complaints about <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b> George Will wrote that the Court has an [...] "increasingly central role in American governance." [...] It was criticized for intervening in bankruptcy proceedings regarding ailing carmaker Chrysler Corporation in 2009. A reporter wrote that [...] "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's intervention in the Chrysler bankruptcy" [...] left open the [...] "possibility of further judicial review" [...] but argued overall that the intervention was a proper use of Supreme Court power to check the executive branch. Warren E. Burger, before becoming Chief Justice, argued that since the Supreme Court has such [...] "unreviewable power" [...] {{it is likely to}} [...] "self-indulge itself" [...] and unlikely to [...] "engage in dispassionate analysis".

National Organization for Marriage (NOM) chairman Maggie Gallagher also disagreed with the ruling. She targeted the judge's sexuality and accused Walker of [...] "substituting his views for those of the American people and of our Founding Fathers who I promise you would be shocked by courts that imagine they have the right to put gay marriage in our Constitution".

It was this demand that led to Aristotle’s distinction between psephismata (votes of the assembly) and nomos (statute law), and to the resulting debate over how best to decide questions of legal supremacy within a democracy. Together with Jason Gratl, he has [...] argued that, in its modern form, the rule of law helps resolve tensions between national security and public accountability and, together with John Whyte, he has argued that care needs to be taken with regard to electoral reform, especially when it comes to implementing proposals focusing on proportional representation. He is often cited in the media on issues ranging from free speech and academic freedom [...] to parliamentary procedure and <b>judicial</b> <b>activism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, an Ontario {{court ruled}} that the {{province}} was legally obligated to keep from closing the Montfort Hospital as part of its program of merging many of the hospitals in the Ottawa region. [...] The basis for the decision was the court's conclusion that this was a logical application of an unwritten constitutional principle of minority rights, which had been found by the Supreme Court in the 1998 Reference re Secession of Quebec. [...] Since the Montfort Hospital was the only hospital in the region operating primarily in French, it amounted to a protected parallel service-provider, much as New Brunswick's French-language and English-language school systems are parallel service providers, and therefore as an essential component of the collective rights of Ottawa's Franco-Ontarian population. The Government of Ontario criticized the decision as <b>judicial</b> <b>activism,</b> and charged that [...] "The divisional court decision has effectively rewritten the constitution to make [...] 16.1 applicable to Ontario despite the express intention that it apply to New Brunswick alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lim Chin Leng has {{opined that}} to accord {{principles}} of natural justice an elevated constitutional status may {{cause it to}} override statutes, which might contradict the Constitution which vests the law making power in the legislature. Similarly, Andrew J. Harding disagrees {{with the idea of}} [...] "substantive natural justice" [...] because, in his view, it cannot be shown that it was the Privy Council's intent to apply natural justice in a substantive sense, since this would mean that the court can strike down a provision for inconsistency with natural justice even if it satisfies the rational nexus test under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. It will also be hard to ascertain the limits of judicial power. However, the view has been expressed that such <b>judicial</b> <b>activism</b> would merely be the judiciary exercising its proper role. Furthermore, a judicial inquiry arguably involves both substantive and procedural aspects, so both concepts require no differentiation.|$|E
