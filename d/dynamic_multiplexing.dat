This approach {{is based on}} a dynamic en-coding of the joint output of sender components into a single message and is applicable to a model involving distributed components moving and interacting in multidimensional space by combining with predictive interest-based quantization. This article applies this approach to a projectile/missile application with realistic multidimensional dynamics. The authors investigate the dependence of sim-ulation accuracy and required network bandwidth on the number of active components and basic time granule.

40|$|In TV {{broadcast}} applications, {{the use of}} MPEG 2 standard allows {{economies in}} transmission bandwidth while providing a service with a quality similar or better to the current analogue systems. Interframe and intraframe techniques are used resulting in VBR bit streams, if constant quality is aimed. The number of bits depends on the motion and spatial detail of the video sequences. The compressed picture size differs by a factor up to 8 or more. Different TV programmes present different bandwidth requirements {{depending on the type}} of scene being transmitted. Thus buffering is needed to smooth rate fluctuations of encoder’s output between pictures. Without smoothing, performance of networks carrying such video traffic can be compromised. The use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplexing</b> schemes to jointly transmit different programmes allows a more efficient distribution of the available channel bandwidth by instantaneously assigning it among video sources according to their needs. The ATM technology provides the mechanisms for flexible allocation of resources and statistical transmission of VBR traffic, while providing the necessary quality of service guarantees to meet the real-time constraints of TV distribution services. This paper proposes the use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplexing</b> algorithms at the user terminal to transmit a number of MPEG 2 VBR encoded TV programmes over a VBR ATM channel. It addresses the problem of jointly controlling the channel and several VBR video sources bit rates...|$|E

A link is established between two people when matching in different points in time, which means we have virtually an individual link for each matching at different moment in time. Looking at the network in different timeframes will result in different arrangements of the links between nodes and different weights if these multiple links were to be collapsed in one single interaction. Thus, thanks to well defined periods of time corresponding to PM cabinets, we can use topic segmentation as a support to observe not the overall network but each slice involving the people’s interactions over the different cabinets (Fig. 9).|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effects of advertising strategy, that is, rational advertising and emotional advertising, on brand love. Based on the consumer-brand relationship literature, brand love {{is defined as a}} reciprocal, <b>dynamic,</b> <b>multiplex,</b> and purposive relationship between satisfied consumers and their brands, and has three key components: brand intimacy, brand passion, and brand commitment. Using a series of pretests and a main experiment, we examine how rational and emotional advertising affect brand love as well as its components for different products and services. Results show that for products, there is an interaction between advertising strategy and product type in influencing brand love. Specifically, rational advertising is more effective for utilitarian-value based products while emotional advertising is more effective for hedonic-value based products. For services, we find that emotional advertising is more effective for both utilitarian- and hedonic-value based services.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{increasing}} reliability {{concerns for}} current and next generation VLSI technologies, fault-tolerance {{is fast becoming}} {{an integral part of}} system-on-chip (SoC) and multicore architectures. Another concern for these architectures is increasing global wire lengths with associated issues leading to network-on-chips (NoC) becoming standard for on-chip global communication. We recognize these issues and present an onchip generic fault-tolerant routing algorithm. The microarchitecture of a NoC router implementing the proposed routing algorithm for a k-ary 2 -cube topology is provided. The proposed router works in two phases. In the first phase, the network is explored for an existing path between sourcedestination pairs after reset or during system reconfiguration after fault detection. Existing paths are cached and used in the second phase of data communication during normal system operation. The presented router architecture also proposes a concept of <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplexing</b> of virtual channels on physical channels to efficiently utilize physical channel bandwidth. The above approaches complement each other and when combined together, result in an efficiently realizable high-performance NoC fault-tolerant router. An implementation characterization of this k-ary 2 -cube torus router in terms of area, power and critical path delay in IBM Cu- 08 technology is presented, along with bandwidth and latency characterization for relevant cases.

40|$|Cell {{signaling}} {{dynamics and}} transcriptional regulatory activities are variable within specific cell types responding to an identical stimulus. In addition to studying the network interactions, {{there is much}} interest in utilizing single cell scale data to elucidate the non-random aspects of the variability involved in cellular decision making. Previous studies have considered the information transfer between the signaling and transcriptional domains based on an instantaneous relationship between the molecular activities. These studies predict a limited binary on/off encoding mechanism which underestimates the complexity of biological information processing, and hence the utility of single cell resolution data. Here we pursue a novel strategy that reformulates the information transfer problem as involving dynamic features of signaling rather than molecular abundances. We pursue a computational approach to test if and how the transcriptional regulatory activity patterns can be informative of the temporal history of signaling. Our analysis reveals (1) the dynamic features of signaling that significantly alter transcriptional regulatory patterns (encoding), and (2) the temporal history of signaling that can be inferred from single cell scale snapshots of transcriptional activity (decoding). Immediate early gene expression patterns were informative of signaling peak retention kinetics, whereas transcription factor activity patterns were informative of activation and deactivation kinetics of signaling. Moreover, the information processing aspects varied across the network, with each component encoding a selective subset of the dynamic signaling features. We developed novel sensitivity and information transfer maps to unravel the <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplexing</b> of signaling features at each of these network components. Unsupervised clustering of the maps revealed two groups that aligned with network motifs distinguished by transcriptional feedforward vs feedback interactions. Our new computational methodology impacts the single cell scale experiments by identifying downstream snapshot measures required for inferring specific dynamical features of upstream signals involved in the regulation of cellular responses...|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} dynamic {{community}} detection has received significant {{interest in the}} academic literature (Cazabet and Amblard 2014). Current approaches for dynamic community detection broadly fall under two headings: incremental community detection and global community detection. The approaches in the first category focus on the systematic propagation of communities through time, whereas the approaches in the second category attempt to simultaneously optimize for multiple metrics on several snapshots of data. Stability of computation and accuracy of results are the fundamental limitations of the incremental approaches, while memory (space) and computational requirements are the main limitations of the global approaches (Cazabet and Amblard 2014). Incremental approaches are fundamentally combinatorial in nature (Tantipathananandh and Berger-Wolf 2011; Nguyen et al. 2014) and involve methods to track communities through time. The stochastic nature of these algorithms makes these methods unstable leading to inaccurate results. Mucha et al. (2010) build on the seminal work of Lambiotte et al. (2014) for community detection in <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplex</b> networks by specializing null models in terms of stability under Laplacian dynamics.|$|R

40|$|Networks {{extracted}} from social media platforms frequently include multiple types of links that dynamically change over time; these links {{can be used}} to represent dyadic interactions such as economic transactions, communications, and shared activities. Organizing this data into a <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplex</b> network, where each layer is composed of a single edge type linking the same underlying vertices, can reveal interesting cross-layer interaction patterns. In coevolving networks, links in one layer result in an increased probability of other types of links forming between the same node pair. Hence we believe that a holistic approach in which all the layers are simultaneously considered can outperform a factored approach in which link prediction is performed separately in each layer. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework, MLP (Multilayer Link Prediction), in which link existence likelihoods for the target layer are learned from the other network layers. These likelihoods are used to reweight the output of a single layer link prediction method that uses rank aggregation to combine a set of topological metrics. Our experiments show that our reweighting procedure outperforms other methods for fusing information across network layers...|$|R

The scanning {{frequency of the}} WSL is 18 kHz, and the 10 dB scanning bandwidth is more than 90 nm around a center wavelength of 1, 540 nm. The output from the WSL is coupled into the multiplexed FBG array, which consists of five FBGs. The reflected Bragg wavelengths of the FBGs are 1, 532. 02 nm, 1, 537. 84 nm, 1, 543. 48 nm, 1, 547. 98 nm, and 1, 553. 06 nm, respectively.

40|$|Social {{structures}} {{emerge as}} a result of individuals managing a variety of different of social relationships. Societies can be represented as highly structured <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplex</b> networks. Here we study the dynamical origins of the specific community structures of a large-scale social multiplex network of a human society that interacts in a virtual world of a massive multiplayer online game. There we find substantial differences in the community structures of different social actions, represented by the various network layers in the multiplex. Community size distributions are either similar to a power-law or appear to be centered around a size of 50 individuals. To understand these observations we propose a voter model that is built around the principle of triadic closure. It explicitly models the co-evolution of node- and link-dynamics across different layers of the multiplex. Depending on link- and node fluctuation rates, the model exhibits an anomalous shattered fragmentation transition, where one layer fragments from one large component into many small components. The observed community size distributions are in good agreement with the predicted fragmentation in the model. We show that the empirical pairwise similarities of network layers, in terms of link overlap and degree correlations, practically coincide with the model. This suggests that several detailed features of the fragmentation in societies {{can be traced back to}} the triadic closure processes. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

When the priorities of all waiting packets increase linearly at rate one, the proposed scheme is shown to be equivalent to the Virtual Clock algorithm.

By employing three different multiplexing ar- chitectures in the network, DTDM permits graceful {{evolution of the}} existing circuit switching network into a flexible broadband packet communication network supporting integrated voice, data, and video traffic. The first multiplexing stage uses a packet assembler to multiplex different broadband services into a common DTDM-format serial bit stream.

The whole process is driven by the insatiable demand for ever-more specific, sensitive, convenient and cost-effective protocols. However, it has also become clear that variable pre-assay conditions, poor assay design and incorrect data analysis have resulted in the regular publication of data that are often inconsistent, inaccurate and often simply wrong.

This has serious consequences for basic research, reducing the potential for translating findings into valuable applications and potentially devastating implications for clinical practice. In response, guidelines proposing a minimum standard for the provision of information for qPCR experiments ("MIQE") have been launched.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, the {{orthogonal}} frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission scheme {{has become part}} of several standards for wireless systems. Today, OFDM is even a candidate for fourth-generation wireless systems. It is well known that dynamic OFDMA systems potentially increase the spectral efficiency. They exploit diversity effects in time, space, and frequency by assigning system resources periodically to terminals. Informing the terminals about new assignments creates a signaling overhead. Up to now, this overhead has not been taken into account in studies on <b>dynamic</b> orthogonal frequency-division <b>multiplexing</b> access (OFDMA) systems. Yet this is crucial for a realistic notion of the performance achieved by dynamic approaches. In this paper, we close this gap. We introduce two forms of representing the signaling information and discuss how these affect system performance. The study of the signaling impact on the performance is conducted for an exemplary dynamic approach. We find that the throughput behavior of dynamic OFDMA systems is significantly influenced by the signaling overhead. In many situations, neglecting the overhead leads to wrong performance conclusions. Also, the performance difference between dynamic and static schemes is now much more sensible to the specific parameter set of the transmission scenario (e. g., frame length, subcarrier number, etc.). This leads to the proposal of access points which should adapt certain system parameters in order to provide optimal performance. QC 20131129 </p...|$|R

Kleimola [1] provides a comprehensive and up-to-date {{description of the}} entire family. One shared trait is that synthesizing vocal sounds and other harmonically-structured sounds comprised of formants can be problematic because of an obstacle which causes distortions when intensifying time-varying controls. Large deflections of pitch or phoneme parameters cause jumps in the required integer approximations of formant center frequencies. Trying to imitate human vocal behavior with its often wide prosodic and expressive excursions causes audible clicks. A partial solution lay buried in some code from the 80 ’s. This, combined with a phase-syncronous oscillator bank described in Lazzarini and Timoney [2] produces uniform harmonic components which ensure artifact-free, exact formant spectra even under the most extreme dynamic conditions.

Because these non-natural oligonucleotides are accessible entirely synthetically, aptamers can be equipped {{with all sorts of}} reporter groups and can be coupled to many different carriers, surfaces, nanoparticles, or other biomolecules. They {{can be used in a}} highly modular fashion and often recognize their targets by a mechanism in which the aptamer undergoes considerable structural rearrangement, which can be exploited for transducing a binding event into a signal. As a consequence, aptamers have been adapted to a huge variety of "read-out configurations" and are increasingly used as capture agents in many different bioanalytical methods. But despite considerable success with these applications, many remaining challenges must still be overcome for the more widespread incorporation of aptasensors in clinical and environmental biosensing and diagnostics to take place. Some particularly noteworthy progress on this front is currently being made with aptasensor configurations that can be used for the multiplexed sensing of many analytes in parallel. In this Account, we describe some of the concepts involved in transducing the binding of a ligand into a signal through various physico-chemical interactions. Research in this area usually involves the combination of the molecular biology of proteins and nucleic acids with biotechnology, synthetic chemistry, physical chemistry, and surface physics. We begin with a brief introduction of the properties and characteristics that qualify aptamers as capture agents for many different analytes and their suitability as highly versatile biosensor components. We then address approaches that apply to surface acoustic wave configurations, drawing largely from our own contributions to aptasensor development, before moving on to describe previous and recent progress in multiplexed aptasensors. Obtaining proteome-wide profiles in cells, organs, organisms, or full populations requires the ability to accurately measure many different analytes in small sample volumes over a broad <b>dynamic</b> range. <b>Multiplexed</b> sensing is an invaluable tool in this endeavor.

Syftet har varit att analysera positioneringar i {{relation}} till diskurser som konstituerar kön, sexualitet och relationer, och hur dessa positioneringar och diskurser konstrueras språkligt. Feminist Post-structuralist Discourse Analysis har använts som teori och metod, kompletterad med en analys utifrån systemisk-funktionell grammatik. Analysen har visat hur deltagarna genomgående konstruerar ett ifrågasättande av normer som organiserar och kategoriserar kön, sexualitet och relationer. Utifrån queer positionering har kön och sexualitet genom agentiva verbprocesser konstruerats som dynamiska och mångfaldiga. Även anti-hierarkiska och feministiska diskurser, tillsammans med en ovilja att definiera sexuell läggning och relationer, genomsyrar samtalen. Vidare har det framgått att queer konstrueras som perspektiv, men även som en praktikgemenskap med gränser för vad och vem som är queer. En analys av diskursers samspel med varandra har synliggjort ämnen som på olika sätt utmanar queers gränser, bland annat könsseparatism, pronomenet hen, pornografi och asexualitet. Analysen har dessutom visat att det queera subjektet rör sig mellan olika positioneringar beroende på kontexten, och att positioneringar kan vara såväl intentionella som påtvingade. Den queera pendlar därmed mellan makt och maktlöshet beroende på relationen till andra individer och diskurser.

The research aim has been to analyze subject positionings in relation to discourses that constitute gender, sexuality and relationships, and how these positionings and discourses are linguistically produced. Feminist Post-structuralist Discourse Analysis, complemented by a systemic-functional grammar analysis, has been the theoretical and methodological approach. The result has shown how the participants consistently position them selves against norms that organizes and categorizes gender, sexuality and relationships. The participants have from queer positionings as agents in verb processes articulated sexuality and gender as <b>dynamic</b> and <b>multiplex.</b> They have also drawn on anti-hierarchical and feminist discourses, as well as articulated a resistance to define sexual orientation and relationships.

An analysis of interaction among discourses has exposed issues that challenge the borders of queer, for example gender separatism, gender neutral pronouns, pornography and asexuality. The analysis has furthermore shown that the queer subject move amongst different positionings depending on the context, and that positionings can be intentional as well as imposed.

40|$|Traffic Engineering (TE) {{refers to}} all the {{techniques}} a Service Provider employs to improve the efficiency and reliability of network operations. In IP over Optical (IPO) networks, traffic coming from upper layers is carried over the logical topology defined by the set of established lightpaths. Within this framework then, TE techniques allow to optimize the configuration of optical resources with respect to an highly dynamic traffic demand. TE can be performed with two main methods: if the demand is known {{only in terms of}} an aggregated traffic matrix, the problem of automatically updating the configuration of an optical network to accommodate traffic changes is called Virtual Topology Reconfiguration (VTR). If instead the traffic demand is known in terms of data-level connection requests with sub-wavelength granularity, arriving dynamically from some source node to any destination node, the problem is called Dynamic Traffic Grooming (DTG). In this dissertation new VTR algorithms for load balancing in optical networks based on Local Search (LS) techniques are presented. The main advantage of using LS is the minimization of network disruption, since the reconfiguration involves {{only a small part of}} the network. A comparison between the proposed schemes and the optimal solutions found via an ILP solver shows calculation time savings for comparable results of network congestion. A similar load balancing technique has been applied to alleviate congestion in an MPLS network, based on the efficient rerouting of Label-Switched Paths (LSP) from the most congested links to allow a better usage of network resources. Many algorithms have been developed to deal with DTG in IPO networks, where most of the attention is focused on optimizing the physical resources utilization by considering specific constraints on the optical node architecture, while very few attention has been put so far on the Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for the carried traffic. In this thesis a novel Traffic Engineering scheme is proposed to guarantee QoS from both the viewpoint of service differentiation and transmission quality. Another contribution in this thesis is a formal framework for the definition of dynamic grooming policies in IPO networks. The framework is then specialized for an overlay architecture, where the control plane of the IP and optical level are separated, and no information is shared between the two. A family of grooming policies based on constraints on the number of hops and on the bandwidth sharing degree at the IP level is defined, and its performance analyzed in both regular and irregular topologies. While most of the literature on DTG problem implicitly considers the grooming of low-speed connections onto optical channels using a TDM approach, the proposed grooming policies are evaluated here by considering a realistic traffic model which consider a <b>Dynamic</b> Statistical <b>Multiplexing</b> (DSM) approach, i. e. a single wavelength channel is shared between multiple IP elastic traffic flows...|$|R
40|$|Language Ecology and Language Planning in Chiang Rai, Thailand' {{had three}} main aims: {{to study the}} {{language}} ecology and sub-ecologies of Chiang Rai province, to study the factors and forces that affect the language ecology, and to study language plans and language policies in Chiang Rai. This study employed two main frameworks: theoretical and methodological framework. The theoretical construct {{is based on a}} parameter rich linguistic theory, Ecolinguistics, where concepts and parameters from linguistics and non-linguistics disciplines are employed. The parameter rich theory assists immensely in the understanding of language as it believes that language is interconnected with the world and the world with language. The study was conducted using ethnography as the methodological framework due to it allowing a wide array of data collection methods which include document studies, observation, participant observation, recorded and unrecorded interviews, personal communications and field notes. Moreover, ethnography provided an opportunity to reflect on the researcher's multiple identities and in varying degrees as insider and outsider. Data collection was conducted in Chiang Rai and six villages in three districts; two districts in the Greater Mae Khong Subregion (G 1 -IS) area namely Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen; and one district in a special economic border zone area Maesai district. The districts were chosen based on economic influences while the six villages were randomly selected. The villages studied were Wiang Mok and Huay Kok villages in Chiang Khong district; Sop Ruak and Santhaat villages in Chiang Saen province; and Phamee and Payaang Chum in Maesai district. Data were also collected from stakeholders concerned in language planning namely government and nongovernment organizations. There were two main findings in accordance with the research aims. Firstly, {{it was found that the}} language ecology and sub-ecologies of Chiang Rai province and the villages were <b>dynamic</b> and <b>multiplex.</b> The dynamics and complexities of the ecology and sub-ecologies wee dependent on numerous interactions of different factors and forces. The factors were social educational, geographical, economic, and political/geopolitical. There were four main levels of forces: world level, national level, regional/provincial level, and home level. The interaction of forces could be positive, negative or neutral to the health of the language ecology. Secondly, with regards to language planning and policy, it was found that there was no explicit minority language policy or planning in Thailand. Two types of language policy were found in Chiang Rai and Thailand: a top-down policy and quasi-bottom up policy. Both policies were education related. The top-down policies were comprised of an implicit national language policy and an explicit foreign language policy, especially for English and Chinese. The quasi-bottom up policy was the only local policy found in Chiang Rai where a Chinese language curriculum was developed at the local level but with a national economic related strategic vision. The study also suggested that future language planning and policies in Thailand should take into account the findings of language ecology and sub-ecologies in Chiang Rai. Language plans should recognise the effect of those factors and forces that will affect other languages within the same ecology. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Blood plasma, {{the largest}} human {{proteome}} is readily accessible {{and can be}} minimalinvasively sampled making it a valuable source of potential biomarkers. However, its analysis is complicated by its complexity and the huge dynamic concentration range of its constituents. Automated assays were established using magnetic microspheres and customized group-specific triple X proteomics (TXP) antibodies. These antibodies are directed against short N- or C-terminal epitope motifs for the immunoprecipitation of signature peptides derived from groups of trypsin-digested plasma proteins. The introduction of these antibodies led to a very efficient enrichment of the targeted analytes {{and a reduction in}} sample complexity similar to the SISCAPA (Stable Isotope Standards and Capture by Anti-Peptide Antibodies) approach introduced by Anderson et al. (2004). The quantitative evaluation as targeted approach, via nano liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring and stable isotopes peptide standards revealed limits of detection of 21 ng/ml and limits of quantification of 189 ng/ml in a tryptic plasma digest assay. Two peptides with the same TXP tag were simultaneously captured with one TXP antibody in a <b>multiplex</b> <b>dynamic</b> range of about 7, 000 (5 fmol peptide were still detectable in presence of 33. 3 pmol matrix peptide). The qualitative evaluation as discovery approach, of a tryptic plasma digest assay via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF) analysis revealed the presence of TXP tag-specific peptides captured by the used TXP antibodies. Their analysis, however, was compromised by peptide peaks from non-targeted high abundant proteins. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation showed a 99 % depletion of non-targeted peptides. Further investigations with a total of 14 TXP antibodies enabled the detection of targeted TXP peptides and a significant reduction in the intensity of non-specific peptides. TXP Proteomics by peptide group-specific immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry read-out allowed reproducible multiplexed plasma protein analysis without the requirement for demanding liquid chromatography separation techniques. Furthermore, the application of TXP antibodies requires significantly fewer antibodies for immuno-affinity mass spectrometry based plasma proteome analysis compared to the use of anti-peptide antibodies. Blutplasma ist das größte menschliche Proteom. Es kann schnell durch einen minimal invasiven Eingriff gewonnen werden und stellt dadurch eine wertvolle Quelle für potentielle Biomarker dar. Die Analyse jedoch ist kompliziert, bedingt durch die Komplexität des Plasmas und den enormen dynamischen Konzentrationsbereich der beinhalteten Proteine. In dieser Arbeit wurde eine automatisierte Probenbearbeitung mit magnetischen Partikeln und gruppenspezifischen "Triple X Proteomics" (TXP) -Antikörpern etabliert. Diese sind gegen kurze N- oder C-terminale Epitop-Motive von Peptiden gerichtet um diese gruppenweise aus tryptisch verdauten Plasma anzureichern. Die Anwendung dieser führte zu einer sehr effektiven Anreicherung der Zielanalyten und folglich zu einer Reduktion der Komplexität ähnlich dem Konzept SISCAPA (Stable Isotope Standards and Capture by Anti-Peptide Antibodies) von Anderson et al. (2004). Die quantitative Evaluierung mittels nano-Flüssigkeitschromatographie Multiple Reaction Monitoring und stabilen Isotopen-Standards zeigte Detektionsgrenzen von 21 ng/ml und Quantifizierungsgrenzen von 189 ng/ml in tryptischem Plasmaverdau. Der multiplexe dynamische Bereich eines TXP-Antikörper lag bei 7, 000 (5 fmol Peptid waren in Gegenwart von 33, 3 pmol Matrixpeptid noch detektierbar), wobei zwei Peptide mit derselben TXP-Sequenz simultan mit einem TXP-Antikörper gebunden werden konnten. Die qualitative Evaluierung eines Plasma-Experiments mittels Matrix-unterstützter Laser-Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI) mit Flugzeitanalyse (time of flight, TOF) zeigte die Präsenz von TXP-spezifischen Peptiden, die von den benutzten TXP-Antikörpern gebunden wurden. Die Analyse dieser wurde allerdings beeinträchtigt durch Peptidpeaks von unerwünschten, hoch abundanten Plasmaproteinen. Mittels Dichtegradientenzentrifugation wurden 99 % der unerwünschten Peptide abgereichert. Mit insgesamt 14 TXP-Antikörpern wurden gezielt Peptide mit TXP-Sequenz angereichert. Gleichzeitig konnte eine signifikante Reduktion von unspezifischen Peptiden ohne TXPSequenz erreicht werden. Die Proteomanalyse mit TXP-Antikörpern (gruppenspezifische Immunpräzipitation von Peptiden gekoppelt mit massenspektrometrischer Analyse) erlaubte die reproduzierbare, multiplexe Analyse von Plasmaproteinen ohne zusätzliche, anspruchsvolle LCTrennungsmethoden. Im Gegensatz zu der Applikation peptidspezifischer Antikörper werden mit TXP-Antikörpern erheblich weniger Antikörper für die Plasma-Proteom- Analyse bei der Immunaffinitätschromatographie benötigt...|$|R
