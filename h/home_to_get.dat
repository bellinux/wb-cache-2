Hearst was a prolific buyer {{who did not}} so much purchase art and antiques to furnish his home as he did build his <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his bulging collection out of warehouses. This led to incongruous elements, such as the private cinema, whose walls were lined with shelves of rare books. The floor plan of the Main Building is chaotic due to his habit of buying centuries-old ceilings, which dictated the proportions and decor of various rooms.|$|E
