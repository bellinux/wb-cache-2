40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} new {{reference}} spur elimination architecture for a charge pump PLL using an edge encoding technique. This uses the dual edge triggered flip flop and shifts the {{rising and falling}} edge by different amounts. This paper proposes two schemes to reduce the initial frequency and power in a PLL. The prototype PLL was fully integrated in a 0. 18 -m CMOS technology. Index terms- <b>Edge</b> <b>encoder,</b> phase locked loop, spur. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a mobile robot {{equipped with a}} sonar sensor array in a guided feature based map building task in an indoor environment. The landmarks common to indoor environments are planes, corners and edges, and these are located and classified with the sonar sensor array. The map building process makes use of accurate odometry information that is derived {{from a pair of}} knife <b>edged</b> unloaded <b>encoder</b> wheels. Discrete sonar observations are incrementally merged into partial planes to produce a realistic representation of environment that is amenable to sonar localisation. Collinearity constraints among features are exploited to enhance both the map feature estimation and robot localisation. The map update employs an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) in the first implementation and subsequently a comparison is made with the JulierUhlmann Kalman Filter (JUKF) which improves the accuracy of covariance propagation when non-linear equations are involved. The map accounts for corre [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a new trellis pruning method which uses nonlinear convolutional coding for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction of filtered QPSK and 16 -QAM modulations. The Nyquist filter {{is viewed as}} a convolutional encoder that controls the analog waveforms of the filter output directly. Pruning some <b>edges</b> of the <b>encoder</b> trellis can effectively reduce the PAPR. The only tradeoff is a slightly lower channel capacity and increased complexity. The paper presents simulation results of the pruning action and the resulting PAPR, and also discusses the decoding algorithm and the capacity of the filtered and pruned QPSK and 16 -QAM modulations on the AWGN channel. Simulation results show that the pruning method reduces the PAPR significantly without much damage to capacity. I...|$|R

40|$|Active robot {{force control}} {{requires}} {{some form of}} dynamic inner loop control for stability. The author considers the implementation of position-based inner loop control on an industrial robot fitted with encoders only. It is shown that high gain velocity feedback for such a robot, which is effectively stationary when in contact with a stiff environment, involves problems beyond the usual caveats {{on the effects of}} unknown environment stiffness. It is shown that it is possible for the controlled joint to become chaotic at very low velocities if <b>encoder</b> <b>edge</b> timing data are used for velocity measurement. The results obtained indicate that there is a lower limit on controlled velocity when encoders are the only means of joint measurement. This lower limit to speed is determined by the desired amount of loop gain, which is itself determined by the severity of the nonlinearities present in the drive system. ...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{geometry}} for powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), termed ‘focal construct geometry’ (FCG) {{is introduced}} and developed with both non-ideal samples and non-ideal sample conditions. FCG utilises an annular beam {{that has the}} unique feature of ‘focusing’ scattering maxima at single loci along a primary axis, hence offering diffraction data of enhanced intensity. This main advantage of FCG can be used within fields in need of rapid material identification, such as security screening in airports. A theoretical comparison between FCG and conventional transmission mode XRD {{showed that even though}} FCG suffers from broader diffraction peaks, an alternative approach to FCG data interpretation has the potential to provide narrower scattering maxima than conventional XRD. However, in order to employ this approach, discrimination between converging and diverging FCG scattering maxima is essential. Peak broadening was investigated by altering various aspects of FCG instrumentation components by either pencil beam XRD or FCG, indicating broad diffraction peaks independent of the beam geometry employed. Development of FCG resulted in the successful analysis of non-ideal samples, such as non-crystalline liquid samples, samples exhibiting preferred orientation and samples with large grain size, demonstrating advantages over conventional XRD. Furthermore, ideal samples (in terms of crystallinity, preferred orientation and grain size) were analysed by FCG under non-ideal conditions. This involved randomly orientating a single planar sample with respect to the primary axis, contrary to previous research that present FCG with a single planar sample normal to the primary axis. Sample rotation resulted in FCG scattering maxima with different xyz coordinates depending on the degree, axis and direction of rotation. Moreover, FCG analysis of multiple samples (normal to the primary axis) showed that as with all XRD arrangements, a priori knowledge of the samples’ position along the primary axis is required for effective data analysis. Investigation into the ability of FCG’s annular beam to act as a pre-sample coded aperture demonstrated an alternative method to interpret FCG images by recovering conventional XRD data. Additionally, two novel post-sample encoders (linear wire and Archimedean spiral) were considered. This enabled spatial discrimination of unknown samples along a primary axis and material identification for conventional XRD techniques. Combination of FCG with an absorbing <b>edge</b> post-sample <b>encoder</b> indicated discrimination between converging and diverging FCG scattering maxima. This ability can enable interpretation of single FCG images, as well as depth information of unknown samples within an inspection volume (e. g. airport luggage), hence enabling material identification. © Cranfield University 201...|$|R
