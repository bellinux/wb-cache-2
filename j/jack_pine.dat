5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (<b>Jack</b> <b>Pine,</b> Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the <b>jack</b> <b>pine,</b> and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore print color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in <b>jack</b> <b>pine</b> and Scotch pine forests. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E
50|$|Conifers can include: <b>Jack</b> <b>pines</b> (Pinus banksiana); Black and White spruces (Picea mariana and Picea glauca); Balsam firs (Abies balsamea), and EasternRed junipers (Juniperus virginiana).|$|R
50|$|<b>Jack</b> <b>pines</b> {{are also}} {{susceptible}} to scleroderris canker (Gremmeniella abietina). This disease manifests by yellowing {{at the base}} of the needles. Prolonged exposure may lead to eventual death of the tree.|$|R
50|$|The species flies from March to November {{during which}} months it feeds on poplar species (especially Populus balsamifera. In Alberta, {{it is known}} for feeding on Pinus contorta, aspens, <b>jack</b> <b>pines,</b> and white spruces in which they also lay their eggs.|$|R
5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian <b>jack</b> <b>pine</b> forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Nestling {{birds are}} common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees {{rather than on}} the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from perch to perch and {{scanning}} surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of <b>jack</b> <b>pine,</b> and greater rates of predation in riparian forest strips and green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. This may be due to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), <b>jack</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E

50|$|Young <b>jack</b> <b>pines</b> are an {{alternate}} host for sweet fern blister rust (Cronartium comptoniae). Infected sweet ferns (Comptonia peregrina) release powdery orange spores {{in the summer}} and nearby trees become infected in the fall. Diseased trees show vertical orange cankers on the trunk and galls on the lower branches. The disease does not tend to affect older trees.|$|R
50|$|Pokemouche {{is located}} in the east {{lowlands}} ecoregion, more precisely in the Caraquet ecodistrict. The long history of colonisation and disruption of the forest led to the prevalence of red maple, white poplar and gray birch. The hollows of the valleys and areas of coarse soil are covered with black spruces and <b>jack</b> <b>pines,</b> which is evidence of a high frequency of fires. There is also hemlock, cedar and tamarack larch growing in some places.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with <b>jack</b> <b>pine</b> trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} widely reproduced, seen across Canada in schools and public institutions. In 1967, a stamp featuring The <b>Jack</b> <b>Pine</b> was released {{to coincide with the}} fiftieth anniversary of the painting's creation and Thomson's death.|$|E
50|$|Pinus banksiana {{ranges from}} 9 - 22 m in height. Some <b>jack</b> <b>pines</b> are shrub-sized, due to poor growing conditions. They do not usually grow {{perfectly}} straight, {{resulting in an}} irregular shape similar to pitch pine (Pinus rigida). This pine often forms pure stands on sandy or rocky soil. It is fire-adapted to stand-replacing fires, with the cones remaining closed for many years, until a forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones, reseeding the burnt ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} found in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. It is less common in the lake states. The species fruits in the summer in the Rocky Mountains. Also, the species fruits in autumn along the Pacific coast and in the lake states. The species is by itself or scattered in mixed forests. The species can commonly be found under lodgepole pines or other two-needle pines. It is rarely found under <b>jack</b> <b>pines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Pine {{restoration}} {{has been}} attempted {{dating back to}} 1902, but with limited success. Fire suppression in the area has eliminated wildfires in the park since the 1920s. Fire is necessary to the regeneration of white, red, and <b>jack</b> <b>pines</b> in the area because it opens the forest floor and canopy for new trees to grow. An overpopulation of white-tailed deer also stunt the regeneration efforts of these pines, as deer browse young pine seedling and prevent them from maturing into trees.|$|R
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} <b>jack</b> <b>pine</b> as a decorative and abstracted pattern, its shapes boldly simplified against the sunset. This stylization demonstrates Thomson's command of decorative effects, developed {{during his years}} as a graphic designer, and with the strong colour and value contrasts, creates the picture's symbolic resonance. The pine, its branches bowed and placed to the right of centre, extends nearly the full length of the canvas, and is cropped at the top. It rises from a rocky foreground; the hardy <b>jack</b> <b>pine</b> often takes root on shores hostile to other trees, its sparsely leaved branches forming eccentric shapes. It is silhouetted against water and sky, with the canvas bisected by the far shore.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Jack</b> <b>Pine</b> was {{included}} in an exhibition of Thomson's work that travelled across Canada in 2003, organized by the National Gallery and the Art Gallery of Ontario. It was then shown at the Hermitage Museum in Russia in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, <b>jack</b> <b>pine,</b> and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980). Seral species {{giving way to}} white spruce include paper birch, aspen, balsam poplar, <b>jack</b> <b>pine,</b> and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, balsam poplar, <b>jack</b> <b>pine,</b> and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|E
40|$|The middle {{crown and}} south {{quadrant}} of 6 -m-tall <b>jack</b> <b>pines,</b> Pinus banksiana Lamb., produced significantly more cones {{than the rest}} of the tree. The number of cones attacked by Eucosma monitorana Heinrich was also highest in the middle crown and south quadrant. Laspeyresia toreuta (Grote) attacked the most cones in the middle crown. A positive, linear correlation existed between the number of cones attacked by inseets and cone abundanee per tree, indicating a response of the insect population to inereased food supply...|$|R

40|$|The {{pinewood}} nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, was inoculated into established native <b>jack</b> and red <b>pines</b> (Pinus banksiana and P. resinosa) {{and exotic}} Austrian pine (P. nigra) in Minnesota and Wisconsin forests during summer 1981. The nematode isolates {{did not kill}} established nonstressed pine trees growing in the forest. However, the same nematode isolates killed pine seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Girdling the main stem of some trees to induce stress resulted {{in the death of}} the majority of inoculated and noninoculated branches of Austrian and <b>jack</b> <b>pines,</b> but no branch death was observed on red pine. Greater numbers of nematodes were extracted from branches of inoculated, girdled trees than from nongirdled trees. The mean number of nematodes extracted from branches of inoculated, nongirdled trees was 0. 3 - 14 nematodes per gram of wood...|$|R

40|$|Mature {{trees of}} eastern white, jack, Scotch, and shortleaf pines were inoculated with 25, 000 - 34, 000 {{pinewood}} nematodes, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, isolated from infected Scotch pines in Missouri. Equal numbers of trees of each species inoculated with distilled water served as controls. Nine of fifteen Scotch pines died within 4 months of nematode infection {{or during the}} winter and early spring following infection. A single eastern white and shortleaf <b>pine</b> died. No <b>jack</b> <b>pines</b> died. A single Scotch pine control died, apparently the result of natural nematode infection. No other controls died. Mean oleoresin flow did not differ among nematode-inoculated <b>jack</b> and shortleaf <b>pines</b> and their respective controls. Oleoresin flow in nematode-inoculated eastern white and Scotch pines was significantly lower than in their controls. Oleoresin flow was temporarily reduced in mortality-resistant eastern white and Scotch pines following nematode infection. Thus a sublethal impact of nematode infection on mortality-resistant host trees was documented...|$|R
25|$|Glaciers {{shaped the}} area, {{creating}} a unique regional ecosystem. A {{large portion of}} the area is the so-called Grayling outwash plain, which consists of broad outwash plain including sandy ice-disintegration ridges; <b>jack</b> <b>pine</b> barrens, some white pine-red pine forest, and northern hardwood forest. Large lakes were created by glacial action.|$|E
25|$|Another species well {{adapted to}} a {{particular}} disturbance is the <b>Jack</b> <b>Pine</b> in boreal forests exposed to crown fires. They, {{as well as some}} other pine species, have specialized serotinous cones that only open and disperse seeds with sufficient heat generated by fire. As a result, this species often dominates in areas where competition has been reduced by fire.|$|E
25|$|Mountain pine beetles inhabit ponderosa, whitebark, lodgepole, Scotch, <b>jack</b> <b>pine,</b> and limber pine trees. Normally, these insects play an {{important}} role in the life of a forest, attacking old or weakened trees, and speeding development of a younger forest. However, unusually hot, dry summers and mild winters throughout the region during the last few years, along with forests filled with mature lodgepole pine, have led to an unprecedented epidemic.|$|E
60|$|Another day {{she found}} a little grove of <b>jack</b> <b>pines</b> growing on a flat mesa-like bluff, the highest point on her land.

From here Carley could see afar to all points of the compass--the slow green descent {{to the south and}} the climb to the black-timbered distance; the ridged and canyoned country to the west, red vents choked with green and rimmed with gray; to the north the grand upflung mountain kingdom crowned with snow; and to the east the vastness of illimitable space, the openness and wildness, the chased and beaten mosaic of colored sands and rocks.|$|R
50|$|Adults are on wing in mid July. The {{adults are}} unusual {{in that the}} wings are mostly clear, unlike those of most moths. The eggs are laid on the bark in early summer, usually near a wound or in scars or crevices. The larvae feed in tunnels on the inner bark and sapwood, causing a copious flow of pitch, which hardens on the bark. They feed for 2 or 3 years and attain a length of about 25 mm before pupating in the pitch mass. The larvae feed on pine and spruce species, {{including}} Austrian, eastern white, Scots and <b>Jack</b> <b>pines</b> as well as white, Norway and Colorado blue spruce. They create a large mass of pitch at the larval feeding site.|$|R
50|$|Today this bird's {{habitat is}} being {{preserved}} by controlled or prescribed burns and staggered timber harvests in its limited breeding range. The DNR, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Forest Service coordinate the clear cutting of tracts of 50 year old <b>jack</b> <b>pines</b> on 23 Kirdland's Warbler management units. These managed units total 220000 acre. After cutting new trees are planted in a specified pattern {{to mimic the}} natural habitat the warbler needs, with clearings and dense thickets. This management program also provides habitat for other species such as small animals, other birds, deer, porcupines, and turkeys. Since this habitat management regime began in the 1970s, the birds' numbers have steadily risen, with an estimated population of 5,000 in 2016.|$|R
