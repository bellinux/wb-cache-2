We define 12 overlapping bins in a normalized dimensionless (p, B(sub z)) `control space' and fit an ellipsoid to those magnetopause crossings having (p, B(sub z)) values within each bin. We also calculate the bivariate (Inp, B(sub z)) moments to second order over each bin in control space.

The antenna is able to adapt its input impedance to {{a variation in the}} antenna elevation and soil type to keep reflections at the antenna’s terminal min-imum. As a result, energy transfer from the generator to the an-tenna is maximized, which in turn maximizes the energy radiated by the antenna into the ground for different antenna elevations and soil types. The antenna is based on a wire bow-tie structure with variable <b>flare</b> <b>angle</b> for adjusting the antenna’s input impedance.

A particular investigation was conducted to determine the effect of <b>flare</b> <b>angle</b> for constant flare length, surface area, and diameter. Results indicated that at a Reynolds number of approximately 0. 92 x l 0 (exp 6) (based on body diameter), the boundary-layer separation effects were significant only with respect to the slope of the normal-force and pitching-moment curve at low angles of attack. The variations of the aerodynamic characteristics with the various parameters were, in general, similar to those predicted by Newtonian theory below a <b>flare</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees and a ratio of flare base diameter to cylinder diameter of less than approximately 2. 2. The limiting diameter ratio is consistent with the extent of the low-constant dynamic-pressure region near the body caused by the bow-shock influences as predicted by axisymmetric characteristic theory. The effects of the various parameters for the flares that exceeded the limiting diameter ratio follow the trends predicted by the computed flow-field properties. The axial force for these flare configurations at zero angle of attack was, in general, computed within 10 percent by using these properties. For a constant flare length and surface area the flare effectiveness increased with increasing flare angle; however, for constant flare diameter only the axial-force coefficient was affected by <b>flare</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{model the}} IR Spectral Energy Distribution of circumstellar disks {{embedded}} in a HII region and photoevaporated by the external UV radiation. The model applies to the photoevaporated disks (proplyds) in Orion Nebula. First we calculate the IR emission of a PMS star surrounded by a dusty globule that is immersed within an HII region. The globule {{is assumed to be}} spherical, homogeneous, optically thin in the IR and photoevaporated according to the Dyson (1968) model. Second, we consider the IR emission of a disk directly exposed to the nebular environment. The disk is passive and treated according to the Chiang and Goldreich (1997) model. We improve over the CG 97 treatment by tracing the propagation of the various radiative fluxes through the disk superheated atmosphere. Since the opposite disk sides receive different amounts of radiation, the <b>flaring</b> <b>angle</b> and the surface temperature distributions are different, resulting in well distinguished SEDs for the two disk faces. Finally, we combine the globule and disk models to estimate the IR emission of proplyds. The energy input from the central star and the nebular environment increase the disk <b>flaring</b> <b>angle,</b> and therefore also the amount of stellar radiation intercepted by the disk. The relative intensity of the disk vs. envelope emission varies with the tilt angle relative to the directions of th 1 Ori-C, and of the Earth. We explore the dependence of the SEDs upon the tilt angle with respect to the Earth, the distance from th 1 Ori-C, the size on the envelope, the inner disk radius and the temperature of the central star. The resulting SEDs are characterized by a broad peak of emission at 30 - 60 micron, and are in general significantly different from those of isolated disks in low-mass star forming regions like Taurus-Auriga.
