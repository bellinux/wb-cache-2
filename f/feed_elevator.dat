40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to identify how the Amish, living a nineteenth century lifestyle, survive in a world filled with technology and mechanization. It was hoped that such a project would help other communities understand that these two diverse groups of people can live and work together. The Research identified various views about the Amish and their presence near the community of Cashton, Wisconsin, held {{by members of the}} Cashton community. The majority of those interviewed accept the Amish for who they are. They respect the people and their ways. There were a few residents interviewed who opposed having the Amish living near them for various reasons. The research also identified that those interviewed believe that the Amish have had both a positive and negative impact on the businesses of Cashton. According to the interviewees, the businesses that have profited from the Amish are the <b>feed</b> <b>elevator,</b> grocery store, banks, and the cheese factory. Businesses that have lost revenue because of the Amish include the automobile dealers, appliance store, electric company, and the local taverns.

40|$|Abstract Background Animal feed as {{a source}} of {{infection}} to food producing animals is much debated. In order to increase our present knowledge about possible feed transmission {{it is important to know}} that the present isolation methods for Salmonella are reliable also for feed materials. In a comparative study the ability of the standard method used for isolation of Salmonella in feed in the Nordic countries, the NMKL 71 method (Nordic Committee on Food Analysis) was compared to the Modified Semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis method (MSRV) and the international standard method (EN ISO 6579 : 2002). Five different feed materials were investigated, namely wheat grain, soybean meal, rape seed meal, palm kernel meal, pellets of pig feed and also scrapings from a <b>feed</b> mill <b>elevator.</b> Four different levels of the Salmonella serotypes S. Typhimurium, S. Cubana and S. Yoruba were added to each feed material, respectively. For all methods pre-enrichment in Buffered Peptone Water (BPW) were carried out followed by enrichments in the different selective media and finally plating on selective agar media. Results The results obtained with all three methods showed no differences in detection levels, with an accuracy and sensitivity of 65 % and 56 %, respectively. However, MÃ¼ller-Kauffmann tetrathionate-novobiocin broth (MKTTn), performed less well due to many false-negative results on Brilliant Green agar (BGA) plates. Compared to other feed materials palm kernel meal showed a higher detection level with all serotypes and methods tested. Conclusion The results of this study showed that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the investigated cultural methods were equivalent. However, the detection levels for different feed and feed ingredients varied considerably. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The {{founding}} of Rushmore: The city {{was named for}} S.M. Rushmore, an early pioneer. The town owes its existence {{to the construction of}} the Worthington and Sioux Falls Railway, and the desire of a New York capitalist to establish a land colonization scheme in southwestern Minnesota. When the Worthington and Sioux Falls Railway was initially surveyed, it was decided to construct a station house in section 19 of Dewald Township. The station house was Named Miller Station, in honor of ex-governor Stephen Miller, and for two years it had no inhabitants. In 1878, George I. Seney, a New York capitalist, secured control of large plots of railroad land in Dewald and Olney Townships. He immediately began the process of colonizing the lands, bringing out settlers from New York City and other eastern points. On May 27, 1878, a Mr. S. M. Rushmore arrived in Worthington along with his family, and immediately took a train for Miller Station. There he established a store to serve Mr. Seney's flood of colonists. A railroad depot was also constructed, and the town was surveyed and platted. In August 1878, the town was renamed Rushmore [...] in honor of the pioneer shopkeeper, and the community grew rapidly. Indeed, a business directory from the fall of 1879 shows that Rushmore had a general store, a <b>feed</b> mill, an <b>elevator,</b> a hotel, a hardware store, a grocer, a lumber agent, a tinware dealer, a notion store, a jeweler, and two blacksmiths. The town also had a new church and a new school. On March 27, 1900, Rushmore, with a population of 204, was incorporated. Village government promptly began under President S. B. Bedford.|$|R
60|$|An {{elevator}} is as ugly {{a monster}} {{as has been}} yet produced. In uncouthness of form it outdoes those obsolete old brutes who used to roam about the semi-aqueous world, and live a most uncomfortable life with their great hungering stomachs and huge unsatisfied maws. The elevator itself consists of a big movable trunk--movable as is that of an elephant, but not pliable, and less graceful even than an elephant's. This {{is attached to a}} huge granary or barn; but in order to give altitude within the barn for the necessary moving up and down of this trunk--seeing that it cannot be curled gracefully to its purposes as the elephant's is curled--there is an awkward box erected {{on the roof of the}} barn, giving some twenty feet of additional height, up into which the elevator can be thrust. It will be understood, then, that this big movable trunk, the head of which, when it is at rest, is thrust up into the box on the roof, is made to slant down in an oblique direction from the building to the river; for the elevator is an amphibious institution, and flourishes only on the banks of navigable waters. When its head is ensconced within its box, and the beast of prey is thus nearly hidden within the building, the unsuspicious vessel is brought up within reach of the creature's trunk, and down it comes, like a musquito's proboscis, right through the deck, in at the open aperture of the hole, and so into the very vitals and bowels of the ship. When there, it goes to work upon its food with a greed and an avidity that is disgusting to a beholder of any taste or imagination. And now I must explain the anatomical arrangement by which the elevator still devours and continues to devour, till the corn within its reach has all been swallowed, masticated, and digested. Its long trunk, as seen slanting down from out of the building across the wharf and into the ship, is a mere wooden pipe; but this pipe is divided within. It has two departments; and as the grain-bearing troughs pass up the one on a pliable band, they pass empty down the other. The system, therefore, is that of an ordinary dredging machine only that corn and not mud is taken away, and that the buckets or troughs are hidden from sight. Below, within the stomach of the poor bark, three or four laborers are at work, helping to <b>feed</b> the <b>elevator.</b> They shovel the corn up toward its maw, so that at every swallow he should take in all that he can hold. Thus the troughs, as they ascend, are kept full, and when they reach the upper building they empty themselves into a shoot, over which a porter stands guard, moderating the shoot by a door, which the weight of his finger can open and close. Through this doorway the corn runs into a measure, and is weighed. By measures of forty bushels each, the tale is kept. There stands the apparatus, with the figures plainly marked, over against the porter's eye; and as the sum mounts nearly up to forty bushels he closes the door till the grains run thinly through, hardly a handful at a time, so that the balance is exactly struck. Then the teller standing by marks down his figure, and the record is made. The exact porter touches the string of another door, and the forty bushels of corn run out at the bottom of the measure, disappear down another shoot, slanting also toward the water, and deposit themselves in the canal boat. The transit of the bushels of corn from the larger vessel to the smaller will have taken less than a minute, and the cost of that transit will have been--a farthing.|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringMark E. CasadaRonaldo G. MaghirangThe United States grain {{handling}} {{infrastructure is}} facing major challenges to meet worldwide customer demands for wholesome, quality, and safe grains and oilseeds {{for food and}} feed. Several challenges are maintaining grain quality during handling; reducing dust emissions for safety and health issues; growing shift from commodity-based to specialty (trait-specific) markets; proliferation of genetically modified crops for food, feed, fuel, pharmaceutical, and industrial uses; and threats from biological and chemical attacks. This {{study was conducted to}} characterize the quality of grain and <b>feed</b> during bucket <b>elevator</b> handling to meet customer demand for high quality and safe products. Specific objectives were to (1) determine the effect of repeated handling on the quality of feed pellets and corn; (2) characterize the dust generated during corn and wheat handling; (3) develop and evaluate particle models for simulating the flow of grain during elevator handling; and (4) accurately simulate grain commingling in elevator boots with discrete element method (DEM). Experiments were conducted at the research elevator of the USDA-ARS Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR) to determine the effect of repeated handling on the quality of corn-based feed pellets and corn. Repeated handling did not significantly influence the durability indices of feed pellets and corn. The feed pellets, however, had significantly greater breakage (3. 83 % per transfer) than the corn (0. 382 % per transfer). The mass of particulate matter < 125 Î¼m was less for feed pellets than for corn. These corn-based feed pellets can be an alternative to corn in view of their handling characteristics. Another series of experiments was conducted in the same elevator to characterize the dust generated during corn and wheat handling. Dust samples were collected from the lower and upper ducts upstream of the cyclones in the elevator. Handling corn produced {{more than twice as much}} total dust than handling wheat (185 g/t vs. 64. 6 g/t). Analysis of dust samples with a laser diffraction analyzer showed that the corn samples produced smaller dust particles, and a greater proportion of small particles, than the wheat samples. Published data on material and interaction properties of selected grains and oilseeds that are relevant to DEM modeling were reviewed. Using these material and interaction properties and soybeans as the test material, the DEM fundamentals were validated by modeling the flow of soybean during handling with a commercial software package (EDEM). Soybean kernels were simulated with single- and multi-sphere particle shapes. A single-sphere particle model best simulated soybean kernels in the bulk property tests. The best particle model had a particle coefficient of restitution of 0. 6; particle static friction of 0. 45 for soybean-soybean contact (0. 30 for soybean-steel interaction); particle rolling friction of 0. 05; normal particle size distribution with standard deviation factor of 0. 4; and particle shear modulus of 1. 04 MPa. The single-sphere particle model for soybeans was implemented in EDEM to simulate grain commingling in a pilot-scale bucket elevator boot using 3 D and quasi- 2 D models. Pilot-scale boot experiments of soybean commingling were performed to validate these models. Commingling was initially simulated with a full 3 D model. Of the four quasi- 2 D boot models with reduced control volumes (4 d, 5 d, 6 d, and 7 d; i. e., control volume widths from 4 to 7 times the mean particle diameter) considered, the quasi- 2 D (6 d) model predictions best matched those of the initial 3 D model. Introduction of realistic vibration motion during the onset of clear soybeans improved the prediction capability of the quasi- 2 D (6 d) model. The physics of the model was refined by accounting for the initial surge of particles and reducing the gap between the bucket cups and the boot wall. Inclusion of the particle surge flow and reduced gap gave the best predictions of commingling of all the tested models. This study showed that grain commingling in a bucket elevator boot system can be simulated in 3 D and quasi- 2 D DEM models and gave results that generally agreed with experimental data. The quasi- 2 D (6 d) models reduced simulation run time by 29 % compared to the 3 D model. Results of this study will be used to accurately predict impurity levels and improve grain handling, which can help farmers and grain handlers reduce costs during transport and export of grains and make the U. S. grain more competitive in the world market...|$|R
