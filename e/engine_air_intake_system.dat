50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the <b>engine’s</b> <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system.</b> The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the <b>engine’s</b> <b>air</b> stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{continuous}} {{work in the}} automobile industry to reduce the environmental impact, reduce fuel consumption and increase efficiency, new technologies {{need to be developed}} and implemented in vehicles. For spark ignited engines, one technology that has received more attention in recent years is long route Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), which means that exhaust gases after the turbine are transported back to the volume before the compressor in the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> of the <b>engine.</b> In this work, the components of the long route EGR system is modeled with mean value engine models in Simulink, and implemented in a existing Simulink engine model. Then different methods for estimating the mass flow over the long route EGR system are compared, and the transport delays for the recirculated exhaust gases in the <b>engines</b> <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> are modeled. This work is based on measurements done on an engine rig, on which a long route EGR system was installed. Finally, some ideas on how a long route EGR system on a gasoline engine can be controlled are presented based on the results in this thesis work...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research was to analyze the flow through the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> of 1. 6 L Proton Waja engine by adding guide vane. The pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> {{is known to have}} a significant influence on the indicated power of the SI engine. The pressure drop along the <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> is proportional to the engine speed and cross sectional area. The guide vane is placed in the system to reduce the pressure drop across the system. It was found that the guide vane help to reduce pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> where it increases the capabilities of air induction system to suck more <b>air</b> to the <b>engine.</b> The geometry of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> of Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine was used in the modeling approach.

50|$|Most {{vehicles}} manufactured {{from the}} mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> that regulate {{the temperature of}} the <b>air</b> entering the <b>engine's</b> <b>intake</b> tract, providing warm <b>air</b> when the <b>engine</b> is cold and cold <b>air</b> when the <b>engine</b> is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy. With the advent of advanced emission controls and more advanced fuel injection methods modern vehicles do not have a thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> and the factory installed <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> draws unregulated cold air. Aftermarket cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance. The putative principle behind a cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> is that cooler air has a higher density, thus containing more oxygen per volume unit than warmer air.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> in a diesel engine could limit the overall engine performance. The intake manifold {{is an important part}} of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> where enough <b>air</b> should be guided to the cylinder. Compactness is a conflicting feature to performance as engine rooms in general, and thereby engines, should use little space. Thus, the development of an <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> manifold requires knowledge about function and placement of most other parts in the engine so that a compatible and compact <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> manifold can be created. MarineDiesel AB is a Swedish company from Ängelholm developing and manufacturing marine diesel engines. The Master thesis project work has been performed in a real project where an engine, previously used in a train, is converted into a marine engine with twice the power. The engine must be designed to fit with the new requirements of the customer. These requirements directly affect the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> which must, as all other engine system, match the desired performance. A well-defined development process with theoretical and practical research together with company guidelines and engineering assessments has generated the concepts in this product development master thesis project. Two different intake manifold concepts have been created. The concepts are different in aspect to both manifold design and <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> configuration. The <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> and the manifold are dependent and therefore a feasible system concept has also been developed to each of the concepts. The {{performance of}} the concepts has been verified through flow simulation and the development process has secured their feasibility. The focus has been set on creating flexible feasible concepts that are possible to manufacture when adapted to future requirements. This creates the best possible prerequisites of implementation later in the project. In other words, the design limitations should be low in this stage of the project and thus the two final concepts are only conceptual and not ready for production. Worth mentioning is that the OEM manifold capabilities are deemed to be sufficient for implementation with both system concepts, replacing the manifold concep...|$|R
