5000|$|The normal {{functioning}} of a CCD, astronomical or otherwise, {{can be divided}} into two phases: exposure and readout. During the first phase, the CCD passively collects incoming photons, storing electrons in its cells. After the exposure time is passed, the cells are read out one line at a time. During the readout phase, cells are shifted down the entire area of the CCD. While they are shifted, they continue to collect light. Thus, if the shifting is not fast enough, errors can result from light that falls on a cell <b>holding</b> <b>charge</b> during the transfer. These errors are referred to as [...] "vertical smear" [...] and cause a strong light source to create a vertical line above and below its exact location. In addition, the CCD cannot be used to collect light while it is being read out. Unfortunately, a faster shifting requires a faster readout, and a faster readout can introduce errors in the cell charge measurement, leading to a higher noise level.|$|E
5000|$|The terms {{elastance}} and elastivity were {{coined by}} Oliver Heaviside in 1886. [...] Heaviside coined {{a great many}} of the terms used in circuit analysis today, such as impedance, inductance, admittance, and conductance. Heaviside's terminology followed the model of resistance and resistivity with the -ance ending used for extensive properties and the -ivity ending used for intensive properties. The extensive properties are used in circuit analysis (they are the [...] "values" [...] of components) and the intensive properties are used in field analysis. Heaviside's nomenclature was designed to highlight the connection between corresponding quantities in field and circuit. [...] Elastivity is the intensive property of a material corresponding to the bulk property of a component, elastance. It is the reciprocal of permittivity. As Heaviside put it,Here, permittance is Heaviside's term for capacitance.

40|$|Purpose – The {{design of}} {{distribution}} networks {{is prone to}} risks due to the uncertainties associated with factors that change over time. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a new method to identify those factors that the structure of a distribution network is most sensitive to. Design/methodology/approach – A new method presented in this paper combines simulation and the Taguchi technique to allow a wide range of factor uncertainties to be evaluated without excessive computation time and effort. The simulation model developed is based on real world data of a European after-sales business in the automotive industry. Findings – The optimum design is most at risk due to the uncertainties associated with stock holding costs and delivery frequencies rather than customer volume changes and transport tariffs. This was found to be counterintuitive by the business managers and fore-warned them of the likely future risks. Practical implications – The analysis indicates that when developing the network a careful consideration has to be given to reliably estimating the inventory holding costs and the mechanism for determining the capital <b>holding</b> <b>charge.</b> The model is sensitive to these variables and hence a company is prone to higher risk of designing the wrong network if these variables are incorrectly estimated. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that higher customer expectations on delivery frequency have an impact on total logistics costs and therefore, companies should consider charging customers different rates for different levels of customer service. Originality/value – A useful generic method has been presented in this paper for investigating the sensitivity of a scenario. This novel approach combines the use of simulation, brainstorming, Taguchi technique and ANOVA with distribution design modelling...|$|E
