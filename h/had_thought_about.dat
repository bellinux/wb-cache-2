5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects.

I remembered a character I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E

[...] William Watts Folwell who was the {{founding}} president of the University of Minnesota, and Berry and Loring, both from Maine, were all united in their love for nature. The system Cleveland created is characterized by the use of indigenous plants in their natural environment and by the linking of open spaces and landmarks across distance with boulevards and parkways. Cleveland <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> linked public open spaces as early as 1855.|$|E
500|$|McCain <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> {{entering}} politics {{since his}} return from Vietnam, although 1964 {{had been the only}} time in his life he had ever voted. In 1976, he briefly thought of running for the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida; he had the support of some local figures in Jacksonville, but was convinced by other Republican Party leaders {{that he did not have}} sufficient political experience, funding, or popular support to defeat longtime Democratic incumbent Charles E. Bennett. [...] Instead, he worked so hard for Ronald Reagan's 1976 Republican primary campaign that his base commander reprimanded him for being too politically active for his naval position.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> an episode in which Mr. Burns would lose his money {{and would have to}} interact with the outside world. In DVD commentary the writers explained that while Mr. Burns tried to change he [...] "couldn't help being himself". Professional wrestler Bret Hart made a cameo as himself, animated in his pink wrestling outfit. [...] "The Old Man and the Lisa" [...] contains cultural references to the television series That Girl and the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

500|$|James Ferguson, {{the third}} laird, owned the estate during the Industrial Revolution in Britain. He {{began work on}} a canal between Pitfour and Peterhead in 1797, despite fierce {{opposition}} from adjoining landowners. The canal was proposed to cover about ten miles following {{the course of the}} River Ugie. Pitfour's canal is sometimes called the St Fergus and River Ugie Canal. Ferguson <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> building the canal since 1793, but it was never completed because of [...] "difficulties in effecting the necessary arrangements with neighbouring heritors." [...] Objections were raised by the Merchant Maiden Hospital, which owned the land {{on the south side of}} the Ugie. Despite being advised to take out an interdict to prevent the work, in January 1797 the hospital thought its case was not strong enough. The hospital applied for an interdict four months later however, when [...] of the canal had been dug to the point where the north and south Ugie joined; it was granted in July 1797.|$|E
500|$|Late in the war, {{under the}} {{sponsorship}} of von Neumann, Frankel and Metropolis began to carry out calculations on the first general-purpose electronic computer, the ENIAC at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. [...] Shortly after returning to Los Alamos, Ulam participated {{in a review of}} results from these calculations. [...] Earlier, while playing solitaire during his recovery from surgery, Ulam <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> playing hundreds of games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful outcome. [...] With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of computers made such statistical methods very practical. John von Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight. In March 1947 he proposed a statistical approach to the problem of neutron diffusion in fissionable material. [...] Because Ulam had often mentioned his uncle, Micha≈Ç Ulam, [...] "who just had to go to Monte Carlo" [...] to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach [...] "The Monte Carlo method". Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified paper on the Monte Carlo method in 1949.|$|E
500|$|After {{buying the}} rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active {{development}} in November 1995. Steven Spielberg <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought {{the rights to}} the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; [...] "We both ended up doing a lot of everything," [...] Adamson said. [...] "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{exhaustive}} investigations, none {{of these}} agencies discovered any further murders attributable to Rader, confirming early suspicions that Rader would have taken credit for any additional murders that he had committed. The 10 known murders are now {{believed to be the}} only murders that Rader is actually responsible for, although Wichita police are fairly certain that Rader stalked and researched a number of other potential victims. This includes one person who was saved when Rader called off his planned attack upon his arrival near the target's home due to the presence of construction and road crews near her home. Rader stated in his police interview that [...] "there are a lot of lucky people," [...] meaning that he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> and developed various levels of murder plans for other victims.|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked what}} they would do if he induced his comrades to {{surrender}}. Kelly stated, [...] "I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, [...] "You can depend on us." [...] Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly [...] "lagged" [...] at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it for some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Holmes {{published}} {{a summary of}} his thinking about the Schlieffen Plan and the debates about it in Not the Schlieffen Plan. He wrote that people believed that the Schlieffen Plan was for a grand offensive against France, to gain a decisive victory in six weeks. The Russians would be held back and then defeated with reinforcements rushed by rail from the west. Holmes wrote that no-one had produced a source showing that Schlieffen intended a huge right-wing flanking move into France, in a two-front war. The 1905 Memorandum was for War against France, in which Russia was unable to participate. Schlieffen <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> such an attack on two general staff rides (Generalstabsreisen) in 1904, on the staff ride of 1905 and in the deployment plan [...] I, for 1905‚Äì06 and 1906‚Äì07, in which all of the German army fought the French. In none of these plans was a two-front war contemplated; the common view that Schlieffen thought that such an offensive would guarantee victory in a two-front war was wrong. In his last exercise critique in December 1905, Schlieffen wrote that the Germans would be so outnumbered against France and Russia, that the Germans must rely on a counter-offensive strategy against both enemies and eliminate one as quickly as possible.|$|E
2500|$|While the game's primary {{gameplay}} modes {{were easily}} developed {{to account for}} unique abilities of all characters, the developers also <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> a Capture the Flag mode for several years, recognizing that most team-based first-person shooters included some type of variant on this mode. The largest issue that this mode faced was the speed or warping abilities {{of some of the}} characters, like Tracer, which could pick up the flag and warp back to their base, leaving the other team unable to stop them. Thus they would either find matches reduced to players selecting the speediest characters, or having to put so many restrictions in place that the result game no longer felt like Overwatch. Over several iterations, they devised a scheme that they put to public testing in January 2017 through the [...] "Capture the Rooster" [...] special event to celebrate the Chinese New Year; here, to prevent speedy characters from running immediately after collecting the flag, they must wait a few seconds before they can run or use their special powers, leaving them vulnerable for that period. Initially having no plans to retain the Capture the Flag mode after the event, Blizzard announced that they will keep the event as a custom game mode with additional options.|$|E
