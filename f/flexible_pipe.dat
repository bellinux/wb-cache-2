60|$|A row {{of bubbles}} slowly crossed the belt of shade, stopped {{and made a}} frothy patch, and then {{lengthened}} out. A <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> slipped across {{the edge of the}} open gangway, and Lister felt the line he held. The line was slack and he knew the diver needed nothing. Two half-naked men, their skins shining with sweat, turned the air-pumps handles, and the rattle of the cranks cut the dull rumble of the surf. Brown, sitting on a tool-box, studied a plan of the wreck Cartwright had given him, and Lister thought it typical Cartwright had got the plan. The old fellow was very keen.|$|E
60|$|A {{plume of}} steam that looked faint and diaphanous {{in the strong}} light blew away from the noisy machine. A large <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> rose from the {{submerged}} hold and another ran from the pump across the hulk's deck. From {{the end of the}} pipe a thick, brown flood poured into the water and stained the green lagoon as the flood tide carried it along. The clash and rattle of the engine carried far, for the load was heavy and Lister was using full steam. The boiler was large and the furnace burned more coal than he had thought. Sometimes palm kernels that had not altogether rotted jambed the fans, and he held the valve-wheel, trying to ease the shocks, while the perspiration dripped from his blistered skin. When Brown indicated the steamer he looked up.|$|E
60|$|We {{arrived here}} {{yesterday}} at two. The room will not hold more than from eighty to ninety pounds. The same scene was repeated {{with the additional}} feature, {{that the people are}} much rougher here than in Dublin, and that there was a very great uproar {{at the opening of the}} doors, which, the police in attendance being quite inefficient and only looking on, it was impossible to check. Arthur was in the deepest misery because shillings got into stalls, and half-crowns got into shillings, and stalls got nowhere, and there was immense confusion. It ceased, however, the moment I showed myself; and all went most brilliantly, in spite of a great piece of the cornice of the ceiling falling with a great crash within four or five inches of the head of a young lady on my platform (I was obliged to have people there), and in spite of my gas suddenly going out at the time of the game of forfeits at Scrooge's nephew's, through some Belfastian gentleman accidentally treading on the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe,</b> and needing to be relighted.|$|E

40|$|Multiphase flows {{include several}} flow regimes that exist with {{different}} conditions. The time varying forces in <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> conveying two-phase flows results in very dynamic structural behavior. These varying forces contribute to fatigue stresses {{which have a}} major effect on a riser life time. Studying the dynamic response of <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> conveying two-phase flows can reveal crucial information regarding induced vibrations and oscillations in risers. These information can be utilized in understanding operational hazards with flexible risers in oil and gas industry. An experimental investigation of <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> is {{carried out in the}} lab. A small scale experimental loop was designed for testing structural behavior of <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> conveying air and water two-phase flow. Experiments were recorded and video processing techniques were utilized for analyzing structural response. The amplitudes of structural oscillations were measured for several cases at different pipe lengths and flow superficial velocities. Two main geometries were investigated, a cantilever pipe in vertical and horizontal direction and a geometry representing a riser collapse inspired by a real accident from oil and gas industry. The experimental results were compared to numerical simulations from a structural dynamic analysis code. The work produced in this thesis was presented for publishing as a part of scientific paper shown in Appendix (A) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} civil {{engineering}} systems {{is a consequence}} of decision making under uncertain conditions. Generally, buried <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> are designed for their transversal behavior to prevent from the important failure mode of buckling. However, the interaction effects between soil and pipe are neglected and the uncertainties in their properties are usually not considered in pipe design. In this regard, the present research paper evaluates the effects of these uncertainties on the uncertainty of the critical buckling hoop force of <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> shallowly buried using the subgrade reaction theory (Winkler model) and First-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) method. The results show that the structural uncertainties of the studied pipes and those of the soil properties {{have a significant effect on}} the uncertainty of the critical buckling hoop force, and therefore taking into account these latter in the design of the shallowly <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> for their buckling behavior is required...|$|R
30|$|Buried pipes can be {{classified}} as either flexible or rigid {{depending on whether the}} pipe itself can deform up to 2  % without incurring damage. Rigid pipes, such as reinforced/non-reinforced concrete, and clay pipes, may experience significant structural cracks if they deflect more than 2  % (Zhao et al., 1998). <b>Flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> have been defined as conduits that can deflect at least 2  % without exhibiting any sign of structural distress such as cracking (Uni-Bell PVC <b>Pipe</b> Association, 2001). <b>Flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> include thermoplastics [i.e., Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)], thermosetting, and corrugated steel pipes.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{flexible}} risers {{are a common}} term for cables, umbilicals and flexible pipes,that are freely or semi-freely suspended between two points (offshore). <b>Flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> are mostly used to transport fluids between platforms/ships etc. to a flow-line/sea floor installation or similar. The safe operating window for the installation is limited by whether induced motion of the installation vessel giving rise to dynamic tension and curvature at the touch-down-zone (TDZ). By investigation and establishing of calculative methods to determine the actual limits of installation and operation, this paper wishes to further the knowledge of global torsion instability of <b>flexible</b> dynamical <b>pipes</b> in catenary configuration at the Touch-down-point (TDP). Today's methods are conservative and {{an expansion of the}} operating/installation widow will have direct economical benefits for the industry. As the filed of global torsion instability in {{flexible risers}} have already been touched upon before, this work centres around furthering this knowledge with special wight on larger cross-section diameter as found in <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes.</b> Trough analysis have been made following already established methodologies, as well as a new method made in order to linking local effects and failure modes, to global torsion problems. The results show that not all prediction methods established for offshore cables are suitable for pipes. In addition, it is seen that the most critical waves are not always the larger ones {{when it comes to the}} coupling between dynamic heave motion and torsion instability. Lastly it is found from the analysis, that dynamic <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> may very well resist global torsion buckling, even when there is compression at the TDP. On top of this, dynamic <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> are also very good at resisting global torsion failure, while under the influence of other failures, such as flooding of the annulus and local lateral buckling of the tensile armour. The final conclusion is that the presented opinion in newer studies on torsion instability, about the practises of today being to conservative, has been further strengthened and the limits are much larger than first anticipated...|$|R
