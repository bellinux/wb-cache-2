The electrical impedance of the prototypes was found to be similar to that of a state-of-the-art <b>industrial</b> <b>package.</b> Moreover, the proposed process is simple and cost-effective.

40|$|Residual oil {{continues}} to be the fuel of choice for many industrial steam users while environmental regulations allow its use. However, new emissions regulations on NOx and SOx are requiring substantial improvements in emissions performance or it will be regulated out of existence. This paper discusses the results and effectiveness of low NOx design modifications to residual oil firing <b>industrial</b> boilers. <b>Industrial</b> <b>package</b> boilers have specific performance criteria that impede the effectiveness of such low NOx techniques. Factors such as smaller furnaces, higher firing densities, lack of air preheat, widened operating envelope, simple controls, and variable fuel quality make the <b>industrial</b> <b>package</b> boiler a more challenging low NOx environment than a field erected or utility boiler. This paper summarizes the results of this NOx reduction program on several industrial water tube boilers, both package and field erected. The results indicate that significant NOx reduction can be obtained through spray pattern modification to produce a staged spray flame with rich and lean zones. The resulting spray flame reduces both thermal and fuel NOx production in cases where the furnace possessed sufficient volume to allow the increases in flame length and width resulting from the flame staging. These results indicate the effectiveness of NOx reduction techniques is directly linked to the size and residence time in the furnace {{and the quality of the}} fuel. Reductions in NOx of up to 25 % can be obtained simply through judicious use of spray staging. The greatest NOx reductions are obtained in field erected boilers with low firing densities as a result of the ability to stage the combustion. The variability in fuel characteristics such as viscosity, distillation curve, carbon residue, and ash composition limits the potential emissions reduction and maintaining stable combustion...|$|R
