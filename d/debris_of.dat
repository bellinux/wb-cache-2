5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{frequency}} <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow disaster has increased, {{which is one}} of the natural disasters during extremely heavy rainfall condition. This paper described the analysis method about deposition characteristics <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow using topographic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path. First, we observed topographic changes by differencing high- resolution LiDAR DEMs acquired before and after the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow event. We assumed that deposition on outside <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path was generated by movements due to the inertia <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flows. Then, we analyzed three topographic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path: slope in flow direction, transition angle of flow path, and the net efficiency(L/H) <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flows defined by the ratio of transport length(L) and elevation difference(H). We applied this method to Umyeon Mountain debris flow event in July 2011. The results showed that deposition on outside <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path due to the inertia <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flows was significantly related to the transition angle <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path. Also, we figured out that there were more frequent such deposition...|$|R

5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{commonly}} known as the admirable bolete, the bragger's bolete, and the velvet top, is an edible species of fungus in the Boletaceae mushroom family. The fruit body has several characteristics with which it may be identified: a dark reddish-brown cap; yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap; and a reddish-brown stem with long narrow reticulations. Aureoboletus mirabilis is found in coniferous forests along the Pacific Coast of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, A.mirabilis sometimes appears to fruit on the wood or woody <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> Hemlock, suggesting a saprobic lifestyle. Despite occasional appearances to the contrary, Aureoboletus mirabilis is mycorrhizal, and forms close mutualistic associations with hemlock roots.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena adscendens are found {{scattered}} to grouped together in twos or threes on fallen twigs, bark, and woody <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> hardwoods {{during the spring}} and autumn; it fruits less frequently on the wood of conifers. Fruitings are most common after periods of wet weather. They are also found growing on hazel nuts that have fallen to the ground; two other Mycenas known to grow on this substrate include M.discopus and M.nucicola. In the United States, it is known from Washington to California. It {{is also found in}} Europe, and has been collected in Amasya Province, Turkey.

The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E

She was there for two months before {{returning}} to San Diego and resuming training missions off the west coast in summer 1957. In November 1957, she found some <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> Pan Am Flight 7, an airline flight that disappeared en route to Hawaii. In January 1958, she steamed west on her last 7th Fleet deployment. Remaining six months, she returned to San Diego on 15 July and commenced inactivation. She was decommissioned 28 December 1958 and berthed with the United States Reserve Fleet at Long Beach, California. She was redesignated AVT-11, an auxiliary aircraft transport and landing training ship, on 15 May 1959. After 10 years docked at the reserve fleet, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 December 1969 and sold for scrapping on 23 March 1971 to Zidell Explorations Corporation in Portland, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Macedonian architecture, {{although}} {{utilizing a}} mixture of different forms and styles {{from the rest of}} Greece, did not represent a unique or diverging style from other ancient Greek architecture. Among the classical orders, Macedonian architects favored the Ionic order, especially in the peristyle courtyards of private homes. There are several surviving examples, albeit in ruins, of Macedonian palatial architecture, including a palace {{at the site of the}} capital Pella, the summer residence of Vergina near the old capital Aigeiai, and the royal residence at Demetrias near modern Volos. At Vergina, the ruins of three large banquet halls with marble-tiled floors (covered in the <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> roof tiles) with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly 16.7 x 17.6m (54.8 x 57.7ft) demonstrate perhaps the earliest examples of monumental triangular roof trusses, if dated before the reign of Antigonus II Gonatas or even the onset of the Hellenistic period. Later Macedonian architecture also featured arches and vaults. The palaces of both Vergina and Demetrias had walls made of sundried bricks, while the latter palace had four corner towers around a central courtyard in the manner of a fortified residence fit for a king or at least a military governor.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Jupiter and Saturn {{are thought}} to have formed through co-accretion, a similar process to that {{believed}} to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's Galilean satellites, but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as Iapetus and Rhea, were formed from the <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's orbital eccentricity.|$|E
