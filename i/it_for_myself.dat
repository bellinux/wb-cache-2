500|$|The {{fragrance}} called [...] "L" [...] {{was launched}} in September, 2007 at Soho House in New York City. Stefani worked with perfumer Harry Fremont to develop the scent. Stefani described the fragrance as [...] "it's another thing you can wear and another thing I {{can be part of}} creatively. I created <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> -- it's like me shrunk into a box." [...] The perfume is a blend of the aromas of hyacinth, white freesia, fresh pear, violet, jasmine, rose, lily, sweet pea, orange blossom, peach, frangipani, heliotrope and musk. The perfume was available in 50ml and 100ml bottles.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, DeLonge claimed {{the album was}} only an attempt to [...] "challenge myself to do different shit": [...] "I did <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> whether it sold a million copies or just one, it was for myself." [...] He clarified the band's future succinctly: [...] "There {{are a lot of}} emotions between Mark and I and that's why there’s never going to be another Box Car Racer album. It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody." [...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious and a little more important." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
2500|$|On December 3, 2008, Cincinnati-based NBC {{affiliate}} WLWT asked Huckabee {{about the}} prospect of running, to which he said, [...] "I'm pretty sure I'll be out there.

500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{inspired}} {{performance by}} Bergkamp helped Arsenal win 0–4 at West Ham United {{in the first}} weekend of February. He, however missed the following match, away to Manchester United, due to suspension along with Petit; Keown was absent due to a hamstring injury. Arsenal conceded a first half penalty when Ray Parlour brought down Ronny Johnsen. Dwight Yorke missed, chipping the ball wide of the right-hand post, and was made to pay {{early in the second}} half as new signing Nwankwo Kanu's through ball found striker Anelka, who scored. Andy Cole equalised moments after – Arsenal's first goal conceded in two months, and with both teams spurring chances to win the match, it ended in a 1–1 draw. Three days after, Anelka scored his first career hat-trick against Leicester City. Bergkamp after the match felt Arsenal were now equipped to push on for a title challenge, like last season: [...] "It's all coming back. I feel <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> and for the team." [...] A draw at Newcastle left the team three points behind Chelsea, in third position.|$|E

2500|$|In spelled-out {{fraction}}s, hyphens {{are usually}} used when the fraction {{is used as}} an adjective but not when it {{is used as a}} noun: thus [...] majority and [...] portion but I drank two thirds of the bottle or I kept three quarters of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> However, at least one major style guide hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun).|$|E
2500|$|Cornered by his {{voicemail}} to Mike Jones requesting meth, Haggard {{told the}} press, [...] "I bought <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> but never used it. I was tempted but I never used it." [...] Haggard claimed {{he bought the}} meth but threw it away. Haggard claimed {{he had never met}} his accuser. Jones volunteered to take a polygraph test on a KHOW radio show hosted by Peter Boyles, where Jones first made the allegations. However, Jones's responses during the section of the polygraph test about whether he had engaged in sex with Haggard indicated deception. The test administrator, John Kresnik, discounted the test results because of Jones's stress and lack of eating or sleeping. Regardless, Haggard responded by saying, [...] "We're so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did." [...] Jones was not asked questions about drug use. Jones expressed doubt that he would retake the test, saying [...] "I've made my point. He's the one who has discredited himself. He should admit it and move on." [...] Eventually, Haggard acknowledged almost all of the allegations against him, including using meth and resigned from all of his leadership positions in religious organizations including the National Association of Evangelicals.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2010, Body Talk Pt. 2 was {{released}} in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of [...] "Hang with Me" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, on 5 September. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like I needed to do. I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I just did <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired {{and to be able}} to do the things I like to do". She said that she would not do it again: [...] "When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, and it takes a while to fill back up and have new things to talk about, so I think it's good for everyone". Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas Åhlund, it was described as a [...] "pulsating full power version [...] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long." [...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997. Combined, the Body Talk albums have sold 91,000 copies in the US ...|$|E
