40|$|Device {{independent}} color {{requires that}} all color imaging devices speak in CIE colorimetric terms. A color image scanner is {{one component of}} the desktop color imaging chain {{that needs to be}} colorimetric if color is to be device independent. Most commercial color scanners are not colorimetric. Instead, they are built as color den-sitometers, emulating commercial <b>graphic</b> arts <b>scanners.</b> There are a wide variety of spectral response options if the design goal is a colorimetric scanner. This paper explores almost color mixture spectral response options using Neugebauers Colorimetric Quality Factor (CQF) as a design merit function. A set of empirical equations relating the average CIEL*a*b * color difference to the CQF under three CIE illuminants (A, F 2 and D 65) is de-veloped, based on a database of over 1000 colors representing a wide variety of colorants and color imaging technologies. Our goal is to empirically bridge this gap between the CQF specification for each channel and the scanners colorimetric performance, in terms of CIEL*a*b * color difference. For spectral response functions that have a high CQF, a universal transformation matrix is described for transforming almost colorimetric scanner RGB data to approximate CIE XYZ tristimulus data. Scanner peak wavelength and bandwidth require-ments for colorimetric and densitometric applications are also reported...|$|R

25|$|Counterfeiting is {{measured}} using a system borrowed from chemistry known as {{parts per million}} (PPM). Normally used to judge the potency of molecules in a solution, PPM in the counterfeit sense refers {{to the number of}} fake banknotes found in circulation for every one million genuine notes. In 1990, Canada's counterfeit ratio was just 4 PPM, ranking its currency among the most secure in the world. By the late 1990s, the rise of powerful and affordable home computers, store-bought <b>graphics</b> software, easy-to-use <b>scanners</b> and colour ink-jet printers were breeding a new generation of counterfeiters. The number of fake Canadian bills rose as high as 117 PPM by 1997. In 2004 Canada’s counterfeit rate had ballooned to 470 PPM. In 2012, the counterfeiting rate had fallen to its lowest point, at 28 PPM. It has since started modestly rising to 36 PPM in 2014. The Bank of Canada's MTP (Medium Term Plan) target to stay below is 30 PPM. Most G20 nations used 50 PPM as their benchmark to stay below.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A reliable colour appearance model is desired by industry to achieve high colour fidelity between images produced using a range of different imaging devices. The {{aim of this study}} was to derive a reliable colour appearance model capable of predicting the change of perceived attributes of colour appearance under a wide range of media/viewing conditions. The research was divided into three parts: characterising imaging devices, conducting a psychophysical experiment, and developing a colour appearance model. Various imaging devices were characterised including a <b>graphic</b> art <b>scanner,</b> a Cromalin proofing system, an IRIS ink jet printer, and a Barco Calibrator. For the former three devices, each colour is described by four primaries: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K). Three set of characterisation samples (120 and 31 black printer, and cube data sets) were produced and measured for deriving and testing the printing characterisation models. Four black printer algorithms (BPA), were derived. Each included both forward and reverse processes. A 2 nd BPA printing model taking into account additivity failure, grey component replacement (GCR) algorithm gave the most accurate prediction to the characterisation data set than the other BPA models. The PLCC (Piecewise Linear interpolation assuming Constant Chromaticity coordinates) monitor model was also implemented to characterise the Barco monitor. The psychophysical experiment was conducted to compare Cromalin hardcopy images viewed in a viewing cabinet and softcopy images presented on a monitor under a wide range of illuminants (white points) including: D 93, D 65, D 50 and A. Two scaling methods: category judgement and paired comparison, were employed by viewing a pair of images. Three classes of colour models were evaluated: uniform colour spaces, colour appearance models and chromatic adaptation transforms. Six images were selected and processed via each colour model. The results indicated that the BFD chromatic transform gave the most accurate predictions of the visual results. Finally, a colour appearance model, LLAB, was developed. It is a combination of the BFD chromatic transform and a modified version of CIELAB uniform colour space to fit the LUTCRI Colour Appearance Data previously accumulated. The form of the LLAB model is much simpler and its performance is more precise to fit experimental data than those of the other models...|$|R
40|$|A GIS-Based {{project for}} the {{management}} of restoration interventions was developed in the Lebanon: survey data, cataloguing of stone (both in structures and scattered), degradation of the archaeological areas of Baalbek and Tyre, where restoration and optimisation works have already been carried out. The project is structured as a single “Geodatabase” and includes the entire archaeological area of Baalbek, while the urban area of Tyre is subdivided into two main physically separated areas called “City Site” and “Al Bass”. The GIS processes all the data relevant to the position, dispersion and dimensions of the objects georeferenced in the Reference System WGS 84 with UTM projection Zone 36 N, as well as the technical data to describe the quality of the objects represented. The Project in this way makes it possible to individually manage, analyse and assess the graphic representation, at a layer level, through the “Polygon” primitive and query the database in SQL language. The requisites used to develop the GIS projects may be subdivided into three categories: descriptive data (analytic datasheets of the architectural elements etc); <b>graphic</b> data (laser <b>scanner</b> surveys; general plan of the islands; maps; satellite images, etc.); photographic data (documentation and archive photographs). The mapping base (vectorial in CAD and Orthophoto raster) made it possible to vectorialise all the elements rendered with the three consecutive geometric primitives of the GIS (Points, Polylines and Polygons). The relations and connection and contiguity relationships between the GIS element are guaranteed by the topological functions. The excellent orthophotos, DEMs and the particularly accurate TINs obtained made it possible to develop an important phase of 3 D data processing through the ESRI ArcScene. The historical charts and grids that permitted spatial diachronic analysis also proved to be invaluable...|$|R
30|$|Stroke {{recognition}}: Stroke recognition can {{be viewed}} as the problem of transforming text in the 2 D spatial cursive forms into symbolic representation. There are two categories: online and offline based on the way of data collection. Online indicates that the writing order is available while offline only has the finished writing results. Order information are collected using an electronic pad or touch screen by recording the ordered two-dimensional coordinates of successive points pressing on the device. Plamondon et al. [2] provide a comprehensive survey on stroke recognition in both categories, and Tappert et al. [1] review those online recognition state-of-the-art algorithms. However, all research reviewed in these two papers mainly focus on the recognition of alphabetic languages, but Chinese Mandarin is a pictographic language by connecting pictographic characters to form sentences instead of spelling the vocabularies. A Chinese character is generally composed of mostly straight lines or “poly-line” strokes. Many characters can be decomposed into relatively independent substructures, called radicals, and different characters may share some common radicals. Generally, recognition can utilize this property to simplify their recognition. Liu et al. [3] survey the advances in online Chinese character recognition. Although there are more feature extraction algorithms [14, 15] invented for image content understanding, developing proper features for Chinese characters is still problematic because of different personal writing habits. Furthermore, the concept can be extended furthermore to recognize the traffic sign while driving [16]. With the advance of mobile devices, social messaging becomes very important [17]. As a result, instant messaging replaces letter writing for personal communication, and typing is the most common input manner for message creation. Since mobile devices have a small screen for typing, they generally cause the following typing difficulties: fast input and fat finger. Therefore, with the entrance of <b>scanners,</b> <b>graphics</b> tablets, and touch screens, Plamondon et al. [2] propose to take handwriting as input and use stroke recognition to replace inconvenient typing. Prochasson et al. [4] collect handwriting data including skeletons, rebuses, and phonetic writing to construct a recognition system for texting input. Although stroke recognition can make texting more intuitive, the robustness of recognition is still problematic due to different writing habits among different users. Therefore, we intend to directly deliver the writing or drawing in a vectorized format without recognition. Furthermore, computer characters and words cannot deliver the emotion and feeling of the user while he/she creates the message. Therefore, this work aims at adding emotional aspects which are missing from texting into instant messaging through handwriting.|$|R
