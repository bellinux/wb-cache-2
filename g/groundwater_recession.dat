In the present study, time series models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vec-tor machines (SVMs) have been developed and applied to groundwater level data from the Gasan, Shingwang, and Cheon-gseong stations of the National Groundwater Monitoring Network. We designed four types of model according to input structure and compared their performances.

40|$|The main {{aspiration}} {{behind this}} study was to calculate <b>groundwater</b> <b>recession</b> parameter using recently developed method and to apply calculated parameter for calculation of groundwater recharge. The equation for the hydrograph recession curve can be utilized to predict groundwater recharge during each recession period. The steps involved during recession curve analysis include selection of analytical expression, derivation of recession characteristic and optimization of the parameters. Each segment shows the outflow process which creates short-term or seasonal influence. The variations recession rate causes problems for derivation of recession characteristics. To avoid variations in recession parameters Short Time Fourier Transformation (STFT) was used. While applying STFT in real runoff data recession segments were chosen by user. The selected segments were further used for calculation of groundwater recharge assuming a linear hydrological model. The runoff hydrograph represents consist of three components: surface flow, intermediate flow and base flow. The applications of wavelet transformation can differential those flow components into were short, intermediate and long wavelet periods. The displacement method was used to obtain further information from wavelet transformation and to verify its practical application in groundwater studies.

40|$|While in {{catchment}} and hillslope hydrology a {{more nuanced}} approach is now taken to streamflow recession analysis, {{in the context of}} major aquifers it is commonly still assumed that the <b>groundwater</b> head <b>recession</b> rate will take exponential form, an idea originally proposed in the 19 th Century. However it is shown here that, in early times, the <b>groundwater</b> head <b>recession</b> in a major aquifer should take an almost straight line form with a rate approximately equal to the long-term recharge rate divided by the aquifer storage coefficient. The length of this phase can be estimated from an analytical expression derived in the paper which depends on the aquifer diffusivity, length scale, and the position of the monitoring point. A transitional phase then leads to an exponential phase after some critical time which is independent of the position of the monitoring point. Major aquifers in a state of periodic quasi-steady state are expected to have rates of <b>groundwater</b> flux <b>recession</b> which deviate little from the average rate of groundwater recharge. Where quasi-exponential groundwater declines are observed in nature, their form may be diagnostic of particular types of aquifer properties and/or boundary effects, such as proximity to drainage boundaries, variations in transmissivity with hydraulic head, storage changes due to pumping, nonequilibrium flow at a range of spatial and temporal scales, and variations in specific yield with depth.

40|$|Calibration of {{distributed}} hydrologic models {{usually involves}} {{how to deal}} with the large number of distributed parameters and optimization problems with multiple but often conflicting objectives that arise in a natural fashion. This study presents a multiobjective sensitivity and optimization approach to handle these problems for the MOBIDIC (MOdello di Bilancio Idrologico DIstribuito e Continuo) distributed hydrologic model, which combines two sensitivity analysis techniques (the Morris method and the state-dependent parameter (SDP) method) with multiobjective optimization (MOO) approach ε-NSGAII (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II). This approach was implemented to calibrate MOBIDIC with its application to the Davidson watershed, North Carolina, with three objective functions, i. e., the standardized root mean square error (SRMSE) of logarithmic transformed discharge, the water balance index, and the mean absolute error of the logarithmic transformed flow duration curve, and its results were compared with those of a single objective optimization (SOO) with the traditional Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm used in MOBIDIC by taking the objective function as the Euclidean norm of these three objectives. Results show that (1) the two sensitivity analysis techniques are effective and efficient for determining the sensitive processes and insensitive parameters: surface runoff and evaporation are very sensitive processes to all three objective functions, while <b>groundwater</b> <b>recession</b> and soil hydraulic conductivity are not sensitive and were excluded in the optimization. (2) Both MOO and SOO lead to acceptable simulations; e. g., for MOO, the average Nash–Sutcliffe value is 0. 75 in the calibration period and 0. 70 in the validation period. (3) Evaporation and surface runoff show similar importance for watershed water balance, while the contribution of baseflow can be ignored.

40|$|Compared to {{hydrograph}} recession analysis, {{which is}} widely applied in engineering hydrology, the {{quantitative assessment of}} stream salinity with time (i. e. the salinograph) has received significantly less attention. In particular, while in many previous hydrological studies an inverse relationship between hydrograph and salinograph responses is apparent, the concept of salinity accession (the inversely related salinity counterpart to hydrograph recession) has not been introduced nor quantitatively evaluated in previous literature. In this study, we conduct a mathematical analysis of salinograph accession, and determine new quantitative relationships between salinity accession and hydrograph recession parameters. An equation is formulated that reproduces the general trend in salinity accession. A salinity accession parameter kc is then introduced and is shown to be the ratio of direct runoff to total stream flow recession parameters: kr/k. The <b>groundwater</b> <b>recession</b> parameter kg was estimated using a simple and rapid method that uses both salinograph and hydrograph data. Salinity accession type-curves illustrate that under certain conditions, the relative steepness of individual salinographs is dependent upon the ratio of groundwater salinity to direct runoff salinity: Cg/Cr. The salinity accession algorithms are applied to two contrasting field settings: Scott Creek, South Australia and Sandy Creek, northern Queensland, Australia. It was found that kg > k during periods of obvious stream flow recession, for the events analysed. Salinograph accession behaviour was fairly similar for both sites, despite contrasting environments. Using assumed end-member salinities for groundwater and direct runoff based upon field observations, the behaviour of kc from the Scott Creek site was approximately reproduced by varying the initial groundwater to runoff flow ratio: Qg 0 /Qr 0, within reasonable parameter ranges. The use of salinograph information when used in addition to standard hydrograph analyses provided useful information on recession characteristics of stream components.

40|$|South Florida has {{transformed}} from a natural to a managed ecosystem upon channelization of Kissimmee River and the wetlands in the 1960 ’s. The drainage has resulted in fast transport of water and nutrient, and subsequently eutrophication of the downstream water bodies. The intervention required: intensive management of the shallow groundwater to balance ecological water requirement; and nutrient removal, namely phosphorus, to minimize eutrophication. The study was set to examine and develop an operational prediction method for groundwater-phosphorus interactions to support the wetlands management. Accordingly, a point scale and a spatio-temporal groundwater level was simulated using sequence based Markovian stochastic analysis and dynamic factor analysis methods respectively. A {{root mean square error}} of 0. 12 m and 0. 15 m was observed for a point and spatio-temporal groundwater prediction. Soluble and sequestered phosphorus were also simulated at 13 % error using a watershed based model called ArcWAM. A spatial analysis on simulated soluble phosphorus and groundwater level indicated similarity of patterns (spatial correlation) 99 % of the time. A geographically weighted multivariate analysis of soluble phosphorus using predictors of groundwater level, total phosphorus of surficial water, and distance from Kissimmee River showed a goodness of fit (R 2) of 0. 2 – 0. 7. Amongst the factors, the groundwater explained 70 % of the soluble phosphorus variability. In summary, an increase in soluble phosphorus was observed with groundwater rise and a decrease during <b>groundwater</b> <b>recession.</b> A reversed relationship was identified for the total phosphorus. Presumably, organic matter in the root zone has contributed to increased soluble phosphorus with the rise in groundwater. On the other hand, solubility of calcium carbonate from the karst aquifers seems to fix and precipitate phosphorus during recession of groundwater. The least sequestration of phosphorus, observed in oversaturated wetlands also suggested that nutrient removal on karst hydrogeology could be risky unless a check is made using vegetation strip to enhance phosphorus uptake. The study concluded that phosphorus could be operationally predicted associated with forecasting of groundwater fluctuation. Further research is recommended to explore factors that could be derived either empirically or from satellite data for prediction of soluble phosphorus at minimum cost...|$|E

40|$|The Magilligan sand spit dune {{field is}} {{situated}} on the eastern mouth of Lough Foyle in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It is a large triangular-shaped site some 7 km by 4 km by 1. 5 km wide (about 800 hectares) and maintains areas, particularly in the eastern part, with slacks that regularly flood in winter. The size of the system acts as a buffer to external drivers due to the large volume of groundwater stored, the longer travel distances and lower hydraulic gradients. However, unlike many other coastal dune sites with humid dune slacks in the British Isles the sand is not wholly underlain by silt and clay, as raised beach sand and gravel deposits are {{in contact with the}} sand aquifer in some places. A preliminary water balance suggests {{that the majority of the}} discharge from the sand aquifer occurs via the underlying raised beach deposits and only a small amount discharges directly from the sand aquifer beneath the foredunes.

Model parameters were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), land use and soil type map of the basin. These parameters and the observed daily meteorological data (1978 - 1983) were used (1) to tests the performance of the WetSpa model to a large tropical basin, (2) to simulate water balance and outflow hydrographs, (3) to identify the different flow components and (4) to study the most sensitive model parameters for the study catchment. The statistical model evaluation results indicated that the model has a relatively high confidence and can give a fair representation of the flow hydrographs and the water balance for a complex terrain. The use of daily observations instead of hourly observations and the lack of other measurements of the hydrological processes (e. g. groundwater flow, infiltration) to calibrate/validate the model may have caused the large errors in low flows and high flows. The deviations between the observed and simulated flows may also be caused by the lack of a good representation of the meteorological conditions in the study area. The WetSpa model also provided insight into the main flow processes during the year.

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{associated with}} shallow saline watertables {{is a major}} threat to the sustainability of agricultural industry throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. Located {{in the western part of}} the Murray Valley of NSW, the Wakool Irrigation District has experienced a history of water table rise, including likely contribut ions from widespread flooding. The community is interested in scientific evidence quantifying the impact of flooding on the shallow groundwater, in order to target management actions to control water table rise and salinity in this area. This study estimates the spatial and temporal impact of flooding on shallow groundwater for the Wakool Irrigation District through an extensive GIS analysis based on a large amount of piezometric data monitored over many years. By compiling the piezometric data into a GIS database and analyzing the data in a GIS application, we are able to quantify the net recharge caused by flooding and to visualize the spatial extent of the impact of flooding on the shallow water table reflected by water table change. The results show that flooding has a significant impact on the shallow groundwater. The floods during the record wet period of 1973 - 75 caused a net recharge of around 116 x 103 ML (0. 52 ML/ha in average) at the stage when water table rise reached its maximum value around December 1975. Apart from the magnitude of flooding, the amount of the net recharge caused by a single flood event is also related to the initial water table before the flood, which affects the shallow groundwater storage capacity. The higher the initial water table is, the less the shallow groundwater storage capacity will be, and consequently there will be less room for the net recharge, as shown during the 1973 - 75 floods. More frequent flooding such as the one experienced in 1981, whose recurrence interval is estimated as around 1 in 10 years, could result in 42. 68 x 103 ML or an average of 0. 19 ML/ha net recharge at the stage around maximum water table mound, given the initial average water table depth being at 4. 28 m. There are strong connections between the local rainfall, flood, and water table change, suggesting that the floods happened in this area are normally due to both upstream and local rainfall. The major flood recharge areas within the Wakool area are mainly located along the Edward – Niemur River system.

40|$|Montane meadows play a {{key role}} in the {{physical}} and biologic processes of coniferous forests in the western United States. However, due to climate change, over grazing, and fire suppression, conifer encroachment into meadows has accelerated. In some western regions, nearly half of all meadow habitat has been loss due to conifer encroachment. To combat this issue, encroaching conifers can be removed in an attempt to increase meadow habitat and function. While multiple studies have assessed changes in soil structure and vegetation composition, few studies directly investigate changes in hydrology following meadow conifer removal projects. The goal of this study is to determine if the removal of conifers from an encroached meadow (Marian Meadow) has an effect on soil moisture and groundwater depth such that meadow hydrologic conditions are promoted. This goal will be accomplished by the following objectives: 1) develop a water budget incorporating groundwater depth, soil moisture, and climate measurements to quantify the hydrologic processes prior to and after conifer removal, 2) conduct a statistical analysis of the project meadow’s wet season water table depth prior to and after conifer removal, 3) conduct a statistical analysis of the meadow’s soil moisture prior to and after conifer removal. Marian Meadow is located in Plumas County, CA at an elevation of 4, 900 feet. This 45 -acre meadow enhancement project is part of a 2, 046 -acre timber harvest plan implemented by the Collins Pine Company. Soil moisture and water table depth sensors were installed in Marian Meadow and a control meadow in September 2013. The soil moisture sensors were installed at one and three foot depths. Soil moisture and water table depth measurements used in this study span from September 2013 through June 2016. The removal of encroaching conifers from Marian Meadow occurred in July 2015. Evapotranspiration was estimated using the Priestly Taylor equation. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was used to determine maximum water table depths. A <b>groundwater</b> <b>recession</b> curve equation was used to model water table depths between water table depth sensor measurements and ERT measurements. Standard least squared linear regression and ANCOVA was used to determine any statistical significant difference in soil moisture and water table depths prior to and after conifer removal. The water balance indicated that the majority of Marian Meadow and the control meadow’s water storage can be attributed to precipitation and not upland sources. This hydrologic characteristic is common in dry meadows. The statistical analysis indicated that measured water table depths increased on average by 0. 58 feet following conifer removal. Relative to the control meadow, soil moisture in Marian Meadow initially decreased following conifer removal. However, from November 2015 through June 2016 soil moisture increased. On average soil moisture increased by 4 % following conifer removal. Also, growing season (April through September) water table depths indicated that meadow vegetation communities could be supported in Marian Meadow following conifer removal. The removal of conifers from an encroached meadow appears to promote soil moisture and water table depth conditions indicative of a meadow and meadow plant community types...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe water {{resources}} of the lower Fitzroy River catchment in the Kimberley region of north-west Western Australia are continuing to present both opportunities and impediments for future irrigation development, mining activities and municipal water supply to southern parts of the State. The recent CSIRO Northern Australia Sustainable Yields (NASY) project revealed that the groundwater and surface {{water resources}} of this catchment, and many others across northern Australia, lack the historical monitoring data and fundamental technical understanding required to undertake quantitative water assessments and therefore establish sustainable water management policies. In particular, there is a dearth {{of information and knowledge}} of groundwater controls on dry season flows in the Fitzroy River. This report presents a synthesis of preliminary research projects that have aimed at starting to address these knowledge gaps. It includes work undertaken by CSIRO as part of the Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge (TRaCK) program, as well as a project in which CSIRO collaborated with WA Department of Water under the Raising National Water Standards program of the National Water Commission, and finally work undertaken by CSIRO as an extension to NASY. This suite of projects has used contemporary hydrogeological mapping techniques and water bore drilling, in combination with groundwater and river sampling for both routine and novel environmental chemistry analyses. A transect of nine new monitoring bores was installed on Noonkanbah Station in October 2009 to facilitate near-river groundwater sampling and enable monitoring of groundwater level responses to wet season flood flows and <b>recession.</b> <b>Groundwater</b> samples from these shallow bores, and nine other regional bores completed in the different geologies of the Canning Basin, were analysed for major ion chemistry, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of water, radon- 222, noble gases (particularly helium- 4), chlorofluorocarbons, carbon- 14 and stable strontium isotopes. Longitudinal sampling of surface water from different reaches of the Fitzroy River was undertaken on two occasions (May 2008 and May 2010) by helicopter, and samples were analysed for a similar suite of chemical and isotopic constituents. The main reach of the Fitzroy River on which these projects have focussed is between Jubilee Downs Station (i. e. downstream of Fitzroy Crossing) and the eastern boundary of Liveringa Station. We have identified two major zones of groundwater discharge along this reach: the first is around the confluence of the Fitzroy River with Cunningham Anabranch, and the second is between a well-known waterfall and Yungngora Community on Noonkanbah Station. Two complex discharge mechanisms have been invoked to explain chemical and isotopic data in the context of recently revised geology for these areas. In the first zone, old regional groundwater in the Liveringa Group is thought to flow westwards towards the river before being forced upwards into the alluvial aquifer, or directly into the river, as it meets the low permeability mudstones of the Noonkanbah Formation. In the second zone, even older regional groundwater from the deep Poole Sandstone aquifer is thought to discharge into the river, possibly via the alluvial aquifer, through a series of faults that transect the river. Modelling of the river chemistry profiles from May 2010 suggests the total rate of groundwater discharge over the 100 kilometre study reach is about 102 ML/day, comprising about 3. 7 ML/day for the regional aquifers. The remaining discharge is sourced from local groundwater flow systems in the alluvial aquifer. The results demonstrate a high dependence of dry season flows in the Fitzroy River on discharge from both local and regional groundwater flow systems. It is likely that future groundwater pumping  adjacent the Fitzroy River will result in a reduction to dry season flows, which in turn will have  an impact on the water level of permanent pools. The distance at which future extractive industries should be placed away from the River in order to minimise impacts to dry season flows  and permanent pools requires further research; however, it will be site specific—that is, it will  depend upon the size and pumping regime of the proposed extraction, the hydrogeological properties  of the aquifers between the river and the proposed development, and the proximity of the proposed extraction to the various groundwater discharge mechanisms identified above...|$|R
40|$|The Lowland Groundwater-Surface water Interaction model (LGSI-model) is a {{lumped model}} concept which {{describes}} changes in storage via {{changes in the}} average groundwater depth and spatial variation in groundwater depth. These characteristics of the groundwater depth are used to calculate discharge. The spatial distribution of groundwater depths are described {{by means of a}} normal distribution that is related to the average groundwater depth within the catchment. The LGSI-model was first tested by Van der Velde et al. (2009) in the Hupsel brook catchment (6 km 2) and showed very promising results. The goal of the study described in this report is to apply the theory and model concepts developed by Van der Velde et al. (2009) to a larger catchment with a more complex geomorphology. For this purpose the Drentsche Aa catchment was selected. To build the lumped LGSI-model, the relations between groundwater depth distributions and fluxes can be calculated based on a spatially distributed groundwater. In this case, the spatially distributed model MIPWA, that includes the Drentsche Aa catchment, was used. Based on the MIPWA model results on a daily basis for the period 1989 - 2001, relations between storage above the surface (negative groundwater depths) and water fluxes between groundwater and surface water (e. g. stream discharge, tube drain discharge, saturated overland flow, evapotranspiration) could be formulated. These relations formed the basis of the LGSI-model of the Drentsche Aa Catchment. To improve the representation of the discharge generating processes within the catchment, the LGSI-model of the Drentsche Aa catchment was calibrated to a measured discharge series of the period 1989 - 2001 using the GLUE analysis. Due to the variations in the geomorphology of the catchment, the Drentsche Aa catchment had to be divided into two different areas. One low area with shallow groundwater tables reaching up to the surface and high, very dry areas where the groundwater tables never reach the surface. These two area types, or reservoirs, could be described by different statistical distributions: in the low areas, a normal distribution was valid, while in the high areas groundwater depth distributions were described by a gamma distribution. Both areas were coupled using a Darcy based equation which was a modification to the original model concept of Van der Velde et al. (2009). Results of the LGSI-model of the Drentsche Aa catchment were very promising and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency for discharge and groundwater depth simulation for both low and high areas were respectively 0. 76 (discharge), 0. 78 (groundwater depth low area) and 0. 87 (groundwater depth high area) over the calibration period 1989 - 2001 (all at a daily time steps). Peak discharges were slightly underestimated by the model, which is the result of inaccurate simulation of the <b>groundwater</b> depth, whereas <b>recessions</b> and periods with small discharge were modelled with high accuracy. A detailed analysis of the model stability was performed, by extending the model simulation of discharge to the period 1980 - 2010 (Nash- Sutcliffe discharge 0. 64). The LGSI-model was also tested on a hourly time step to determine if the model could have a good model performance on a smaller timescale (Nash-Sutcliffe discharge 0. 75). The results of the fast calibration using the GLUE analysis can be useful for evaluation of model parameters of the spatially distributed groundwater model. Since this type of calibration cannot be done for spatially calibrated models without very long calculation times, the LGSI-model {{could be used as a}} tool for calibration of these models. Another interesting feature of the LGSI-model concept is that it divides the total discharge of the catchment into its separate components (groundwater exfiltration in rivers, saturated overland flow, drainage). This offers the possibility to analyse the composition of peak discharge or determine the relative contributions of the discharge components throughout the year. It was concluded that the LGSI-model generated very good simulations of discharge and groundwater depths in the Drentsche Aa catchment. Due to these simultaneous and rapid model simulations of groundwater depth, storage and discharge, the LGSI-model concept provides additional insight in the discharge behaviour for a variety of groundwater depth distributions and parameter values. Moreover, the LGSI-model shows that knowledge of the groundwater system and the groundwater-surface water interaction processes that occur in a catchment is very useful, if not crucial, for good simulation and prediction of stream discharge of a catchment...|$|R
