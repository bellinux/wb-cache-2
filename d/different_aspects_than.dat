These findings could be used to develop a cartographic model of preferred black-tailed prairie dog habitat useful for prairie dog monitoring and management, and for estimating prairie dog expansion potential for possible black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) reintroduction sites...|$|E

A survey methodology was used with experienced business professionals and MBA students. Two of three research propositions were empirically supported. The results indicate that both the technology acceptance model (TAM) and absorptive capacity represent appropriate theories for studying XBRL adoption.

Method: Case report of an unusual presentation of a patient treated for 9 consecutive years with a therapeutically recommended dose of hydroxychloroquine. Result: We report {{the case of a}} 53 -year-old Caucasian female treated with 400 mg hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis over 9 years, currently on methotrexate and folinic acid, who stopped treatment 3 years ago. The cumulative dose is estimated at 1. 314 kg. She recently noticed a reduction of vision in both eyes to 0. 34 logMAR, with colour vision problems and major distortion in central vision. Fundus autofluorescence revealed minimal foveal pigmentary changes and more pronounced changes in the retina elsewhere. Foveal changes were confirmed by optical coherence tomography in both eyes. The patient did not report any colour perception difficulties or night vision problems and has no family history of any eye condition. Her visual field tested by an optician was full, with some central changes. Conclusion: Retinal toxicity from hydroxychloroquine can present in a <b>different</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>than</b> the commonly known retinal toxicity, and it happens even after years of cessation of the drug.

Currently, most empirical studies on developers performing change tasks are, however, limited to very small code snippets or limited by the granularity and detail of the data collected on developer’s navigation behavior. In our research, we extend this work by combining user interaction monitoring to gather interaction context – the code elements a developer selects and edits – with eye-tracking to gather more detailed and fine-granular gaze context-code elements a developer looked at. In a study with 12 professional and 10 student developers we gathered interaction and gaze contexts from participants working on three change tasks of an open source system.

Those costs can be mitigated cost-efficiently within appropriate institutional framework. Deforestation in tropical rainforest regions can be a significant factor altering the climate in those particular regions. In Brazil it reduces rainfall, thus affecting hydrological conditions which are critical for hydropower generation. The country relies heavily on hydropower in its electricity production, and therefore this study considers a possibility of that hydroelectricity supply issues would negatively affect Brazil’s long-term economic growth. A literature review combines different aspects of development in Brazil in order to form a picture of how country’s institutional structure inflicts the transmission of issues in hydropower sector into the economy. The review is complemented by a sensitivity analysis to a growth projection which aptly reflects some characteristics of development in Brazil. Thereby the analysis demonstrates how more comprehensive evaluation of <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> what in general has been done so far could change the conception of country’s growth potential. If current state of institutional affairs persists, there is an obvious threat of that electricity supply side issues will have increasing economic costs.

The data were {{comparable to those}} from a Swiss forest plot monitored for 21 years. Species richness and abundance were almost linearly correlated on a log/log scale. Abundance and yearly frequency of species were tightly correlated. The geographic range of species may also be related to these two parameters. Rare species scored low on abundance, yearly frequency and geographic range. About half of the species were rare, and occurred in {{only one out of}} seven years. The two major functional groups of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal species behaved similarly over the years, as in the Swiss study. Annual variation was high for species richness alone and for richness combined with abundances. The log transformed species richness of plots correlated well with parameters that take the abundances or yearly frequencies of species into account. If other mushroom assemblages show similar regularities, {{it may be possible to}} omit abundance counts in future surveys. The species composition of the plots varied strongly over the years. Many species did not reach their maximum abundance in the richest year. Species showed their maximum abundances in different plots in the same year more often than expected by chance. Thus the presence and abundance of species depended on factor(s) other than the general productivity of a year, and years showed (a) <b>different</b> <b>aspect(s)</b> <b>than</b> productivity alone.

In the course of globalization, companies seek nowadays the collaboration with other companies or organizations in developing countries, in order to benefit from several advantages like reduced labor costs. Next to that, a myriad of companies or organizations carry out projects with partners that are situated in developing countries, only with the attempt {{to fill the gap}} of knowledge between developed and developing world – knowledge that is particularly needed in those countries {{in order for them to}} reach certain standards of living and to keep up with the rapid development that takes place in other parts of the world.

Thereby, this paper aims at providing information about their importance in the corresponding contexts and at giving inspiration on the ways these factors can be dealt with. The exploratory results suggest that by covering specific aspects from the beginning, the companies or organizations involved can overcome the majority of the factors and barriers. Furthermore, it is pointed out that the importance of each factor varies heavily depending on the context: the process of internal knowledge transfer requires the companies to concentrate their attention on <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> in the context of external knowledge transfer...|$|E
40|$|In {{healthcare}} building projects, it {{is necessary}} to consider a larger number of <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> in other building types, as patients' emotions, comfort needs and the integration of latest technologies. To design these buildings, considering a sustainable approach, the sustainable practices for healthcare building should be considered properly in design and use phases. Therefore, {{there is a lack of}} common understanding on the field of various relations between built, natural and social systems. To tackle this, the goal of this article is to contribute to the better understanding in this context by exposing a proposal for the structure and system of weights of the sustainability criteria of a healthcare building sustainability assessment method, the HBSAtool-PT. The methodological approach adopted is innovative since in the development of the list of sustainability criteria it considers the opinion of main healthcare buildings? stakeholders, the existing healthcare assessment methods and the ISO and CEN standardisation works in the field of the methods to assess the sustainability of construction works. Additionally, a methodology to develop the weighting system to be used in the aggregation of the different indicators is proposed and applied to the Portuguese context. As a result, the proposed sustainability assessment system for healthcare buildings (HBSAtool-PT) embraces fifty-two sustainability indicators that cover the different dimensions of the sustainability concept to support decision making during the design of a new or retrofitted healthcare building in urban areas. The proposed structure for the HBSAtool-PT presents a more balanced structure between the dimensions of the sustainable development, and compared with other existing approaches, it integrates more comprehensive social and economic concerns.

None of these cuts were longer than one second in length and most only a few frames, and none altered the sequence of the scene. However, they were enough to avoid the X rating for the film. The visuals of the final released scene in film and VHS versions (later DVD and Blu-ray disc as well) combined with O'Connell's verbalization still leave no doubt as to what happens to the character; in fact, the scene was still too explicit for many countries, who either required it be deleted or denied the film a release entirely. All authorized later releases of the film in Europe, America and elsewhere contain the scene in its final, R-rated version. The X rated clipped materials themselves were lost over time and are not included as part of the new DVD/Blu-ray Disc release or any other release of the film.

For this study I have used three dependent variables to define different aspects of public institutions. These are trust in the legal system, trust in political parties and state of health services nowadays.   The method that {{is used in the}} study is based on a comparative study between two countries, Sweden and Portugal.  The actual result is made up by comparing means and regressions by using 13 independent variables. Many of the independent variables that has been used is deriving from institutional theories of Putnam and Rothstein These theories points out the importance of strong traditions of civic engagement and that the success of the trust of the institutions depends in large part on the horizontal bonds that make up social capital. Other theories describe the malicious venom that is the outcome of corruption and the importance of happiness. The cultural dimensions by Hofstede are also included in the list of theories, especially those dealing with the freedom and free from collectivism and caring for others well-being. With help from these theories thirteen independent variables were emerged. The result that comes from the study is that the trust is first of all the obvious Sweden has a higher level of trust in all the <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> Portugal. Although the regressions shows that only 4, 8 - 11, 2 % can be explained, there is still possible to make clear conclusions. The clearest conclusion we can draw is that state of happiness makes a difference regarding trust for the institutions. Other things that influence the trust are civic engagement by working in another organization and believing in equality seems to correlate with higher trust. Caring for others seems to have a slightly negative effect on the trust. With this we can conclude that altruists do not have a higher trust on public institutions than others. A clearer tendency is that the sense of feeling free is negative on the trust for the public institutions...|$|E

A great deal of empirical research has been carried out to understand why differences between schools might emerge, with variable-based models being the preferred research tool.

This paper describes an ABM that addresses this topic, using data from the London Educational Authority's Junior Project. To compare the results and performance with more traditional modelling techniques, the same data are also fitted to a multilevel model (MLM), one of the preferred variable-based models used in the field. The paper reports the results of both models and compares their performances in terms of predictive and explanatory power. Although the fitted MLM outperforms the proposed ABM, the latter still offers a reasonable fit and provides a causal mechanism to explain differences in the identified school performances that is absent in the MLM.

Out of almost 4, 500 analyst reports about 36 percent contain environmental information, varying between 3 to 79 percent depending on industry sector where, in general, analyst reports in sectors with more severe environmental aspects to a larger degree contain environmental information. The type of environmental information that the analysts foremost focus on in their reports are on how firms’ products and product portfolios are adopted to Environmental regulations facing customers/markets, Customer demands and Eco-Efficiency. This product perspective is strongly related to discussions of business opportunities of the firm. In fact, a good 77 % of the financial analyst reports containing environmental information dealt with opportunities linked to environmental aspects. To a lower extent, financial analysts write about company specific risk issues like emissions and litigation. The financial analyst reports, furthermore, practically lacks environmental preparedness aspects – like environmental strategies, policies, management systems, reporting and auditing – that are core issues of the ethical and SRI analyses.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} can {{be placed}} in the growing literature on issue competition. According to this perspective, originally developed against the backdrop of US two-party competition, utility maximising politicians play the most influential role in determining the relative competition among political issues. Specifically, the governing party is expected to keep focusing on the issues that brought it into power, while the opposition attempts to mobilise issues that do not reinforce existing patterns of party competition and most likely divide the governing party. To what extent can these insights be applied to more complex Western European multiparty systems? This study focuses on four strategies that capture the essence of issue competition, namely whether parties will: emphasise issues over which their potential electorate is divided, engage in dialogue on issues threatening existing patterns of party competition, mobilise wedge issues dividing (a coalition of) governing parties, and emphasise <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of issues <b>than</b> competitors. By employing a behavioural classification distinguishing between challenger parties, mainstream opposition parties, and government parties, this study demonstrates that previous experience in office forms a crucial factor in explaining whether parties will engage in the strategies at hand...|$|R

The purpose is to examine to what extent they have been influenced by their mother tongues whi 1 e studying Japanese as a second language, in terms of the examples of the excessive use and omissive use of the noun modifier ”の/no/” in Japanese. 　The excessive use of ”の” can be often found in the conversations of Chinese spedkers, which accord with the results of the investigation of adult beginners (Sakota 1999).
