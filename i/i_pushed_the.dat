25|$|You can't hear, you can't see well. You can go over {{something}} and you'll never know. I scooped up some earth, I couldn't see anything. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> earth, and I didn't see her at all. Maybe she was hiding in there.|$|E
25|$|After {{this she}} was {{thrashing}} {{around on the}} ground. She was trying to scream but nothing was coming out. I think I kicked her because she wouldn't keep still. And then I put my foot on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> knife {{all the way in}} but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her {{on the left side of}} the chest.|$|E
2500|$|... "When I {{was about}} 700 feet <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> nose down to {{maintain}} height {{and noticed that}} the aircraft began to sink rapidly. I increased the throttle to little effect and then started {{to look for a}} safe landing place, but the area was full of high trees and houses. I increased the throttle and was able to hold height {{for a few minutes and}} then noticed the engine water temperature was over 100 degrees Celsius and I could see steam from the left hand engine cowling. The engine lost power again and I saw a chance to land in some allotments, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> control down to 45 degrees and hit the ground at the same angle. I was trapped by my foot and released myself after about two minutes, as I freed myself the engine caught fire. I managed to get to the door of the cabin and only one of the passengers was conscious." ...|$|E

60|$|Now my {{original}} business--that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts--was considerably increased by receiving the master's office. There was now great work for scriveners. Not only must <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>the</b> clerks already with me, but I must have additional help.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{stand in}} the same spot, about two- or three-feet area, all night. The only time a person stops is when the line stops. We do about thirty-two jobs per car, per unit. Forty-eight units an hour. eight hours a day. Thirty-two times forty-eight times eight. Figure it out. That's how many times <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>the</b> button." [...] (Phil Stallings, spot-welder) ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1972, the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Eduard Prchal, {{described}} the events: [...] "I received {{the green light}} from the tower and we began our take-off run. I pulled the stick back and the aircraft started to climb. When I was at 150ft <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> controls of the aircraft forward to gain speed. Suddenly I discovered I {{was not able to}} pull the stick back. The steering mechanism was jammed or locked." [...] The aircraft then lost height rapidly. Prchal closed the four throttles and warned the others through the intercom [...] "Attention, crash". The aircraft crashed into the sea.|$|E
2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} school-room open. There {{are some}} {{spectacles}} which a man never forgets. The burning of Troy probably seemed a large-sized conflagration to the pious Aeneas, and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble Anchises.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> away <b>the</b> tray, and Mary, looking at it, {{declared}} herself satisfied, {{and placed it on}} a side table.|$|R
6000|$|Ay; I did get in; [...] Though {{not without}} hard striving, such the throng; [...] But {{travellers}} roam to waste who shyly roam [...] And <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> like <b>the</b> rest.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> open <b>the</b> {{door and}} entered the hall, I found myself {{suddenly}} {{face to face with}} the Count again. He was just putting a letter into the post-bag.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> wicket open {{a little}} way and peeped in. The actor was {{standing}} just by the fust crane talking {{to two of the}} hands off of the Saltram. He'd got 'is back to the light, but 'ow it was they didn't twig his voice I can't think.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> {{board on}} to Ayesha, who deftly ran {{it across the}} gulf so that one end of it rested on the rocking-stone, the other {{remaining}} on the extremity of the trembling spur. Then placing her foot upon it {{to prevent it from}} being blown away, she turned to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> panels apart, {{and stepped}} out upon the narrow balcony. Below me lay the street, the {{lanterns}} of the passers-by flitting like fireflies through the dark; and from it stole up to me the hum of pleasure life, a perfume of sound, strangely distinct in the still night air.|$|E
60|$|My guide, {{who stood}} {{still in the}} same place, called out {{to me that there}} was no one to hear my knocking; so <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> open <b>the</b> door and entered the hut.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> open <b>the</b> {{door and}} entered Pesca's room. He was {{crouched}} up, in the strangest manner, {{in a corner}} of the sofa. He seemed to shrink from me when I approached him.|$|R
2500|$|Senna {{was often}} quoted as using driving {{as a means}} for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life: [...] "The harder <b>I</b> <b>push,</b> <b>the</b> more <b>I</b> find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a {{different}} world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations, and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's that boy!" [...] I cried, bawling in hoarse fury; [...] "it's that accursed boy!" [...] {{and turning}} about <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> waiter aside--he was just bring me some more toast--and rushed violently {{out of the}} room and down and out upon the queer little esplanade in front of the hotel.|$|E
60|$|The {{speed of}} the fellow seemed to {{preclude}} the possibility of escaping him upon the open beach. There was but a single alternative--the rude skiff--and with a celerity which equaled his, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> thing into the sea and as it floated gave a final shove and clambered in over the end.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> open Diary {{across the}} table. If I was {{the object of}} any suspicions which she wanted to confirm, it would be curious {{to see if the}} {{poisoning}} story helped her. [...] "It's a piece of family history," [...] I said; [...] "I think you will agree with me that it is really interesting." ...|$|E
60|$|Trembling with excitement, <b>I</b> {{watched him}} <b>push</b> <b>the</b> hand round as he described.|$|R
60|$|Yielding to {{the impulse}} of <b>the</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> him under <b>the</b> wheels of a trolley-car, and ran.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a cross old man," [...] added Hubert. [...] "He said {{children}} {{ought not}} to be allowed on the esplanade, because he got into the way as <b>I</b> was <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> perambulator." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hubert's was an ingeniously worked {{circle of}} scales of Californian gold, the first {{ornament}} that Vera had ever possessed, {{and that all}} the sisters had set great store by. But with an outcry of joy Vera exclaimed, [...] "Here's the snake all safe! <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> other up my arm because it looked so plain and dull, {{and it was that}} which came off." ...|$|E
6000|$|Just then a dim figure {{approached}} {{me from the}} direction of Virginia--a man, evidently. He came straight at me, and I stepped aside to let him pass; he stepped in the way and confronted me again. Then I saw that he had a mask on and was holding something in my face--I heard a click-click and recognized a revolver in dim outline. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> barrel aside with my hand and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|The door stood {{a trifle}} ajar. We {{approached}} it stealthily--on tiptoe and at half-breath--for {{that is the}} way one's feeling makes him do, at such a time. The king knocked. We waited. No answer. Knocked again. No answer. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> door softly open and looked in. I made out some dim forms, and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me, as one does who is wakened from sleep. Presently she found her voice: ...|$|E
60|$|Now my {{original}} business--that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts--was considerably increased by receiving the master's office. There was now great work for scriveners. Not only must <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>the</b> clerks already with me, but I must have additional help. In {{answer to my}} advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure now--pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Nelly, raise those lower boughs as {{gently and}} as {{carefully}} as you can. <b>I</b> will <b>push</b> <b>the</b> canoe under. <b>I</b> don't think the sharpest Indian {{will be able to}} take up our track now." ...|$|R

60|$|Gently I {{pressed it}} open a crack; enough to {{discover}} a dozen blacks stretched upon their silks in profound slumber. At {{the far side of}} the room a rack held the swords and firearms of the men. Warily <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> door a trifle wider to admit my body. A hinge gave out a resentful groan. One of the men stirred, and my heart stood still. I cursed myself for a fool to have thus jeopardized our chances for escape; but there was nothing for it now but to see the adventure through.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, father, look at this," [...] she returned, half-sobbing, and {{touching}} {{the lower end}} of the colored margin with her finger. [...] "Do you see how badly it is colored? And I had spent three days in altering and retouching it, and still it displeased me. Then, in sudden anger, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> book from me, and seeing it slipping from the stand I caught the leaf to prevent it from falling, and it was torn by the weight of the book. Oh, dear father, will you forgive me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'His hand groped stealthily, came {{in contact}} with a liqueur-glass, and was {{withdrawn}} suddenly as if it had touched a red-hot coal. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> bottle slightly. [...] "Won't you have some more?" [...] I asked. He looked at me angrily. [...] "Don't you think I can tell you what there is to tell without screwing myself up?" [...] he asked. The squad of globe-trotters had gone to bed. We were alone but for a vague white form erect in the shadow, that, being looked at, cringed forward, hesitated, backed away silently. It was getting late, but I did not hurry my guest.|$|E
5000|$|Ken Whelan (5th): [...] "The {{ground was}} too soft and <b>I</b> was <b>pushing</b> all <b>the</b> way." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am always}} quite {{straightforward}} when I am {{dealing with a}} client who means business. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> aside <b>the</b> litter of papers in front of me, leaned my elbows upon my desk, rested my chin in my hands, and said briefly: ...|$|R
6000|$|We went in slowly, and Jane bolted the door. [...] "But {{who it is}} {{that can}} be bolted out," [...] she said, [...] "I know not; though there's much to bolt in. I have stood here, Mr. Brocken, on darker nights as still as this, and have heard {{what seemed to be}} the sea breaking, far away, leagues upon leagues beyond the forests--the gush forward, the protracted, heavy retreat,--listened till I could have wept to think that it was only my own poor furious heart beating. You may imagine, then, <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>the</b> bolts home." ...|$|R
