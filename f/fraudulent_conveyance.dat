2500|$|Conceptually, {{fraudulent}} {{trading is}} similar to a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conveyance,</b> but the key distinction is that an application to have a transaction set aside as a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conveyance</b> usually requires to the third party beneficiary to disgorge the benefit of the conveyance to undo the loss to the company's assets, whereas a court order in relation to fraudulent trading it is the responsible parties (usually the directors) who must make up the loss and the third party beneficiaries will usually retain the benefit. [...] However, it is perfectly possible for a single transaction to be simultaneously fraudulent trading and a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conveyance,</b> and to be the subject on concurrent applications.

2500|$|The U.S. never {{adopted the}} {{floating}} charge directly {{because at the}} time it was developing in England in the 19th century, U.S. courts generally held that a debtor simply could not create a security interest in future property; general creditors ought to have a pool of unencumbered assets to look to; and even if such a thing could exist, it was a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>conveyance.</b> [...] However, creditors' lawyers gradually developed an diverse variety of methods, some authorized by state legislatures and others tolerated by state courts, to evade the general ban on security interests in future property. [...] As it had become clear that creditors and debtors were going to find ways to create enforceable de facto security interests in after-acquired property and general intangibles whether courts liked it or not, the UCC drafters in the 1940s (particularly Grant Gilmore) successfully argued that such interests should be legitimized and simplified in the form of the floating lien.|$|E
