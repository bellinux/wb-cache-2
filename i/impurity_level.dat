40|$|Isoelectronic {{impurity}} {{states are}} localized states induced by stoichiometric single atom substitution in bulk semiconductor. Photoluminescence spectra indicate deep <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> of 0. 5 to 0. 9 eV above {{the top of}} valence band for systems like: GaN:As, GaN:P, CdS:Te, ZnS:Te. Previous calculations based on small supercells seemingly confirmed these experimental results. However, the current ab initio calculations based on thousand atom supercells indicate that the <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> of the above systems are actually much shallower(0. 04 to 0. 23 eV), and these <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> should be compared with photoluminescence excitation spectra, not photoluminescence spectra...|$|R
40|$|<b>Impurity</b> <b>levels</b> {{in the low}} parts-per-trillion (ppt) are {{possible}} to measure by atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry. These <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> are achieved {{by the use of}} getter-based point-of-use purifiers for argon and nitrogen over a wide range of operating conditions, including room temperature operation. At these low <b>impurity</b> <b>levels,</b> the neces-sity for using ultraclean technology principles, such as all-metal construction, the elimination of dead zones, and the re-duction of outgassing by the use of techniques such as oxygen passivation, is clearly demonstrated, especially to achieve moisture levels near the 100 ppt range. The trend in recent years for semiconductor process gas purity levels has been toward lower <b>impurity</b> <b>levels,</b> with parts-per-trillion (ppt) levels available in the future (1).

50|$|The {{nature of}} a {{crystallization}} process is governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors, which can make it highly variable and difficult to control.

50|$|In {{regions where}} a bright fringe is present, {{electrons}} can absorb {{the light and}} be photoexcited from an <b>impurity</b> <b>level</b> into the conduction band of the material, leaving an electron hole (a net positive charge). Impurity levels have an energy intermediate between the energies of the valence band and conduction band of the material.|$|E
50|$|While in the {{conduction}} band, {{the electrons}} may with some probability recombine with the holes {{and return to}} the impurity levels. The rate at which this recombination takes place determines how far the electrons diffuse, and thus the overall strength of the photorefractive effect in that material.

For junctions with weak zero-bias anomaly in conductance, the Fano factor (normalized shot noise) depends on the magnetic configuration being enhanced for antiparallel alignment of the ferromagnetic electrodes. We propose a model of sequential tunneling through nonmagnetic and paramagnetic <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> inside the tunnel barrier to qualitatively explain the observations.

40|$|Incorporation of a {{small amount}} of a {{secondary}} metal element such as tin, indium or aluminum into copper interconnects structures has been shown to improve the device reliability and electromigration. In this study, the incorporation of tin during copper damascene plating was investigated at conditions that allow void-free filling. The study focused on the effects of the additive package used, the current density, and the feature size on the tin incorporation. The Sn concentration in Cu was found to increase with the non-metallic <b>impurity</b> <b>levels.</b> Because the plating chemistry and plating current have strong impacts on the incorporation of the non-metallic impurities, they were also found to change the Sn incorporation. For example, Cu films plated at a lower current density, which showed higher non-metallic <b>impurity</b> <b>levels,</b> were also found to incorporate more Sn, opposite to the expectation from the more negative reversible potential of Sn. In addition, the Sn incorporation is also higher in narrow lines as compared with overburden films which, correlate well to findings for non-metallic <b>impurity</b> <b>levels.</b> By combining a plating chemistry which results in high non-metallic <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> and a low current density, 60 nm wide Cu lines with up to about 0. 1 % Sn were plated, a 10 -fold increase from the overburden film...|$|R

5000|$|The {{melting point}} of Galinstan {{has been a}} source of much debate. Many commercially {{available}} gallium, indium and tin eutectic alloys are advertised with a melting point of about +11 °C, which is significantly higher than the −19 °C featured by Galinstan. The official MSDS (material safety data sheet) mentions only that Galinstan is an [...] "eutectic mixture of the metal components gallium, indium and tin" [...] with no further explanation provided. Additionally, a US patent to Geraberger Thermometerwerk GmbH describes various related eutectic alloys and mentions that they may contain up to 2 wt% of antimony (Sb) to increase oxidation resistance and up to 2 wt% of bismuth (Bi) to improve fluidity. The resulting eutectic alloy is said to contain 68 wt% to 69 wt% Ga, 21 wt% to 22 wt% In, and 9.5 wt% to 10.5 wt% Sn, with small addition of Sb and Bi and an <b>impurity</b> <b>level</b> less than 0.001 wt%. The resulting material is noted to have a melting point of −19.5 °C and vaporisation point of above 1800 °C.|$|E
5000|$|The {{creation}} of defects such as voids/bubbles, precipitates, dislocation loops/lines, and defect clusters can strengthen a material because they block dislocation motion. The movement of dislocations is what leads to plastic deformation. While this hardens the material, {{the downside is}} that there is a loss of ductility. Losing ductility, or increasing brittleness, is dangerous in RPV's because it can lead to catastrophic failure without warning. When ductile materials fail, there is substantial deformation before failure, which can be monitored. Brittle materials will crack and explode when under pressure without much prior deformation, so there's not much engineers can do to detect when the material is about to fail. A particularly damaging element in steels that can lead to hardening or embrittlement is copper. Cu-rich precipitates are very small (1-3 nm) so they are effective at pinning dislocations. It has been recognized that copper is the dominant detrimental element in steels used for RPV's, especially if the <b>impurity</b> <b>level</b> is greater than 0.1 wt%. Thus, the development of [...] "clean" [...] steels, or ones with very low impurity levels, are important in reducing radiation-induced hardening.|$|E

The energy constraint is relaxed by placing the acceptor <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> and the quantum well subband continuum in separate layers of different germanium compositions.

40|$|The {{rotating}} {{disk electrode}} (RDE) technique is being extensively {{used as a}} screening tool to estimate the activity of novel PEMFC electrocatalysts synthesized in lab-scale (mg) quantities. Discrepancies in measured activity attributable to glassware and electrolyte <b>impurity</b> <b>levels,</b> as well as conditioning, protocols and corrections are prevalent in the literature. The electrochemical response to {{a broad spectrum of}} commercially sourced perchloric acid and the effect of acid molarity on <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> and solution resistance were also assessed. Our findings reveal that an area specific activity (SA) exceeding 2. 0 mA/cm 2 (20 mV/s, 25 ◦C, 100 kPa, 0. 1 M HClO 4) for polished poly-Pt is an indicator of <b>impurity</b> <b>levels</b> that do not impede the accurate measurement of the ORR activity of Pt based catalysts. After exploring various conditioning protocols to approach maximum utilization of the electrochemical area (ECA) and peak ORR activity without introducing catalyst degradation, an investigation of measurement protocols for ECA and ORR activity was conducted. Down-selected protocols were based on the criteria of reproducibility, duration of experiments, impurity effects and magnitude of pseudo-capacitive background correction. Statistical reproducibility of ORR activity for poly-Pt and Pt supported on high surface area carbon was demonstrated...|$|R

For an <b>impurity</b> <b>level</b> inside the conduction band a positive bias creates the new localized in-gap state. A negative bias does not produce the same result and leads to a simple broadening of the <b>impurity</b> <b>level.</b> The implications for transport are discussed including a possibility of gate-controlled Kondo effect.

40|$|Abstract—Electronic {{structures}} of graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges (AGNRs) containing N substitutional impurity have been investigated, using ab initio density functional theory. It is {{shown that the}} electronic {{structures of}} the doped AGNRs {{are different from those}} of doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs). N introduces an <b>impurity</b> <b>level</b> above the conduction band minimum (CBM) in the AGNRs while an <b>impurity</b> <b>level</b> introduced by N is below the CBM in the CNTs. This character can be explained {{as a consequence of the}} edge polarization effects which ionize the <b>impurity</b> <b>level</b> so that the relevant charge carriers occupy the conduction bands, which is independent of curvature and doping site. Although the N-doped AGNR and CNT are all n-type semiconductors, an implication of the result is that edge polarization effects could make some properties of the N-doped AGNRs different from those of N-doped CNTs. It suggests the possibility to make one-dimensional doped structures with novel physical and device characteristics...|$|E
