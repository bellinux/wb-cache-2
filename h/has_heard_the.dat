25|$|Shi'ahs {{offer this}} as a one rakat salah {{at the end of}} salatul layl (the night prayer), which is an {{optional}} prayer according to some shi'ah scholars, and a wajib (obligatory) prayer according to others. This is to be prayed any time after Isha, up until fajr. The best time to pray it is the last third of the night (the night being divided into three, between maghrib and fajr of that night). It is considered highly meritorious by all shi'ah Muslims, and is said to bring numerous benefits to the believer, mainly gaining proximity to Allah. There are various methods of salatul-layl's performance, including shorter and longer versions, in the longer version the believer must perform 8 nawafil salah, in sets of 2 rakats each, then they must pray a 2 rakats salah called 'salatul shafa'ah' this is to include surah nas after surah fatihah in the first rakat and surah falaq after surah fatihah in the secound rakat, and unusually no qunut (a du'ah recited before going into ruku' of the second rakat of most prayers performed by shi'ahs) It is after this that the believer performs salatul witr, it's long method being - Starting with takbiratul ehram, then surah fatihah, then surah ikhlas, then surah falaq, then surah nas, then the hands are raised to recite qunut, upon which the believer can recite any du'a, however there are many recommended du'as for this purpose. Within qunut, the believer must pray for the forgiveness of 40 believers, then further prayers are read where the believer asks for forgiveness for himself a certain number of times using specified phrases and amounts of times to repeat those phrases. The believer then completes the salah in the usual way, by completing his qunut, reciting takbir whilst rasing his hands, going into ruku' and reciting the usual phrase for that, then returning up right and reciting takbir whilst doing so and upon being upright recites 'sami allahu liman hamida' (verily Allah <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> one who has praised him) thereupon the believer recites takbir whilst raising his hands and goes into sajda. He recites the proscribed phrase in sajda rises, recites takbir whilst rising and then again whilst returnin to sajdah, then rises with takbir again and recites tashahud and salam, thus ending this prayer. It is then optional to recite certain other du'as and dhikr (remembrance of Allah through certain phrases and some of his names being repeated) It is then recommended to perform and sajdah ash-shukr (prostration of thanks) and to then recite ayatul kursi (verse of the throne) and then perform another sajdah ash-shukr.|$|E

"It's {{no secret}} that in music, as in life, success and failure are largely {{dependent}} on timing, and so {{with that in mind}} it's hard not to feel just a little bad for Michelle Williams, the Johnny-come-lately third member of Destiny's Child, who has always had a hard time establishing herself inside the group, let alone outside it, and who now finds herself releasing a new record at a time when her efforts will likely be eclipsed by her former group members. And so, after a series of delays, Williams's third solo album, Unexpected, arrives on shelves just as people have begun to buzz about Beyoncé's upcoming album, and when honorary DC sister Solange has made an unexpected critical impact with the oddball surrealism of her recent sophomore effort, Sol-Angel and the Hadley Street Dreams. Considering Unexpected is a fairly decent album and by far the least pretentious, unashamedly pop record to be made by a DC member so far, it's all a bit unfortunate. Anyone who <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> first single, [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] already knows that Williams, whose solo work to date has been gospel-oriented, has on this occasion stepped outside of the confines of the church and into the dark of the clubs, embracing au courant euro-pop sounds, and it's a move that works well for her. [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] which boasts a chorus wrapped up in some awesome swirling synth-pop majestics, has done relatively well on the dance charts but deserved to cross over. Meanwhile, ignoring some atrocious lyrical hiccups, [...] "Til' the End of the World" [...] is a moody, frostbitten electro lament, and in the lush balladry of [...] "The Greatest," [...] Williams could find the hit she needs." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Chickasaw {{delegation}} {{assigned to}} explore the new Chickasaw territory west of the Mississippi stalled removal, much to Jackson's distress, for another two years, after {{they returned to the}} Mississippi Chickasaws saying that the new land was unacceptable. The Senate refused to ratify the Franklin treaty and the Chickasaws refused to leave their territory in Mississippi to these lands. After enduring two more years of whites in Mississippi however, and the devastating effects whiskey and squatters on Chickasaw culture, and of Mississippi state law on Chickasaw tribal governance, the Chickasaw National Council assembled to meet John Coffee at the Council House on Pontotoc Creek on October 20, 1832 to sign a Treaty allowing for the sale of the Chickasaw Mississippi territory in exchange for the surveying of new lands in the west. The preamble written by the Chickasaw chiefs read: [...] "The Chickasaw Nation find themselves oppressed in their present situation, by being made subject to the laws of the States in which they reside. Being ignorant of the laws of the white man, they cannot understand or obey them. Rather than submit to this great evil, they prefer to seek a home in the west, where they may live and be governed by their own laws. And believing that they can procure for themselves a home, in a country suited to their wants and condition, provided they had the means to contract and pay for the same, they have determined to sell their country and hunt a new home. The President <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> complaints of the Chickasaws and like them believes they cannot be happy, and prosper as a nation, in their present situation and condition, and being desirous to relieve them from the great calamity that seems to await them, if they remain as they are - He has sent his Commissioner General John Coffee, who has met the whole Chickasaw nation in Council, and after mature deliberation, they have entered into the following articles..."Although further complications had to be resolved, Arrell M. Gibson writes that the Pontotoc Creek Treaty [...] "was the basic Chickasaw removal document providing for the cession of all tribal land east of the Mississippi River." [...] In the treaty, the Chickasaw land was ceded in return for the U.S. finding suitable land for resettlement –revealing the chiefs' desperation to regain Chickasaw sovereignty from the aggressions of the state of Mississippi. Chickasaw landholders were to be compensated for the improvements made on his land, and all the proceeds made by the Federal government in the sale of the land were to {{be turned over to the}} Chickasaw to pay for finding new territory and the actual removal of the tribe. Unlike other removal treaties, then, the Chickasaw would pay for their own migration. The treaty also provided for the protection the Chickasaw in Mississippi until they emigrated with the allotment of [...] "temporary homesteads." [...] This meant that the Chickasaws were allotted the land they were living on in Mississippi to be protected by the Federal government from squatters, –a benefit not given to the Cherokee when later the Federal government relied on the influx of squatters in Georgia to pressure the Cherokee into removal.|$|E
