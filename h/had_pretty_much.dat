25|$|Logic {{suggests}} that Ward's fate {{was destined to}} be much the same. However, in Ward's case, his invention enabled him to turn his fate to his immense advantage. Family members state that the fact that the travels associated with the promotion of his invention took him away from the farm a lot was not something city-bred Ward considered to be disagreeable. In fact, his son David Bryant King <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> taken over operation of the farm {{by the time he reached}} eighteen. Leffler, after many years on his Hancock County farm, was finally able to move back to Springfield to help his father manage the family's considerable real estate holdings during his father's declining years. Like his brother, his son Edwin Askam King pretty much took over the operation of Grassland Farm. Although separated by distance, the brothers always remained very close, and they constantly worked together on the family's real estate undertakings in Springfield. Ironically, in the remarkably parallel lives of these two Springfield-reared farmers, their children were more farm people than they were.|$|E
500|$|Designer Steve Meretzky {{conceived}} Hodj 'n' Podj in {{the late}} 1980s, five or more years before the project began in 1994. His initial goal was to revive [...] "all those fun, simple games which <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> disappeared" [...] at the time. To increase its value, he believed it needed a structure that tied together its minigames; and this inspired its storyline and board game motif. Its story was {{in the style of}} Fractured Fairy Tales, from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. Meretzky later noted that other companies beat him to reviving these games in the years between Hodj 'n' Podjs conception and release, and saw success without any using overarching structures. However, he still felt [...] "very happy creatively" [...] with the final design of his project.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive." [...] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged." [...] In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the [...] "careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels." [...] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking [...] "whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't." [...] She further added that the [...] "3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition." ...|$|E

Mathieu also published her autobiography with co-author [...] The title is Oui Je Crois [...] "Yes, I Believe" [...] which is taken from the lyrics of Mon crédo, her first recording.

She was considered a pre-revolution (1968) Gaullist figurehead, and hated by the left. Stark was also exhausted and overweight by this time. Pierre Delanoë wrote a passionate song about Joan of Arc in [...] for Mireille. The final lyric: [...] "When I think of all I have given France... and she has forgotten me" [...] was truly how the singer felt as she was made a caricature by the Communists in power. She used her fists in punching the air while singing the song.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the extreme}} {{empiricism}} of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned {{this sort of}} phenomenalism {{in favor of a}} rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics. [...] That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called protocol sentences, for example, [...] "X at location Y and at time T observes such and such." [...] The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic-synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as Nelson Goodman, W.V. Quine, Hilary Putnam, Karl Popper, and Richard Rorty. [...] By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> run its course, though its influence is still significant [...] among contemporary analytic philosophers such as Michael Dummett and other anti-realists.|$|E

Ulrich added that the band was feeling a musical insecurity — [...] "We felt inadequate as musicians and as songwriters, That made us go too far, around Master of Puppets and Justice, {{in the direction of}} trying to prove ourselves. 'We'll do all this weird-ass shit sideways to prove that we are capable musicians and songwriters'" [...] – and Hetfield added he wanted to avoid getting stale: [...] "Sitting there and worrying about whether people are going to like the album, therefore we have to write a certain kind of song — you just end up writing for someone else. Everyone's different. If everyone was the same, it would be boring as shit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colvin's first {{involvement}} with international cricket came in August 2005, when the England team {{was preparing to}} face the Australian women's international team at the Hove County Cricket Ground. She was invited to bowl against the English team in the nets to give them practice against a left-arm spinner, who the Australian team was fielding {{in the form of}} Shelley Nitschke. After the practice session, Colvin was asked to be available for the four-day [...] by team coach Richard Bates. Team captain Clare Connor admitted that her inclusion was [...] "pure hunch", believing that the dry, dusty wicket would be favourable to spin bowling. Bates explained to The Times that [...] "the pitch [...] a little worn, and we felt that Holly could help us exploit it". Colvin made her England debut on 9 August 2005, becoming at 15 years and 336 days the youngest cricketer (of either sex) to play Test cricket for England. She took three wickets in her inaugural game, dismissing Kate Blackwell and Julia Price in two consecutive balls and nearly taking Julie Hayes for a hat-trick. Reminiscing over the experience in February 2008, Colvin remarked that [...] "I think I was fortunate... I had no idea who I was playing against – all these big names that were coming up against me and I <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> no idea".

6000|$|Exactly! In {{other words}} Fred <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same {{complaint}} {{as the rest}} of Dr. Slyder's patients on Plutoria Avenue, and was to be treated in the same way. Dr. Slyder, who was the most fashionable practitioner in the City, spent his entire time moving to and fro in an almost noiseless motor earnestly advising people to keep quiet. [...] "You must keep very quiet for a little while," [...] he would say with a sigh, as he sat beside a sick-bed. As he drew on his gloves in the hall below he would shake his head very impressively and say, [...] "You must keep him very quiet," [...] and so pass out, quite soundlessly. By this means Dr. Slyder often succeeded in keeping people quiet for weeks. It was all the medicine that he knew. But it was enough.

60|$|Sir Charles, I {{ought to}} say, had secured during that summer a very {{advantageous}} option {{in a part}} of Africa on the Transvaal frontier, rumoured to be auriferous. Now, whether it was auriferous or not before, the mere fact that Charles had secured some claim on it naturally made it so; for no man had ever the genuine Midas-touch to a greater degree than Charles Vandrift: whatever he handles turns at once to gold, if not to diamonds. Therefore, as soon as my brother-in-law had obtained this option from the native vendor (a most respected chief, by name Montsioa), and promoted a company of his own to develop it, his great rival in that region, Lord Craig-Ellachie (formerly Sir David Alexander Granton), immediately secured a similar option of an adjacent track, the larger part of which <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same geological conditions as that covered by Sir Charles's right of pre-emption.|$|E

60|$|In {{the wider}} horizons and opener {{atmosphere}} of the great city he came to understand better that to be an American in all respects was not the best. His mounting sense of importance began to be retroactive {{in the direction of}} his ancestral home; he wrote back to the little town near Wurzburg which his people had come from, and found that he had relatives still living there, some of whom had become people of substance; and about the time his health gave way from life-long gluttony, and he was ordered to Carlsbad, he <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> made up his mind to take his younger daughters and put them in school {{for a year or two}} in Wurzburg, for a little discipline if not education.

60|$|In 1709, {{when the}} {{publication}} of the Tatler began, our great-great-grandfathers must have seized upon that new and delightful paper with much such eagerness as lovers of light literature in a later day exhibited when the Waverley novels appeared, upon which the public rushed, forsaking that feeble entertainment of which the Miss Porters, the Anne of Swanseas, and worthy Mrs. Radcliffe herself, with her dreary castles and exploded old ghosts, had <b>had</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the monopoly. I have looked over many of the comic books with which our ancestors amused themselves, from the novels of Swift’s coadjutrix, Mrs. Manley, the delectable author of the New Atlantis, to the facetious productions of Tom Durfey, and Tom Brown, and Ned Ward, writer of the London Spy and several other volumes of ribaldry. The slang of the taverns and ordinaries, the wit of the bagnios, form the strongest part of the farrago of which these libels are composed. In the excellent newspaper collection at the British Museum, you may see, besides the Craftsman and Post Boy, specimens, and queer specimens they are, of the higher literature of Queen Anne’s time. Here is an abstract from a notable journal bearing date, Wednesday, October 13th, 1708, and entitled The British Apollo; or, Curious Amusements for the Ingenious, by a Society of Gentlemen. The British Apollo invited and professed to answer questions upon all subjects of wit, morality, science, and even religion; and two out of its four pages are filled with queries and replies much like some of the oracular penny prints of the present time.|$|E
