Nevertheless, {{since it was}} first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. The heavier isotope 243Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a <b>higher</b> <b>cost</b> of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone.

5|$|Benzoquinone is {{actually}} not a necessary component for this reaction; its {{role is to}} regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while at a much <b>higher</b> <b>cost.</b> Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some {{progress has been made}} in the development of catalytic variants.

Past and future technological developments {{have a variety of}} social, economic and ethical implications which have {{to be taken into account}} when balancing its costs and benefits to society. Departing from an economic perspective we describe a number of mechanisms underlying the emergence of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology which help us to understand some of the characteristics of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology, such as its focus on quality enhancement rather than on economy. To assess the actual performance of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology in terms of efficiency and equity is difficult as there may be debate about the perspective guiding such assessment and as there still is scarce information on <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology in terms of these economic indicators. The increasing technological opportunities have triggered a wider debate on the desired evolution of our health care systems. In some countries there is a tendency to diminish government involvement in health care and emphasize private (for profit) enterprise as a reaction to not being able to finance all new <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology. The risks of such strategies are discussed briefly. We conclude that the main actors in health care should adjust their behaviour in order to accomplish the introduction of more cost-effective technologies and to achieve a more socially efficient distribution of their benefits. <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> technology socio-economic implications...|$|R

5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the <b>higher</b> <b>cost</b> of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E

DESIGN: To locate <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> or long stay patients, the analysis was designed {{on the basis}} of a mixture of Weibull distributions. In this new model, the proportion of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> patients was expressed according to the multinomial logistic regression, permitting the determination of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> factors. SETTING: The 1993 French reference database, constituted in the framework of the national study of DRG costs, conducted by the French Ministry of Health. The database of discharge abstracts recorded in 1993 in the Dijon public teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The analyses were based on 1352 abstracts from the French reference database and 368 from the Dijon database concerning patients, aged 18 and over, suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma. MAIN RESULTS: <b>High</b> <b>cost</b> and long stay factors were the same: number of stays, death, transfer, acute leukaemia, neutropenia, septicaemia, high dose aplastic chemotherapy, central venous catheterisation, parenteral nutrition, protected or laminar airflow room, blood transfusion, and intravenous antibiotherapy.

A major {{study conducted by}} the Young Foundation and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council investigating the use of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit in Wales. The research was carried out throughout 2015 with the final report - Credit where credit’s due? Understanding experiences of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit in Wales – published in May 2016. An estimated 12 million people across the UK lack access to affordable credit, something the majority take for granted in everyday life. The alternatives for many are <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> lenders – payday loans, doorstep lenders, or expensive rent-to-own stores on the high street. This financial exclusion is harmful to individuals and families, our communities and the wider economy. Objectives: We set out to understand the scale of the issue, pathways into and journeys through <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit, and the impact this has. We aimed to identify opportunities and offer suggestions for new and improved products, services and ways of engaging consumers – and to outline what might work as alternatives to <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit. Key Findings: •	Six per cent of the Welsh population have used one or more of rent-to-own stores, home credit and payday loans in the last year. •	Customers come {{from all walks of life}} but are most likely to be young families. •	Reasons for using <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit range from paying for Christmas or buying new items for the home, to simply paying the bills and making ends meet. For most, these represent essential purchases. •	The majority of people turn straight to <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit without considering different types of credit or comparing offers between lenders. •	<b>High</b> <b>cost</b> credit customers are typically extremely aware of their income and outgoings, often using ‘jam jar’ and other informal money management solutions. •	Many see <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit options as being ‘for people like me’ and one of a very limited set of financial options. •	The majority of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit customers live in communities where these types of borrowing are normal. •	Home credit providers especially are in a strong position to encourage repeat borrowing. •	Customer perceptions of payday loans still firmly reflect the pre-cap market. •	By contrast, rent-to-own and home credit have largely slipped through the net of negative publicity. •	Regulating all forms of <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> credit out of existence is not the answer. •	There is a clear need for market growth in the affordable credit market...|$|R

5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much <b>higher</b> <b>cost)</b> or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E
5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and timber castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the <b>higher</b> <b>cost</b> of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles {{were by no means}} useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace <b>higher</b> <b>cost</b> generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E

5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, {{it is not}} {{surprising}} that their players dominated the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs at a much higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were a large part of the success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially <b>higher</b> <b>cost</b> than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E
