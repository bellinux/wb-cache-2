5000|$|Unlike {{the simpler}} {{vertical}} declining sundial, {{this type of}} dial does not always show hour angles on its sunside face for all declinations between east and west. When a northern hemisphere partly south-facing dial reclines back (i.e. away from the sun) from the vertical, the gnomon will become co-planar with the dial plate at declinations less than due east or due west. Likewise for southern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing.Were these dials reclining forward, the range of declination would actually exceed due east and due west.In a similar way, northern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing and southern hemisphere dials that are south-facing, and which lean forward toward their upward pointing gnomons, will have a similar restriction on the range of declination that is possible for a given reclination value.The critical declination [...] is a <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraint</b> which depends {{on the value of}} both the dial's reclination and its latitude : ...|$|E

To {{take into account the}} influences of the local compositions together with the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature of the membrane surface, a general potential functional is constructed. We introduce two kinds of virtual displacement modes: the normal one and the tangential one. By minimizing the potential functional, the equilibrium differential equations and the boundary conditions of two-component lipid vesicles are derived. Additionally, the <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraint</b> equation and geometrically permissible condition for the two-component lipid vesicles are presented. The physical, mathematical, and biological meanings of the equilibrium differential equations and the <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraint</b> equations are discussed.

40|$|International audienceThe simple {{connection}} conditions of reciprocal structures means that technological <b>constraints</b> become <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraints</b> and bending moments are increased. <b>Geometrical</b> <b>constraints</b> can be dealt by using form-finding {{methods such as}} a dynamic relaxation algorithm, but resisting bending moments to gain stiffness is difficult to accomplish without increasing {{the weight of the}} structure.

The proposed paper is thus an attempt to apply these strategies to reciprocal structures and to develop spherical domes with a structural thickness.

40|$|The {{motion error}} of {{assembled}} bearing {{depends on the}} geometric profile of bearing components. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} establish the relationship between geometric error of bearing components and motion error of assembled bearing, which contributes to improving the rotational accuracy of assembled bearing in the design and machining of the bearing. The main purpose of this research is to propose an accurate method for predicting the radial runout of inner ring based on the <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraint</b> model of cylindrical roller bearings. In the <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraint</b> model, dimension and form errors in the inner raceway, the outer raceway, and rollers are considered, and the change of contact positions between the raceways and rollers caused by geometric errors of bearing components is taken into account. This method could predict the radial runout of inner ring after bearing components with geometric error are assembled. In order to testify the validity of the proposed prediction method, two particular cases in which the profiles of the inner raceway are circle and ellipse are selected, and the analysis algorithms for the radial runout of inner ring are derived. Two analytical results obtained from the analysis algorithms validate accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method...|$|E

Here we wished to assay how external <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraints</b> applied to the cell body and/or the neurites of hippocampal neurons may modulate axonal polarization in vitro. Through {{the use of a}} panel of non-specific poly-L-lysine micropatterns, we manipulated the neuronal shape. By applying <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraints</b> on the cell body we provided evidence that centrosome location was not predictive of axonal polarization but rather follows axonal fate. When the <b>geometrical</b> <b>constraints</b> were applied to the neurites trajectories we demonstrated that axonal specification was inhibited by curved lines. Altogether these results indicated that intrinsic mechanical tensions occur during neuritic growth and that maximal tension was developed by the axon and expressed on straight trajectories. The strong inhibitory effect of curved lines on axon specification was further demonstrated by their ability to prevent formation of multiple axons normally induced by cytochalasin or taxol treatments. Finally we provided evidence that microtubules were involved in the tension-mediated axonal polarization, acting as curvature sensors during neuronal differentiation. Thus, biomechanics coupled to physical constraints might be the first level of regulation during neuronal development, primary to biochemical and guidance regulations...|$|R
