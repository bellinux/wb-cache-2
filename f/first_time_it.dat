5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.|$|E

5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block.

This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, is the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E

5|$|Edisto Beach, South Carolina {{was changed}} forever by Gracie, due to human efforts to renourish the beach after its passage. Most {{of the shell}} hash beach {{currently}} at Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the beach, an inland marsh was excavated {{and moved to the}} shoreline. This created highly desirable beach front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The Kermadec petrel, a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> appeared in North America.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the success of}} the legislation, most of the 333,456 large cents struck in 1857 never left the Philadelphia Mint, and were later melted. Snowden purchased a new set of rollers and other equipment so that the Mint could produce its own cent planchets, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> had done so in over 50 years. Although the legislation was still a day from final passage, Snowden recommended Longacre's designs to Guthrie on February 20. Guthrie approved them on the 24th, though he requested that the edge of the coin be made less sharp; Snowden promised to comply. Flying Eagle cents were struck beginning in April 1857 and were held pending official release. The Mint stored the pieces pending accumulation of a sufficient supply; in mid-May, Snowden notified Philadelphia newspapers that distribution would begin on May 25.|$|E
