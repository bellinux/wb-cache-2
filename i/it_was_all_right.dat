5|$|The family {{received}} the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from the video that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son had not wanted to attend the funeral.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefsâ€”including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, to make sure <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Lauderdale, on 139, {{was a bit}} {{puzzled by}} all this. But they were all new to the four-track, and he {{supposed}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Then the signalman gave them a green flag from the box, so Lauderdale started pulling forward {{to see what he}} wanted. But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But it was too late then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out and went over the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line. Its driver saw the crash occur and managed to pull up just in time.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008 Sebastian {{gained a}} {{contract}} to release his previous album The Memphis Album in the US. The release was later changed to only include three of the soul cover songs from The Memphis Album, with the other eight tracks being songs which he had recorded for his fifth Australian album. Sebastian stated {{in an interview with}} the Sunday Telegraph, [...] "They were originally just going to release The Memphis Album, but I don't want to be known as a covers artist here. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> in Australia, because it was my fourth album, but I want some originals on there." [...] The album was set to be released in mid-2009, under the title Like It Like That.|$|E
2500|$|The {{loneliness}} in Orbison's {{songs that}} he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: [...] "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else... Although if you grow up in West Texas, {{there are a lot}} of ways to be lonely." [...] His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, [...] "He made emotion fashionable, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it." [...] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: [...] "When [...] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry." [...] Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{one year}} after their live debut and now dubbed the Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again {{following}} in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called Moe Howard to see if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to call his band [...] "The Stooges," [...] to which Howard responded by merely saying [...] "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not the Three Stooges!" [...] and hung up the phone). The Stooges' first album The Stooges, (on which Pop was credited as [...] "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening heroin addiction.|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
