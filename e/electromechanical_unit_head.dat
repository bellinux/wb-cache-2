40|$|Abstract-The {{main purpose}} of the paper is to present the {{metrological}} aspects of virtual kilo-watt-hours meters developed for measurement of active power in while voltage and current are non-sinusoidal. Today’s electrical kilo-watt-hours meters are built as devices for sinusoidal signals both for current and voltage. These <b>electromechanical</b> <b>units</b> are not appropriate for distorted signals, so {{the new generation of}} kilo-watt-hours with a used of electronic elements are under development. Deliberation of virtual active electronic electrical power meters are presented here. I...|$|R

50|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century three {{different}} systems of units of measure existed for electrical measurements: a CGS-based system for electrostatic units, also known as the Gaussian or ESU system, a CGS-based system for <b>electromechanical</b> <b>units</b> (EMU) and an MKS-based system ("international system") for electrical distribution systems. Attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|R

The main units of Ferro Chrome Plant of Burrel are the melting <b>unit,</b> <b>electromechanical</b> <b>unit,</b> internal transportation and services units. Chrome mineral that is used in melting power plants, is supplied from the mines of the country, mainly from the chrome-holding basin of Bulqize. The final and only product of the Ferro Chrome factory in Burrel is ferro-chrome with high carbon content (C= 6-8 %), whereas the chrome in ferro-chrome is Cr=60-65 % (base 63%).|$|R

A molded ring frame of polyamide-imide plastic (Torlon) is attached along one edge to {{a base plate}} formed of a highly heat conducting material, such as aluminum or copper. Bores are placed through a base plate within {{the area of the}} edge surface of ring frame which result in an attachment of the ring frame to the base plate during molding. Electrical leads are molded into the ring frame. The leads are L-shaped gold-plated copper wires imbedded within widened portions of the side wall of the ring frame. Within the plastic ring frame wall the leads are bent (typically, though not necessarily at 90 deg) so that they project into the interior volume of the ring frame for connection to the solid state devices...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 19 th century {{microscopy}} and early physiologicalexperimentation {{gave rise to}} the apparent paradox thatalthough cardiac muscle is made up of individual cells, it behaves as a single continuous functional unit. The explana-tion had to be that a component of the individual cells was responsible for coupling them together and coordinating their function to provide one continuous <b>electromechanical</b> <b>unit.</b> In the 1960 s high resolution microscopy identified the likely membrane specialization responsible for this, and the func-tional properties of what later became known as the “gap junction ” started to be determined by experimentation in the 1970 s. Gap-junctional membrane offers relatively low resistance to current flow, several orders of magnitude lower than ordinary cell membrane. But in passing through the cytoplas-mic pathway from cell to cell in whole tissue, gap junctions remain relatively resistive discontinuities to the passage o...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} research effort {{explores the}} development of active cells - simple contractile <b>electromechanical</b> <b>units</b> {{that can be used}} as the material basis for larger articulable structures. Each cell, which might be considered a 2 ̆ 7 muscle unit 2 ̆ 7, consists of a contractile Nitinol SMA core with conductive terminals. Large numbers of these cells might be combined and externally powered to change phase, contracting to either articulate with a large strain or increase the stiffness of the ensemble, depending on the cell design. Unlike traditional work in modular robotics, the approach presented here focuses on cells that have a simplistic design and function, are inexpensive to fabricate, and are eventually scalable to sub-millimeter sizes, working towards our vision of robot structures that can be custom-fabricated from large numbers of general cell units, similar to biological structures...|$|R
