5|$|Sanchez {{became the}} first USC quarterback to leave school <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> NFL since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season. During the press conference, head coach Pete Carroll {{made it clear that}} he did not agree with Sanchez's decision, and advised him of the low success-rate of quarterbacks who left college early. Despite the public disagreement, the two {{remained}} close afterward.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged {{prior to the}} Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the gold standard or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.|$|E

5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Adrian Hubbard, Cyrus Kouandjio, Jeoffrey Pagan and Vinnie Sunseri {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2014 NFL Draft. At {{the time of}} their announcement, Clinton-Dix and Kouandjio were projected to be first-round picks and both Hubbard and Pagan were projected to be no lower than third-round picks. With their departures it marked the first time during the Saban era that more than three juniors declared <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> NFL Draft. In February 2014, twelve Alabama players, seven seniors and five juniors, were invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited players were offensive linemen Cyrus Kouandjio and Anthony Steen, safeties Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and Vinnie Sunseri, linebackers Adrian Hubbard and C. J. Mosley, defensive ends Jeoffrey Pagan and Ed Stinson, quarterback AJ McCarron, wide receiver Kevin Norwood, cornerback Deion Belue and punter Cody Mandell.|$|E
5|$|The first final of the UEFA European Football Championship (then {{referred}} to as the European Nations' Cup Final) was contested in July 1960 in Paris between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Milan Galić scored for Yugoslavia just before half-time but Slava Metreveli equalised soon after the break, and the scores remained level, sending the game into extra time. With seven minutes left, Viktor Ponedelnik won the match for the Soviet Union, scoring the winner with a header. The 1960 champions qualified for the final of the 1964 tournament, where they faced hosts Spain. Jesús María Pereda scored <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> home side, but the match was levelled two minutes later when Galimzyan Khusainov equalised. Nearly 80,000 spectators at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid had to wait for the winner which came six minutes from time, courtesy of a header from Spaniard Marcelino.|$|E
5|$|Audi's No. 8 car made a {{pit stop}} for tyres, fuel and a {{replacement}} rear spoiler. The safety car {{went into the}} pit lane after 24 minutes and racing resumed with Jarvis leading the field back up to speed. Lamy passed François Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari at Rivage corner {{to take over the}} LMGTE Am lead. Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR Sport car after moving in front of the vehicle upon lapping it at La Source resulting in heavy damage to the No. 7 Audi car's front-end, littering debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler braked <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, littering the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while lapping Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E

The first great tournament in which he participated was the EuroBasket 1995, where Greece made the semifinals, finishing fourth. Alvertis did not start any of the games, nor get very significant playing time, but he helped the team with his shooting coming off the bench. He finished the tournament averaging 4.9 points per game.|$|E

25|$|The {{next issue}} of {{contention}} is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ten-year-old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing {{themselves with a}} champion, hail from rival noble houses: The foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiance, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified.|$|E

After leading the Blue Devils to the championship game of the Final Four—where they were upset by the Connecticut Huskies—Brand was named the consensus National Player of the Year. He subsequently decided to leave Duke after his sophomore season and declared for the 1999 NBA draft. Brand, along with sophomore William Avery and freshman Corey Maggette, were the first three players under Mike Krzyzewski to leave <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> draft and not play the full four years at Duke.|$|E
25|$|On December 11, Bush sprained his medial {{collateral}} {{ligament in}} his left knee in the Saints' 27–24 overtime loss in Chicago. Although diagnosed as a sprain, given {{that it was the}} same knee he had surgery on earlier in the year – and that the Saints were now out of the playoff picture with only two games left in the 2008 season – Bush was placed on injured reserve, ending his season <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second year in a row. He finished the season with 404 rushing yards on 106 carries, 440 yards receiving with 52 receptions and nine total touchdowns, playing in ten games.|$|E
25|$|Thirty of the 32 {{players that}} {{traveled}} for LSU to Miami saw playing {{time in the}} game. Dietzel pulled most starters after the first score of the fourth quarter. Fran Curci gave LSU the most trouble; he passed for 62 yards and rushed for 62 more, which led his team in both categories. Tommy Davis was LSU's leading rusher with 62 yards of his own. Miami gained fourteen first downs to LSU's eleven, but three interceptions ended drives <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hurricanes. It was another run-dominated game for LSU as both teams had over 200 rushing yards. The win moved LSU into the top ten in the Coaches' Poll, to number nine.|$|E

25|$|However, {{against the}} Washington Redskins the {{following}} week, his 100th career start, Cutler tore a groin muscle when sacked by Chris Baker, breaking Jim Harbaugh's franchise {{record for most}} times sacked. Josh McCown was solid in relief, barely losing that Redskins game in a 45–41 shootout, and after the bye-week tossing two touchdowns in a 27–21 win at Green Bay. Cutler was medically cleared to return <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> week 10 game against Detroit, where he had 250 yards, 1 TD, and 1 INT before a hit from Stephen Tulloch {{in the second quarter}} finally drove him from the game on the Bears last drive. McCown drove 74 yards in 90 seconds for a touchdown, but the two-point conversion failed and the Bears lost 21–19.|$|E
25|$|Marinovich {{entered the}} 1990 {{season as a}} Heisman Trophy candidate, with {{speculation}} on his leaving school <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> NFL. Head coach Larry Smith set for Marinovich {{the goal of a}} 70% pass completion rate. However, his play became erratic due to his personal difficulties. After finding out Marinovich had been skipping numerous classes Smith suspended him from the Arizona State game, but his play against Arizona had been so poor that he might have been kept out of the game regardless. Smith had a difficult relationship with Marinovich, and the relationship worsened when the quarterback began yelling at the coach on national television during a loss in the Sun Bowl. Marinovich was arrested for cocaine possession a month later, and entered the NFL draft after the season.|$|E
25|$|Played on {{the same}} day as both the semi-finals, the match was played as a day/night game. Somerset captain Justin Langer won the toss and decided to let Sussex bat first. Murray Goodwin was {{dismissed}} <b>early</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sharks, caught by Somerset's wicket-keeper Craig Kieswetter off the bowling of Charl Willoughby. Despite that, {{by the end of the}} six-over powerplay, Sussex were well placed on 47 for one. However, the run out of Luke Wright was soon followed by two more wickets, and left Sussex on 80 for four. Dwayne Smith then scored rapidly to push the total up to 122, before he was stumped by Kieswetter, giving Max Waller his second wicket. Chris Nash and Yasir Arafat batted well together at the end of the innings to take Sussex's score to 172 for seven.|$|E
