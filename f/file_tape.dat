50|$|Interlink {{was founded}} in 1983 by Lambert Onuma, Fred Wright, Karl Johnson and Greg Thompson, {{formerly}} of Digital Equipment Corporation. The company's first product, called simply Interlink, allowed IBM MVS mainframes {{to be connected to}} VAX computers on a DECnet network. Later a VM/DECnet product was developed in cooperation with Dupont to link IBM VM/CMS systems with a DECnet network interconnecting e-mail, <b>file,</b> <b>tape,</b> and storage access, terminal emulation, a program-to-program API, and enabling DECnet to be tunneled over an SNA LU6.2 network. In 1990, Interlink acquired a product called ACCES/MVS from Advanced Computer Communications, which implemented a native TCP/IP protocol stack on the MVS and VM operating systems and within CICS regions. First released in 1986, ACCES/MVS had been the first commercial TCP/IP implementation for MVS mainframes. Interlink developed and marketed this product as SNS/TCPaccess. The prefix was later dropped, and TCPaccess became the company's main focus of development by the mid-1990s.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program called NASCAN (NASTRAN scan) is described. NASCAN enables users to scan lengthy NASTRAN output files for maximum and minimum values in easy user oriented categories. Areas of high stress or deflections {{in any of}} the NASTRAN rigid formats are quickly detected and listed out for project documentations. The NASTRAN model is then revised if necessary by updating an input <b>file</b> <b>tape</b> which is processed through the NASTRAN program...|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnet {{symmetric}} (PMS) lens {{is considered}} {{as the final}} focusing element for the RFQ linac at ICR. The PMS lens, which produces strong axial magnetic field like a solenoid lens, is composed of radially magnetized permanent magnet rings. Because of the low injection energy (50 keV) and a relatively high beam current intended (20 mA), space-charge effects {{should be taken into}} account. The beam tracking code PARMSYL is developed for the purpose, which first reads an output <b>file</b> (<b>TAPE</b> 35) from PANDIRA for the PMS field and then numerically integrates the equation of motion including the spacecharge force The matching section to the RFQ is designed using this code and TRACE- 3 D. I. INTRODUCTION At Institute for Chemical Research (ICR), Kyoto University, the proton linac consisting of a 2 MeV RFQ linac and a 7 MeV Alvarez linac has been operated since 1992 [1]. Various mechanical improvements are in progress to increase the beam current up to 20 mA. In this paper, the design of a new [...] ...|$|E
