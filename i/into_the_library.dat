The parlor was converted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> and the library was converted into the dining room after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>library,</b> Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E

25|$|The gunfight distracted Harris and Klebold {{from the}} injured Brian Anderson. Anderson escaped {{to the library}} and hid inside an open staff break room. Back in the school, the duo moved along the main North Hallway, {{throwing}} pipe bombs and shooting at anyone they encountered. Klebold shot Stephanie Munson in the ankle, although she was able to walk out of the school. The pair then shot out the windows to the East Entrance of the school.

25|$|The Lexicon (Λέξεων Συναγωγή), {{published}} {{later than}} the Bibliotheca, was probably in the main the work {{of some of his}} pupils. It was intended as a book of reference to facilitate the reading of old classical and sacred authors, whose language and vocabulary were out of date. For a long time, the only manuscripts of the Lexicon were the Codex Galeanus, which passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> of Trinity College, Cambridge and Berolinensis graec. oct. 22, both of which were incomplete. But in 1959, Linos Politis of the University of Thessaloniki discovered a complete manuscript, codex Zavordensis 95, in the Zavorda Monastery (Greek: Ζάβορδα) in Grevena, Greece, where it still resides.|$|E

They escape the house by shrinking themselves down and sailing out on a model ship via an underground stream accessible through Prospero’s basement.

25|$|The {{art gallery}} was another extravagance of Strousberg's for {{the display of}} his {{painting}} and sculpture collection. East of the gallery, the Billiards room provided a convenient entertaining room, which led back through the walnut paneled dining room to either the drawing room or <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>library.</b> Above the library's panelling, which was again carved from walnut, were murals and a skylight set into the ceiling. At night this room, like the others, was lit by gas light. The rest of the Palais's ground floor accommodation served as anterooms and work rooms for the Ambassador. Above the small windows of the Servants' quarters in the basement; {{the windows of the}} great hall, its anteroom and the portrait gallery, stood more than 3 metres tall, overlooking and visually connected the rooms with each other and the gardens in the large courtyard. The facades that faced onto this courtyard were given a unifying treatment with Corinthian columns dividing the glazing. Originally it was open to the west, where a curved terrace opened onto a garden. Its location can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. Its plan shape can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. The terrace was adjacent to the garden of the Palais Redern and effectively extended the small garden of the Palais Strousberg into the generous garden of the Palais Redern.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, 2006, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a fourth-year University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student, was drive stunned {{multiple}} {{times with a}} Taser by campus police, for allegedly refusing to show his school ID to a fellow student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. The police had been called after Tabatabainejad had refused to provide his BruinCard (student ID) to a UCLA Community Service Officer (aka student volunteer). Tabatabainejad felt he was being singled out because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. A UCLA ID card with magnetic strip is needed to enter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> after hours and therefore {{it was assumed that}} all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad sat on the floor in protest of the way he was being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind his back with plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.|$|E
