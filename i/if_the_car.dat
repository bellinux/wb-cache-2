5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there was}} {{disappointment}} in the Lola camp, because Michele Alboreto could have scored {{one point in}} that race <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> had not broken down.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is {{entering}} pit road {{to avoid an}} incident and has to cross the plane of road line track side, then enter pit road, no penalty.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not known}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> of McKenna and Douglas {{actually}} retired from the race or were still running when the race time expired.|$|R
50|$|But <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> are damaged {{beyond the}} ability to repair in race, or even totaled, the player will have to watch the rest of <b>the</b> race, even <b>if</b> none of its cars is on track.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the length}} of the {{auxiliary}} pit road was significantly shorter than the main pit road, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> that pitted there were held from 15-20 seconds {{to make up for the}} time that would have been spent <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> had traveled <b>the</b> entire main pit road.|$|R
25|$|The game keeps score {{between the}} player and the donkeys. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> hits a donkey, the donkey gets a {{point and the}} player is {{returned}} {{to the start of}} the road. As the car avoids donkeys it moves slowly up the screen, giving the player less time to react when donkeys appear. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> avoids enough donkeys the player receives a point and the car is moved back to the bottom of the road. The game displays the number of points earned by the player and donkey but does not end or change when a particular score is reached.|$|E
25|$|In Set XXX, {{the road}} number of a DM car is 1XXX, the road number of a T car is 2XXX {{and the road}} number of an M car is 3XXX. The table below shows the set numbers of the heavy-capacity car types, which include Types C301, C321, C341, C371, and C381. For example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> numbers of a C301 train is 1001-2001-3001-3002-2002-1002, two C301 sets 001 and 002 form this train.|$|E
25|$|There are {{costs and}} {{benefits}} to car use. The costs include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (<b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle {{at the end of}} its life. Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Into the 1980s, a {{marketing}} strategy emphasize the toy appeal of <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> including brighter paints, large tampos and slightly exaggerated bodies. However, this was well executed, and even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> lost some realism, {{they had a}} particular, attractive solidness and style not like the competition. And in 1980 they bought Solido.|$|R
50|$|Telescoping {{often results}} in heavy {{fatalities}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> telescoped are fully occupied. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> riding on top will often be destroyed by the structure of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> below, leaving very little survivable space (although the physics of the incident may reverse the cars' roles). The chances of telescoping can be reduced by use of anticlimbers and crash energy management (CEM) structural systems.|$|R
25|$|Overtaking <b>the</b> lead <b>car</b> under drift {{conditions}} is OK <b>if</b> <b>the</b> chasing <b>car</b> doesn't interrupt <b>the</b> lead <b>car's</b> drift.|$|R
25|$|Strategic {{dominance}} {{links the}} Monty Hall {{problem to the}} game theory. In the zero-sum game setting of Gill, 2011, discarding the non-switching strategies reduces the game to the following simple variant: the host (or the TV-team) decides {{on the door to}} hide the car, and the contestant chooses two doors (i.e., the two doors remaining after the player's first, nominal, choice). The contestant wins (and her opponent loses) <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is behind one of the two doors she chose.|$|E
25|$|Dominance is {{a strong}} reason to seek for a {{solution}} among always-switching strategies, under fairly general assumptions on {{the environment in which}} the contestant is making decisions. In particular, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is hidden by means of some randomization device – like tossing symmetric or asymmetric three-sided die – the dominance implies that a strategy maximizing the probability of winning the car will be among three always-switching strategies, namely it will be the strategy that initially picks the least likely door then switches no matter which door to switch is offered by the host.|$|E
25|$|Hylton {{stated that}} his plans {{following}} his retirement included continued {{participation in the}} ARCA Racing Series as a team owner, planning to hire a younger driver to run the No. 48. Sean Corr ran the car in 2014 along with several other drivers. Corr returned to Daytona in 2015. Brad Smith took over as driver planning the full season, but an injury at Talladega forced him out <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Driver James Swanson has since taken over, and the team has been running Dodge since Swanson began driving.|$|E
5000|$|Despite McRae's efforts, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{that emerged}} {{appeared}} cobbled together, {{rather than as}} a cohesive design. Auto reviewer [...] "Uncle" [...] Tom McCahill remarked that from the rear it looked as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> had been left in the sun too long and the canted fiberglass fins had started to melt down the straight rear fender sides.|$|R
25|$|Driving {{missions}} {{can involve}} either {{trying to catch}} another car, escape from another car, or tailing another car. At all times, when the player is in a car, their car's condition is shown on screen. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> health meter empties, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is close to destruction. During normal driving missions in both games, the player can solve random crimes given by the radio dispatcher.|$|R
50|$|Episode 6: Team F-150 competes against Team Lotus in the Challenge, {{which is}} a drag race with a {{concrete}} wall at <b>the</b> end <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> don't stop in time. Team F-150 chooses to crash through this wall, resulting in damage to their headlights and grille. They are able {{to repair the damage}} and continue.|$|R
25|$|Thus, for example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main ring gear may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the left wheel will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel. The sun gears (which drive the axle half-shafts) will rotate at different speeds relative to the ring gear (one faster, one slower) by, say, 2 full turns each (4 full turns relative to each other), resulting in the left wheel making 12 rotations, and the right wheel making 8 rotations.|$|E
25|$|UN R48 has {{mandated}} {{the installation}} of automatic headlamp since July 30, 2016. With Daytime running lamp equipped and operated, the dipped beam headlamp should automatically turn on <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is driving in less than 1,000 lux ambient condition (Automatic switching condition), such as in tunnel and in dark environment. while driving in tunnel or dark environment, Daytime running lamp would make glare more evident to the upcoming vehicle driver, which in turn would influence the upcoming vehicle driver's eyesight, such that, by automatically switching the Daytime running lamp to the dipped-beam headlamp, the inherent safety defect could be solved and safety benefit ensured.|$|E
25|$|In March 2014, Nissan is recalling {{nearly one}} million {{vehicles}} for {{a problem with}} the airbags. The occupant classification system (OCS) may incorrectly think that the passenger seat is empty when it is occupied by an adult, failing to activate the airbag in a collision. Cars affected include the 2013–14 model year Leaf, Altima, Pathfinder and Sentra, as well as the 2013 NV200, 2013 JX35, 2014 QX60 and the 2014 Q50. Recall documents say that due to the sensitivity of the OCS software calibration, the system may not sense a passenger. That combined with high-engine vibration at idle when the seat is empty and then becomes occupied, or unusual occupant seating postures, can cause the system to fail. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> crashes during this time, the airbag won't deploy. Nissan will notify owners, and dealerships will fix the OCS software free of charge.|$|E
5000|$|BBC television's Top Gear ran a short {{segment on}} the Hellcat, in their Season 9 Episode 4 show. Presenter James May commented that he doubted <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> drag {{coefficient}} would be low enough ("slippery enough") {{to reach the}} claimed top speed. In addition, the prototype's weight is also prohibitive of it reaching the claimed top speed.|$|R
5000|$|Major entries {{that are}} {{registered}} as WRC teams {{but not as}} manufacturers must take part in at least seven events - including at least one outside Europe - with a one or two-car team. These teams are eligible to score manufacturers' points <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> entered meet <b>the</b> homologation of those cars that are entered by teams registered as manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|It {{became obvious}} {{at this stage}} {{that the only way}} to pursue <b>the</b> {{construction}} of <b>cars</b> was <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> left Italy fully assembled and running. In cooperation with an Italian bank, Credito Italiano, Intermeccanica found a distributor in Genser Forman of New Jersey, and finally production and sales reached the 100 to 120 cars per year level. These cars were Ford V8 powered, with Ford running gear.|$|R
25|$|On March 2, 2002 Louisville Mayor David L. Armstrong fired Police Chief Gene Sherrard due to {{a banquet}} honoring {{officers}} for exceptional valor. Two officers being honored for facing immediate danger were controversial as to what constituted immediate danger to these officers. The suspect {{in the case of}} these two officers, Desmond Rudolph, had left the house the officers went to through the back door and went to a stolen vehicle. Rudolph, who was unarmed, attempted to drive off, but there are conflicting statements as to <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was operable or not. The view of the policemen involved was that the car was operable and, believing they may be struck by the vehicle, constituted a danger to their lives, while the opposing view is that the policemen did not follow proper police procedure by failing to secure the rear exit and that the car was inoperable and did not pose any danger to the officers. Rudolph was shot by the two officers 22 times and Rudolph died from his wounds. After the firing of the chief of police, many Louisville policemen marched in front of Louisville City Hall to protest the firing of Sherrard and demanded the resignation of Mayor Armstrong.|$|E

500|$|VOSES uses miniature, {{all-weather}} audio speakers {{that are}} placed on the hybrid's wheel wells and emit specific sounds based on the direction the car is moving {{in order to minimize}} noise pollution and to maximize acoustic information for pedestrians. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is moving forward, the sounds are only projected in the forward direction; and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is turning left or right, the sound changes on the left or right appropriately. The company argues that chirps, beeps and alarms are more distracting than useful, and that the best sounds for alerting pedestrians are carlike, such as [...] "the soft purr of an engine or the slow roll of tires across pavement." [...] One of the EVA's external sound systems was designed specifically for the Toyota Prius.|$|E
25|$|Autorack {{and flat}} car length quickly grew to 87 feet (26.52m) and then 89 feet (27.13m) to {{increase}} their loading capacity even further. This made them {{about as long as}} the average railroad passenger <b>car</b> of <b>the</b> time; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were much longer, they wouldn't be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better.|$|R
50|$|In Slovakia a {{scrappage}} {{scheme was}} introduced {{that allows for}} €2,000 (originally €2,500) <b>if</b> <b>the</b> old <b>car</b> was older than 10 years and <b>the</b> new <b>car</b> was below €25,000.|$|R

500|$|The first radar (instead of {{previous}} lidar) sensor on a Lexus sedan allowed the new Dynamic RADAR Cruise Control {{to work in}} any weather conditions. The millimeter-wave radar technology also enabled the first Pre-Collision System (PCS) on a Lexus sedan (with partial autonomous braking only on the Japanese market Toyota Celsior version). A [...] "low-speed tracking mode" [...] was added in 2004. The low-speed tracking mode was a second mode that would warn the driver <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> ahead stopped and provide braking; it could stop the car but then deactivated.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, the car {{is equally}} likely to be behind {{any of the three}} doors: the odds on door 1, door 2, and door 3 are [...] This remains the case after the player has chosen door 1, by independence. According to Bayes' rule, the {{posterior}} odds on the location of the car, given that the host opens door 3, are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the Bayes factor or likelihood, which is, by definition, the probability of the new piece of information (host opens door 3) under each of the hypotheses considered (location of the car). Now, since the player initially chose door 1, the chance that the host opens door 3 is 50% <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is behind door 1, 100% <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is behind door 2, 0% <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is behind door 3.
