25|$|Many North American {{hardcore}} punk fans {{adopted a}} dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. The clothing style was {{a reflection of}} hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the hypocrisy of American culture. It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, <b>holey</b> T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots. The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|<b>Holey</b> {{dollar is}} the name given to coins used in {{the early history of}} two British settlements: Prince Edward Island (now part of Canada) and New South Wales (now part of Australia). The middle was punched out of Spanish dollars, {{creating}} two parts: a small coin, known as a [...] "dump" [...] in Australia, and a [...] "holey dollar". [...] This coin {{was one of the first}} coins struck in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{shipment}} of currency were strict instructions {{to prevent the}} newly arrived coinage from leaving the country, so after consultation with the Judge Advocate and other officials, Governor Macquarie had a convicted forger named William Henshall cut the centres out of the coins and counter stamp them, thus making them useless outside the colony. The central plug (known as a dump) was valued at 15 pence (i.e., 1 shilling, 3 pence, or 1s 3d), and was restruck with a new design (a crown on the obverse, the denomination on the reverse), whilst the <b>holey</b> dollar received an overstamp around the hole ("New South Wales 1813" [...] on the obverse, [...] "Five Shillings" [...] on the reverse). This distinguished the coins as belonging to the colony of New South Wales, creating the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in NSW. The combined nominal value in NSW of the <b>holey</b> dollar and the dump was 6s 3d, or 25 {{percent more than the}} value of a Spanish dollar; this made it unprofitable to export the coins from the colony.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project to}} convert the 40,000 Spanish coins took over a year to complete. Of the 40,000 Spanish dollars imported, 39,910 <b>holey</b> dollars and 39,910 dumps were made, with the balance assumed to have been spoiled during the {{conversion}} process. On 1 July 1813 Governor Macquarie issued a proclamation [...] "that the said Silver Money shall be a legal Tender" [...] and that set their value. The converted coins went into circulation in 1814.|$|E

He also wears a hoodie over his jumper as of series nine, over his T-shirt all being worn under his coat.

2500|$|Macquarie is {{credited}} with producing the first official currency specifically for circulation in Australia. Foreign coins were common {{in the early years}} of the New South Wales colony but much of this coin left the colony as a result of trade with visiting merchant ships. To secure a reliable supply of coins, in 1812 Macquarie purchased 40,000 Spanish dollar coins and had a convicted forger named William Henshall cut the centres out of the coins and counter stamp them to distinguish them as belonging to the colony of New South Wales and prevent them being useful elsewhere. The central plug (known as a [...] "dump") was valued at 15 pence and the rim (known as a <b>holey</b> dollar) became a five-shilling piece. The new currency was proclaimed in the Sydney Gazette of 10 July 1813, with offences of forgery, utterance or exportation of the new currency being punishable by seven years in the Newcastle coal mines.|$|E

[...] Without much hope I {{returned}} to my lodgings, changed my clothes, donned my silk hat, took my one pair of gloves, drew its silk case over my <b>holey</b> umbrella; and so equipped for fight with Fate made my way to Aldersgate Street. For {{a quarter of an hour}} or so, being too soon, I walked up and down the pavement outside the house, gazing at the second-floor windows, behind which, so the door-plate had informed me, were the offices of Lott & Co. I could not recall their advertisement, nor my reply to it. The firm was evidently not in a very flourishing condition. I wondered idly what salary they would offer. For a moment I dreamt of a Cheeryble Brother asking me kindly if I thought I could do with thirty shillings a week as a beginning; but the next I recalled my usual fate, and considered whether it was even worth while to climb the stairs, go through what to me was a painful ordeal, merely to be impressed again with the sense of my own worthlessness.|$|E

While working in a fast food restaurant he gets the idea {{to write a novel}} of historical fiction based {{in the small town of}} <b>Holey,</b> Minnesota. Feeb's novel revolves around the conflict between two citizens of <b>Holey</b> in the early 1900s, as well as a giant rodent from which the novel gets its name. However, when he tries to sell the novel to a publisher, he is told that he doesn't look right to be the author of an action novel. Feeb then enlists the help of local actor Jack Ryback to pretend he wrote the book and attempt to sell it. Jack sells the novel easily, but tells the publisher that it is a non-fiction book, instead of a novel. Jack and Pontius then work with the citizens of <b>Holey</b> to attempt to cover up the book's fictional nature. During their many visits to <b>Holey,</b> Ponty becomes friendly with the town's female mayor. As Feeb's Death Rat grows in popularity, the cover-up becomes harder and harder to maintain, as the rock star [...] "King Leo" [...] adopts the book as the scripture of a new religion, and sets up a revival in <b>Holey.</b> Meanwhile, a rival Minnesotan author is trying desperately to discredit Jack and [...] "his" [...] book.|$|E
5000|$|The first coinage {{issued by}} the colony took place in 1813, and was {{effected}} by punching the middle out of Spanish dollars. This process created two parts: a small coin, which was called the dump, and a ring, which was called a <b>holey</b> dollar. One <b>holey</b> dollar was worth five shillings (a quarter of one pound sterling), and one dump was worth one shilling and three pence (or one quarter of a <b>holey</b> dollar). This was done {{in order to keep}} the coins in New South Wales, as they would be valueless elsewhere. From 1817, when the first bank, the Bank of New South Wales, was established, private banks issued paper money denominated in pounds. Acceptance of private bank notes was not made compulsory by legal tender laws but they were widely used and accepted.|$|E
