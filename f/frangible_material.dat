5000|$|Ammunition for the 90 mm rifle {{was issued}} in {{complete}} fixed cartridges. The term [...] "fixed" [...] {{means that the}} projectile and the cartridge case are crimped together. This ensures correct alignment of the projectile and the cartridge case. It also permits faster loading because the projectile and the cartridge case are loaded as one unit. The rear end of the cartridge case is made of <b>frangible</b> <b>material</b> that is completely destroyed when fired. The projectiles used are pre-engraved with a rifling band, that is, the rotating bands are cut to engage the rifled bore both to trap gases and to spin-stabilize the projectile.|$|E
50|$|The FAA's design {{criteria}} for new airports designate Runway Safety Areas (RSA), {{to increase the}} margin of safety if an overrun occurs, and to provide additional access room for response vehicles. A United States federal law required that the length of RSA in airports was to be 1000 ft {{by the end of}} 2015, in a response to a runway overrun into a highway at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. At airports built before these standards were put into effect, the FAA has funded the installation of EMAS at the ends of the main runways. The minimum recommended overall length of an EMAS installation is 600 ft, of which at least 400 ft is to consist of the <b>frangible</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{material}} {{is said to}} be frangible if through deformation it tends to break up into fragments, rather than deforming elastically and retaining its cohesion as a single object. Common biscuits or crackers are examples of <b>frangible</b> <b>materials,</b> while fresh bread, which deforms elastically, is not frangible.|$|R

Through studying the physical and mechanical process of microstructure varity, we can introduce some kind averaging method to find the material’s macroscopic property. It has not been studied as yet that we study entrainment composite body’s damage trough introducing continous field variable of every exponent tensor from macrophenomenology angle. This paper regards entrainment multiphase composite body as the micropolar medium of introducing inner structure. It provides analytic formula to describe equivalent modus of entrainment multiphase composite body damage, through the stress in micropolar theory of elasticity, couple-stresses tensor and Helmhoetz degrees of freedom density. ...|$|R
