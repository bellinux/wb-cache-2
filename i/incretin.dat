We determined the role of GLUT 2, GLP- 1 or GIP receptors in glucose-induced <b>incretins</b> secretion, in the corresponding knockout mice. GLP- 1 secretion was reduced in all mutant mice, while GIP secretion did not require GLUT 2. Intestinal GLP- 1 content was reduced only in GIP and GLUT 2 receptors knockout mice suggesting that this impairment could contribute to the phenotype.

40|$|GLP- 1 and GIP are <b>incretins</b> {{known to}} affect beta-cell {{function}} and turnover. However, {{information on the}} direct actions of these hormones on human islet cells is limited. We tested the effects of acute (45 min) or prolonged (2 days) exposure to GLP- 1 or GIP, alone or in combination, on the function and some molecular features of human islets isolated from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic multiorgan donors. Acutely, both GLP- 1 and, more markedly so, GIP, significantly potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin release, with no apparent synergic action. Some of these effects were observed with type 2 diabetic islets as well. Following prolonged exposure to the <b>incretins,</b> improved insulin secretion was observed, and transcription of insulin, PDX- 1 and Bcl- 2 was increased in both non-diabetic and diabetic islets, with the combination of GLP- 1 and GIP showing more significant effects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Incretins</b> are hormones {{produced}} by the intestine and can stimulate the secretion of insulin, helping to diminish the post-prandial glycemia. The administration of an emulsion of palm oil can help in {{the maintenance of the}} weight, and can increase circulating <b>incretins</b> levels. Glutamine increases the concentration of <b>incretins</b> in diabetic people. Both can help in metabolic syndrome. AIM: To analyze the effects of ingestion of palm oil and glutamine in glycemia and in <b>incretins</b> in patients with diabetes submitted to surgical duodenojejunal exclusion with ileal interposition without gastrectomy. METHODS: Eleven diabetic type 2 patients were included and were operated. They were called to laboratory follow-up without eating anything between eight and 12 hours. They had there blood collected after the stimulus of the palm oil and glutamine taken in different days. For the hormonal doses were used ELISA kits. RESULTS: The glycemia showed a meaningful fall between the fast and two hours after the stimulus of the palm oil (p= 0, 018). With the glutamine the GLP- 1 showed an increase between the fast and one hour (p= 0, 32), the PYY showed an important increase between the fast and one hour after the stimulus (p= 0, 06), the glycemia showed a meaningful fall after two hours of the administration of the stimulus (p= 0, 03).

40|$|Abstract: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{is a major}} {{metabolic disorder}} currently affecting over 200 million people worldwide. Approximately 90 % of all diabetic patients suffer from Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). The world's economy coughs out billions of dollars annually to diagnose, treat and manage patients with diabetes. It {{has been shown that}} the naturally occurring gut hormones <b>incretins,</b> glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) can preserve the morphology and function of pancreatic beta cell. In addition, GIP and GLP- 1 act on insulin receptors to facilitate insulin-receptor binding, resulting in optimal glucose metabolism. This review examines the medicinal chemistry and roles of <b>incretins,</b> specifically, GLP- 1 and drugs which can mimic its actions and prevent its enzymatic degradation. The review discussed GLP- 1 agonists such as exenatide, liraglutide, taspoglutide and albiglutide. The paper also identified and reviewed a number of inhibitors, which can block dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP- 4), the enzyme responsible for the rapid degradation of GLP- 1. These DPP- 4 inhibitors include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and many others which are still in the experimental phase.

40|$|Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) stimulate insulin secretion. They {{are both}} {{released}} after meal ingestion, {{and therefore they}} might cooperate in their actions. However, {{whether there is a}} cooperative action of the two <b>incretins</b> is not known. This study therefore investigated the effects on insulin secretion and glucose disappearance of GLP- 1 and GIP when given together with intravenous glucose both alone and in combination in mice. Four different doses were used (0. 003, 0. 03, 0. 3 and 3. 0 nmol/kg), which ranged from subthreshold to maximal doses to stimulate first-phase insulin secretion as evident from initial dose–response studies. It was found that at 0. 03 nmol/kg and higher doses, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was augmented by both <b>incretins.</b> When they were given in combination, no further increase was observed, indicating no synergistic effect. Also, glucose disappearance rate was increased by 0. 03 and 3. 0 nmol/kg of the two <b>incretins,</b> both when they were given alone and in combination with, again, no synergy. Finally, glucose effectiveness (an index of noninsulin-mediated processes) was enhanced by the two <b>incretins,</b> in particular GIP. We also found that insulin-dependent and insulin-independent mechanisms contributed 38 % and 62 %, respectively, to glucose tolerance after glucose alone; with GIP, the contribution by noninsulin-dependent processes was remarkably dominant and with GLP- 1, insulin-dependent processes were prevailing. In conclusion, GIP and GLP- 1 stimulate insulin secretion and glucose effectiveness in mice with no synergistic action, but with a dissociated contributory effector on glucose disposal: with GLP- 1 being more active on insulin-dependent processes and GIP more active on noninsulin-dependent processes...|$|R
