According to the firm, Keef {{was supposed to}} perform at the IndigO2 Arena in London on December 29, 2012 but never showed. Neither Keef nor his label has given any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> {{as to why he}} missed the date. He ignored the lawsuit and the court sided with Team Major, ordering Keef to pay $230,019 to Team Major by default.|$|E

The {{exhibition}} {{attempted to}} elucidate {{the extent that}} artists and high culture drew on and from popular culture. Although universally panned {{at the time as}} the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. The exhibition is remembered today as a benchmark of the conflict between late modernism and postmodernism.|$|E
500|$|To {{accommodate}} the video production, {{the equivalent of}} a television studio control room—costing US$3.5million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used fivebroadcast camera systems, 12Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12directors, 19video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends on some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E

As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E

30|$|The article rejects ontological and {{epistemological}} {{accounts of}} knowledge production {{in favour of}} a socio-cultural approach that sees a community of academics and professionals, {{such as those in}} science or in architecture and urbanism, as an interpretative community of shared values and beliefs.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for designing planar multimode wideband bandpass filters with good selectivity.

Depending on electric field distribution and equivalent circuit model, {{the characteristics of the}} filter are analyzed. To verify the proposed method, two filters are implemented. The measured results exhibit good agreement with the simulation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Current induced in cultured {{cerebellar}} granule cells by {{the bath}} application of kainate (500 microM) {{was measured using}} the conventional patch-clamp technique. Two different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> were observed after the agonist perfusion. Some cells exhibited small inward whole-cell currents: 116 +/- 40 pA (7 cells) at a clamp potential of - 60 mV; in other cells, the agonist induced significantly larger currents: 420 +/- 35 pA (6 cells) at a clamp potential of - 60 mV. The current flowing in the agonist-activated ionic channels was indirectly estimated by processing the fluctuations of whole-cell current {{by means of an}} original parametric method. Mean conductance of the underlying channels was then determined from the single-channel current estimated at different clamp potentials. In the cells exhibiting small inward currents, the mean conductance was equal to 0. 5 +/- 0. 2 pS (7 cells), whereas in the cells with large inward currents it was 3 +/- 0. 4 pS (6 cells). This result gives a coherent explanation <b>of</b> the different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> observed at macroscopic level in the whole-cell current and confirms that kainate-activated channels can exhibit different levels of conductance...|$|R
