Later in the episode Nick also reveals that he lost a science competition and Grissom tells him to let it go.

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the video}} the {{isolated}} and sad men depart with the doors closing on them. As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips. Both are clad in loose-fitting gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous look. They stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The <b>Kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, come back, we still need you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks. Only when she disappears from the carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy, then the music and visuals become comparable.|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school <b>kid,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E

2500|$|Dash X, {{played by}} Jason Marsden, is a {{character}} shrouded in mystery. First introduced in the episode [...] "The Hole in the Head Gang", Dash claims that he woke up in [...] "Weirdsville" [...] without any knowledge to how he got there. Dash has no memory of parents, hometown, past or his real name. Since Dash has no home, he is forced {{to live on the}} streets and eat out of Dumpsters. Dash is commonly referred to as [...] "The <b>Kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Grey Hair". People would later go on to call him the [...] "Sneaky <b>Kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hair" [...] and [...] "The Kid with No Name". On some occasions, Dash would help Marshall and Simon solve some of Eerie's mysteries, most notably by helping them infiltrate the Loyal Order of Corn cult. Dash X gave himself his name in the episode [...] "The Loyal Order of the Corn", as a reference to the mysterious '-' and '+' markings on his hands which were shared by the extra-terrestrial leader of the cult. Dash X wonders if the cult leader, played by Ray Walston is his father, but the leader ruefully and cryptically remarks, [...] "If only it were that simple," [...] before returning to his homeworld.|$|E

The group was signed by Sony Entertainment, but the company's {{ultimate}} goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant's youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway & King Tech and recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight's [...] "Hold Me". Bryant even appeared on Lakers teammate O'Neal's Respect, starting the track [...] "3 X's Dope", though Bryant's name was not listed on the credits.|$|E

6000|$|Molly calmed her doubts. Sables are soothing. Proud as a queen {{she went}} {{forth in the}} streets at the Kid's side. In all that region of low-lying streets Russian sables had never been seen before. The word sped, and doors and windows blossomed with heads eager to see the swell furs Kid Brady had given his girl. All down the street there were [...] "Oh's" [...] and [...] "Ah's" [...] and the {{reported}} fabulous sum paid for the sables was passed from lip to lip, increasing as it went. At her right elbow sauntered the <b>Kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> air of princes. Work had not diminished his love of pomp and show and his passion for the costly and genuine. On a corner they saw a group of the Stovepipe Gang loafing, immaculate. They raised their hats to the Kid's girl and went on with their calm, unaccented palaver.|$|E
