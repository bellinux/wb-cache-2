5|$|The <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> of the United States is {{the hostess}} of the White House. The {{position}} is traditionally filled by {{the wife of}} the President of the United States, but, on occasion, the title has been applied to women who were not presidents’ wives, such as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when {{the wife of the}} president was unable to fulfill the duties of the <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> herself. The <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> is not an elected position; it carries no official duties and receives no salary. Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the president. Traditionally, the <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> does not hold outside employment while occupying the office. She has her own staff, including the White House Social Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Press Secretary, the Chief Floral Designer, and the Executive Chef. The Office of the <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President.|$|E
40|$|By {{analyzing}} the initiatives and involvements of <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> {{through the lens}} of political party affiliation, this study provides a unique way to understand the manner and extent to which each political party leveraged the <b>first</b> <b>lady’s</b> office and each woman’s impact and legacy. This study explores the political relationship shared between each presidential couple as deemed important by the administration and press. Ultimately, the study’s content analysis indicates that there is a relationship between party affiliation, initiative selection and influence exertion. While Republican <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> pursue initiatives that more closely align with the president’s domestic social policy priorities, Democratic <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> are more systematically integrated into the traditional political sphere. Republican <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> are most frequently associated with education and Democratic <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> with health. Examining the changing role for the <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> adds great depth to the conversation surrounding the evolution office as it relates to gender dynamics and party affiliation. As the United States elects more females into decision-making roles and holds greater expectations for its presidential spouses, it is critical to understand how not only <b>first</b> <b>ladies,</b> but all elected female officials and women navigate obstacles to influence national political discourse and policies...|$|R

30|$|Even from {{a global}} perspective, the fashion choices of <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> {{have had an}} {{impression}} on the masses. Given this, various works have examined the fashion of <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> (Betts 2011; Sonya 2009; Young 2011). Specifically, Young (2011) explored the role of fashion and style for <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> and women politicians. The author discusses how <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> are often judged by their fashion choices, and how what they choose to wear impacts the views the public has of their husbands (Young 2011). Thus, Young (2011) suggests that unspoken fashion rules that <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> should abide by since the public takes notice. Young goes on to give examples of this notion from the examination of global <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> and women politicians including Mrs. Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher, Queen Rania of Jordan, Jackie Kennedy, and Hillary Clinton among others. However, Young’s (2011) assessment {{is more of a}} visual examination of these public figures, and does not make reference to how these public figures’ examples of dress may influence others.|$|R
