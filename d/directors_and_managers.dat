2500|$|Because {{different}} countries take {{different approaches to}} ensuring occupational safety and health, areas of OSH need and focus also vary between countries and regions. Similar {{to the findings of}} the ENHSPO survey conducted in Australia, the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the UK found {{that there is a need}} to put greater emphasis on work-related illness in the UK. [...] In contrast, in Australia and the US, a major responsibility of the OHS professional is to keep company <b>directors</b> <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> aware of the issues that they face in regards to occupational health and safety principles and legislation. [...] However, in some other areas of Europe, it is precisely this which has been lacking: “Nearly half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date understanding of their health and safety-related duties and responsibilities.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that chances for admission are higher {{for students who are}} prepared to pay the full price, there are indications that this has been even more prevalent {{in the past few years}} given economic uncertainty and rising college costs, particularly at schools without large endowments.

The report suggested that full-pay students tended to have lower high school grades and test scores than other students, compared to other applicants, on average. Two other reports confirmed that public university admissions officers were actively seeking out-of-state and international students since they paid higher rates for tuition. Another report found that one in ten admissions officers had said that their college admitted full-pay students despite their having lower average grades and test scores. Reports vary about whether the financial neediness of applicants impacts admissions chances; one suggested that applicants with strong academic credentials or talents are more likely to get financial aid, but that depending on the college, [...] "borderline admits" [...] needing money were most vulnerable; a second report was that [...] "colleges like rich students". George Washington University, despite claiming to have need blind admissions, was more likely to waitlist financially needy applicants, according to one report. One view was that financial aid depends on how a specific student compares with other students: ...|$|E
