5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{replaced}} midfielder Jiří Jarošík with striker Eiður Guðjohnsen at {{the start}} of the second half, and started the second half in the same manner that they finished the first, with Liverpool withholding the pressure on their penalty area. Cole passed the ball over the Liverpool defence to Drogba in the 54th minute, but defender Jamie Carragher was able to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> clear the ball. The ball was played back into the penalty area and met by Guðjohnsen, whose header was saved by Dudek, the ball fell to Gallas and Dudek again saved the subsequent shot. Midfielder Antonio Núñez replaced Harry Kewell in the 56th minute. Against the run of play, Liverpool had an attack in the 64th minute. A counter-attack results in a Dietmar Hamann shot, but it was saved by Čech. Liverpool made another substitution following the attack as Igor Bišćan replaced an injured Djimi Traoré. Chelsea continued to push forward and were close to a goal in the 71st minute, but Riise cleared a Gallas after the ball was played to him by Makélélé. Both teams made substitutions in the following minutes. Striker Milan Baroš replaced Morientes for Liverpool while Chelsea substituted Gallas for striker Mateja Kežman.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic {{shipping}} terminal was in Colon, Panama. The Pacific terminal was in Panama City. The 48-mile {{double track}} railway {{was the first}} transcontinental railway and an engineering marvel of the era.

When the transcontinental Union Pacific Railroad to San Francisco was completed on May 10, 1869, this more direct route was then used for shipping and travel connecting to Portland by boat.|$|E

NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated, [...] "We'll have to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> talk to the teams and look at the speeds from the last two days of testing.

The film project, which became known as <b>Get</b> <b>Back</b> <b>and</b> eventually Let It Be, formed part of the band's proposed return to live performance {{for the first time since}} their 1966 North American tour. Harrison said that after coming back from Woodstock in December 1968, he was [...] "quite optimistic" [...] about the new project, especially the plan to return to a more ensemble-based approach to playing. The rehearsals were filmed and recorded by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg with the intention that the documentary film would accompany a televised concert by the Beatles.|$|E

Byrne said {{his goal was to}} [...] "turn the clock back ... <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception". He made a number of changes during his tenure: The Thing was temporarily replaced {{as a member of the}} quartet by the She-Hulk, while the Thing had adventures in his own comic (#1 - 22 also written by Byrne), and the Thing's longtime girlfriend Alicia Masters left him for his teammate the Human Torch; the Invisible Girl was developed into the most powerful member with her heightened control of her refined powers and the self-confident assertiveness to use it epitomized by her name change to the Invisible Woman; and headquarters the Baxter Building was destroyed and replaced with Four Freedoms Plaza. Byrne has cited multiple reasons for leaving the series, including [...] "internal office politics" [...] and that [...] "it simply started to get old".|$|E

[...] On Pet Sounds and other work, author Jim Fussili observed a repeated nuance of Wilson's to [...] "wander far from the logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work". Tony Asher remembers: [...] "one of the things that I really enjoyed, was that first time I'd hear him hunting for a chord change and I'd think 'Man, he's just gone right off the edge because he's not ever gonna get close. He's way out there in some area that's just—he'll never <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> <b>And</b> if he's successful, gets out of there, people are going to say, I've lost my tone center, don't know where the hell I am and stuff.

2500|$|It can {{be shown}} that any {{algebraic}} integer that is also a rational number must actually be an integer, hence the name [...] "algebraic integer". Again using abstract algebra, specifically {{the notion of a}} finitely generated module, it {{can be shown}} that the sum and the product of any two algebraic integers is still an algebraic integer, it follows that the algebraic integers in F form a ring denoted O'F called the ring of integers of F. It is a subring of (that is, a ring contained in) F. A field contains no zero divisors and this property is inherited by any subring. Therefore, the ring of integers of F is an integral domain. The field F is the field of fractions of the integral domain O'F. [...] This way one can <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth between the algebraic number field F and its ring of integers O'F. Rings of algebraic integers have three distinctive properties: firstly, O'F is an integral domain that is integrally closed in its field of fractions F. Secondly, O'F is a Noetherian ring. Finally, every nonzero prime ideal of O'F is maximal or, equivalently, the Krull dimension of this ring is one. An abstract commutative ring with these three properties is called a Dedekind ring (or Dedekind domain), in honor of Richard Dedekind, who undertook a deep study of rings of algebraic integers.|$|E

2500|$|The same year, John Byrne {{began his}} six-year run writing and {{illustrating}} Fantastic Four, sparking a [...] "second golden age" [...] {{for the title}} but also attempting to [...] "turn the clock back [...] <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> see fresh {{what it was that}} made the book great at its inception." [...] Doctor Doom made his first appearance under Byrne's tenure with issue #236. Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom's disfigurement was more a figment of Victor's vain personality, Byrne decided that Doom's face was truly ravaged: only Doom's own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet. Byrne emphasized other aspects of Doom's personality; despite his ruthless nature, Victor von Doom is a man of honor. Returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doctor Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from Doctor Strange in order to oversee his land's reconstruction. Despite a tempestuous temper, Doom occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from Mephisto and treats Kristoff Vernard like his own son. Byrne gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring: Byrne introduced the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Victor with a small scar that was exaggerated into a more disfiguring accident by Doom's own arrogance—by donning his newly forged face mask before it had fully cooled, he caused massive irreparable damage.|$|E
2500|$|At dawn, the 6th Company of RIR 122 {{arrived in}} Quadrangle Support, after a fraught night march. Leutnant Köstlin had {{received}} the order in the afternoon of 9 July and took the company back to Martinpuich for supplies and ammunition but the field kitchen draught horse bolted from a shell with the field kitchen. Ammunition took until after midnight to issue and then the company moved forward, with two machine-guns. Two guides had been sent back from the III Battalion {{but it was so}} dark that Köstlin went cross-country on a compass bearing. The column lost cohesion in the dark between Martinpuich and Bazentin {{because of the number of}} shell-holes and trenches to traverse and the halts to form up took too much time. Köstlin formed the company into columns of sections after passing over the second position and the advance quickened. The ground was under shellfire and casualties began to increase.
