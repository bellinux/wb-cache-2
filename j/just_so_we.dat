500|$|... "Sweet Love" [...] {{is a slow}} jam R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} electronic music; it lasts for a duration of three minutes and 19 seconds long. The instrumentation is provided by a keyboard, synthesizers, percussion and a drum machine. According to Nadeska Alexis of MTVs Rapfix, Brown sings in a falsetto tone, which she found to be reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush described the ballad as [...] "very Michael Jackson and neo-Bieber". JusMusic of Singersroom noted that [...] "Sweet Love" [...] is inspired by Silk's [...] "Freak Me" [...] (1993). Chris Brown – Sweet Love|work=Singersroom|date=2012-05-25|accessdate=2012-05-27}} Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun musically compared the song to Prince. The theme of [...] "Sweet Love" [...] revolves around sex. It contains lyrics about Brown asking his lover to take off her clothes {{so that they can}} have sex. During the chorus, he harmonizes: [...] "Oooh baby let's get naked / <b>Just</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> can make sweet love / All these sensations got me going crazy for you / Inside on top of you / Grinding inside and out of you / Baby I know what to do / Let's just take our clothes off".|$|E
500|$|The {{liner notes}} for Revelation {{state that the}} album art is [...] "an artistic interpretation" [...] of Salvation Mountain, a {{monument}} created by Leonard Knight as [...] "a public art project designed to send the message that 'God Loves Everyone'". Located in Calipatria, California, the location is entered in the Congressional Record as a 'national treasure'. The album cover is of Salvation Mountain with the song titles of Revelation composed on it, [...] "to send [...] own message of God's love to the world". According to bassist Tai Anderson, the idea to use Salvation Mountain as the album cover art was lead vocalist Mac Powell's idea. Anderson recalled that Third Day received critiques about the album art, with people claiming it ripped off the cover art of Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief (2003). Although he admits there [...] "are similarities" [...] between the two, Anderson denied that the band based the design off of [...] "outside sources". Anderson also said he was {{more concerned with the}} album art's coloring, as [...] "red-skewed" [...] album covers had been used by bands such as U2 and Green Day. In hindsight, Anderson felt that the band [...] "probably would have used one of the other images from the packaging on the cover <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't have to read the one star critiques on iTunes which never reference the music, just the album cover".|$|E

2500|$|Addressing {{the issue}} of {{remaining}} faithful to the two previous games whilst still introducing new elements to the franchise, MumboJumbo president Mark Dochtermann explained the developers {{did not intend to}} reinvent the series' basic gameplay, although they were keen to try out new things; [...] "There's a lot left to explore in the Myth franchise even before we go in a somewhat different route. Although, we are taking a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now." [...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated [...] "We intend to pay respect to Myth and its fans. We don't care to change the whole appeal of the game <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> can call it ours." [...] With this in mind, MumboJumbo hired three members of Soulblighters modding community to work on the game. Although initially hired to work on technical aspects, they became invaluable to MumboJumbo in terms of writing the storyline. Executive producer Mike Donges explains, [...] "they're our Myth lore experts, so if we try to put in something new, they have the ability to [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Writer Ştefan Agopian, who met Cioculescu {{during the}} 1980s, {{recalled}} that the literary community was puzzled {{as to why}} Cioculescu himself was not arrested, and claims that his rescue was largely owed to Paul Georgescu, who secretly harbored anti-Stalinist convictions of his own. Agopian cites Georgescu saying: [...] "He had done nothing wrong, so he was still usable, we {{could not afford to}} lose a guy like Cioculescu <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> could have our prisons filled. Cioculescu's luck was that the idiots upstairs listened to me." [...] However, according to the account of comparatist Matei Călinescu, who was then working for Gazeta Literară, Georgescu took personal part in censoring Cioculescu's work: in one such case, Cioculescu had written a political text on the occasion of May Day, believing that the Party was requesting a sign of loyalty from him, but unaware that authors with few political credentials were in fact barred from publishing around national holidays. According to this account, Georgescu was infuriated by his subordinate's action, and made a point of disavowing it publicly—an attitude linked by him with Georgescu's dogmatism. According to Agopian, this was nevertheless a subtle attempt to prevent Cioculescu from discrediting his name by associating it with communist messages.|$|E

Guralnick adds [...] "The Colonel joked that they looked like a bunch of old men, but the Memphis Mafia had become almost as well known around town as Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack" [...] and that Elvis and his guys were all [...] "living on speed and tranqs." [...] For Joe Esposito, [...] "it was a party like you wouldn't believe. Go to a different show every night, then pick up a bunch of women afterwards, go party the next night. Go to the lounges, see Fats Domino, Della Reese, Jackie Wilson, the Four Aces, the Dominoes – all the old acts.

2500|$|Matei Călinescu places {{stress on}} the {{relationship}} between the enforcement of PCR directives at Gazeta Literară and Georgescu's promotion of modernism and young poetry. He notes how, in 1958, the editor published a [...] "Zhdanovist" [...] essay targeting directly Ion Barbu, which included negative comments on sampled poems, and how it was later revealed to him that this was a covert method to make Barbu's poetry somehow available to the general public. This, Călinescu writes, was a [...] "cynical lesson" [...] in how to use ideological texts as [...] "a verbal package with a minimal content." [...] In reference to Cioculescu and his potential arrest, Agopian cited Georgescu saying: [...] "He had done nothing wrong, so he was still usable, we could not afford to lose a guy like Cioculescu <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> could have our prisons filled. Cioculescu's luck was that the idiots upstairs listened to me." [...] The same commentator contends that, by not allowing his fellow critic to publish politicized texts, Georgescu may have intended to save his reputation. In addition, Călinescu cites Georgescu's reference to those writers who gave in to pressures and accepted to contribute propaganda as having paid their [...] "entrance to the circus", as well as his belief that [...] "keeping a private diary today [...] is the equivalent of a denunciation." [...] In Radu Cosaşu's account, although a [...] "dogmatic Marxist", his older friend saw no link between the ideology and Socialist Realist guidelines, and never pressured him to write [...] "for the party", while Dimisianu discusses Georgescu's [...] "generosity" [...] and [...] "warmth" [...] in respect to his friends and disciples.|$|E
2500|$|... "Attack" [...] {{had been}} around for a while and the band was unconvinced of its worth. The song proved to be {{somewhat}} problematic, and was nearly excluded from the album. During an interview in 2005, Jared Leto said [...] "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it – I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand – I was playing it everywhere." [...] When Jared tried performing the song {{with the rest of the}} band, something was wrong. [...] "On acoustic it was great; but when we played it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." [...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was just talking. I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it." [...] Jared told Josh Abraham that night [...] "This song deserves to be a hit <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> can tell this story." ...|$|E

The receivers were in the trade, and kept capital shops - establishments of the first respectability - one of 'em at the West End, one down in Westminster. After a lot of watching and inquiry, and this and that among ourselves, we found that the job was managed, and the purchases of the stolen goods made, at a little public-house near Smithfield, down by Saint Bartholomew's; where the Warehouse Porters, who were the thieves, took 'em for that purpose, don't you see? and made appointments to meet the people that went between themselves and the receivers.

Not to speak of our jackets--used for blankets--being soaking wet, the spray, coming down the hatchways, kept the planks of the berth-deck itself constantly wet; whereas, had we been permitted our hammocks, we might have swung dry over all this deluge. But we endeavoured to make ourselves as warm and comfortable as possible, chiefly by close stowing, so as to generate a little steam, {{in the absence of any}} fire-side warmth.

6000|$|But {{after having}} wished {{that his country}} should be <b>just</b> <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> proceed to {{discover}} {{that it is in}} fact not a bit different. Between these phases of our consciousness he is an unfailing messenger. The reader will remember how often he has accompanied with pictures the text of some amiable paper describing a pastoral region--Warwickshire or Surrey. Devonshire or the Thames. He will remember his exquisite designs for certain of Wordsworth's sonnets. A sonnet of Wordsworth is a difficult thing to illustrate, but Mr. Parsons' ripe taste has shown him the way. Then there are lovely morsels from his hand associated with the drawings of his friend Mr. Abbey--head-pieces, tailpieces, vignettes, charming combinations of flower and foliage, decorative clusters of all sorts of pleasant rural emblems. If he has an inexhaustible feeling for the country in general, his love of the myriad English flowers is perhaps the fondest part of it. He draws them with a rare perfection, and always--little definite, delicate, tremulous things as they are--with a certain nobleness. This latter quality, indeed. I am prone to find in all his work, and I should insist on it still more if I might refer to his important paintings. So composite are the parts of which any distinguished talent is made up that we have to feel our way as we enumerate them; and yet that very ambiguity is a challenge to analysis and to characterization. This [...] "nobleness" [...] on Mr. Parsons' part is the element of style--something large and manly, expressive of the total character of his facts. His landscape is the landscape of the male vision, and yet his touch is full of sentiment, of curiosity and endearment. These things, and others besides, make him the most interesting, the most living, of the new workers in his line. And what shall I say of the other things besides? How can I take precautions enough to say that among the new workers, deeply English as he is, there is comparatively something French in his manner? Many people will like him because they see in him--or they think they do--a certain happy mean. Will they not fancy they catch him taking the middle way between the unsociable French étude and the old-fashioned English [...] "picture"? If one of these extremes is a desert, the other, no doubt, is an oasis still more vain. I have a recollection of productions of Mr. Alfred Parsons' which might have come from a Frenchman who was in love with English river-sides. I call to mind no studies--if he has made any--of French scenery; but if I did they would doubtless appear English enough. It is the fashion among sundry to maintain that the English landscape is of no use for la peinture sérieuse, that it is wanting in technical accent and is in general too storytelling, too self-conscious and dramatic also too lumpish and stodgy, of a green--d'un vert bête--which, when reproduced, looks like that of the chromo. Certain it is that there are many hands which are not to be trusted with it, and taste and integrity have been known to go down before it. But Alfred Parsons may be pointed to as one who has made the luxuriant and lovable things of his own country almost as [...] "serious" [...] as those familiar objects--the pasture and the poplar--which, even when infinitely repeated by the great school across the Channel, strike us as but meagre morsels of France.|$|E
