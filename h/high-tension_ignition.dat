5000|$|The {{engine was}} made of two {{separately}} cast two-cylinder units which were common with the two-cylinder 10 hp and six-cylinder 30 hp types sharing their bore of 4 in and stroke of 5 in. It is water-cooled and of 4118 cc capacity with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves Early cars had a <b>high-tension</b> <b>ignition</b> system using pre-charged accumulators, a trembler and a coil ignition system; on later cars this was supplemented by a magneto {{which could be used}} as an alternative. As the lighting supplied uses oil for the side and tail and acetylene for the headlights, there is no other drain on the accumulators, which need to be recharged between outings. The power output is [...] at 1000 rpm. The engine speed is controlled by a governor that can be over-ridden by the pedal-controlled accelerator. A three-speed gearbox was fitted at first, later changed to four-speed with the introduction of the Light 20 and subsequently fitted to all cars, connected to the engine via a short shaft and a leather-lined cone clutch was used. On the four-speed type, third gear is direct and fourth speed an overdrive ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Three-cylinder engines {{were quite}} {{popular in the}} early years of motoring, and one was part of the ambitious {{programme}} of the new company. The layout produced less vibration than 2-cylinder engines and was much simpler to make than a six-cylinder with its long crankshaft. However, Royce was making his range of engines using a standard two-cylinder block, putting two together for the four-cylinder and three for the six. The three-cylinder engine did not fit in with this production, having each of its cylinders cast separately, and this is thought to be the reason why only six were made. The engine, which has a bore of 4 in and stroke of 5 in, is water-cooled and of 3000 cc capacity with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. A <b>high-tension</b> <b>ignition</b> system using pre-charged accumulators, a trembler and a coil provides the ignition spark.

5000|$|The {{engine is}} made of three {{separately}} cast two-cylinder units which are common with the two-cylinder 10 hp and four-cylinder 20 hp types sharing their bore of 4 in and stroke of 5 in. It is water-cooled and of 6000 cc capacity with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. The crankshaft is carried in seven main bearings {{in an attempt to}} keep vibration to a minimum, a problem on many early six-cylinder engines, as the dynamics of the layout were still not fully understood. Flywheels are fitted at both the fronty and rear of the crankshaft. After some early cars suffered broken crankshafts Royce modified the front flywheel to incorporate a damper which overcame the problem. [...] A single Royce carburetter is fitted.

50|$|The company {{responded to}} the {{increasing}} number of low-priced cars—including the $700 Ford Model N, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout at $650, the $485 Brush Runabout, the Black at $375, the $500 Western Gale Model A, and the bargain-basement Success an amazingly low $250—by introducing the Model 25, their cheapest four yet. At $695, this five-seat tourer had <b>high-tension</b> magneto <b>ignition,</b> electric horn and (optional) electric starter and headlights, and an innovative shock absorber to protect the radiator.|$|R
50|$|The first {{successful}} motor boat {{was designed by}} the Priestman Brothers in Hull, England, {{under the direction of}} William Dent Priestman. The company began trials of their first motorboat in 1888. The engine was powered with kerosene and used an innovative <b>high-tension</b> (high voltage) <b>ignition</b> system. The company was the first to begin large scale production of the motor boat, and by 1890, Priestman's boats were successfully being used for towing goods along canals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{was originally}} single-speed. In 1909, a two-speed transmission was offered, then three-speed in 1914 with the 748 cc engine. It {{had a single}} speed shaft drive turned by a bevel gear. The rider started the engine by pedaling bicycle style pedals with a chain drive and sprockets to the rear wheels. The 1905 model had a <b>high-tension</b> Bosch magneto <b>ignition,</b> a spray carburetor, and a rear coaster brake operated by the pedals. It had a 5:1 reduction ratio to 26" [...] wheels.|$|R
