Standard methods of inelastic scattering measurements, i. e., a constant-energy transfer hω with either fixed final neutron energy Ef = 14. 7 meV or fixed incoming neutron energy Ei = 30. 59 meV, and a constant momentum transfer Q with fixed incoming neutron energy Ei = 30. 59 meV, were applied to measure the low-energy magnetic excitations. For fixed Ef measurement, a 5 -cm thick PG filter was set between the sample and the analyzer to eliminate λ/n harmonics.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, several carbon {{supported}} PtSn and PtSnRu catalysts were prepared with different atomic ratios and tested in direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) operated at lower temperature (T= 90 degreesC). XRD and TEM {{results indicate that}} all of these catalysts consist of uniform nano-sized particles of narrow distribution and the average particle sizes are always less than 3. 0 nm. As the content of Sn increases, the Pt lattice parameter becomes longer. Single direct ethanol fuel cell tests were used to evaluate the performance of carbon supported PtSn catalysts for ethanol electro-oxidation. It was found that the addition of Sn can enhance the activity towards ethanol electro-oxidation. It is also found that a single DEFC of Pt/Sn atomic ratioless than or equal to 2, "Pt <b>1</b> <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C, Pt 3 Sn 2 /C, and Pt 2 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C" shows better performance than those with Pt 3 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C and Pt 4 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C. But even adopting the least active PtSn catalyst, Pt 4 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C, the DEFC also exhibits higher performance than that with the commercial Pt 1 Ru 1 /C, which is dominatingly used in PEMFC at present as anode catalyst for both methanol electro-oxidation and CO-tolerance. At 90 degreesC, the DEFC exhibits the best performance when Pt 2 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C is adopted as anode catalysts. This distinct difference in DEFC performance between the catalysts examined here is attributed to the so-called bifunctional mechanism and to the electronic interaction between Pt and Sn. It is thought that -OHads, Surface Pt active sites and the ohmic effect of PtSn/C catalyst determines the electro-oxidation activity of PtSn catalysts with different Pt/Sn ratios.

40|$|We discuss {{here the}} ion {{transport}} mechanism of a gel electrolyte comprising lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) solvated by two plastic crystalline solvents, one a solid (succinonitrile, abbreviated as SN) and another (a room temperature ionic liquid) (1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium bis-(trifluorotuethanesulfonyl) imide, (abbreviated as IL) confined inside a linear network of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The {{concentration of the}} IL component (x) determines the physical properties of the unconfined electrolyte (i. e., <b>SN</b> <b>1</b> -xILx-LiTFSI) and when confined inside the polymer network (GPE-x). The extent of disorder in the <b>SN</b> <b>1</b> -xILx-LiTFSI and the GPE-x electrolytes is enhanced compared to both the bare SN-LiTFSI and IL-LiTFSI electrolytes. The enhanced disordering in the plastic phase alters both the local ion environment and viscosity. These changes strongly influence the ion mobility and nature of predominant charge carriers and thus the ion conduction mechanism in <b>SN</b> <b>1</b> -xILx-LiTFSI and GPE-x. The proposed <b>SN</b> <b>1</b> -xILx-LiTFSI and the GPE-x electrolytes show predominantly anion conduction (t(TFSI) approximate to 0. 5); however, lithium transference number (t(Li) approximate to 0. 2) is nearly an order higher than the IL-LiTFSI (t(Li) approximate to 0. 02 - 0. 06). The ionic conductivity of <b>SN</b> <b>1</b> -xILx-LiTFSI is much higher (especially for x approximate to 0. 1) compared to both SN-LiTFSI and IL-LiTFSI. The ionic conductivity of the GPE-x, though lower than the unconfined <b>SN</b> <b>1</b> -xILx-LiTFSI electrolytes, is still very promising, displaying values of similar to 10 (- 3) Omega(-) 1 cm(- 1). The GPE-x displayed compliable mechanical properties, stable Li-electrode/electrolyte interface, low rate of At corrosion, and stable cyclability over several tens of charge-discharge cycles when assembled in a separator-free Li-graphite cell. The promising electrochemical performance further justifies the simple strategy of employing, mixed, physical state plasticizers to tune the physical properties of polymer electrolytes requisite for application in rechargeable batteries...|$|R
40|$|Volume {{expansion}} and elastic softening of Sn anode on lithiation result in mechanical degradation and pulverization of Sn, affecting the overall performance of Li-Sn batteries. It can however {{be overcome by}} using exotic high pressure quenched phase as prelithiated reagent. Moreover, {{it is known that}} under pressure many unusual stoichiometric which are basically impossible at ambient pressure, can be synthesized, that may even survive the decompression from high to ambient pressure. We therefore have performed a comprehensive study using evolutionary algorithm and density functional theory based simulations to understand the lithiation of Sn anode at pressure ranging from 1 atm to 20 GPa. The ground state structures of all stable and metastable Li-Sn compounds have been identified at ambient and moderate pressures and their properties have been studied to understand the role of pressure in re-defining the reaction mechanism during charging-discharging process in Li-ion batteries. Besides the well-known existing Li-Sn compounds, our studies reveal the existence of five unreported stoichiometries (Li 8 Sn 3, Li 3 <b>Sn</b> <b>1,</b> Li 4 <b>Sn</b> <b>1,</b> Li 5 <b>Sn</b> <b>1,</b> and Li 7 <b>Sn</b> <b>1)</b> and their associated crystal structures at ambient and high pressure.

Most importantly, our calculations show reduction in volume expansion by ~ 50 % at 20 GPa, and reveal that the application of pressure can reduce the chance of Li plating and improve the mechanical properties, which are desired to make the battery safer and its life longer...|$|R

Membrane-bound constructs containing either or both SNARE motifs were also singly labeled with donor or acceptor fluorophores. Interaction of probes with other SNAREs was monitored by the formation of SDS-resistant complexes and by changes in FRET measured in vitro using spectroscopy and in the plasma membrane of living cells using TIRF microscopy. The probes formed the predicted SDS-resistant SNARE complexes. FRET measurements revealed that syntaxin induced a close association of the N-termini of <b>SN</b> <b>1</b> and <b>SN</b> 2. This association required that the SNARE motifs reside in the same molecule. Unexpectedly, the syntaxin-induced FRET was prevented by VAMP. Both full-length SNAP 25 constructs and the combination of its separated, membrane-bound constituent chains supported secretion in permeabilized chromaffin cells that had been allowed to rundown. However, only full-length SNAP 25 constructs enabled robust secretion from intact cells or permeabilized cells before rundown.

40|$|In {{the present}} work several Pt-based anode {{catalysts}} supported on carbon XC- 72 R were prepared {{with a novel}} method and characterized by means of XRD, TEM and XPS analysis. It was found that all these catalysts are consisted of uniform nanosized particles with sharp distribution and Pt lattice parameter decreases {{with the addition of}} Ru or Pd and increases with the addition of Sn or W. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and single direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) tests jointly showed that the presence of Sn, Ru and W enhances the activity of Pt towards ethanol electro-oxidation in the following order:Pt <b>1</b> <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C > Pt 1 Ru 1 /C > Pt 1 W 1 /C > Pt 1 Pd 1 /C > Pt/C. Moreover, Pt 1 Ru 1 /C further modified by W and Mo showed improved ethanol electro-oxidation activity, but its DEFC performance was found to be inferior to that measured for Pt <b>1</b> <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C. Under this respect, several PtSn/C catalysts with different Pt/Sn atomic ratio were also identically prepared and characterized and their direct ethanol fuel cell performances were evaluated. It was found that the single direct ethanol fuel cell having Pt <b>1</b> <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C or Pt 3 Sn 2 /C or Pt 2 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C as anode catalyst showed better performances than those with Pt 3 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C or Pt 4 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C. It was also found that the latter two cells exhibited higher performances than the single cell using Pt 1 Ru 1 /C, which is exclusively used in PEMFC as anode catalyst for both methanol electro-oxidation and CO-tolerance. This distinct difference in DEFC performance between the catalysts examined here would be attributed to the so-called bifunctional mechanism and to the electronic interaction between Pt and additives. It is thought that an amount of-OHads, an amount of surface Pt active sites and the conductivity effect of PtSn/C catalysts would determine the activity of PtSn/C with different Pt/Sn ratios. At lower temperature values or at low current density regions where the electro-oxidation of ethanol is considered not so fast and its chemisorption is not the rate-determining step, the Pt 3 Sn 2 /C seems to be more suitable for the direct ethanol fuel cell. At 75 °C, the single ethanol fuel cell with Pt 3 Sn 2 /C as anode catalyst showed a comparable performance to that with Pt 2 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C, but at higher temperature of 90 °C, the latter presented much better performance. It is thought from a practical point of view that Pt 2 <b>Sn</b> <b>1</b> /C, supplying sufficient -OHads and having adequate active Pt sites and acceptable ohmic effect, could be the appropriate anode catalyst for DEFC. © 2003 Elsevier B.
