5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's {{foreign policy is}} the country's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States. The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|A {{nationalist}} {{movement in the}} Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many <b>issues,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> questions of federalism and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.|$|E
5|$|As the {{microscopic}} world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as John Ray worked {{to incorporate the}} flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology (natural theology). Debate over another flood, the Noachian, catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists {{until the end of}} the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> age of the earth and extinction.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> degree to which the firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E
5|$|On the whole, Cecil and Dudley were {{in concord}} about {{policies}} while disagreeing fundamentally about some <b>issues,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Queen's marriage and {{some areas of}} foreign policy. Cecil favoured the suit of Francois, Duke of Anjou, in 1578–1581 for Elizabeth's hand, while Leicester was among its strongest opponents, even contemplating exile in letters to Burghley. The Anjou courtship, {{at the end of}} which Leicester and several dozen noblemen and gentlemen escorted the French prince to Antwerp, also touched the question of English intervention in the Netherlands to help the rebellious provinces. This debate stretched over a decade until 1585, with the Earl of Leicester as the foremost interventionist. Burghley was more cautious of military engagement while in a dilemma over his Protestant predilections.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{academic}} science, it is {{rare for}} individuals to consider themselves a herpetologist first and foremost.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore to what extent {{secondary}} policy issues are influenced by electoral incentives. We develop a political agency model in which a politician decides on both a frontline policy <b>issue,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> level of public spending, and a secondary policy <b>issue,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> environmental policy. <b>The</b> model shows under which conditions the incumbent finds it worthwhile to manipulate the secondary policy to attract additional votes to his platform. We test the predictions of the model using state-level panel data on Gubernatorial environmental policy choices over the years 1960 - 2000. In contrast to the popular view that choices on secondary policy instruments are largely determined by lobbying, we find strong effects of electoral incentives on environmental policy. ...|$|R

Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend.

5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. <b>Issues</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
