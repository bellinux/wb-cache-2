25|$|At St John's {{the design}} is even more complex, because, {{near the top of}} the upper window, the tower <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> appears to become {{octagonal}} in horizontal section, before the spire is reached. The change to the section is masked by the presence of four large pinnacles which rise from the corners at this point, as if they were sitting on the buttresses but are in line with the tower itself. Behind the pinnacles, once again Blacket has placed an encircling battlement which appears to mark the point where the tower ceases to be tower and becomes spire, or vice versa. Harmonious with the four crocketed pinnacles, and on the same level, are little dormer windows.|$|E
500|$|If {{the player}} harvests {{more than one}} Little Sister, Jack turns on the Little Sisters to harvest their ADAM. Tenenbaum sadly narrates what occurred, condemning Jack and his actions. A {{submarine}} then comes across {{the wreckage of the}} plane, and finds <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers who attack the crew and take control of it. The submarine is revealed to be carrying nuclear missiles, with Tenenbaum claiming that Jack has now [...] "stolen the terrible secrets of the world": the more Little Sisters are harvested, the harsher and more furious Tenenbaum's narrative becomes.|$|E
2500|$|According to Roy Mottahedeh, {{author of}} The Mantle of the Prophet, [...] "thousands of Iranians who had felt neutral and had until now {{thought that the}} {{struggle}} was only between the shah and supporters of religiously conservative mullahs felt that the government might put their own lives on the block to save <b>itself.</b> <b>Suddenly,</b> for hundreds of thousands, the movement was their own business." ...|$|E
6000|$|A pointsman's back {{straightened}} <b>itself</b> upright <b>suddenly</b> {{against a}} tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something automatic {{so that the}} wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention? ...|$|R
60|$|Rose looked {{round in}} terror, as Lomaque spoke his last words--looked round, {{and saw her}} husband recoil before the {{signature}} on the arrest order, as if the guillotine <b>itself</b> had <b>suddenly</b> arisen before him. Her brother felt her shrinking back in his arms, and trembled {{for the preservation of}} her self-control if the terror and suspense of the arrest lasted any longer.|$|R
6000|$|The tone {{in which}} those words were spoken was an insult in <b>itself.</b> Mercy <b>suddenly</b> lifted her head; the angry answer was on her lips. She checked it, and {{submitted}} in silence. [...] "I will be worthy of Julian Gray's confidence in me," [...] she thought, as she stood patiently by the chair. [...] "I will bear anything from the woman whom I have wronged." ...|$|R
60|$|The dame de compagnie {{dropped her}} arms, {{and the cat}} found <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> on the ground. It {{remained}} quite still after alighting, one hind leg stretched backwards. Miss Haldin was extremely indignant {{on behalf of the}} lady companion.|$|E
60|$|She {{was gone}} {{before he could}} stop her. He {{turned back to his}} desk and seated himself. The sight of his last {{finished}} sentence presented <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> in a new light. There was a suggestiveness about it which was almost poignant. He took up his pen and began to write rapidly.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're easy {{words to}} say, Barrow, but how am I going to amuse, entertain, divert a mind that finds <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{assaulted}} and overwhelmed by disasters {{of a sort}} not dreamed of and not provided for? No--no, the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings: Let us talk of death and funerals." ...|$|E
60|$|For a time I feared {{they would}} {{obliterate}} civilization <b>itself.</b> Then <b>suddenly</b> Blinks decided that Jinks' Cossacks were no good, not properly trained. He converted {{himself on the}} spot into a Prussian Field Marshal, declared himself organised to a pitch of organisation of which Jinks could form no idea, and swept Jinks' army off the earth, without using any men at all, by sheer organisation.|$|R
50|$|The springs <b>itself</b> opened <b>suddenly</b> in 1861 on the Talmadge family farm, and {{was used}} until 1889 for irrigation. A wooden conduit was {{constructed}} in 1889 and from 1889 to 1916, before being depleted, the spring supplied all of the water for nearby Elmhurst (including supplying the source water for the Elmhurst Spring Water Company) and Oak Brook (including supplying the source water for the Mammoth Spring Ice Company).|$|R
2500|$|... "I feel {{incapable}} of describing what I saw. I looked fixedly at the sun, which seemed pale {{and did not}} hurt my eyes. [...] Looking like a ball of snow, revolving on <b>itself,</b> it <b>suddenly</b> seemed to come down in a zig-zag, menacing the earth. Terrified, I ran and hid myself among the people, who were weeping and expecting {{the end of the}} world at any moment." [...] —Rev. Joaquim Lourenço, describing his boyhood experience in Alburitel, eighteen kilometers from Fátima.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the side}} of the man with which Arnold wholly sympathized showed <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly.</b> At the mention of his wife's name an {{expression}} partly fatuous, partly beatific, transformed his homely features. He was looking at her picture which stood always opposite him. He had the air of an adoring devotee before some sacred shrine.|$|E
60|$|One by {{one they}} leaped, one after the other, {{propelled}} away by the repulsive material of the suits. A few minutes later they were being hauled aboard the pursuit ship. As the last {{one of them was}} lifted through the port, their own ship pointed <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> upward and shot off at tremendous speed. It disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Heyst {{went into}} the bedroom, {{and shut the door}} after him with a bang. Coming from the light, he could not see a thing in there at first; yet he {{received}} the impression of the girl getting up from the floor. On the less opaque darkness of the shutter-hole, her head detached <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly,</b> very faint, a mere hint of a round, dark shape without a face.|$|E
60|$|She {{made one}} or two {{attempts}} to restore the knot, but soon found it quite beyond her skill. It had disentangled <b>itself</b> so <b>suddenly</b> {{that she could not}} in the least remember how the strings had been doubled into one another; and when she tried to recollect the shape and appearance of the knot, it seemed to have gone entirely out of her mind. Nothing was to be done, therefore, but to let the box remain as it was until Epimetheus should come in.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the name}} passed her lips the flush on Miss Silvester's face died away, and a deadly paleness took its place. She made a {{movement}} to leave the summer-house--checked herself abruptly--and laid {{one hand on the}} back of a rustic seat at her side. A gentleman behind her, looking at the hand, saw it clench <b>itself</b> so <b>suddenly</b> and so fiercely that the glove on it split. The gentleman made a mental memorandum, and registered Miss Silvester in his private books as [...] "the devil's own temper." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{entirely new}} was {{full-blown}} love to Elfride, that she trembled {{as much from}} the novelty of the emotion as from the emotion <b>itself.</b> Then she <b>suddenly</b> withdrew herself and stood upright, vexed that she had submitted unresistingly even to his momentary pressure. She resolved to consider this demonstration as premature.|$|R
60|$|Between them, as {{they sat}} side by side, there {{inserted}} <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> the pinkly remorseful face of Freddie Rooke. Freddie, having skirmished warily in the aisle until {{it was clear that}} Lady Underhill's attention was engaged elsewhere, had occupied a seat in the row behind which had been left vacant temporarily by an owner who liked refreshment between the acts. Freddie was feeling deeply ashamed of himself. He felt that he had perpetrated a bloomer of no slight magnitude.|$|E
6000|$|JANUARY 2d, 1759: FRANKFURT-ON-MAYN, THOUGH IT IS A REICHSTADT, FINDS <b>ITSELF</b> <b>SUDDENLY</b> BECOME FRENCH. [...] "Prince de Soubise {{lies between}} Mayn and Lahn, with his 25,000; beautifully safe and convenient,--though ill {{off for a}} place-of-arms in those parts. Opulent Frankfurt, on his right; how handy would that be, were not Reichs Law so express! Marburg, Giessen are {{outposts}} of his; on which side one of Ferdinand's people, Prince von Ysenburg, watches him with an 8 or 10,000, capable of mischief in that quarter.|$|E
60|$|He bade his guest, {{with his}} {{daughter}} and their attendants, to ride on, saying that he himself would follow and overtake them. But the steward detained him longer than he had expected, so that, although the company proceeded leisurely towards the city, Pico had {{not come up with}} them when they reached the river. In the narrow street beyond the bridge the little escort found <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> confronted and thrust aside by a magnificent cavalcade of ladies and gallants, hawk on wrist and followed by a pack of hounds.|$|E
50|$|At Ropar the Sutlej river {{suddenly}} turns sharply {{away from}} the Ghaggar. The narrow Ghaggar river bed <b>itself</b> is becoming <b>suddenly</b> wider at the conjunction where the Sutlej should have met the Ghaggar river. There also is a major paleochannel between the turning point of the Sutlej and where the Ghaggar river bed widens.|$|R
5000|$|Beauregard had {{defined a}} number of deceptively simple operations, which, when applied to a whole number, at first {{resulted}} in fractions. But if the same steps were repeated often enough, the eventual outcome was once again a whole number. Or, as Beauregard cheerfully observed: “In all numbers lurks a wild number, guaranteed to emerge when you provoke them long enough” [...] 0 yielded the wild number 11, 1 brought forth 67, 2 <b>itself,</b> 3 <b>suddenly</b> manifested <b>itself</b> as 4769, 4, surprisingly, brought forth 67 again. Beauregard himself had found fifty different wild numbers. The money prize was now awarded to whoever found a new one.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a faint shout, {{apparently}} {{somewhere in}} the vicinity of the line, brought out a perfectly clear response, followed by the audible murmur of voices, which it was impossible to localize. Yet the whole field was so devoid of any suggestion of human life or motion that it seemed rather as if the vast expanse <b>itself</b> had become <b>suddenly</b> articulate and intelligible.|$|R
60|$|He {{was waiting}} {{secretly}} in the house--waiting for her last moments; listening for her last words; watching his opportunity, perhaps, {{to enter the}} room again, and openly profane it by his presence! I placed myself by the door, resolved, if he approached, to thrust him back, at any hazard, from the bedside. How long I remained absorbed in watching before {{the darkness of the}} inner room, I know not--but some time must have elapsed before the silence around me forced <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> on my attention. I turned towards Margaret; and, in an instant, all previous thoughts were suspended in my mind, by the sight that now met my eyes.|$|E
60|$|Inspector MacDonald {{had sent}} up {{a note to}} the effect that he would wait upon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining room. She entered now, a tall and {{beautiful}} woman of thirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very different from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured. It is true that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured a great shock; but her manner was composed, and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon {{the edge of the table}} was as steady as my own. Her sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression. That questioning gaze transformed <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> into abrupt speech.|$|E
60|$|They {{crossed the}} Yukon to its west bank, shot {{down-stream}} with easy stroke, {{and at the}} end of forty minutes swung in close to the left around the tail of an island. Forty Mile spread <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> before them. Both men straightened their backs and gazed at the sight. They gazed long and carefully, drifting with the current, in their faces an expression of mingled surprise and consternation slowly gathering. Not a thread of smoke was rising from the hundreds of log-cabins. There was no sound of axes biting sharply into wood, of hammering and sawing. Neither dogs nor men loitered before the big store. No steamboats lay at the bank, no canoes, nor scows, nor poling-boats. The river was as bare of craft as the town was of life.|$|E
6000|$|The list of its {{friends is}} daily swelled by the {{additions}} of fifties, of hundreds, and of thousands. The cause <b>itself</b> seems <b>suddenly</b> {{transformed from a}} cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active, and powerful chieftain, going forth [...] "conquering and to conquer." [...] The citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temple and his altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made, are daily desecrated and deserted. The triumph of the conqueror's fame is sounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land, and calling millions to his standard at a blast.|$|R
60|$|Not {{until the}} {{following}} morning did we {{come to understand the}} full extent of the calamity which had overtaken the Black Kendah. I think I have said that their crops this year were magnificent and just ripening to harvest. From our roof on previous days we could see a great area of them stretching to the edge of the forest. When the sun rose that morning this area had vanished, and the ground was covered with a carpet of green pulp. Also the forest <b>itself</b> appeared <b>suddenly</b> to have experienced the full effects of a northern winter. Not a leaf was left upon the trees, which stood their pointing their naked boughs to heaven.|$|R
6000|$|... "First of all," [...] he said, [...] "house-breaking." [...] And {{he forced}} the blade into the crevice {{of the wood}} and broke away a huge splinter, leaving a gap and glimpse of the dark window-pane inside. The room within was entirely unlighted, so {{that for the first}} few seconds the window seemed a dead and opaque surface, as dark as a strip of slate. Then came a {{realization}} which, though in a sense gradual, made us step back and catch our breath. Two large dim human eyes were so close to us that the window <b>itself</b> seemed <b>suddenly</b> to be a mask. A pale human face was pressed against the glass within, and with increased distinctness, with the increase of the opening came the words: ...|$|R
60|$|Like a flash {{he seemed}} to pass from his own, almost the hermit's way of looking out upon life from the old-fashioned {{standpoint}} of his inherent puritanism, into a closer sympathy with those others, {{the men and women}} of the world into which he had so lately entered, the men and women who had welcomed him so warm-heartedly, human beings all of them, who lived and loved with glad hearts and much kindliness. The contrast was absurd, the story <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> so reasonable. No other woman on tour would have kept Sylvanus Power waiting for three years. Only Elizabeth could have done that. It was such a human little problem. People didn't live in the clouds. He wasn't fit for the clouds himself. Nevertheless, when he tried to speak his throat was hard and dry, and at the second attempt he began instead to laugh. She gripped his arm.|$|E
60|$|And first, much {{is to be}} done {{by right}} {{modification}} of accessory circumstances, so as to express miraculous power exercised over them by the spiritual creature. There is a beautiful instance of this in John Bellini's picture of St. Jerome at Venice. The saint sits upon a rock, his grand form defined against clear green open sky; he is reading, a noble tree springs out of a cleft in the rock, bends <b>itself</b> <b>suddenly</b> back to form a rest for the volume, then shoots up into the sky. There is something very beautiful in this obedient ministry of the lower creature; but be it observed that the sweet feeling of the whole depends upon the service being such as is consistent with its nature. It is not animated, it does not listen to the saint, nor bend itself towards him as if in affection, this would have been mere fancy, illegitimate and effectless. But the simple bend of the trunk to receive the book is miraculous subjection of {{the true nature of the}} tree; it is therefore imaginative, and very touching.|$|E
60|$|Granet {{walked slowly}} up the avenue, {{his hands behind}} him, a frown upon his forehead. Perhaps, after all, things {{were not to be}} so easy for him. On either side he could see the {{stretches}} of sand, and here and there the long creeks of salt water. As he came nearer to the house, the smell of the sea grew stronger, the tops of the trees were more bowed than ever, sand was blown everywhere across the hopeless flower-beds. The house <b>itself,</b> <b>suddenly</b> revealed, was a grim weather-beaten structure, built on the very edge of a queer, barrow-like tongue of land which ended with the house itself. The sea was breaking on the few yards of beach sheer below the windows. To his right was a walled garden, some lawns and greenhouses; to the left, stables, a garage, and two or three labourer's cottages. At the front door another soldier was stationed doing sentry duty. He stood on one side, however, and allowed Granet to ring the bell.|$|E
60|$|Stephen Masterton {{may have}} thought it so when, a week later, he found himself issuing from a rocky gorge into a rough, badly paved, hilly street, {{which seemed to be}} only a {{continuation}} of the mountain road <b>itself.</b> It broadened <b>suddenly</b> into a square or plaza, flanked on each side by an irregular row of yellowing adobe houses, with the inevitable verandaed tienda in each corner, and the solitary, galleried fonda, with a half-Moorish archway leading into an inner patio or courtyard in the center.|$|R
60|$|And now, as if {{the last}} burden had been rolled from its heart, and {{assurance}} were at length perfect, Paris bursts forth anew into extreme jubilee. The Basoche rejoices aloud, that the foe of Parlements is fallen; Nobility, Gentry, Commonalty have rejoiced; and rejoice. Nay now, with new emphasis, Rascality <b>itself,</b> starting <b>suddenly</b> from its dim depths, will arise and do it,--for down even thither the new Political Evangel, in some rude version or other, has penetrated. It is Monday, the 14th of September 1788: Rascality assembles anew, in great force, in the Place Dauphine; lets off petards, fires blunderbusses, to an incredible extent, without interval, for eighteen hours. There is again a wicker Figure, 'Mannequin of osier:' the centre of endless howlings. Also Necker's Portrait snatched, or purchased, from some Printshop, is borne processionally, aloft on a perch, with huzzas;--an example to be remembered.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Miller (1891-1980) American writer {{wrote about}} Poros in [...] "The Colossus of Maroussi", {{considered}} his best book writes about Poros ..."I don't know which affected me more deeply-the {{story of the}} lemon groves just opposite us or the sight of Poros <b>itself</b> when <b>suddenly</b> I realized we were sailing through the streets. If there is one dream which I like above all others it is that of sailing on land. Coming into Poros gives the illusion of the deep dream. Suddenly the land converges on all sides and the boat is squeezed into a narrow strait from {{which there is no}} egress. The men and women of Poros are hanging out of the windows just above your head. You pull in right under their frosty nostrils, as though for a shave and a haircut en route. The loungers on the quay are walking with the same speed as the boat. They can walk faster than the boat if they choose to quicken their pace." ...|$|R
