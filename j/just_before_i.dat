500|$|Silver himself {{commented that}} {{inspiration}} came from multiple sources: [...] "I'm inspired by nature and {{by some of}} the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life. I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E
500|$|Anna Rosmus {{received}} the 1994 award, {{in honor of}} work related to her research on the Nazi past of her hometown in Bavaria. [...] Rosmus researched anti-Semitism, and opposed neo-Nazis and the extreme right in Germany. [...] She also located and published artwork of Jews that had once lived {{in her hometown of}} Passau, Germany. [...] As a result of her work, Rosmus endured threats against her life. In a 1996 Yom HaShoah ceremony, Rosmus recounted threats she faced after conducting her research: [...] "Once-friendly neighbors threatened me openly - on the telephone, in person, in letters ... They threatened to kill me and kidnap my children. Some even attacked me physically, a room where I was to speak in Munich was bombed <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was to be there, and several times I was sued. Nobody ever claimed I had said anything false or made mistakes. They just claimed all this would damage their reputations." [...] Rosmus was profiled on 60 Minutes, and her story was the subject of the 1990 West German drama film, The Nasty Girl. Rosmus was presented with the Conscience-in-Media Award in a special ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> go to bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sinéad O'Connor {{reviewed}} the album on 28 November 2007 on The Dave Fanning Show and praised it as: [...] "the record I {{always come back}} to again and again...It is far superior to Astral Weeks and I love Astral Weeks. [...] This is the definitive Van album with the definitive Van song, [...] "Who Was That Masked Man"...It's the most obvious album he's ever done about Ireland...Veedon Fleece {{is the only thing}} I listen to <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> go on stage." [...] When asked in an interview in 2005 to name something she considered [...] "a mind-altering work of art", she answered: [...] "Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Seattle group (originally the Seattle Artificial Kidney Center, {{later the}} Northwest Kidney Centers) started their home program in July 1964. [...] It was {{inspired}} by the fifteen-year-old daughter of a collaborator's friend, who went into renal failure due to lupus erythematosus, and had been denied access to dialysis by their patient selection committee. [...] Dialysis treatment at home was the only alternative and managed to extend her life another four years. Dr. Chris Blagg has stated that the first training predated the establishment of the home program: the [...] "first home patient wasn’t part of our program at all, he was president of a big Indian corporation, lived in Madras, and he came to Seattle <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> came in ’63. He came in early ’63, again, with his doctor and his wife and Dr. Scribner trained them to do dialysis at home and they went home to Madras." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when I looked in the mirror <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me." ...|$|E

2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
