5|$|From the {{structural}} perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B12H122−), decaborane (B10H14), and the carboranes such as C2B10H12. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.|$|E

5|$|After {{months of}} not {{working on the}} poem, Eliot began to feel {{compelled}} to finish it; {{it was not until}} August 1942, however, that he started working on it again. In total, there were five drafts. The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly. Little Gidding was intended to conclude the Four Quartets series, summarising Eliot's views expressed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> of poems.|$|E

Elephant, horse, bull, {{tortoise}} and lion are the animals depicted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series,</b> along with snake and fish. Symbols of inanimate objects include arched hills, battle axe, conch, river, swastika, trident, flowers and the sun.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, with the West Indies not the force they had been, and England on the rise.

5|$|By mintages, the {{key dates}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been {{extensively}} melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate. For example, although {{more than nine}} million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, {{second only to the}} 1953-S in price in that grade.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{percent of}} Nescopeck Creek's {{watershed}} {{is made up}} of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the soil series. Other areas where this soil series occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor for plant growth <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> is the rocky surface and the depth of the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil series occurs in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil series mostly is near Nescopeck Creek's source, but there is some of it in the central Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|In 1956–57, The New Adventures of Charlie Chan, {{starring}} J. Carrol Naish in {{the title}} role, were made independently for TV syndication in 39 episodes, by Television Programs of America.

5|$|Samarium (and its sesquioxide) are {{paramagnetic}} at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2µB, are the 3rd lowest {{among the}} lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14.8K. Individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules. They {{can also be}} doped between the C60 molecules in the fullerene solid, rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors – the most recent class of high-temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56K, which is the highest value achieved so far <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{books in}} the Goosebumps Gold series {{appeared}} on illustrator Tim Jacobus's website and marketing sites but were never released. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>series,</b> Stine intended to write a sequel to The Haunted Mask II (The Haunted Mask Lives!), and a sequel to Welcome to Dead House (Happy Holidays from Dead House). It {{was one of the}} two book series by Stine that was planned to be released in 2000 (the other was The Nightmare Room).|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} soil {{series in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series. Twenty-six percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed contains this soil series. Much soil and bedrock <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> has been removed during mining operations. This soil series occurs {{in the southern part}} of the Nescopeck Creek watershed, near tributaries such as Black Creek and Stony Creek. The soils in this soil series are highly permeable.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{titles are}} {{accompanied}} by a mock-Elizabethan arrangement of Howard Goodall's Blackadder theme played on a recorder and an electric guitar, and feature a black snake slithering about on a marble table. The snake, noncompliant to the wishes of its handler, is eventually removed and replaced with something related to the episode title, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> is always a single noun. The opening ominous string crescendo and imagery are a parody of the opening credits of the 1976 BBC television adaptation of Robert Graves' I, Claudius.|$|E
5|$|While {{the series}} retells the real {{events of the}} gangland war, several {{inaccuracies}} have been pointed out and some deliberate fictionalizations have been made. The Purana Taskforce, as presented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series,</b> is not a portrayal of the real taskforce, as laws in Victoria do not allow real police officers, including those who previously served and were not sacked, to be portrayed by actors in the media. As a result, the characters presented are entirely fictional characters vaguely based on the real officers, leading to some major differences such as the series suggesting that a senior officer died due to a heart attack, which never in fact occurred.|$|E

5|$|Ashida rose to {{prominence}} after {{appearing in the}} award-winning television drama Mother, as Reina Michiki, a young child abused by her mother. She won awards such as the Best Supporting Actress at the 14th Nikkan Sports Drama Grand Prix and the Special Award at the 4th Tokyo Drama Awards for her role. At the age of 6, Ashida became the youngest lead actress in a Japanese television drama in the special television drama-cum-movie Sayonara Bokutachi no Youchien in 2011. In the spring drama season, she became the youngest actress in a drama series when she starred in the television drama Marumo no Okite. She co-starred <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> with the then-6 years old actor Fuku Suzuki. The series received a viewership rating of 23.9% for its last episode, and an average rating of 15.48% for its entire run.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>series</b> are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick also edited Oxford Early Christian Studies (from 1990). With {{his brother}} Owen, he edited The Oxford History of the Christian Church (12 vols., 1981–2010).

His final work {{was to have}} been on Photios I of Constantinople, {{research}} for which covered many of his interests, particularly classical learning and Christianity, and ecumenism. Some of his material on the topic was published in East and West. He was also an Editorial Advisor of Dionysius. He died in Oxford on 17 June 2008.|$|E
