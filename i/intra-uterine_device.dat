40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which an <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>device</b> in one horn of the rat uterus prevents implantation in that horn is not known. It {{has been suggested that}} histamine has a role to play in the implantation of the fertilized ovum(Shelesnyak, 1952). Shelesnyak, Kraicer & Zeilmaker (1963) have indicated that on {{the latter part of the}} 3 rd day after successful mating in rats there is an oestrogenic upsurge which triggers off histamine release and this is essential for successful implantation. It has been known for a long time that there is a correlation between the histamine content of a tissue and the mast cell count (Riley & West, 1953). Mast cells have been demonstrated in the uterine tissue of golden hamsters (Harvey, 1964), guinea-pigs (Iversen, 1962), ferrets(Buchanan, 1966) and cows (Likar & Likar, 1964). Changes in the mast cell count at different phases of the oestrous cycle were observed in cows, hamsters and ferrets by the above mentioned workers who found an increase in the mast cell count in the oestrous phase. In view of the possible role of mast cells and histamine in normal implantation in the rat it was thought that a study of the mast cell distribution in the normal rat uterus and also in the uterus with an <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>device</b> in one horn would be worthwhile.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the binding characteristics, content and intracellular distribution of nuclear and cytosolic oestrogen receptors in the uteri of rats bearing a unilateral intrauterine device, fitted 14 [...] 18 days earlier, at four phases of a 5 -day oestrous cycle. The patterns {{of changes in}} wet weight and content of cytosolic and nuclear receptor that normally occur during the oestrous cycle were not altered {{by the presence of}} the device. At all stages of the cycle the intra-uterine-device-containing horn had a greater wet weight and a correspondingly higher content of cytosolic receptor than its contralateral control horn, the cellular concentration of cytosolic receptor being apparently maintained. However, the intra-uterine-device-containing horn had significantly lower cellular concentrations (i. e. per mg of DNA) of nuclear receptor, particularly at late dioestrus and pro-oestrus. Thus the treated horn showed a decreased translocation of receptor in response to increases in circulating oestrogens. Both horns contained equivalent amounts of an activating factor implicated in translocation and measured in vitro by binding of cytosol receptor to oligo(dT) -cellulose. The presence of an <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>device</b> neither altered the dissociation constants (Kd) of the nuclear and cytosolic oestrogen-receptor complexes nor the stability of the nuclear receptor complex in vitro. The decreased translocation cannot thus be directly attributed to changes in the physical properties of the receptor.

40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: Pelvic-abdominal actinomycosis {{is a rare}} chronic condition {{caused by}} an anaerobic, gram-negative rod-shaped commensal bacterium of the Actinomyces species. When Actinomyces becomes pathogenic, it frequently causes a chronic infection with granulomatous abscess formation with pus. Due to diversity in clinical and radiological presentation, actinomycosis can easily be mistaken for several other conditions. Peritonitis without preceding abscess formation caused by Actinomyces species has been described in only few cases before in literature. Case report: We report a case of spontaneous pelvic-abdominal peritonitis with presence of pneumoperitoneum and absence of preceding abscesses due to acute actinomycosis mimicking a perforation of the proximal jejunum in a 42 -year-old female with an <b>intra-uterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> in place.

40|$|The authors report five {{cases of}} lost <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>devices,</b> {{which means that}} the threads were not visible at the {{external}} os of the cervix. This gives them an opportunity to review the literature and to conclude the following: 1. Ultra-sound is the treatment of choice to find the position of the IUD that has been lost, whether is is intra- or extra-uterine. 2. In doubtful cases an antero-posterior and a lateral hysterogram makes it possible to determine the relative position of the IUD to the uterine cavity. Laparoscopy gives useful complementary information. 3. If the IUD is intra-uterine, either totally so or partially, the treatment of choice is to remove it under hysteroscopic control. 4. Where perforation has occurred and the IUD has only entered incompletely into the pelvis, it is possible to pull it out under hysteroscopic control through the vagina if laparoscopy has demonstrated that there are no local adhesions attaching it to neighbouring organs. 5. Where perforation has been complete, laparotomy is preferable to laparoscopy as a technique to recover the lost IUD, in particular when this is a copper one. 6. Perforations occur particularly when the IUDs are inserted post-partum. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
