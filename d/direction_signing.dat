50|$|On 18 February, {{with the}} loan {{transfer}} window opened, Cambridge United midfielder Paul Carden signed for Luton on loan {{until the end}} of the season. Young striker Dan Walker went in the opposite <b>direction,</b> <b>signing</b> for Cambridge on a one-month loan. The same day, Carden made his debut in a 1-1 draw with Newport County. Luton took the lead in the first-half through Willmott, but were pegged back via a last-minute Newport penalty.|$|E
50|$|In June, 2009, Griffin {{had moved}} {{his career in}} another <b>direction,</b> <b>signing</b> up with the Nicaraguan League (ACB) Jaguares De La UAM. In regular season action, Griffin {{averaged}} 18 points and 8 rebounds while shooting 49 percent from the floor, and over 40 percent behind the three point arc. Once the playoff semifinals started where the Jaguares faced defending champs U de M, Griffin averaged 28 points and 8 rebounds while shooting 47 percent {{from the floor and}} over 62 percent from three point land. However, his side lost the playoff series 4-3.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to identify design elements of roundabouts that could be problematic to older drivers with a specific focus on traffic control measures. It introduces a new approach to the evaluation and pre-testing of traffic control features through the use of video footage and animated videos. Focus groups formed {{the first phase of the}} project, and structured interviews the second phase. Materials used in the project presented different alternatives from a driver’s perspective within the road environment rather than using line drawings of signs in isolation. The animated videos were created by digitally manipulating photographs taken at 10 -ft intervals. Specific design elements that were pertinent to the concerns raised by participants included: advance warning signs; lane assignment and advance guide signs; channelization; yield treatment; directional signing; and exit <b>direction</b> <b>signing.</b> The structured interviews focused on the following elements: advance warning signs, roundabout lane assignment signs, directional signs (one-way indication), yield treatments, and exit treatments. The use of video footage and animated video materials were successful in allowing participants to assess th...|$|E
50|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> {{inform about}} places, businesses, routes, choice of lanes, choice of roads and {{distance}} to destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> {{with a yellow}} background (blue on motorways) show geographical destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> with a white background (or white fields on yellow and blue signs) show local destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> with a brown background show destinations of special interest to tourism. Orange backgrounds denote temporary detours.|$|R
50|$|<b>Direction</b> and {{distance}} <b>signs</b> are rectangular with dark green backgrounds and white text. In urban areas, <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> have dark blue backgrounds. The signs are normally written in Korean and English. In March 2010, Korea Expressway Corporation {{introduced a new}} type of <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> for expressways. Currently, Korea Expressway Corporation changes old <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> to new ones on their expressways. This new type of <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> is exit guide based sign and its typeface has changed from Sandol Doropyojipanche (Sandol traffic sign typeface, which can be seen on the distance <b>sign</b> and <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> below) to Hangilche (Hangil typeface).|$|R
5000|$|The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals {{divides the}} direction, position, or {{indication}} <b>sign</b> category into <b>direction</b> <b>signs,</b> which are only those giving distances or directions {{to a given}} location; road identification signs (also known as [...] "reassurance signs"), which repeat the name or number of the road, and place identification signs, which give {{the name of a}} landmark, such as a town, river or border. Unlike the other classes of <b>sign,</b> <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> remain broadly undefined by the convention; the only restrictions given are that <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> must be either a rectangle or an arrow shaped pentagon, and that they may not contain placenames in more than two languages. Additionally, <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> on motorways must be blue or green, while temporary <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> are yellow or orange.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the most significant developments in the area of road (geometric) design practices and standards and related research in the Netherlands in recent years. The paper describes the importance of the Sustainable Road Safety policy in this context. Furthermore, it provides a summary of a number of new initiatives and developments with respect to road and intersection design with a specific focus on related (road safety) research and its role in the development and application of guidelines. Since 1998 the Netherlands has applied the principles of Sustainable Safety in road design and over the years these have been researched and in varying degrees been adopted into geometric design standards and guidelines. In recent years the strategic direction of road safety has shifted from being focussed on predominantly infrastructure to concentrating on regular traffic offenders and vulnerable road users and where technological innovation plays an important role. The newly adopted road safety strategy for 2020 is a testament of this shift. However, road authorities, standards and research organisations continue pursuing the long term vision set out by the Sustainable Safety programme by adapting the road environment and related standards and guidelines to meet the ongoing challenge of further reducing road accidents. To facilitate and support these developments, extensive research programmes have been carried out and these include driving simulator research into the (behavioural) effects of, for example narrow cross-sections, research into safe and credible speeds and research into the effects of road design and layout on road safety. The results of these research programmes are used in the development and/or amendment of road design guidelines and standards. Examples discussed in the paper include the implementation and evaluation of the essential characteristics for the recognition of road infrastructure, the further expansion of 30 and 60 km/h zones and 2 + 1 roads. The paper further elaborates on the following significant and related developments: − Optimising the use of available road space through innovative design and traffic management procedures (e. g. network approach; emergency lane etc.) − the planned new guidelines for national highways − guidelines for signing and marking at road construction zones − the guidelines for essential characteristics for the recognition of road types − experiences related to the use and design of turbo-roundabouts (traffic circles) and subsequently adopted design guidelines − design guidelines for 2 + 1 roads − the Dutch traffic safety handbook − the relationship between road design and (<b>direction)</b> <b>signing</b> and in-car/roadside information systems − Human factor guidelines (the so called Golden Rules). The focal point of Sustainable Safety is that the human and consequently human factors still play an increasingly important role in road design in the Netherlands. The Sustainable Safety programme has been around since 1997 and has had a major impact on infrastructure design {{and the way in which}} the Netherlands approaches road safety. This has resulted in 10 years of re-engineering major parts of the Dutch road network and making a significant contribution to the 300 to 400 fewer road traffic fatalities in 2007 when compared to 1997. This paper will briefly touch on these effects. The paper closes with an overview of other future developments and their possible consequence on road design practices in the Netherlands...|$|E
