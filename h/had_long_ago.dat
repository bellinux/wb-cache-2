5|$|A live-action {{version of}} Aurora {{appears as a}} {{recurring}} character in the fantasy television series Once Upon a Time, portrayed by actress Sarah Bolger. She made a guest appearance in a Sofia the First episode, Holiday in Enchancia called on by the mystical amulet of Avalor to assist young Princess Sofia in finding her missing stepfather, King Roland II. She assured Sofia that she could rely on her animal friends' to help just she <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5|$|Depending on the player's actions, {{the newly}} {{reformed}} Etrurian Army then continues through either the snowy tundras of Ilia and its many mercenary groups on Bern's contract, {{or through the}} Sacae plains where nomad tribes have allied with Bern. Both paths ultimately take the Etrurian Army to Bern's borders, where Roy discovers a shrine housing the Binding Blade, a powerful weapon that rules over the other eight Divine Weapons. Combined with the Fire Emblem, Roy is granted its incredible power and wields the Binding Blade in the final assault on Bern's capital. Zephiel is eventually killed by the Etrurian Army and his Divine Weapon is taken from him, but the war does not end with his death. Before his last battle, Zephiel had sent his remaining forces to gather somewhere in Elibe. The eight Divine Weapons suddenly emit a light that leads the Lycian Army to this location: an ancient temple that <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> been built by the dragons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle {{to save the}} planet, several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs {{enacting}} failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape {{with the help of}} a young council member and a guard. They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers. The portal has carried them to the Ark, the massive structure that serves as a construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian's work. The trio are healed, and Bornstellar meets the Librarian, which brings up conflicting thoughts and feelings, due to his imprint from the Didact. She informs him that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate the Precursors, except this one, who now seeks revenge.|$|E

25|$|Rome had an {{affinity}} {{for the people of}} Campania, who, like themselves, traced their backgrounds to the Etruscans. The Samnite Wars were instigated by the Samnites when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of Capua in Campania. The Italic speakers in Latium <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state. They were responsible for changing Rome from a primarily Etruscan to a primarily Italic state.|$|E
25|$|During the {{planning}} phase, {{virtually no one}} thought that the original site of Jamestown would be suitable, as it was isolated and long-abandoned. There were no local facilities to handle large crowds, and {{it was believed that}} the fort housing the settlement <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> been swallowed by the James River. No rail lines ran near Jamestown. Many Virginia residents thought that Richmond, the state capital, would be chosen as the site of the celebration.|$|E

Patients capable of working were asked to help with various duties, partly because of staff shortages in World War II. Unless considered dangerous, patients were allowed some liberties, such as being allowed to go fishing - an activity that provided patients with leisure time, while also helping the fishing business Truby King <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> established at nearby Karitane.|$|E
25|$|July {{began with}} another {{impotent}} showing from the United offense {{in a place}} where the team <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> become accustomed to losing. Despite repeated jaw-dropping heroics by goalie Hamid, United fell behind in Utah to home team Real Salt Lake on a 52nd-minute goal. United seemed resigned to another road loss at Rio Tinto Stadium until Jeffrey scored a header on a stoppage time corner kick to gain the surprise point. That result, however, seemed a distant memory the next week, when United traveled to the Philadelphia Union, and suffered the team's worst loss to that franchise, a 3-0 drubbing with 2 first-half penalty kick goals and a second yellow-card ejection for Opare. starting in place of captain Boswell, who had been beaten several times in the previous match against RSL.|$|E
25|$|In 579, Pelagius II chose Gregory as his apocrisiarius (ambassador to the {{imperial}} court in Constantinople), a post Gregory would hold until 586. Gregory {{was part of}} the Roman delegation (both lay and clerical) that arrived in Constantinople in 578 to ask the emperor for military aid against the Lombards. With the Byzantine military focused on the East, these entreaties proved unsuccessful; in 584, Pelagius II wrote to Gregory as apocrisiarius, detailing the hardships that Rome was experiencing under the Lombards and asking him to ask Emperor Maurice to send a relief force. Maurice, however, <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> determined to limit his efforts against the Lombards to intrigue and diplomacy, pitting the Franks against them. It soon became obvious to Gregory that the Byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force, given their more immediate difficulties with the Persians in the East and the Avars and Slavs to the North.|$|E

25|$|According to Altekar, {{there is}} no mention of actual sati in the period of Brahmana {{literature}} (c. 1500–700 BCE) and the later Grhyusutras, roughly composed 600–300 BCE on a number of rituals, but sati is not described or mentioned. In fact, what is written about funeral customs, is that the widow is brought back from the funeral pyre, typically by a trusted servant. Altekar thinks it significant that Gautama Buddha, who castigated customs of animal sacrifice, and other customs where pain was inflicted, is entirely silent about burning women alive. Altekar takes these elements as proofs that burning widows alive <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> died out as a practice. Nor do the authors of the Dharmasutras (c. 400 BCE–100 BCE) or Yajnavalkya (c. 100 CE–300 CE) say anything about it being commendable to burn a widow alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Although we have late fourth-century BCE evidence from Greek authors and the Mahabarata for the 'existence' of the custom of sati, Altekar thinks it did not really begin to grow in popularity before 400 CE, by the manner of which it is infrequently mentioned in the Puranas of that time. A very early attested case from 510 CE is that of the wife of Goparaja, who immolated herself with her dead husband, according to the Eran inscription of king Bhanugupta, with another similar case attested from 606 CE. As the custom grew in popularity, Altekar highlights as determined opponents of this aristocratic custom in particular 7th-century poet Bāṇabhaṭṭa, but also 9th-century theologian Medhātithi and 12th-century Devana Bhatta. In Altekar's view, their crusades against the custom were largely unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|Chronopolis divided this entity {{into six}} pieces and created an Elements system.

Thousands of years later, a panther demon attacked a three-year-old Serge. His father took him to find assistance at Marbule, but Serge's boat blew off course due to a raging magnetic storm caused by Schala. Schala, the princess of the Kingdom of Zeal, <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> accidentally fallen to a place known as the Darkness Beyond Time and began merging with Lavos, the chief antagonist of Chrono Trigger.

He also felt that the overarching mythology of the series <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> become too convoluted to make sense, but that the [...] "human pieces of the show still work, and that includes Doggett." [...] Contra Costa Times columnists George Avalos and Michael Liedtke were pleased with the episode noting that the last scene was [...] "beautifully written". Avalos and Liedtke also reacted positively to the death of Alex Krycek at the hands of Skinner, saying it was the best scene in the episode. Despite their praise, however, they stressed that [...] "Existence" [...] was not as exciting as the previous episode, [...] "Essence," [...] or the 1998 The X-Files feature film. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- rating, noting that [...] "season eight's finale goes out with a big fat juicy kiss between Mulder and Scully, at long last". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on".|$|E

He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London.
