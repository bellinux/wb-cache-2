50|$|The Martian {{fighting}} machines {{designed by}} Albert Nozaki for George Pal's 1953 Paramount film The War of the Worlds barely resemble the same {{machines in the}} H. G. Wells novel. The novel's fighting machines are 10-story tall tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected {{to the front of}} the machine's main body. In the film each fighting machine is armed with a visible, reddish heat-ray, atop a moving <b>goose-neck,</b> mounted in a cobra-like head.|$|E
50|$|Lepas anatifera {{has long}} been known to grow on sea turtles, but in 2008, some small {{specimens}} were found attached to an American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) on the Pacific coast of Mexico. This crocodile species mostly inhabits mangrove swamps and river estuaries but it is salt tolerant, and is sometimes found in marine environments. In this instance, the size of the <b>goose-neck</b> barnacles indicated that the crocodile must have been in the sea for at least a week. This {{is the first time that}} Lepas anatifera has been recorded as an epibiont of a crocodilian.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{she came to}} Ludwig's attention, though he wrote poems to her and had her painted by the court painter Joseph Karl Stieler for his Gallery, but Stieler's first version chose a view that over-emphasised her <b>goose-neck</b> and displeased its commissioner. As Ludwig had wanted Strobl's beauty {{documented}} naturalistically, he forbade Stieler to amend this first version to correct or reduce the neck. Stieler had to paint her again, but this time in an uncomfortable position, with the neck somewhat hidden by a necklace. Ludwig briefly considered placing both Stieler's versions in his Gallery, {{but in the end}} only chose to take the second one. The first one was lost, perhaps being given back to the artist, until it resurfaced on the art market in 1976 and bought by Munich's Residenzmuseum. A miniaturepainting by Stieler of the second version is in a private collection.|$|E
50|$|Jefferies {{had a very}} pragmatic design ethic: {{reasoning}} that a starship's engines would be extremely powerful and potentially dangerous, he positioned them {{far away from the}} ship, with the added benefit of modular design so that they could be ejected quickly in an emergency. Figuring that whatever could go wrong would, he put all of the ship's workings on the interior for easy access, eliminating the need for spacewalking in case of exterior repairs. The bridge panels were given an ergonomic design for comfort and ease of use. He was opposed to the idea of PADDs, as well as the <b>goose-neck</b> viewers that appeared in the first pilot. Moreover, he disliked the idea of a large engine room because by his reckoning the entire ship could be run by a single panel on the bridge. Later, Jefferies' work on the bridge of the Enterprise influenced the design of the U.S. Navy master communications center at NAS San Diego.|$|E
5000|$|He alternated between band {{tours and}} residencies at New York City clubs {{through the late}} 1920s. In 1931, his band became the house band at the Savoy Ballroom. He {{became one of the}} best-regarded bandleaders and drummers of the new [...] "swing" [...] style. Drummer Buddy Rich cited Webb's {{powerful}} technique and virtuoso performances as heavily influential on his own drumming, and even referred to Webb as [...] "the daddy of them all". Webb was unable to read music, and instead memorized the arrangements played by the band and conducted from a platform in the center. He used custom-made pedals, <b>goose-neck</b> cymbal holders, a 28-inch bass drum and other percussion instruments. Although his band was not as influential and revered in the long term, it was feared {{in the battle of the}} bands. The Savoy often featured [...] "Battle of the Bands" [...] where Webb's band would compete with other top bands (such as the Benny Goodman Orchestra or the Count Basie Orchestra) from opposing bandstands. By the end of the night's battles the dancers seemed always to have voted Chick's band as the best. As a result, Webb was deemed the most worthy recipient to be crowned the first [...] "King of Swing". Notably, Webb lost to Duke Ellington in 1937. Although a judge declared Webb's band the official winner in 1938 over Count Basie's, and Basie himself said he was just relieved to come away from the contest without embarrassing himself, surviving musicians continued to dispute the ruling for decades to follow.|$|E
5000|$|Pal's {{adaptation}} {{has many}} other notable differences from H. G. Wells' novel. The closest resemblance is probably {{that of the}} antagonists. The film's aliens are indeed Martians, and invade Earth {{for the same reasons}} as those stated in the novel (the state of Mars suggests that it is {{in the final stages of}} being able to support life, leading to the Martians decision to make Earth their new home). They land in the same way, by crashing to the Earth. However, the novel's spacecraft are large cylinder-shaped projectiles fired from the Martian surface from some kind of cannon, instead of the film's meteorite-spaceships; but the Martians emerge from their craft in the same way, by unscrewing a large, round hatch. They appear to have no use for humans in the film. In the novel, however, the invaders are observed [...] "feeding" [...] on humans by fatally transfusing their captives' blood supply directly into Martian bodies by using pipettes; there is also a later speculation about the Martians eventually using trained human slaves to hunt down all remaining survivors after they have conquered Earth. In the film the Martians do not bring their fast-growing red weed with them, but they are defeated by Earth microorganisms, as observed in the novel. However, they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteorite-ship; in the novel the Martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of England. The Martians themselves bear no physical resemblance to the novel's Martians, who are described as bear-sized, roundish creatures with brown bodies, [...] "merely heads", with quivering beak-like, V-shaped mouths dripping saliva; they have sixteen whip-like tentacles in two groupings of eight arranged on each side of their mouths and two large [...] "luminous, disk-like eyes". Due to budget constraints, their film counterparts are short, reddish-brown creatures with two long, thin arms with three long, thin fingers with suction cup tips. The Martian's [...] "head", if it can be called that, is a broad [...] "face" [...] at the top-front of its broad shouldered upper torso, the only apparent feature of which is a single large eye with three distinctly colored lenses (red, blue, and green). The Martians' lower extremities, whatever they may be, are never shown. (Some speculative designs for the creature suggest the idea of three thin legs resembling their fingers, while others show them as bipeds with short, stubby legs with three-toed feet.) [...] The film's Martian war machines do actually have more of a resemblance than they may seem at first glance. The novel's machines are 10-story tall tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the war machine's main body. The film's machines are shaped like manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the Martians observe their surroundings. On top of the machine is the cobra head-like heat-ray attached to a long, narrow, <b>goose-neck</b> extension. They can be mistaken for flying machines, but Forrester states that they are lifted by [...] "invisible legs"; in one scene, when the first machine emerges, you can see faint traces of three energy legs beneath and three sparking traces where the three energy shafts touch the burning ground. Therefore, technically speaking, the film's war machines are indeed tripods, though they are never given that designation. Whereas the novel's war machines had no protection against British army and navy cannon fire, the film's war machines have a force field surrounding them; this invisible shield is described by Forrester as a [...] "protective blister". The Martian weaponry is also partially unchanged. The heat-ray has the very same effect as that of the novel. However, the novel's heat-ray mechanism is briefly described as just a rounded hump when first seen in silhouette rising above the landing crater's rim; it fires an invisible energy beam in a wide arc while still in the pit made by the first Martian cylinder after it crash-lands. The film's heat-ray projector when first seen is shaped like a cobra's head and has a single, red pulsing [...] "eye", which likely acts like a targeting telescope for the Martians inside their manta ray-like war machine. The novel describes another weapon, the [...] "black smoke" [...] used to kill all life; the war machines fire canisters containing a black smoke-powder through a bazooka-like tube accessory. When dispersed, this black powder is lethal to all life forms who breathe it. This weapon is replaced in the film by a Martian [...] "skeleton beam", green pulsing bursts fired from the wingtips of the manta-ray machines; these bursts break apart the sub-atomic bonds that hold matter together on anything they touch. These skeleton beams are used off screen to obliterate several French cities. The plot of the film is very different from the novel, which tells the story of a 19th-century writer (with additional narration in later chapters by his medical student younger brother), who journeys through Victorian London and its southwestern suburbs while the Martians attack, eventually being reunited with his wife; the film's protagonist is a California scientist who falls in love with a former college student after the Martian invasion begins. However, certain points of the film's plot are similar to the novel, from the crash-landing of the Martian meteorite-ships to their eventual defeat by Earth's microorganisms. Forrester also experiences similar events like the book's narrator: an ordeal in a destroyed house, observing an actual Martian up close, and eventually reuniting with his love interest at the end of the story. The film is given more of a Cold War theme with its use of the Atomic Bomb against the enemy and the mass-destruction that such a global war would inflict on mankind.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Proximal {{migration}} of the ureteric double J stent {{is a rare}} but known complication. We describe three cases where a minimally invasive technique for retrieval of displaced double J stents using Amplatz™ <b>goose-neck</b> snare was successful. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of patients with displaced double J stent was carried out, in whom cystoscopy guided retrieval of double J stent was attempted {{with the help of}} Amplatz <b>goose-neck</b> snare under radiological control. Results: All three patients were under the age of 3 years. Two patients had migrated double J stent following pyeloplasty and in one patient the double J stent was displaced during a retrograde insertion of double J stent. In all cases, retrieval of displaced double J stent was successfully achieved using Amplatz <b>goose-neck</b> snare. There were no postoperative complications. Conclusion: Our method of retrieval of stent from renal pelvis is simple, safe and minimally invasive. This technique is a useful and safe alternative option for retrieval of proximally migrated double J stents in children...|$|E
40|$|In {{a patient}} with a distal common bile duct stone, a {{fracture}} of the traction wire of the basket occurring during the performance of mechanical lithotripsy resulted in the impaction of the lithotripter basket with a stone.

40|$|Introduction. Entrapment and {{fracture}} of diagnostic or therapeutic devices within the coronary circulatory system are a rare, but increasing problem. Case report. A 70 -yearold man was admitted in our clinic for coronary angiography before the planned aortic valve replacement. An arterial sheath was {{inserted in the}} right common femoral artery. After introducing a J-tip diagnostic coronary guidewire into the aorta and advancing a left Judkins diagnostic catheter over it, suddenly occured peeling off of the wire´s hydrophilic coating at the aortic arch level. Very soon, this outer coating of guidewire carried by the blood stream was entered into the left femoral artery, then into the left popliteal artery. This stripped part of guidewire was successfully caught and extracted out by using a <b>goose-neck</b> snare catheter. Conclusion. A sudden stripping of outer coating of a J-tip diagnostic hydrophilic coronary guidewire during coronary angiography is possible to manage quickly and successfully {{by the use of}} a simple cathether...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONFracture and {{embolization}} {{of central}} venous catheters placed via the subclavian approach is well recognized, but fractured catheters placed via the internal jugular vein are extremely rare.

Goose neck and conformational loop snares were successfully used to percutaneously retrieve the severed catheter, which had migrated to the right ventricle. DISCUSSIONCatheter fracture may occur even after placement via the internal jugular approach and may be underestimated because it is often asymptomatic. Interventional radiology techniques using <b>goose-neck</b> and conformational loop snares {{may be useful to}} retract an intravascular foreign body.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{cross-sectional}} echocardiographic {{demonstration of}} the "goose-neck " deformity is described in four patients with endocardial cushion defect. The diagnosis was confirmed in each patient by left ventricular angiocardiogram. The subxiphoid approach of cross-sectional echocardiography in diastole al-lowed visualization of an elongated, narrowed, and somewhat horizontally inclined configuration of the left ventricular outflow tract, which appeared almost identical to that obtained by angiocardiography. In systole, the right border of the left ventricle was composed of the cleft anterior mitral leaflet, the left-sided line of which was convex toward the left ventricular cavity. The mitral valvular echoes were thickened, jagged and irregular, which seemed to correspond to the scalloped appearance of the right border of the left ventricular silhouette in a systolic phase of the left ventricular angiocardiogram. There were no obvious differences between the <b>goose-neck</b> configuration of complete-type endocardial cushion defect and that of ostium primum atrial septal defect. FROM THE DIAGNOSTIC standpoint of endo-cardial cushion defect (ECD), the "goose-neck " defor-mity as seen on the frontal projection of the left ventricular angiocardiogram is a most important fea-ture. 1 - 7 M-mode echocardiography has been widel...|$|E
40|$|SummaryA 78 -year-old man who {{had been}} treated with {{maintenance}} hemodialysis for chronic renal failure was admitted with severe edema in left arm for 1 month. Venous angiography showed a severe stenosis in left innominate vein, then, he underwent percutaneous balloon angioplasty and venous stenting (Wall Stent RP). His arm edema soon improved after angioplasty, however, he complained of general fatigue and bradycardia 2 days after the venous angioplasty. Electrocardiogram showed complete atrioventricular block with 35 wide QRS complexes per minute. His echocardiogram showed a pipe-shaped structure with multiple slit and acoustic shadow in right ventricle. His radiographical right ventriculogram revealed the migrated venous stent from innominate vein to right ventricle. We tried to perform percutaneous transvenous stent extraction using <b>Goose-Neck</b> snare catheter, however, the wall stent stuck in the right external iliac vein, and contrast media leaked to the outside of the vascular wall. Therefore, we implanted this stent in the iliac vein with optimal-sized balloon inflation, and succeeded in stopping bleeding. Complete atrioventricular block was recovered to sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block just after the removal of the venous stent from right ventricle, and no cardiovascular events occurred after the treatment...|$|E
40|$|Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) {{facilities}} create high enthalpy ows {{to recreate}} atmospheric entry conditions. Although no condition has been duplicated exactly in a ground test facility, {{it is important}} to characterize the condition to understand how close a facility can come to doing so. An ICP facility was constructed at the University of Vermont for aerospace material testing in 2010. The current setup can operate using air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon to test samples in a chamber. In this work we investigate di erent ways to increase measured heat ux and expand our facility to operate supersonically. To do so, a water cooled injection system was designed to overcome failure points of the prior system. An investigation of heat ux methods that provide a baseline for the facility were also examined and tested. A nozzle con guration was also developed with an overall goal of increasing the plasma ow to reach sonic and supersonic velocities, allowing it to be compared with the existing subsonic system. An iterative approach was taken to develop a nozzle design that is robust enough to handle the harsh environment, yet adaptable to the pre-existing facility components. The current design uses interchangeable sonic and supersonic nozzles which also allow for appropriate plasma gas expansion. Data are taken through retractable and <b>goose-neck</b> probe sample holders during testing. Heat ux can be determined by use of a Gardon gage, slug calorimeter, and water cooled calorimeter. Total and static pressure are determined from a pitot tube and pressure tap, which are then manipulated into a velocity measurement. A comparison between subsonic and supersonic operation is then made with these data. Existing literature uses correlations between jet diameter and velocity gradients to determine the e ective heat ux. This investigation found that the experimental and theoretical heat ux results scale correctly according to the correlations...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{adaptation}} of livestock to repeated transport. This study determined how repeated transport affected calf feed intake, plasma cortisol (CORT), post-transport behavior, and the expression of immune-related genes. Thirty-six 4 -month-old Holstein steer calves were housed in groups of six with each group randomly assigned to either transport (T) or control (C) treatments. The T calves were hauled for 6 h in a 7. 3 m x 2. 4 m <b>goose-neck</b> trailer, at an average density of 0. 87 m 2 /calf, every 7 d for five consecutive weeks. Individual daily intake was determined using Calan gate feeders. Blood samples were obtained in the trailer or home pen via jugular venipuncture before loading, and after 2, 4, and 6 h of transport. Samples were analyzed for CORT, serotonin, tryptophan, and the gene expression of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2, interleukin- 12, toll-like receptor- 4, toll-like receptor- 2, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor 2 A in leukocytes. Behavior was recorded for transported calves at 5 -min intervals for 1 h after return to their home pens. The C calves had a higher feed intake than T calves overall (P = 0. 01), on the day of transport (P = 0. 007), and the day after transport (P = 0. 02). Pre-transport CORT concentrations did not differ by treatment (P = 0. 77) or trial (P = 0. 32). However, the T calves had higher response CORT concentrations than C calves during Transport 3 (P = 0. 006), Transport 4 (P = 0. 001) and Transport 5 (P = 0. 02). The T calves had the highest response CORT concentrations after 2 h of transport and the lowest response CORT concentrations after 6 h of transport (P < 0. 0001). Treatment did not affect gene expression in leukocytes, however, the expression of IL- 4 (P = 0. 01) and IL- 6 (P = 0. 05) was significantly lower after 2 h of transport than any other sampling times. These results suggest conflicting conclusions on whether the calves started to acclimate after being transported five times. However, CORT and gene expression differences occurred in response to the blood sampling regimen, which may provide insight to how calves acclimate during prolonged stress...|$|E
