40|$|This paper {{describes}} an augmented reality prototype that precisely tracks {{the position of}} paper <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> used by air traffic controllers. By embedding resistors with different values into slightly modified plastic stripholders and inserting contacts {{along the sides of}} a stripboard frame, we can detect the exact position of individual stripholders (and their corresponding paper <b>flight</b> <b>strips).</b> When placed over a graphics tablet or touch sensitive screen, and properly calibrated, we have a simple, inexpensive solution for identifying paper <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> and linking them to capture and display technologies. KEYWORDS: Augmented Reality, paper <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> INTRODUCTION Air traffic controllers still use pre-printed strips of paper, called <b>flight</b> <b>strips,</b> to track their planes. Writing on them, manipulating them, and organizing them on a stripboard helps controllers memorize information on the strips and build a mental representation of the air traffic. Paper <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> are easy to [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Aside from airline flights, Ivan Farrar {{built an}} {{aircraft}} himself around 1970and tested {{it at the}} Omak Airport in the 1970s. No major accidents or incidents have occurred throughout its history among all aircraft operations. In October1953, the airfield was leased to a firm for four-years under conditions as a public airport; the Omak Chamber of Commerce was told about the situation. The Omak Airport has historically suffered from financial difficulties, specifically in November1959. In attempt to resolve the issue, city and county members met in a government conference. The <b>flight</b> <b>strip</b> gained $40,000and $60,000for improvements and maintenance. Despite this, {{it was suggested that}} this money depends largely upon commercial airline service among the Okanogan County and the [...] "job is too big" [...] for the Omak City Council. At that time, there were also budget restrictions which prevented large help for the airport. One proposal was to develop a port or airport district to operate the airfield, although snow removal in the winter by a plow machine would be a difficult task to perform. City council members of nearby city Okanogan stated that their airport, Okanogan Legion Airport, also required assistance with its snow by a plow machine. The city proposed leasing the airfield in 1965, but an action was not noted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} our {{exploration of}} a design space for an augmented reality prototype.

40|$|The Controller Interface (CI) is {{the primary}} method for Air Traffic Controllers to {{communicate}} with aircraft via Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC). The controller, wearing a microphone/headset, aurally gives instructions to aircraft as he/she would with today's voice radio systems. The CI's voice recognition system converts the instructions to digitized messages that are formatted according to the RTCA DO- 219 Operational Performance Standards for ATC Two-Way Data Link Communications. The DO- 219 messages are transferred via RS- 232 to the ATIDS system for uplink using a Mode-S datalink. Pilot acknowledgments of controller messages are downlinked to the ATIDS system and transferred to the Cl. A computer monitor is used to convey information to the controller. Aircraft data from the ARTS database are displayed on <b>flight</b> <b>strips.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> are electronic versions of the strips currently used in the ATC system. Outgoing controller messages cause the respective strip to change color to indicate an unacknowledged transmission. The message text is shown on the <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> for reference. When the pilot acknowledges the message, the strip returns to its normal color. A map of the airport can also be displayed on the monitor. In addition to voice recognition, the controller can enter messages using the monitor's touch screen or by mouse/keyboard...|$|R

50|$|A {{system of}} {{electronic}} <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> replacing the old paper strips {{is being used}} by several service providers, such as Nav Canada, MASUAC, DFS, DECEA. E-strips allows controllers to manage electronic flight data online without paper strips, reducing the need for manual functions, creating new tools and reducing the ATCO's workload. The firsts electronic <b>flight</b> <b>strips</b> systems were independently and simultaneously invented and implemented by Nav Canada and Saipher ATC in 1999. The Nav Canada system known as EXCDS and rebranded in 2011 to NAVCANstrips and Saipher's first generation system known as SGTC, which is now being updated by its 2nd generation system, the TATIC TWR. DECEA in Brazil is the world's largest user of tower e-strips system, ranging from very small airports up to the busiest ones, taking the advantage of real time information and data collection from each of more than 150 sites for use in air traffic flow management (ATFM), billing and statistics.|$|R

40|$|A lot of HCI {{work has}} been done {{focusing}} on Air Traffic Controllers (ATC).

In this project, I have done a user study to investigate further the bridge between digital data accessed by controllers and the static data that is printed and annotated on <b>flight</b> <b>strips.</b> My primary point of focus has been the behavior of controllers in high traffic periods as opposed to average to low traffic loads. With the continued call to eliminate paper strips from control towers, this study seeks to verify the usefulness of paper strips. The study shows that a combination of paper strips and digital strips is what controllers prefer. While the controllers want to use digital strips because of the significant functionality obtained from them, paper strips are still maintained as a backup interface because of their inherent reliability...|$|R
