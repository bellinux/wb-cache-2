40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the growth strategies {{adopted by the}} <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> sector {{in the context of}} changes resulting from the deregulation and liberalization of the electricity market. Strategies pursued by the <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> sector were rarely the subject of research in the field of strategic management despite the fact that electricity is an indispensable element of everyday life and the economy as a whole. Therefore, a case study of the largest incumbent <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> in the Republic of Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia has been conducted, and differences in the degree of market liberalization and core features of these companies have been noted. Research findings have shown that the degree of deregulation can affect the growth strategies of <b>electric</b> <b>utilities.</b> In those countries where the degree of deregulation is lower, <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> focus on the domestic market. On the other hand, a higher level of deregulation enables <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> to achieve their growth through diversification or innovation. Given the fact that the analyzed <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> are operating within relatively small economies, they cannot compete with <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> in developed countries, and, apart from international electricity trading, are mostly focused on their domestic markets...|$|R

5|$|Oklahoma {{set up the}} Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) on January 10, 1935. Eventually, on September 18, 1937, {{with the}} help of Oklahoma Representative Wesley E. Disney, Senator Elmer Thomas and {{engineer}} W. R. Holway, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $20 million in funding through the New Deal's Public Works Administration for the dam. The higher cost for the dam was attributed to a project that was approved for additional purposes, including hydroelectric power generation and recreation. Additional costs for the dam were covered by the state government and by GRDA municipal bond auctions which appropriated or raised $11 million. Disney had pushed much of the legislation for the dam, comparing the higher <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> rates in Oklahoma compared to other states. Senator Thomas helped appropriate additional state and public funding for the dam while also being instrumental in its legislation.|$|E

5|$|In 1890 Lilly {{and other}} civic leaders founded the Commercial Club; Lilly was elected {{as its first}} president. The club, renamed the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1912, was the primary vehicle for Lilly's city {{development}} goals. It was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including citywide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them, and a city sewage system. The companies that provided these services were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to the companies' customers, who slowly bought each company back from its initial investors. The model was later followed other regions of Indiana to establish water and <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> companies. The Commercial Club members also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, as well as successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand Indianapolis's growing industries.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean <b>Electric</b> <b>Utility</b> Services Corporation (CARILEC) sent linemen {{to assist}} the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews {{in the event of}} power outages from Gonzalo. Still {{completing}} restoration work after massive outages from Fay, BELCO stationed vehicles and supplies at strategic points on the island to prepare for the next hurricane. On the morning of October 16, BELCO switched its focus from Fay to Gonzalo, leaving around 1,500 households without power; the remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling to report outages. Ahead of the storm, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll sailed from the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. Public beaches were closed as hurricane swells began to build, and {{the decision was made to}} shut down the Causeway early on October 17, based on forecasts of long-duration severe winds. Additionally, L.F.Wade International Airport closed prior to the storm's onslaught, accounting for 62canceled commercial flights. Three cruise ships were diverted from the island.|$|E
5|$|William A. Foote was a 30-year-old grist mill {{operator}} in Adrian, Michigan, in 1884 when, {{in what was}} then a common occurrence, he provided space and shaft power from his mill wheel to Thomson - Houston, a local <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> startup, to light 12 streetlights. Fascinated by the potential, within a year he enlisted his then 17-year-old brother James and moved to Jackson, Michigan, and in 1886 they jointly founded Jackson Electric Light Works (a predecessor company to Consumers Energy), which began by lighting downtown Jackson electrically. The Foote brothers set up similar city specific companies in Battle Creek and Adrian within a few years. In many cases dams already built for grist mills, sawmills and the like were refit for electric generators, but in some cases, new dams were constructed. As the familiarity with the technology, and the technology itself, improved, the scope of projects became more ambitious.|$|E

40|$|The regulation-protected {{environment}} of <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> has undergone massive changes to open market competition. The {{protection of the}} regulatory shield {{in the past has}} imposed obstacles and barriers for many <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> to change their business emphasis from internal focused to market orientation (MO). In order to face the new challenges, <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> have incorporated a large variety of piecemeal change management programmes to change their business emphasis. Many of them have experienced a lot of difficulties in fundamentally transforming themselves from their old ways of doing business. TQM philosophy and principles, targeting the generation of holistic and systematic changes for customer satisfaction, were suggested to be used in guiding the change process in <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> towards market orientation through continuous quality improvement. To investigate the possibility of using TQM as an integrative approach to guide market orientation change for <b>electric</b> <b>utilities,</b> an internationally-based questionnaire survey was conducted. Results of the study indicated that the influence of TQM applications on market orientation is positive and significant, and that the external business environment seems to have little interaction on the effectiveness of using TQM for change towards market orientation. TQM is empirically found to be a potentially effective approach for <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> to change to market orientation. The literature has so far been focused extensively on the effects of market orientation on business performance, organization innovativeness and product development performance etc. This paper investigates the mechanism to transform organizations towards market orientation.
