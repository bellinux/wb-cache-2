5|$|The next morning, Bart's {{conscience}} gets to him, {{and finally}} he admits the truth, which prompts Homer and Lisa to choke him. Soon, Brockman and the news crew arrive to do a follow-up story. After the family {{go along with the}} lie, a cameraman, with help from Santa's Little Helper, finds the burned remains of the Christmas tree. The family is forced to explain the truth, but the citizens of Springfield <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been scammed and shun and harass the family until they can pay back the $15,000.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
25|$|If a {{vaccination}} program successfully reduces the disease threat, it {{may reduce the}} perceived risk of disease as cultural memories {{of the effects of}} that disease fade. At this point, parents may <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> nothing to lose by not vaccinating their children. If enough people hope to become free-riders, gaining the benefits of herd immunity without vaccination, vaccination levels may drop to a level where herd immunity ceases to be as effective.|$|E

30|$|Another {{feature of}} high Out Closeness {{is that there}} is often a {{discrepancy}} between the number of important relationships a person <b>feels</b> <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> and the number of important relationships others <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> actually <b>have</b> with them. This lack of reciprocity may be a key to the lowered degree of wellbeing in those with high degrees of Out Closeness.|$|R
25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when {{the consequences of their}} statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{traditional}} version of cricket, with rules most closely replicating the original rules of cricket from the 16th and 17th century. It is a single innings game with a set time limit for the entire game to be completed in. To win the game, a side must both score the highest aggregate number of runs and take all ten of the opposition wickets. It {{is up to the}} side batting first to declare when they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> enough runs to be able to win the match. In this format of cricket, if the side batting second do not lose all ten of their wickets, the match is said to have ended in a draw.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to, while others act compulsively {{so as to}} mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E

25|$|Provisions from Dodd–Frank {{found in}} section 922 also address whistle blower protection. Under new {{regulations}} any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can {{be rewarded with}} substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected. Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars. These provisions also enact anti-retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers {{the right to have}} a jury trial if they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing. If the jury finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees. This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations. The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011.|$|E
25|$|Informality of {{land tenure}} {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} of urban slums. At their start, slums are typically located in least desirable lands near the town or city, that are state owned or philanthropic trust owned or religious entity owned or have no clear land title. Some immigrants regard unoccupied land as land without owners and therefore occupy it. In some cases the local community or the government allots lands to people, which will later develop into slums and over which the dwellers don't have property rights. Informal land tenure also includes occupation of land belonging to someone else. According to Flood, 51 percent of slums are based on invasion to private land in sub-Saharan Africa, 39 percent in North Africa and West Asia, 10 percent in South Asia, 40 percent in East Asia, and 40 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. In some cases, once the slum has many residents, the early residents form a social group, an informal association or a gang that controls newcomers, charges a fee {{for the right to}} live in the slums, and dictates where and how new homes get built within the slum. The newcomers, having paid for the right, <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> commercial right to the home in that slum. The slum dwellings, built earlier or in later period as the slum grows, are constructed without checking land ownership rights or building codes, are not registered with the city, and often not recognized by the city or state governments.|$|E

Mike Royko wrote in his 2002 book For the Love of Mike that people may have a bad day, not a nice one, because they [...] "confront a demanding boss, a nasty customer, a crabby teacher".|$|E

500|$|GameSpot called Pillars of Eternitys writing [...] "lovely".

PC Gamer also praised the writing, saying that it is [...] "rich" [...] and [...] "evocative". Destructoid praised the plot and the world's reactivity to the player, writing, [...] "the main plot is packed with twists and surprises with staggering ramifications for a world players will <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become part of." [...] IGN said that characters in the game, both major and minor, have elaborate characterization, but found the fact that only some characters have voice acting to be an annoyance. Eurogamer criticized the game's lack of humor, with the writer of the review saying that he wanted characters in the same vein as Minsc from Baldur's Gate and Morte from Planescape: Torment in Pillars of Eternity to [...] "lighten the mood". The writer further said that he found the quests in the game to be [...] "fairly stock" [...] and the characters [...] "forgettable".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E
500|$|Xenogears was Yasunori Mitsuda's {{first major}} solo work, as his {{previous}} soundtracks were collaborations with other composers {{with the exception}} of the score to , which never saw an album release. According to Mitsuda, the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from [...] "a world of [...] own imagining" [...] rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. His musical approach for the original soundtrack was to insert Celtic influences into [...] "easy-to-listen-to" [...] pop tracks rather than making either [...] "dense" [...] Celtic music or simple background music. For Creid, he expanded on this theme to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style. The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces. The album's title refers to two ideas, with one being [...] "a message to those who <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lost sight of their ambitions for the flood of information this era surrounds us with" [...] and the other an affirmation to himself that Mitsuda had [...] "rediscovered [...] own path". Mitsuda felt that with this album, he had [...] "discovered the precise mode of musical expression [...] was seeking within" [...] himself and [...] "given form to the belief within [...] heart".|$|E
