30|$|Sq <b>foci</b> <b>tracks</b> for dataset 2 (2011): One {{shortcoming}} of {{dataset 1}} {{is that no}} observatories were installed in the direct vicinity of the SAA. Dataset 2 allows to investigate if additional observatories {{in the region of}} the SAA influence the resulting Sq <b>foci</b> <b>tracks.</b> The left plots in Figure 4 depict the tracks for scenario 1 when the data from the Intermagnet network were analyzed, but the observatories in the region of the SAA (KEP, TDC, SHE, ASC, PST) were not included. The right column gives the results for scenario 2, when all observatories were included in the dataset. We observe that the additional observatories {{in the vicinity of the}} SAA do not significantly change the resulting Sq <b>foci</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The EOS 100D {{shares a}} similar set of {{features}} {{with the larger}} Canon EOS 700D. However, it does have an improved <b>focus</b> <b>tracking</b> system in live view mode called Hybrid CMOS AF II with 80% frame coverage. The 700D has the previous version of Hybrid CMOS AF with much reduced frame coverage.|$|E
50|$|With Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF {{system and}} {{customizable}} Movie Servo AF, the camera provides continuous phase-detection AF during video recording for quick and accurate <b>focus</b> <b>tracking</b> of moving subjects over approximately {{eighty percent of}} the image area measured horizontally and vertically.

50|$|Three {{firmware}} updates {{have been}} released for the D3. The latest firmware version is 2.02. In this firmware version, the maximum ISO sensitivity allowed under Automatic ISO can be modified in increments {{the same as the}} manual ISO settings can, and automatic White balance and <b>focus</b> <b>tracking</b> are improved. In the 2.01 firmware update, automatic correction of lateral chromatic aberration is standardized, and Vignetting ("Vignette control"), lens distortion ("Distortion") correction, as well as image rotation ("Straighten") via playback ("Retouch") menu, are made possible.|$|E
50|$|Depth perception, <b>focus,</b> <b>tracking</b> {{and other}} aspects of vision {{continue}} to develop throughout early and middle childhood. From recent studies in the United States and Australia {{there is some evidence that}} the amount of time school aged children spend outdoors, in natural light, may have some impact on whether they develop myopia. The condition tends to get somewhat worse through childhood and adolescence, but stabilizes in adulthood. More prominent myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are thought to be inherited. Children with this condition may need to wear glasses.|$|E
50|$|The F4 {{introduced}} many Nikon {{owners to}} autofocus (as well as <b>focus</b> <b>tracking),</b> {{and was the}} first professional Nikon to utilize a vertical-travel metal-blade shutter (with shutter balancer to minimize noise and camera bounce). As a fully electronic camera with motorized film transport (up to 5.7 frames per second), it required one of three available bottom-mounted battery packs to operate, using standard AA or rechargeable cells. For the first time on a Nikon SLR, two of those battery packs also offered an additional vertical shutter release button and grip for using the camera vertically.|$|E

30|$|We have {{analyzed}} the Sq current system {{in terms of}} the Sq <b>foci</b> <b>track</b> variability with respect to longitude, day, season, and solar activity. The computed tracks result in pronounced mid-latitude bands in the northern and southern hemisphere. The computed Sq tracks seem to neither follow the geographic nor the geomagnetic or dip equators. We observe a pronounced scattering of the tracks over the SAA. Remarkably, the scattering appears to be very robust, irrespective of the dataset used. This systematic scattering manifests as a large shift of the southern hemisphere focus northwards during northern summer and southwards during the southern solstice. The shift of the southern Sq <b>focus</b> <b>tracks</b> with respect to the seasons is clearly evident. The physical mechanism of this systematic effect remains unclear. The longitudinal variations of the Sq foci are believed to have their origin from an influence of non-migrating tides as reported in recent studies and the anomalous weak amplitude of the geomagnetic main field over the SAA.|$|R
50|$|In the AAS method, {{the set of}} servo systems (<b>focus,</b> <b>tracking,</b> sled, and spindle servos) {{keeps the}} laser beam focused on the spiral track, and allows disc {{rotation}} and laser head motion during the scanning. The amplification/detection board (DAB) is integrated into the CD/DVD drive unit and incorporates a photosensor and electronic circuitry to amplify the RF signal extracted from the photodiode transducer. The photosensor generates a trigger signal when detecting the trigger mark. Both signals are brought to the USB2.0 data acquisition board(DAQ) for digitization and quantification.|$|E
5000|$|AI servo is an {{auto focus}} mode found on Canon SLR cameras, {{although}} {{the same principle}} is used with Nikon and some Pentax cameras, known there as [...] "continuous focus" [...] (AF-C). [...] Also referred to as <b>focus</b> <b>tracking,</b> {{it is used to}} track a subject as it moves around the frame, or toward and away from the camera. When in use, the lens will constantly maintain its focus on the subject, hence it is commonly used for sports and action photography. AI refers to artificial intelligence: algorithms that constantly predict where a subject is about to be based on its speed and acceleration data from the autofocus sensor.|$|E
50|$|Cameras {{capable of}} high {{continuous}} shooting rates are much desired when the subjects are in motion, as in sports photography, {{or where the}} opportunities are brief. Rather than anticipate the action precisely, photographers can simply start shooting from right before they believe the action will occur, giving a high chance {{of at least one}} frame being acceptable. Most modern digital SLR cameras have continuous shooting rates of between 3 and 8 frames per second, although very high end cameras such as the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II are capable of 14 frames per second with full autofocus, or 16 frames per second when in mirror lock-up mode. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 is capable of recording 40 still images per second in burst mode, at a slightly reduced resolution. In March 2014, Nikon claims its Nikon 1 V3 mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera has the world's fastest burst mode of 20fps Auto <b>Focus</b> <b>tracking</b> and 60fps at the first shot autofocus, both in 18.4MP full resolution. The claim is among digital cameras with interchangeable lenses (including (its) DSLR).|$|E
30|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanism of}} the systematic scattering of the Sq <b>foci</b> <b>tracks</b> over the SAA remains unclear. As reported in recent studies, the longitudinal variations of Sq have their origin at least partly from an influence of non-migrating tides (e.g., Lieberman et al. 2013). Further, the ionospheric gyrofrequencies are proportional to the background magnetic field B, so the ionospheric conductivities decrease with increasing B (e.g., Richmond 1995, Stening and Winch 2013). The SAA represents an area of an anomalous weak geomagnetic field strength; hence, {{a combination of these}} processes is believed to influence the Sq <b>foci</b> <b>tracks</b> in the observed way. Numerical modeling studies could help to better understand the physical {{mechanism of the}} observed systematic Sq foci shift. Concerning the solar activity as a possible source for the variability of the Sq source system, we observe no influence since there is {{no significant difference between the}} results for datasets 1 and 2 in Table 1.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop and compare several multi-resolution {{microscope}} slide scanning algorithms of increasing complexity. The algorithms utilise a low-resolution {{image of the}} whole sample to optimise the high-resolution scan in terms of decreasing the number of field-of-view (FOV) images required. This approach, while commonly applied in microscopy, has never been fully evaluated to quantify expected improvements in scan time when the high-resolution scans are optimised on each sample. In addition, the methods have potential to improve image quality by reducing both image stitching and <b>focus</b> <b>tracking</b> artefacts. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new autofocusing method for {{microbiological}} specimens, such as cells. The proposed focusing method used a quick focus estimation named “depth from diffraction”, {{based on a}} diffraction pattern in a defocused image of a biological specimen. Since this method can estimate the focal position of the specimen from only a single defocused image, it can easily realize high-speed autofocusing. To demonstrate the proposed method, continuous focusing was applied to <b>focus</b> <b>tracking</b> of a swimming paramecium, in combination with two-dimensional tracking. This allowed three-dimensional tracking of the paramecium for 75 s to be successfully demonstrated. I...|$|E

Nondestructive testing in industry often relies on holography, which is the reconstruction of optical waves to make a three-dimensional image. In combination with microscopy, digital holography can also provide contact-free, marker-free, quantita-tive, phase-contrast imaging. Here, we describe a system with high-magnification optics that can detect fast processes and pro-vide long-termmeasurements, even if they require <b>focus</b> <b>tracking.</b> Figure 1 shows our system for digital-holographicmicroscopy.

30|$|Sq <b>foci</b> <b>tracks</b> for {{dataset 1}} (1990): Dataset 1 allows to {{investigate}} if the unbalanced Intermagnet network {{is capable of}} obtaining a robust determination of the Sq source by balancing it with the 53 non-permanent AWAGS stations in Australia. The left plots in Figure 3 depict the tracks for scenario 1, when only data from the Intermagnet network were used. The right plots present tracks for scenario 2, when data from the Intermagnet and AWAGS network were used. The different colors represent results for the different seasons. The red, green, and blue colors denote {{the results for the}} northern summer (May, June, July), equinoctial (February, March, April, August, September, October), and southern summer days (November, December, January), respectively (Table 1). The upper plots show the positions of the Sq foci for each day and the lower ones the median values for the different seasons. The tracks of the Sq foci for all days and all seasons and for the two scenarios manifest as two pronounced mid-latitude bands. One can see that the tracks and the computed seasonal medians neither follow the geographic equator nor the geomagnetic equator and the dip equator. By comparing the results of the two scenarios, we find that the <b>foci</b> <b>tracks</b> are independent of the observatory network which is used to determine the Sq system with respect to the standard deviation (cf. Table 1).|$|R
