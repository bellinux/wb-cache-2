5|$|In 1989, the RAN Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Michael Hudson {{approved}} a <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Australian warships only carry battle honours earned by previous Australian vessels. The creation and awarding of battle honours came completely under RAN control.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the new cathedral were drawn up {{and work on the}} {{foundation}} began in 1562. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the cathedral face south instead of east was made in 1570. In the same year, construction commenced, working from the Gothic designs and models created by Claudio de Arciniega and Juan Miguel de Agüero, inspired by cathedrals found in Spanish cities such as Valladolid and Jaén.|$|E

In 1972 this was {{increased}} {{to a total of}} 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E
40|$|L. A. Paul has {{recently}} argued that, {{on the standard}} model of rationality, individuals cannot make rational <b>decisions</b> about whether <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child or not. In this paper, I show that Paul’s arguments do not plausibly demonstrate that the standard model of rationality precludes rational <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child. I argue that there are phenomenal and non-phenomenal values {{that can be used}} to determine the value that having a child will have for us and, in turn, that can be used <b>to</b> make rational <b>decisions</b> about whether <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child or not. I also argue that we can have an approximate idea of what it is like for us <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child, even before we have a child and that, on the standard model, this is sufficient <b>to</b> make rational <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child...|$|R
30|$|Using older {{children}} to measure childbearing would be problematic because parameters of interest will be identified off of within-MSA {{differences in the}} size of the immigrant population across decades. <b>Decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{older children}} are not likely to be affected by relatively recent changes in the immigrant population.|$|R
50|$|Preferences {{can also}} apply to {{the sex of the}} {{children}} born, and can therefore influence the <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more children.  For instance, if a couple’s preference is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> at least one boy and one girl, and the first two children born are boys, there is a significantly high likelihood that the couple will opt <b>to</b> <b>have</b> another child.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{policies}} that Diefenbaker held dear did not survive the 16 years of Liberal rule which followed his fall. By the end of 1963, {{the first of the}} Bomarc warheads entered Canada, where they remained until the last were finally phased out during John Turner's brief government in 1984. Diefenbaker's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Canada remain outside the OAS was not reversed by Pearson, and it was not until 1989, under the Tory government of Brian Mulroney, that Canada joined.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was first}} {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around town in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element did {{make it into the}} series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E
5|$|Gerard van Swieten, whom Maria Theresa had {{recruited}} {{following the}} death of her sister, Archduchess Maria Anna, founded the Vienna General Hospital, revamped Austria's educational system and served as the Empress's personal physician. After calling in van Swieten, Maria Theresa asked him to study the problem of infant mortality in Austria. Following his recommendation, she made a decree that autopsies would be mandatory for all hospital deaths in the city of Graz, Austria's second largest city. This law – still in effect today – combined with the relatively stable population of Graz, resulted {{in one of the most}} important and complete autopsy records in the world. Maria Theresa banned the creation of new burial grounds without prior government permission, thus countering wasteful and unhygienic burial customs. Her <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her children inoculated after the smallpox epidemic of 1767 was responsible for changing Austrian physicians' negative view of inoculation. The empress herself inaugurated inoculation in Austria by hosting a dinner for the first sixty-five inoculated children in Schönbrunn Palace, waiting on the children herself.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{along with}} America First {{chairman}} Jonathan M. Hill appeared on Al Jazeera English, discussing strategic development plans for third {{parties in the}} United States. The broadcast was viewed by over 100 million viewers worldwide. He also made two appearances on Fox News, first on the TV special The Rescue Rumble and later on Your World, both shows were hosted by Neil Cavuto. He later appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central TV series The Colbert Report, a news satire show about modern American politics. According to Moore, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him on the show came from Stephen Colbert, the current host for the TV series. A spokeswoman from Comedy Central {{would not comment on}} the motives behind the selection. Moore also wrote several articles in The Nation, The New Republic and National Journal, and the newspapers The St. Petersburg Times, The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. The {{question of whether or not}} Barack Obama was a socialist, led to an increased interest in Moore during the election. The Left Party, a Swedish democratic socialist political party, officially endorsed Moore for president during a televised debate in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{decision}} to move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance. The National Park Service {{expressed concern that the}} battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor. To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace.|$|E
5|$|Stephanie Brown {{became the}} {{featured}} {{character of the}} Batgirl series from 2009 to 2011. DC subsequently relaunched all their monthly publications during The New 52 relaunch. In the revised continuity, Barbara Gordon recovers from her paralysis following a surgical procedure and stars in the relaunched Batgirl series as the titular character. These changes were retained {{as part of the}} 2016 DC Rebirth event. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. The character's popularity from adaptations factored into the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her return to the comics, and Dan DiDio, co-publisher of DC Comics, expressed that she is the best-known version of the character.|$|E

5|$|The Invisible Touch Tour was the band's largest {{world tour}} {{in its history}} which {{included}} 112 dates from September 1986 to July 1987. Genesis received some criticism in their <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Michelob beer as a sponsor. The tour concluded with four consecutive sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium in London. The shows were released in 1988 as The Invisible Touch Tour. When the tour ended, Genesis took a five-year break while each member committed to their solo projects. They performed twice during this time; on 14 May 1988, they performed a 20-minute set at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden. This {{was followed by a}} set at a charity gig at the 1990 Knebworth Festival in June, headlined by Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka. Fujisaka, who was acquainted with Sakaguchi, was brought on board the project at the beginning. At that point, only a simple plot outline had been created, and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka and asked what he visualized from it. Due to this, Fujisaka {{had a lot of}} leeway in his designs. Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed, Fujisaka was initially nervous about working with him on the project, but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one. An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the characters able to change their clothing: their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines, and while designing extra outfits proved difficult, he ultimately enjoyed the experience. Fujisaka also worked as a world designer, initially feeling restricted by the console's limited graphics. According to Fujisaka, the city hub began taking shape in 2009, relatively early in development. The world design he initially created was fairly bleak, but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed, he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E

5|$|The episode's script {{went through}} several {{different}} versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The decision to kill off the character of Catherine Black {{was based on a}} suggestion by Chris Carter, the series' creator. Morgan and Wong discussed the idea with actress Megan Gallagher, who felt that it was an interesting <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Catherine give her life after seeing Frank Black sacrifice so much for their family throughout the previous episodes. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{the then}} Director of Operations Group Captain Robert Saundby, {{complained that the}} role for Coastal Command in war, namely {{supporting}} the bomber offensive, and second, the support of naval forces along the British coastline, were too limited and {{was in danger of}} diverting the Command from its main concern: ASW. In October the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) Air Vice Marshal Richard Peirse confirmed that there was no formal role for the service or location of its units. Peirse did reverse the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> strategic bombing support as the primary function. This was changed to trade defence. Coastal Command was only to be used for other purposes if trade routes were suffering little interference and the intensity of air attack on Britain, or air attacks on enemy targets, required all available air units for those purposes. However, in December 1937, the Naval and Air Staffs met again and changed the priority to North Sea reconnaissance. The Naval Staff insisted that surface commerce raiders presented the greatest danger, and aircraft could prove decisive only in locating enemy warships. ASW remained in third place, after direct co-operation with surface fleets. In December 1938, this was changed again, and ASW moved up to second priority. In August 1939 it was moved to first priority. When Coastal Command went to war, its first task was to co-operate with the Navy to prevent enemy vessels from escaping into the North Sea and Atlantic Oceans. Secondly, it was to provide ASW support where and when it could. These steps are significant as the language indicates a change from passive reconnaissance of enemy warships and submarines to an active directive which involved the attack of the vessels by Coastal Command aircraft.|$|E

DCI Harry Hutchinson acts as Neculai's informant, but John is convinced that PC Billy Jackson is the informant. John later learns that Harry is Neculai's informant after catching him leaving Neculai's warehouse, {{which leads to a}} hostage situation involving Kate and her children. John and Luke rescue Kate and the children; although they are shot in the process, they both survive. Newly appointed PC Lucy Slater is stabbed while out on duty.

The hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim, including Robbins, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. These doctors and Torres buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Everything seems to go well for Arizona and Callie, until a big storm hits the hospital now named after Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey. In the last episode of the ninth season, Arizona cheats on Callie with Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton). Callie soon discovers Arizona's infidelity by seeing her wedding ring pinned to Dr. Boswell's scrub top. In {{the aftermath}} of discovery, both Callie and Arizona share their feelings and it is revealed that Arizona does not forgive Callie for making the call to amputate her leg. Callie is heartbroken and Arizona states that Callie lost nothing in the crash, to which Callie responds that she, apparently, lost Arizona.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of that record, Holy Cross got into the 1947 NCAA Tournament as the last seed in the then only eight-team tournament. In the first game, they {{defeated}} Navy 55-47 in front of a sell-out crowd at Madison Square Garden. Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points, thanks to Navy coach Ben Carnevale's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his players back off from Mullaney, who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter. In the semifinal game, the Crusaders faced CCNY, coached by Nat Holman, one of the game's earliest innovators. Led by Kaftan's thirty points, Holy Cross easily defeated the Beavers 60–45. In the championship game, the Crusaders faced Oklahoma, coached by Bruce Drake, in another sold-out game at Madison Square Garden. Kaftan followed up his 30-point semifinal heroics with a mere 18 points in the title game, which was far more than enough for the team to defeat the Sooners 58–47. Cousy played poorly, however, scoring only four points on 2-for-13 shots. Holy Cross became the first New England college to win the NCAA tournament. On their arrival back in Worcester, the team was given a hero's welcome by about ten thousand cheering fans who met their train at Union Station.|$|E
5|$|When Prince John rebelled in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset {{put aside}} their feud to quash the uprising. Geoffrey {{strengthened}} Doncaster's defences {{and went to}} the aid of Puiset, who was besieging Tickhill Castle. In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of Sheriff of Yorkshire for himself. Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the primacy of England, which Canterbury claimed and York disputed. Walter's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over York and all of England. Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month. King Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation, and {{even went so far as}} to restore some of his confiscated estates. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey's actions, which led to Geoffrey's estates being confiscated once again. Geoffrey appealed to the king, who was then in Maine; Richard over-ruled Walter, restored Geoffrey's estates, and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow.|$|E
