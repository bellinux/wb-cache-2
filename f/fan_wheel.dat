50|$|Variable drive fans may use {{hydraulic}} or magnetic couplings (between the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> {{shaft and}} the motor shaft) that allow variable speed. The fan speed controls are often integrated into automated systems {{to maintain the}} desired <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> speed.|$|E
50|$|Axial {{fan types}} have <b>fan</b> <b>wheels</b> with diameters that usually range {{from less than}} a foot (0.3 meters) to over 30 feet (9 m), {{although}} axial cooling tower <b>fan</b> <b>wheels</b> may exceed 82 feet (25 m) in diameter.|$|R

50|$|The <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> can {{be linked}} {{directly}} to the shaft of an electric motor. This means that the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> speed {{is identical to the}} motor's rotational speed. With this type of fan drive mechanism, the fan speed cannot be varied unless the motor speed is adjustable. Air conditioning automatically provides faster speed because colder air is denser.|$|E

50|$|Some {{electronics}} {{manufacturers have}} made centrifugal fans with external rotor motors (the stator {{is inside the}} rotor), and the rotor is directly mounted on the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> (impeller).|$|E

50|$|Forward-curved blades, as in Figure 3(a), {{curve in}} the {{direction}} of the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel's</b> rotation. These are especially sensitive to particulates. Forward-curved blades provide a low noise level and relatively small air flow with a high increase in static pressure.|$|R
50|$|Mixed-flow fans - The {{gas flow}} {{patterns}} these fans produce resemble {{a combination of}} axial and centrifugal patterns, although the <b>fan</b> <b>wheels</b> often appear similar to centrifugal wheels. There are various types of mixed-flow fans, including gas-tight high-pressure fans and blowers.|$|R
50|$|The {{fan drive}} determines {{the speed of}} the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> (impeller) {{and the extent to which}} this speed can be varied. There are three basic types of fan drives.|$|E

The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|R
50|$|Backward {{inclined}} - These {{fans have}} simple flat blades, backwardly inclined {{to match the}} velocity pattern of the air passing through the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> for high-efficiency operation. These fans are typically used in high-volume, relatively low-pressure, clean air applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{centrifugal}} design {{uses the}} centrifugal force {{generated by a}} rotating disk, with blades mounted {{at right angles to}} the disk, to impart movement to the air or gas and increase its pressure. The assembly of the hub, disk and blades is known as the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel,</b> and often includes other components with aerodynamic or structural functions. The centrifugal <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> is typically contained within a scroll-shaped fan housing, resembling the shell of the nautilus sea creature with a central hole. The air or gas inside the spinning fan is thrown off the outside of the wheel, to an outlet at the housing's largest diameter. This simultaneously draws more air or gas into the wheel through the central hole http://www.howden.com/en/Products/default.htm. Inlet and outlet ducting are often attached to the fan's housing, to supply and/or exhaust the air or gas to the industry's requirements.|$|E

The blades {{are arranged to}} rotate upon a control-pitch hub. The <b>fan</b> <b>wheel</b> will spin at a constant speed. As the hub moves toward the rotor, the blades increase their angle of attack {{and an increase in}} flow results.|$|E

5000|$|Backward-curved blades, as in Figure 3(b), curve {{against the}} {{direction}} of the <b>fan</b> <b>wheel's</b> rotation. Smaller blowers may have backward-inclined blades, which are straight, not curved. Larger backward-inclined/-curved blowers have blades whose backward curvatures mimic that of an airfoil cross section, but both designs provide good operating efficiency with relatively economical construction techniques. These types of blowers are designed to handle gas streams with low to moderate particulate loadings [...] They can be easily fitted with wear protection but certain blade curvatures can be prone to solids build-up.. Backward curved wheels are often heavier than corresponding forward-curved equivalents, as they run at higher speeds and require stronger construction.|$|R
50|$|The axial design uses {{axial forces}} {{to achieve the}} {{movement}} of the air or gas, spinning a central hub with blades extending radially from its outer diameter. The fluid is moved parallel to the fan wheel's shaft, or axis of rotation.

5000|$|Radial tipped - These <b>fans</b> have <b>wheels</b> {{that are}} {{backward}} curved, {{but in a}} way slightly different from backward curved fans. Backward curved <b>fans</b> have <b>wheels</b> whose blades curve outward, while radial-tip fans' blades are curved inward and radial at their tips (hence the name [...] "radial tip"), while still in a backwardly-curved configuration. Their curvature can also be thought of as radial at the tips but gradually sloping toward the direction of rotation. This rugged design is used in high-volume flow rate applications when the pressure requirement is rather high and erosion resistance is necessary. It offers medium efficiencies. A common application is the dirty side of a baghouse or precipitator. The design is more compact than airfoil, backward curved or backward inclined fans.|$|R
