40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of digital electrocardiographs, high-pass filters have been necessary for successful analog-to-digital conversion with a reasonable amplitude resolution. On the other hand, such high-pass filters may distort the diagnostically significant ST-segment of the ECG, which {{can result in a}} misleading diagnosis. We present an inverting filter that successfully undoes the effects of a 0. 05 Hz single pole high-pass filter. The inverting filter has been tested on more than 1600 clinical ECGs with one-minute durations and produces a negligible mean RMS-error of 3. 1 * 10 (- 8) LSB. Alternative, less strong inverting filters have also been tested, as have different applications of the filters with respect to rounding of the signals after filtering. A design scheme for the alternative inverting filters has been suggested, based on the maximum strength of the filter. With the use of the suggested filters, it is possible to recover the original DC-coupled ECGs from AC-coupled ECGs, at least when a 0. 05 Hz first order <b>digital</b> single <b>pole</b> high-pass filter is used for the AC-coupling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{method for}} the design of IIR <b>digital</b> filters with <b>pole</b> radius {{constraint}} based on the argument principle (AP) from complex analysis is proposed. Unlike the stability constraints available in the literature which are sufficient but not necessary stability constraints, the proposed AP-based stability condition is both sufficient and necessary. We show that weighted leastsquares and minimax designs of robustly stable IIR filters can be accomplished in convenient convex programming settings where the proposed stability criterion can easily be incorporated as a single equality constraint that does not depend on any parameters other then filter’s denominator coefficients. Design examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms. I...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{growth in}} Internet {{use in the}} 1990 s {{resulted}} in many digital pioneers viewing new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) as a means to radically empower people through new global connections and extensive social capital. This has extended into an interest in exploring how ICTs can contribute to international development, and particularly in the field of ICT for development (ICT 4 D). Evidence from the minority and majority worlds has tempered some of this initial enthusiasm and visions of technological determinism. This article is structured around a piece of coproduced writing to reflect on a project in a deprived neighbourhood in Edinburgh, Scotland, to empower a community through new technology and digital art. The approach involved social history {{in the form of an}} archive of images of the neighbourhood, a blog and Facebook page, and a range of physical outputs including social history walking guides and a <b>digital</b> totem <b>pole.</b> The article sets the coproduced paper in the broader literature on ICTs in community development to draw out lessons on the challenges and also the strengths of using novel methods to engage communities. While ICTs cannot develop extensive social capital within deprived neighbourhoods, it was clear that they can offer low-cost ways for institutional social capital to be developed improving partnership working...|$|R
40|$|Before {{the rise}} of digital new media {{technology}} in 2002, 2 ̆ 7 old 2 ̆ 7 media at its heart displayed a fundamental division between sender and receiver, a division which {{for a long time}} had structurally, materially and politically conditioned {{the nature of the relationship}} between 2 ̆ 7 old 2 ̆ 7 media and war. Within the recently emerging digital new media technology, however, this age-old separation between sender and receiver has been eroded. Thus, alongside traditional media platforms, an entirely new form of media technology has arisen. This development has transformed the hitherto multipolar nature of the old media landscape and has led to a heteropolar global media landscape, in which the relationship between media and war has been altered. By exploring how <b>digital</b> new media <b>poles</b> are forming and old media poles are evolving, this article examines how this seismic shift in the global media landscape requires a redefinition of the understanding of the nature of the relationship between media and conflict today. © 201...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFrequency transposition {{is the process}} of raising or lowering the frequency content (pitch) of an audio signal. The hearing impaired community has the greatest interest in the application of frequency transposition. Though several analog and digital frequency transposing hearing aid systems have been built and tested, this investigates a possible <b>digital</b> processing alternative. <b>Pole</b> shifting, in the z-domain of an autoregressive (all pole) model of speech was proven to be a viable theory for changing frequency content Since linear predictive coding (LPC) techniques are used to code, analyze and synthesize speech, with the resulting LPC coefficients related to the coefficients of an equivalent autoregressive model, a linear relationships between LPC coefficients and frequency transposition is explored. This theoretical relationship is first established using a pure sine wave and then is extended into processing speech. The resulting speech synthesis experiments failed to substantiate the conjectures of this thesis. However, future research avenues are suggested that may lead to a viable approach to transpose speech. [URL] United States NAv...|$|R
40|$|Non-destructive {{testing for}} drying defects in Eucalyptus grandis utility poles {{would be highly}} advantageous. These defects can {{negatively}} affect creosote preservative treatment and in-service performance. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess correlations between drying defects such as surface checking, honeycombing, collapse, their parameters and moisture content (MC) gradient in poles, to possibly find a simple and quick but reliable method to assess internal and external drying defects. Defects and moisture content gradients were measured in 39 kiln-dried E. grandis poles. After measuring surface check length, width and depth using a measuring tape, a ruler and a depth gauge, destructive sampling at the theoretical ground line (TGL) was done to measure the MC gradient between the shell and core of <b>poles.</b> <b>Digital</b> image analysis of cross-sections of discs cut at TGL was used to measure honeycomb check width, length and area, as well as counting individual closed surface checks. Collapse was assessed using qualitative methods. Results showed that honeycombing and collapse were positively, and surface checking and MC gradient were negatively correlated. Surface check width, length and depth were also correlated. Honeycomb count, check width, length and area were strongly correlated. It was concluded that measuring any of these surface check and/ or honeycomb parameters may give meaningful deductions about the extent of surface checking and honeycombing respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of various mobile laser scanning systems was tested on an established urban test field. The test {{was connected to}} the European Spatial Data Research (EuroSDR) project “Mobile Mapping—Road Environment Mapping Using Mobile Laser Scanning”. Several commercial and research systems collected laser point cloud data on the same test field. The system comparisons focused on planimetric and elevation errors using a filtered <b>digital</b> elevation model, <b>poles,</b> and building corners as the reference objects. The results revealed the high quality of the point clouds generated by all of the tested systems under good GNSS conditions. With all professional systems properly calibrated, the elevation accuracy was better than 3. 5 cm up to a range of 35 m. The best system achieved a planimetric accuracy of 2. 5 cm over a range of 45 m. The planimetric errors increased as a function of range, but moderately so if the system was properly calibrated. The main focus on mobile laser scanning development in the near future should be on the improvement of the trajectory solution, especially under non-ideal conditions, using both improvements in hardware and software. Test fields are relatively easy to implement in built environments and they are feasible for verifying and comparing the {{performance of}} different systems and also for improving system calibration to achieve optimum quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{specific}} cases, kiln drying {{prior to}} preservative treatment is the prescribed method of utility pole seasoning in South Africa. The slow drying nature of Eucalyptus grandis poles makes rapid kiln drying potentially detrimen-tal due to development of defects such as excessive surface checking, honeycomb and collapse. To control these defects {{while maintaining the}} fastest drying rate possible, the effect of drying schedule on the drying quality of E. grandis poles was investigated. Full length pole drying was simulated in thirty 2. 1 m long butt sections of poles of which the top ends were end sealed. Three industrially used schedules that differed in dry and wet bulb temperature and duration of drying (Tdb, Twb and time) were chosen: 80 °C/ 59 °C/ 8 days, 80 °C/ 69 °C/ 10 days and 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days. Surface check length of each pole was measured after drying. Cross-sections cut at the theoretical ground line (TGL), 1. 5 m from the butt end, were {{used to measure the}} moisture content (MC) gradient between the shell and core of <b>poles.</b> <b>Digital</b> image analysis of cross-sections of discs cut at TGL was used to measure the area of honeycomb and disc cross-section. Collapse was assessed qualitatively. With all three schedules, MC’s in the pole cores at the end of drying were still very high. Some poles were above 25 % in the outer 25 mm of the treatable zone. The 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days schedule generated the highest surface check total length. A reduction in the wet bulb depression o...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Digital</b> History {{department}} (<b>Pôle</b> histoire numérique) of the LARHRA {{laboratory in}} Lyon has developed since ten years the symogih. org project (Système modulaire de gestion de l’information historique), a method and a platform to collaboratively produce structured data {{and use them}} for semantically annotate TEI encoded texts. The aim of the project {{is not only to}} connect individual historical research and data production with a collectively managed data repository, but also to interlink the platform’s data to those published by other data providers, e. g. authority files of national libraries, museums and other cultural heritage institutions, and to format them according to widespread standards, like the CIDOC-CRM. In this way the data will be available, interoperable and reusable for new platform-internal and external research projects, and for the public. In the first part of my talk, I will describe the method the symogih. org project has adopted to collaboratively develop and maintain an ontology for historical data which can be indefinitely extended according to the needs of present participants and of new research projects. Further, I’ll report about the ongoing process of refining the symogih. org ontology using the CIDOC-CRM modelling method. This process is aimed at developing a CRM extension for historical data that will be managed by a consortium and be opened to any interested project and to further development according to the specific needs of participant projects. In the second part, I’ll give an account of a method to semantically annotate XML encoded texts using some basic tags and properties of the TEI standard, combining them with the flexibility and richness of an ontology for historical data. The workflow integrates the corpus analysis environment TXM for exploring the text from a linguistic perspective before annotating it semantically with the project ontology. I’ll then outline how this method allows to analyse the terminology of a historical text corpus and collaboratively manage a conceptual thesaurus...|$|R
