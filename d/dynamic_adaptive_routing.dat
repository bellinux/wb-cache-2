40|$|A novel {{adaptive}} routing algorithm - Efficient <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Routing</b> (EDAR) is proposed {{to provide a}} fault-tolerant capability for Networks-on-Chip (NoC) via an efficient routing path selection mechanism. It {{is based on a}} weighted path selection strategy, which exploits the status of real-time NoC traffic made available via monitor modules. The key performance goal is to maintain throughput under congested and faulty conditions via effective routing path decisions. In the proposed EDAR, port weights are calculated in real-time according to the channel status – Idle/Busy/Congested/Faulty, and the port with the lowest weighting is ranked as the near-optimal route to forward packets. This mechanism enables the router to bypass congested ports and tolerate faulty ports. To assess the latency and throughput of the proposed routing algorithm, several traffic patterns for both fault-free and faulty NoCs were evaluated. Results show that EDAR can achieve higher throughput compared to other state of the art routing algorithms under various traffic patterns and levels of injected faults. In addition, the hardware area overhead for EDAR is demonstrated to have a reasonably low cost which maintains scalability for large NoC implementations...|$|E

AN is an enabling technology for Network Centric Warfare. AN is different from the terrestrial mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and the wire-line internet, both in terms of network capability and underlying assumptions. The backbone nodes of the AN are envisioned to fly in pre-planned orbits whose knowledge can be exploited for efficient routing. In this paper we propose a <b>dynamic</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing</b> protocol that uses known trajectories of the AN nodes to enhance performance. Our routing protocol has two components: (1) a Mobility Aware Routing Protocol (MARP), that routes traffic based on the knowledge of network topology with respect to time and makes preemptive decisions to minimize packet losses due to link failure and discover better routes, and (2) a Mobility Dissemination protocol (MDP) that informs all network nodes of any deviation from the preplanned behavior.

Many attackers can consume the limited network energy, by the method of capturing some legal nodes then control them to start DoS and flooding attack, which is difficult to be detected by only the classic cryptography based techniques with common routing protocols in wireless sensor networks. We argue that under the condition of attacking, existing routing schemes are low energy-efficient and vulnerable to inside attack due to their deterministic nature. To avoid the energy consumption caused by the inside attack initiated by the malicious nodes, this paper proposes a novel energy efficiency routing. Under our design, each node computes the trust value of its 1 -hop neighbors based on their multiple behaviors attributes evaluation and builds a trust management by the trust value. By this way, sensor nodes act as router to achieve <b>dynamic</b> and <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing,</b> where the node can select much energy efficiency and faithful forwarding node from its neighbors according to their remaining energy and trust values in the next process of data collection.

Six controllers and twelve transport pilots participated in a human-in-the-loop simulation of arrival operations into Louisville International Airport with interval management requirements.

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 In recent times, {{the primary focus}} of every ISP is to deliver high quality of service for multimedia applications. Due to ever-increasing network traffic, it is challenging for ISPs to accomplish optimal network conditions. To achieve high-quality services implementation of network monitoring and QoS routing algorithm is inevitable. Also, several modifications occur while network planning especially in managing physical devices to host network services required to achieve QoS routing. Dynamic routing in physical network hardware is not suitable for cost effective business models. Therefore, to lower operational and capital expenditure, we propose a technique called <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing</b> managed with the support of SDN (Software Defined Networking and NFV (Network Function Virtualization). We introduce an economical routing model which will assist in meeting the demands of the consumers {{and at the same time}} provide significant savings in product cost and usability.
