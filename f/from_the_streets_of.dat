25|$|At {{the time}} of the Mayflowers sailing in September 1620, the {{children}} were aged between four and eight and classed as indentured servants and were to be labour in the colony of (Northern) Virginia (present day Long Island). This was the Mayflower's intended destination until winter weather forced the ship to anchor at Cape Cod. A number of colonists travelled as paying passengers on the Mayflower. Exactly what explanation was given for the More children's presence is not known as many homeless waifs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> London were sent to the New World as laborers.|$|E
25|$|Schepens {{invented the}} {{binocular}} indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO), which is routinely {{used to look}} at the retina. His original BIO is now {{in the collection of the}} Smithsonian Institution. It has been reported that Schepens assembled the prototype for his BIO from metal scraps collected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> London during the German blitz. He was also a pioneer of surgical techniques such as scleral buckling for the repair of retinal detachments. The use of these techniques has raised the success of retinal reattachment surgery from 40% to 90%. During his career, Schepens wrote four books and over 340 research papers.|$|E

25|$|In the 315-member Senate of the Republic, Berlusconi's {{coalition}} won 174 {{seats to}} Veltroni's 134. In the lower house, Berlusconi's conservative bloc {{led by a}} margin of 9% of the vote: 46.5% (344 seats) to 37.5% (246 seats). Berlusconi capitalised on discontent over the nation's stagnating economy and the unpopularity of Prodi's government. His declared top priorities were to remove piles of rubbish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Naples and to improve the state of the Italian economy, which had under-performed the rest of the Eurozone for years. He also said he was open to working with the opposition, and pledged to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion, reform the judicial system and reduce public debt. He intended {{to reduce the number of}} Cabinet ministers to 12. Berlusconi and his ministers (Berlusconi IV Cabinet) were sworn in on 8 May 2008.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the street vendors {{disappeared}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Latvia due to new health laws that banned its sale on the street. Economic disruptions forced many kvass factories to close. The Coca-Cola Company moved in and quickly dominated the market for soft drinks. In 1998 the local soft drink industry adapted by selling bottled kvass and launching aggressive marketing campaigns. This surge in sales was stimulated by the fact that kvass sold for about half the price of Coca-Cola. In just three years, kvass constituted as much as 30% of the soft drink market in Latvia, while the market share of Coca-Cola fell from 65% to 44%. The Coca-Cola company had losses in Latvia of about $1 million in 1999 and 2000. The situation was similar in the other Baltic countries and Russia. Coca-Cola responded by buying kvass manufacturers as well as making kvass at their own soft drink plants.|$|E
25|$|Rolfe took an {{interest}} in photography throughout his life, but never achieved any more than basic competence. While he began to experiment with photography when he was a schoolmaster, it was his time in Rome in 1889–90 that introduced him to the work of the 'Arcadian' photographers Wilhelm von Gloeden and Guglielmo Plüschow. His seminary, the Scots College, was quite close to Plüschow's studio in via Sardegna, just off the via Veneto, and when Rolfe was expelled from the College and came under the benevolent patronage of the Duchess Sforza Cesarini, he began his own photographic efforts in imitation of von Gloeden and Plüschow. His models were the local ragazzi <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Genzano di Roma, a town dominated by the Duchess's palazzo. These youths were later to become the principal characters in Rolfe's Toto stories, published first in The Yellow Book in 1895–96 and later collected in Stories Toto Told Me in 1898 and In His Own Image in 1901.|$|E

25|$|In {{that same}} year, {{by his own}} account, Samuel went to his {{employer}} and a More family friend, Lord Zouche, Lord President of the Council of Wales, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Privy Counselor, {{to draw up a}} plan for the disposition of the children. Zouche had been {{an active member of the}} Virginia Company and in 1617 he invested £100 in an expedition to the Colony of Virginia, which is where the Mayflower was supposed to have landed. It was his actions that were instrumental in putting the More children on the Mayflower. At that time, children were routinely rounded up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as labourers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were over-ridden by the Privy Council, namely, Lord Zouche. Most people thought it a death sentence and indeed, many did not survive either the voyage or the harsh climate, disease and scarcity of fresh food for which they were ill-prepared.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mayflower {{passenger}} list, {{just over}} a third of the passengers were Puritan Separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Others were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of Mayflower pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618. Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council. In 1959, it was conclusively shown that the four More children were sent to America because they were deemed illegitimate. Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, but Richard lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} a number of indentured {{servants}} among the colonists. [...] Indentured servants were mostly poor children whose families were receiving church relief and [...] "many homeless waifs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> London sent as laborers".|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after work}} {{began on the}} Patapsco Tunnel Project on April 7, 1955, several changes {{were made to the}} plans for the {{approach}} highways. [...] The northern terminus at US 40 was altered to allow an extension from US 40 to {{the southern end of the}} future Northeastern Expressway (now John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway). [...] As a result, additional connections with US 40 were planned for the area around present day Exit 14. [...] In addition, the south approach was to have a tie-in to the Glen Burnie Bypass (now I-97) then under construction. [...] The tunnel and approach highways were completed and opened November 29, 1957 as the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, respectively. [...] The opening of the tunnel and approach roads removed a significant amount of traffic <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Baltimore and eliminated 51 traffic lights from the route of motorists passing through the city.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} Broadway production, {{the stage was}} completely open, with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience. [...] The proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding. [...] Wagner's spare set was painted in shades of grey with street graffiti stenciled on the stage. [...] The stage was raked, and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree. [...] This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast had gathered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> New York. [...] These included a life-size papier-mâché bus driver, the head of Jesus, and a neon marquee of the Waverly movie theater in Greenwich Village. [...] Potts' costumes were based on hippie street clothes, made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture. [...] Some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms, bell bottom jeans with Ukrainian embroidery, tie dyed T-shirts and a red white and blue fringed coat. [...] Early productions were primarily reproductions of this basic design.|$|E
