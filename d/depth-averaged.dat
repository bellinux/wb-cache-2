Although the method is easily extended to transient flow, only steady flow is considered here. The flow field is represented spectrally in the depthwise direction in terms of orthonormal shape functions, which together with the Galerkin projection lead {{to a system of}} ordinary differential equations that can be solved using standard methods. The method is particularly effective for nonlinear flow, including nonlinearities of geometrical or material origins. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated for a flow with inertia, and, unlike the <b>depth-averaging</b> method, is not limited to a flow at small Reynolds number. The problem is closely related to high-speed lubrication flow. The validity of the spectral representation is assessed by examining the convergence of the method, and comparing it with the fully two-dimensional finite-element solution, and the widely used <b>depth-averaging</b> method from shallow-water theory. It is found that a low number of modes are usually sufficient to secure convergence and accuracy. The influence of inertia is examined on the velocity and pressure fields. The pressure distributions reflect excellent agreement between the low-order spectral method and the finite-element solution, even at moderately high Reynolds number.

40|$|Heat {{and salt}} {{balances}} over the New England shelf are examined using 10 month time series of currents, temperature, and salinity from a four element moored array and surface heat and freshwater fluxes from a meteorological buoy. A principal result is {{closure of the}} heat budget to 10 W m− 2. The seasonal variation in <b>depth‐average</b> temperature, from 14 °C in September to 5 °C in March, was primarily due to the seasonal variation in surface heat flux and a heat loss in winter caused by along‐shelf advection of colder water from the northeast. Conductivity sensor drifts precluded closing the salt balance on time scales of months or longer. For time scales of days to weeks, <b>depth‐average</b> temperature and salinity variability were primarily due to advection. Advective heat and salt flux divergences were strongest and most complex in winter, when there were large cross‐shelf temperature and salinity gradients at the site due to the shelf‐slope front that separates cooler, fresher shelf water from warmer, saltier slope water. Onshore flow of warm, salty slope water near the bottom and offshore flow of cooler, fresher shelf water due to persistent eastward (upwelling‐favorable) winds caused a temperature increase of nearly 3 °C and a salinity increase of 0. 8 in winter. Along‐shelf barotropic tidal currents caused a temperature decrease of 1. 5 °C and a salinity decrease of 0. 7.

40|$|Shallow flow {{models are}} used for {{a large number of}} {{applications}} including weather forecasting, open channel hydraulics and simulation-based natural hazard assessment. In these applications the shallowness of the process motivates <b>depth-averaging.</b> While the shallow flow formulation is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency, it also comes at the price of losing vertical information such as the flow's velocity profile. This gives rise to a model error, which limits the shallow flow model's predictive power and is often not explicitly quantifiable. We propose the use of vertical moments to overcome this problem. The shallow moment approximation preserves information on the vertical flow structure while still making use of the simplifying framework of <b>depth-averaging.</b> In this article, we derive a generic shallow flow moment system of arbitrary order starting from a set of balance laws, which has been reduced by scaling arguments. The derivation is based on a fully vertically resolved reference model with the vertical coordinate mapped onto the unit interval. We specify the shallow flow moment hierarchy for kinematic and Newtonian flow conditions and present 1 D numerical results for shallow moment systems up to third order. Finally, we assess their performance with respect to both the standard shallow flow equations as well as with respect to the vertically resolved reference model. Our results show that depending on the parameter regime, e. g. friction and slip, shallow moment approximations significantly reduce the model error in shallow flow regimes and have a lot of potential to increase the predictive power of shallow flow models, while keeping them computationally cost efficient...|$|R

40|$|Most {{previous}} {{solutions for}} groundwater flow induced by localized recharge assumed either aquifer incompressibility or two-dimensional {{flow in the}} absence of the vertical flow. This paper develops a new three-dimensional flow model for hydraulic head variation due to localized recharge in a rectangular unconfined aquifer with four boundaries under the Robin condition. A governing equation describing spatiotemporal head distributions is employed. The first-order free-surface equation with a source term defining a constant recharge rate over a rectangular area is used to depict water table movement. The solution to the model for the head is developed with the methods of Laplace transform and double-integral transform. Based on Duhamel's theorem, the present solution is applicable to flow problems accounting for arbitrary time-dependent recharge rates. The solution to <b>depth-average</b> head can then be obtained by integrating the head solution to elevation and dividing the result by the aquifer thickness. The use of a rectangular aquifer domain has two merits. One is that the integration for estimating the <b>depth-average</b> head can be analytically achieved. The other is that existing solutions based on aquifers of infinite extent can be considered as special cases of the present solution before the time when the aquifer boundary had an effect on head predictions. With the help of the present solution, the assumption of neglecting the vertical flow effect on the temporal head distribution at an observation point outside a recharge region can be assessed by a dimensionless parameter related to the aquifer horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities, initial aquifer thickness, and the shortest distance between the observation point and the edge of the recharge region. The validity of assuming aquifer incompressibility is dominated by the ratio of the aquifer specific yield to its storage coefficient. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the head response to the change in each of the aquifer parameters...|$|R

40|$|The fate of {{reactive}} tracers {{is often}} modelled by <b>depth-averaged</b> equations. When integrating the depth-resolved equations, {{it appears that}} the term describing the settling of particles is dependent on the concentration just above the bottom. Because in a <b>depth-averaged</b> framework this quantity is not available, the settling term needs to be parameterised. The most natural choice is to make the settling flux dependent on the average concentration. This approximation is acceptable if the water column is well mixed, but these conditions are not necessarily met in real applications. Therefore, this study aims at assessing and understanding the error made by using a <b>depth-averaged</b> model in a range of realistic conditions. For the definition of these conditions, typical values for the Scheldt Estuary and the Dutch-Belgian coast were taken. The realistic inspiration for the reactive tracer in this study is the fecal bacterium Escherichia coli, whose own dynamics are characterised by settling and gradual decay by mortality. In an attempt to understand the relative importance of several factors like settling, mortality, mixing and stratification on the error made by a <b>depth-averaged</b> approach, a number of simplified test cases were investigated. It follows that, as expected, the error is acceptable if the situation is mixing-dominated. However, the effect of mortality and stratification was less obvious in advance. For instance, it appeared that errors can also be significant if settling and mortality have the same characteristic timescales.

Vergence position immediately after stimulus presentation was measured using dichoptic nonius lines. Since the stimulus was not visible after {{the onset of the}} vergence movement, the experiment accesses the initiation of vergence rather than its eventual result. In the unequivocal stimuli (one depth plane), elicited vergence tends to reduce disparity. Disparities of 0. 5 – 1 deg are most effective which is in accordance with earlier findings. If two depth planes are presented, elicited vergence lies between the two planes, approaching the plane with higher dot density and/or dot contrast. In quantitative measurements, we show that the <b>depth-averaging</b> mechanism uses signal power per depth plane as a weight. Therefore, the relative pulling strength of dot density compared with dot contrast follows a power law with exponent 2.
