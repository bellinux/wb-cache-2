40|$|Europe's first polar-orbiting weather satellite, METOPA, was {{launched}} by a Soyuz launcher from Baikonur Cosmodrome on the 19 th of October of 2006. The routine operations of METOP-A are conducted by EUMETSAT (European Organization for Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) {{in the frame}} of the <b>European</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>System</b> mission (EPS). The METOP-A Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) operations have been performed by ESA/ESOC. The Flight Dynamics Orbit Determination and Control team (OD&C) at ESOC was in charge of correcting the S/C orbit as delivered by the launcher {{in such a way that}} EUMETSAT would be able to acquire the reference orbit with a drift-stop manoeuvre approximately two weeks after a LEOP of 3 days and Hand-Over to the EUMETSAT Control Centre (EUMETSAT-CC) in Darmstadt, Germany. The various strict constraints and the short amount of time available for ESOC operations made this task challenging. Several strategies were prepared before launch and analysed during LEOP based on the achieved injection orbit. This paper presents the different manoeuvre strategies investigated and finally applied to acquire the operational orbit, reporting as well the details of its execution and final achieved state...|$|E
40|$|The highly {{accurate}} {{measurements of the}} hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) are used in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), atmospheric chemistry and climate monitoring. As the second generation of the <b>European</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>System</b> (EPS-SG) is being developed, {{a new generation of}} IASI instruments has been designed to fly on board the MetOp-SG constellation: IASI New Generation (IASI-NG). In order to prepare the arrival of this new instrument, and to evaluate its impact on NWP and atmospheric chemistry applications, a set of IASI and IASI-NG simulated data was built and made available to the public to set a common framework for future impact studies. This paper describes the information available in this database and the procedure followed to run the IASI and IASI-NG simulations. These simulated data were evaluated by comparing IASI-NG to IASI observations. The result is also presented here. Additionally, preliminary impact studies of the benefit of IASI-NG compared to IASI on the retrieval of temperature and humidity in a NWP framework are also shown in the present work. With a channel dataset located in the same wave numbers for both instruments, we showed an improvement of the temperature retrievals along all the atmosphere with a maximum in the troposphere with IASI-NG and a lower benefit for the tropospheric humidity...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The EUMETSAT <b>Polar</b> <b>System</b> (EPS) is the European {{contribution}} to the Initial Joint <b>Polar</b> <b>System</b> (IJPS) established with NOAA [1]. The IJPS will provide global meteorological data {{from a series of}} European and American sun-synchronous polar orbiting satellites, replacing the current NOAA K-L-M series. With EPS, EUMETSAT is committed to taking over the morning orbit service from NOAA who will continue to be responsible for the afternoon service. Both services are co-coordinated and integrated on the basis of exchange of data, instruments and operational services (Fig. 1). The EUMETSAT Programme is approved and under development in the framework of co-operations involving ESA, NOAA and CNES. Ultimately, with the implementation of the EPS, Europe will contribute to the polar orbiting component of the space-based Global Observing System of the World Weather Watch. Fig. 1.
