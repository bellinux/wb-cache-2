5|$|Contemporary sea-{{inspired}} novels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Joseph Conrad, Herman Wouk, and Herman Melville; {{poems about}} the sea <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Rudyard Kipling and John Masefield. The sea has inspired much music {{over the centuries}} including sea shanties, Richard Wagner's The Flying Dutchman, Claude Debussy's La mer (1903–05), Charles Villiers Stanford's Songs of the Sea (1904) and Songs of the Fleet (1910), Edward Elgar's Sea Pictures (1899) and Ralph Vaughan Williams' A Sea Symphony (1903–1909). Burial at sea has been practised in various ways by {{countries around the world}} since the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were created by}} American writer Edward Stratemeyer, {{the founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book-packaging firm, and the books <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> many different ghostwriters over the years. The books are published under the collective pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works are thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, {{it is possible that}} women employed others to write documents.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to the low}} {{population}} of the islands, most of {{the literature of the}} islands <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> outsiders, and <b>is</b> non-fiction.

5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions on {{the nature}} of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. The scholars T. L. Heath and Marshall Clagett argued that it cannot <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in 2005, Msgr. Fleetwood, then serving with the Council of European Episcopal Conferences, gave an {{interview}} with Vatican Radio. In the interview, Fleetwood reaffirmed his positive opinion of the books, and remarked that then-Cardinal Ratzinger's letters may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> {{a member of the}} congregation's staff and simply signed by the prefect. He also stated that his and Amorth's opinions are just that, conflicting personal opinions of priests.|$|E

5|$|Drowned God {{is based}} on a forged {{manuscript}} written by Harry Horse in 1983, purported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> 19th-century poet Richard Henry Horne, who shares Horse's name. After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing Myst and 7th Guest in the mid-1990s, whereupon he decided a first person adventure game would {{be the best way to}} tell the manuscript's story.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán was {{a colonial}} Guatemalan {{historian}} of Spanish descent who wrote La Recordación Florida, also called Historia de Guatemala (History of Guatemala). The book {{was written in}} 1690 and is {{regarded as one of}} the most important works of Guatemalan history, and is the first such book to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> a criollo author. Field investigation has tended to support the estimates of indigenous population and army sizes given by Fuentes y Guzmán.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the History means they cannot <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> the same author.|$|E

5|$|Little, Brown Books has {{published}} three Glee–related young adult novels, {{all of which}} were developed in collaboration with the show's producers and writers. All three <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Sophia Lowell; the first, Glee: The Beginning, was released in August 2010 and serves as a prequel to the events of the television series. Subsequent novels include Glee: Foreign Exchange, released in February 2011, and Glee: Summer Break, released in July 2011.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{may have}} {{remained}} in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could {{be sent to the}} Imperial Capital.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eleven}} poems the Gosen Wakashū {{attributed}} to Narihira, several were really by others—for example, two were actually by Fujiwara no Nakahira {{and one by}} Ōshikōchi no Mitsune. The Shin Kokinshū and later court anthologies attribute more poems to Narihira, {{but many of these}} were likely misunderstood to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> him because of their appearance in The Tales of Ise. Some of these were probably composed after Narihira's death. Combined, poems attributed to Narihira in court anthologies total 87.|$|E

5|$|Adams wrote {{numerous}} {{letters and}} essays {{in opposition to}} the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the military occupation, an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, never to return.|$|E
5|$|Baseball and Bloomers, {{also known}} as Baseball in Bloomers, is a 1911 American silent short sports film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film stars William Garwood and is the debut of Marguerite Snow. The film focuses on a female seminary which organizes a baseball club and challenges another school to a game. The boys accept to the game with amusement and find that the women are not good at baseball. Two Harvard University baseball stars {{join the ranks of}} the girls in disguise and defeat the boys team. The script may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Lloyd Lonergan and the film may have been directed by Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. The film was released on January 6, 1911 and it received positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed could not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E

5|$|Those {{opposed to}} the new {{government}} began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move Edward to the more secure location of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, Edward was kept {{in the custody of}} Mortimer's son-in-law, Thomas Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance. It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the Lament of Edward II, was once thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian Antonia Gransden is inclined {{to believe that the}} work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the Liber, suggests that it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the Liber specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.|$|E
5|$|In 1133, Roger of Salisbury {{secured the}} bishopric of Ely for Nigel. Ely had been without a bishop since 1131; after the two-year vacancy, King Henry made the {{appointment}} {{because he was}} settling outstanding business before leaving England to return to Normandy. At this time Henry also appointed Geoffrey Rufus to Durham, and Æthelwold to the newly created Diocese of Carlisle. Nigel was consecrated on 1 October 1133 at Lambeth by William de Corbeil—who was by then Archbishop of Canterbury—possibly {{with the assistance of}} Roger of Salisbury. Nigel continued to hold the office of treasurer until 1136, when he was replaced by a relative, Adelelm, although the historian C. Warren Hollister placed his departure from the office in 1133 with his appointment to Ely. The Constitutio domus regis, or Establishment of the King's Household, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Nigel, or possibly for his use, and probably was composed around 1135.|$|E
