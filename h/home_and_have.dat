5|$|James and Sanborn's unit {{is called}} to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An {{innocent}} Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries {{to cut off the}} locks to remove the vest, but there are too many of them. He abandons the man, who is killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and wants to return <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a son.|$|E
5|$|The double {{burden that}} single mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E

25|$|As the Packers {{were the}} {{designated}} home {{team in the}} annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the team elected to wear their green jerseys. Although both teams are known to wear their colored jerseys at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> rarely worn white at home (the Packers wore white at home for two games in 1989), the Packers decision contrasted with the Steelers decision as the home team in Super Bowl XL to wear white jerseys. Both the 2005 Steelers and 2010 Packers were number 6 seeded teams {{when they reached the}} Super Bowl, forcing them to play all of their postseason games on the road and wearing their respective white jerseys in those games.|$|E

The Bulls played at Coychurch Road but following the announcement about the setting up of the Celtic Crusaders they were invited {{to play at the}} Brewery Field by the owner Leighton Samuel. One year on they were refused permission to continue playing at the Brewery Field {{in the middle of the}} season. They were then aided by Porthcawl RFC and staged the remaining 2006 home games at the Porthcawl ground. Subsequently Porthcawl RFC have become their regular <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> even staged an amateur rugby league international there during 2008 (Wales v Ireland).|$|E

500|$|Bassist Mark Hoppus penned [...] "Adam's Song" [...] to vent these {{frustrations and}} the {{loneliness}} he experienced on the tour; {{while the other}} members had longtime girlfriends to return home to, Hoppus was single. [...] "When you're on tour, you're so lonely," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "You hang out with all your bros and it's a great time and everything, but everybody wants to come <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a girlfriend. And every time we'd fly home, Tom and [...] Scott [...] always had girlfriends waiting for them at the airport, and I didn't. It's about me being depressed and lonely out on tour, and not really having anything to come home to." [...] The couplet [...] "I couldn't wait til I got home/To pass the time in my room alone" [...] originally ended [...] "to {{get off the plane}} alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Phoenix is {{the home}} of a unique {{architectural}} tradition and community. Frank Lloyd Wright moved to Phoenix in 1937 and built his winter home, Taliesin West, and the main campus for The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Over the years, Phoenix has attracted notable architects who have made it their <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> grown successful practices. These architectural studios embrace the desert climate, and are unconventional in their approach to the practice of design. They include the Paolo Soleri (who created Arcosanti), Al Beadle, Will Bruder, Wendell Burnette, and Blank Studio architectural design studios. Another major force in architectural landscape of the city was Ralph Haver whose firm, Haver & Nunn, designed commercial, industrial and residential structures throughout the valley. [...] Of particular note was his trademark, [...] "Haver Home", which were affordable contemporary-style tract houses.|$|E
500|$|Animation {{historian}} Michael Barrier {{wrote that}} Belle [...] "becomes {{a sort of}} intellectual less by actually reading books, it seems, than by hanging out with them", but says that the film comes closer than other [...] "Disney-studio" [...] films to [...] "accepting challenges {{of the kind that}} the finest Walt Disney features met". David Whitley writes in The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework, although her role is somewhat undefined {{in the same way that}} [...] "contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> to take on the fraught, multiple responsibilities of the working mother". Whitley also notes other themes and modern influences, such as the film's critical view of Gaston's chauvinism and attitude towards nature, the cyborg-like servants, and the father's role as an inventor rather than a merchant.|$|E

500|$|She {{acknowledges}} the struggles for equality that women riders in earlier generations {{had to face}} were greater than her own, but notes that women jockeys still [...] "fight a battle." [...] In her early career, she simply tried to [...] "blend in" [...] with the male riders, but nonetheless encountered some owners and trainers who refused to hire a female jockey. She later said, [...] "I was very conscious when I raced against their horsesâ€”and when I beat them." [...] Napravnik has encountered harassment from male jockeys on the track when other riders would deliberately bump her or pen in her horse from all sides. [...] In a 2013 interview with 60 Minutes, Napravnik said that she has heard hecklers at the track yell at her to [...] "go <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a baby," [...] or [...] "go home {{and stay in the}} kitchen." [...] She repeatedly has chosen to make her mark on the track instead of getting into post-race fights. [...] Trainer Larry Jones, having witnessed other jockeys deliberately bumping into her on the track, commented, [...] "Don't do Rosie that way, because she will run over you. The girl has no fear." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1858, William Moore {{heard the}} news of the gold discoveries on the Fraser River in British Columbia. He {{immediately}} sold his Goat Island property, packed up his livestock (mostly goats) and family onto his schooner and embarked for Victoria, where he would build the family <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a fourth child, son Henry. Upon his arrival, Moore built a 15-ton barge named Blue Bird. As 30,000 gold-seekers poured into what would soon be the Colony of British Columbia, Moore made his first fortune, not in mining, but in providing transportation for the miners and delivering their supplies up the Fraser River to Fort Hope. In 1859, he replaced the cumbersome barge with a sternwheeler named the Henrietta, built by James Trahey at Victoria and launched in October. To pilot her, Moore hired Captain John Deighton, also known as [...] "Gassy Jack", who would later be renowned as the first resident of Granville, which would become Vancouver.|$|E
2500|$|After {{an exhilarating}} flight, Carter arrives at last at the abode of the gods, but finds it empty. Finally a great {{procession}} arrives with much fanfare, {{led by a}} pharaoh-like man who explains to Carter that the gods of earth have seen the city of Carter's dreams and decided to make it their <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> thus abandoned Kadath. The gods walk no more {{in the ways of}} gods, and have become instead mere denizens of the jewelled city Carter had glimpsed in his dreams. The pharaoh commands Carter to find this city, so that the natural order might be restored. [...] "It is not over unknown seas," [...] he says, [...] "but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth... These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love." [...] This mysterious man then reveals his identityhe is Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, the emissary of the Other Gods who dwell in the blackness of space.|$|E
