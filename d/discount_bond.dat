This paper provides a simple model that replicates these facts. Investing in foreign currency is like {{betting on the}} difference between your own intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) and your neighbor’s IMRS. These bets are very risky if your neighbor’s IMRS is not correlated with yours, but they provide a hedge when his IMRS is highly correlated and more volatile. If the foreign neighbors that face low interest rates also have more volatile and correlated IMRS, that accounts for the spread in excess returns in the data. (JEL: F 31, G 12) 1...|$|R

Interest rate derivative structures. 1. 1 Discount bonds {{and interest rates}} The formulae involved with interest rate modelling can get complicated. It is important to use an unambiguous scheme of notation that can be carried {{across a range of}} different models {{and at the same time}} is useful for calculations. Time 0 denotes the present. Times a, b, c, etc., denote various future times, as do s, t, u, and so on. Alphabetical order will often be used to suggest chronological order. Occasionally, we use an upper case T to draw attention to a particular date (e. g. a termination date). We use the notation Pab to denote the value at time a of a <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> maturing at time b. Attimeb, the bond pays one unit of “currency”. We fix a currency throughout here. In fact, for any class of financial assets we have a corresponding system of discount bonds. Thus, for dollars, Pab denotes the price at time a, in dollars, of a bond that pays one dollar at the maturity b. Equally, we can speak of a “sterling ” <b>discount</b> <b>bond,</b> or even a “gold ” <b>discount</b> <b>bond.</b> In the latter case, Pab could denote the price at time a, in ounces of gold, of a contract delivering one ounce of gold at time b. Occasionally, a comma will be inserted for clarity. Thus Pt,x+t denotes the value of a <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> at time t that matures at time x + t. For any fixed value of t, the system of <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> prices PtT for T ∈ [t, ∞) is called the discount-function at that time.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{discrete}} form of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton(HJM) model for the term structure of interest rates implies a linear relationship between the one period rates of return on pure <b>discount</b> <b>bonds</b> of different maturities.

Errors-in-variable regressions are developed and empirically tested using monthly returns onpure <b>discount</b> <b>bonds</b> of yearlymaturities over the period January 1970 through December 1998 and three economically different sub-periods. We show that, in general, the Ho-Lee hypothesis of constant forward rate volatilities is not tenable for the monthly data analyzed.

40|$|Introduction T he Flesaker-Hughston framework, [9], {{encompasses}} {{the set of}} general Heath-JarrowMorton (HJM) models for which interest rates are non-explosive and non-negative [5], [6], [3]. A <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> price process is specified and the terminal pricing measure (involving a <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> with terminal maturity T) is specified. The HJM framework makes use of the instantaneous forward rate process. The <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> process is generated via specification of a positive martingale process. A major advantage of the Flesaker-Hughston framework over that of HJM is that no complicated dependence of the volatility structure on the forward rates is needed to specify a positive short term interest rate process. The short rate process is by construction positive. An example of this class of (positive interest rate) models is the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross model. This model is known to fit within the HJM framework and has only recently been show...|$|E

The model is characterised by five parameters which are sufficiently flexible to reflect the prediction of the future interest rates distribution. The interest rate converges in law to a Beta distribution and has transition probabilities which are represented {{by a series of}} Jacobi polynomials. We derive the moment evaluation formula of the interest rate. We also derive the arbitrage free pure <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> price formula by a weighted series of Jacobi polynomials. Furthermore we give simple lower and upper bounds for the arbitrage free <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> price which are tight for the narrow interest rates region case.

40|$|In the "positive interest" {{models of}} Flesaker-Hughston, the nominal <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> system is {{determined}} by a one-parameter family of positive martingales. In the present paper we extend this analysis to include a variety of distributions for the martingale family, parameterised by a function that determines the behaviour of the market risk premium. These distributions include jump and diffusion characteristics that generate various properties for <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> returns. For example, one can generate skewness and excess kurtosis in the bond returns by choosing the martingale family to be given by (a) exponential gamma processes, or (b) exponential variance gamma processes. The models are "rational" {{in the sense that}} the <b>discount</b> <b>bond</b> price is given by a ratio of weighted sums of positive martingales. Our findings lead to semi-analytical formulae for the prices of options on discount bonds. A number of general results concerning Lévy interest rate models are presented as well. ...|$|E
