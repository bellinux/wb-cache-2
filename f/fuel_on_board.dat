5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the vessel {{was captured by}} the Italians and served with the Royal Italian Navy under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, she was scuttled by her crew as she had insufficient <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to reach an Allied port.|$|E
5|$|MV New Carissa was a {{freighter}} {{that ran}} aground {{on a beach}} near Coos Bay, Oregon, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to tow the bow section of the ship out to sea failed when the tow line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. <b>Fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the ship was burned off in situ with napalm, but a significant amount was also spilled from the wreckage, causing ecological damage to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E
50|$|Flying consumes fuel. The way to {{replenish}} this supply is to rescue downed pilots who bring their remaining <b>fuel</b> supplies <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many smaller {{aircraft}} have {{a maximum}} landing weight {{that is the}} same as the maximum take-off weight, in which case issues of overweight landing due to excess <b>fuel</b> being <b>on</b> <b>board</b> cannot arise.|$|R
50|$|The weight figures {{differ by}} up to 3 cwt between sources. This may simply reflect the amount of <b>fuel</b> and water <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|R
25|$|Aircraft take {{advantage}} of lower air pressure and lower temperatures by cruising at altitude to reduce energy consumption but unlike trains need to carry <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> This {{has led to the}} suggestion of conveying maglev vehicles through partially evacuated tubes or tunnels with the possibility of supplying energy from renewable sources.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday 8 October 1991 a United Airlines Boeing 747-122 N4728U made an {{emergency}} landing after its intended destination, Auckland Airport, was closed by fog. It was estimated that if the plane had continued to its planned alternate destination, Christchurch, {{it would have had}} an unacceptable 15 minutes of <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another memorable episode {{happened}} during the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix. The race was stopped just after 75% distance, after treacherous weather and a sequence of accidents, including a spin into the grass for lead Minardi driver Jos Verstappen. Stoddart later claimed that Verstappen had enough <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to last until just after the time the red flag was eventually waved, due to {{the large number of}} safety car laps. Assuming Stoddart is being truthful, Verstappen may well have won this race had he not spun.|$|E

50|$|The AAIB {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} report of its findings on 9 December. It confirmed that the rotor blades were attached, but neither they nor the fenestron tail rotor were rotating {{at the time of}} impact. No evidence of engine or gearbox failure was found and there were around 95 L of <b>fuel</b> still <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|R

25|$|After {{the pilot}} {{explained}} {{that there was}} not enough <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to reach London, he agreed to fly to Chad. He made no threats or other communication to the passengers, none of whom became aware the aircraft had been hijacked. When the aircraft entered Chadian airspace it was met by French Mirage F-1 fighter jets stationed in N'Djamena, which escorted the plane until it landed at N'Djamena International Airport at 0830 UTC, where it was immediately surrounded by Chadian troops. Twenty minutes of negotiations followed, after which the hijacker allowed all the occupants of the aircraft to leave before surrendering.|$|E
25|$|A major {{function}} of ACARS is to automatically detect and report {{the start of}} each major flight phase, called OOOI events in the industry (out of the gate, off the ground, on the ground, and into the gate). These OOOI events are detected using input from aircraft sensors mounted on doors, parking brakes, and struts. At {{the start of each}} flight phase, an ACARS message is transmitted to the ground describing the flight phase, the time at which it occurred, and other related information such as the amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> or the flight origin and destination. These messages are used to track the status of aircraft and crews.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{downlink}} signal was lost due to distance, the hydrazine attitude control <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough {{power for the}} heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft {{would no longer be}} able to maneuver to keep its high gain antenna pointing towards Earth, and the downlink signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the X-band communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel pipework was routed over the X-band TWTAs, because when one of them was operating, this kept this part of the pipework warm enough.|$|E
50|$|On 18 May 2011, a Boeing 707 {{belonging}} to Omega Aerial Refueling Services and chartered to the U.S. Navy skidded off the runway {{and burst into}} flames shortly after landing. A reported amount of approximately 150,000 pounds of jet <b>fuel</b> was <b>on</b> <b>board</b> when the plane crashed. All three personnel aboard the aircraft survived with non life-threatening injuries.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the design optimization {{and operation of}} the Forschungszentrum Jülich’s ATR 13 autothermal reformer with conventional diesel fuels. The main objective was to eliminate undesirable by-products that can amass in the reformate. The reforming of conventional, highly aromatic diesel fuels with a high final boiling point presents a particular challenge – these fuels {{are more difficult to}} evaporate and are prone to coking; tendencies that can damage both the reformers themselves and downstream components. Here, we present several constructive and operational measures to generate a high-quality reformate from the Swedish Test Diesel SD 10 and, moreover, to prevent the formation of short-chain hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds in the reformate. This will enable the stable, long-term operation of fuel cell-based APUs utilizing conventional diesel <b>fuels</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> trucks...|$|R
25|$|Although {{molecular}} hydrogen has very {{high energy density}} on a mass basis, partly because of its low molecular weight, as a gas at ambient conditions it has very low energy density by volume. If {{it is to be}} used as <b>fuel</b> stored <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the vehicle, pure hydrogen gas must be stored in an energy-dense form to provide sufficient driving range.|$|R
25|$|One of the T-2s {{was used}} {{for a number of}} long-distance flights over the next few years, {{culminating}} in the first nonstop transcontinental flight across the United States, an idea that originated with Lt Oakley G. Kelly, one of the T-2's test pilots. The Army agreed to let Kelly have the aircraft specially modified to carry more fuel, and to install a connecting doorway between the cabin and cockpit so that he and fellow test-pilot Lieutenant John A. Macready could take turns flying and resting. An extra set of controls was also installed to facilitate the handover from one pilot to the other. As modified, the T-2 would take off with 2,350L (620US gal) of <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> making it 1,110kg (2,450lb) over its prescribed maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
25|$|The final 10-minute {{shoot-out}} {{began with}} very close lap times. As the chequered flag fell everyone {{was on their}} final lap. Button {{was the first of}} the main contenders to cross it for the final time and he didn't improve and stayed 5th. Next was Barrichello as he crossed the line and didn't improve and stayed 2nd. Kovalainen looked set for pole position but a lockup and a slide in the final corner could only get him up into second, so Hamilton didn't feel the need to complete his lap with no one else on fast laps. Hamilton got his first pole position of the season, but more importantly, it was a McLaren 1–2. Barrichello came third and a surprise 4th for Vettel as he split the Brawns. Räikkönen even with race <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> posted a lap time that was 1.279 seconds quicker than Luca Badoer's time in Q1 on low fuel. This was also the first time Lewis Hamilton had been on pole since the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|T6 {{was then}} {{operated}} by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two [...] L/40 anti-aircraft guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her. After the Italians capitulated in September 1943, T6 was scuttled by her crew [...] north of Rimini on 11 September as she had insufficient <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to reach an Allied port.|$|E
50|$|On 18 May 2011, a Boeing 707 {{belonging}} to Omega Aerial Refueling Services and chartered to the U.S. Navy skidded off the Point Mugu runway {{and burst into}} flames shortly after landing.

50|$|The {{amount of}} <b>fuel</b> carried <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a {{satellite}} directly affects its lifetime, {{therefore it is}} desirable to make the apogee kick maneuver as efficient as possible. The mass of most geostationary satellites {{at the beginning of}} its operational life in geostationary orbit is roughly half that when it separated from its vehicle in geostationary transfer orbit, with the other half having been fuel expended in the apogee kick maneuver.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{increasing}} {{fuel prices}} and upcoming pollutant emission regulations {{are becoming a}} growing concern for the shipping industry worldwide. While fuel prices will keep rising in future years, the new International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and Sulphur Emissions Control Areas (SECA) regulations will forbid ships to use heavy fuel oils at certain situations. To fulfil with these regulations, {{the next step in the}} marine shipping business will comprise the use of cleaner <b>fuels</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> as well as developing new propulsion concept. In this work a new conceptual marine propulsion system is developed, based on the integration of diesel generators with fuel cells in a 2850 metric tonne of deadweight platform supply vessel. The efficiency of the two 250 kW methanol-fed Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) system installed <b>on</b> <b>board</b> combined with the hydro dynamically optimized design of the hull of the ship will allow the ship to successfully operate at certain modes of operation while notably reduce the pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Besides the cogeneration heat obtained from the fuel cell system will be used to answer different heating needs <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the vesse...|$|R
500|$|At about 2:55 pm, the four-engine Electra {{turboprop}} {{began its}} takeoff {{run to the}} west. At {{some point during the}} takeoff run or initial climb, the number three engine failed and caught fire. The crew continued the takeoff and climb, per standard procedure, using power from the remaining three engines. The pilot radioed the control tower declaring an emergency, and the control tower cleared the flight for an immediate landing. The number three engine was engulfed in flames as the crew retracted the flaps and maneuvered the plane into a left turn back to the runway. The plane entered a 30–45 degree bank, then rapidly lost altitude and crashed into hilly terrain about [...] west-southwest of the runway, above the village of San Jerónimo. [...] The <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> caught fire and all aboard perished except the copilot, 26 year old Juan Loo, who was found in the wreckage of the cockpit badly burned but alive. Two farm workers were killed on the ground.|$|E
500|$|The 620 {{engine was}} light for its time, {{weighing}} around , compared to [...] for the Maserati V12, but in 3litre Formula One form only produced around 300brake horsepower (220kW) at under 8000revolutions per minute (rpm), compared to 330–360bhp (250–270kW) {{produced by the}} Ferrari and Maserati V12s. However, it produced high levels of torque {{over a wide range}} of engine speeds from 3500rpm up to peak torque of 233pound feet (316N·m) at 6500rpm. Installed in the lightweight BT19 chassis, it was also relatively fuel efficient; on the car's debut Brabham reported that the BT19 achieved 7miles per gallon (40L/100km), against figures of around 4mpg (70L/100km) for its [...] "more exotic rivals". This meant that it could start a Grand Prix with only 35gallons (160L) of <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> compared to around 55gallons (250L) for the Cooper T81-Maseratis. The engine had one further advantage over bespoke racing engines: parts were cheap. For example, the engine blocks were available for GB£11 each and the connecting rods cost £7 each.|$|E
500|$|T5 {{was also}} {{returned}} to the KJRM-in-exile in December 1943. T6 was scuttled by the Italians [...] north of Rimini on 11 September as she had insufficient <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to reach an Allied port. Once under German control, T7 was also {{handed over to the}} Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and served under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of Yugoslav Partisan propaganda, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. On 24 June 1944, she and the S-boats S 154 and S 157 of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German sea supply routes along the Adriatic, when they were attacked by the Royal Navy Fairmile D motor torpedo boats MTB 659, MTB 662 and MTB 670 near the island of Kukuljari, south of Murter Island. The MTBs fired two torpedoes at T7, but missed, so they closed and engaged her with their guns, setting her ablaze. She was beached, and 21 crew were rescued by the MTBs. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more crew, then destroyed her with demolition charges. T8 was sunk [...] north-west of Dubrovnik by German aircraft while evacuating Italian troops from Dalmatia on 10 or 11 September 1943.|$|E
50|$|According to the U.S. Government, {{the primary}} reason for {{destroying}} the satellite was the approximately 1000 lb of toxic hydrazine <b>fuel</b> contained <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> which could pose health risks to persons in the immediate vicinity of the crash site should any significant amount survive the re-entry. On February 20, 2008, it was announced that the launch was carried out successfully and an explosion was observed consistent with the destruction of the hydrazine fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|The typhoon has {{resulted}} in some identifiable but limited impact on oil deliveries to East Asian destinations. At least two fuel oil cargoes in East China were delayed due to typhoon Morakot. This included 90,000-mt Venezuelan fuel oil cargo with Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province. There was a report that an 18,000-mt cargo of Singapore-origin with <b>fuel</b> oil <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for Aug 10 delivery into Zhangjiagang in Jiangsu Province was postponed to arrive on Aug 15.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, fuel theft is an ongoing concern. Consequently, the {{accurate}} measurement of <b>fuel</b> taken <b>on</b> <b>board</b> coupled with the fuel actually consumed by engines and generators, {{is an important part of}} MFM. Flow meters should be installed in all fuel transfer lines so accurate fueling data can be captured. This data can then be compared with burn rates to determine whether fuel is being transferred off the vessel secretively.|$|R
500|$|Since {{the vessel}} {{was no longer}} {{seaworthy}} and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, {{the focus of the}} operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an environmental hazard, a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the surf. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to burn off the oil. The first attempt was made on February 10. Napalm and other incendiary devices were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on February 11 when US Navy explosive experts placed 39 shaped charges to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280liters of napalm and nearly 180kg of plastic explosives were also used to ignite the <b>fuel</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The ship burned for approximately 33hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between [...] The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on February 11.|$|E
