I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't {{going to make it}} back.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Zeroes", which Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{called the most}} heartening and successful track on the album, is, according to Bowie, a nostalgia trip: [...] "I wanted to put in every 60s cliche <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of!</b> 'Stopping and preaching and letting love in,' all those things. I hope there's a humorous undertone to it. But the subtext is definitely that the trappings of rock are not what they're made out to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackman also {{watched a}} woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken {{to see the}} woman have similar blond hair to his wife: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was my wife on that table. As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, I knew in that moment that I was so not ready for death." [...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders." [...] As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor.|$|E

500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E
500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goody {{initially}} {{denied that}} her comments were racist: [...] "She is Indian, thinking of an Indian name and only thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was Indian food. Wasn't racial at all. It {{was not to}} offend any Indian out there." [...] On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty {{could be seen as}} racist. In a video on the BBC News website, Goody said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing his {{gameplay}} {{strategy in}} 1930, he said, [...] "My system was all offense. I believed in {{putting up a}} mental hazard for the other fellow. If we were five or six runs ahead, I'd try some wild play, such as going from first to home on a single. This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on. I worked out all the angles <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> to keep them guessing and hurrying." [...] In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase, but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies, {{he was able to}} surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.|$|E
2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun.... I was doing everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> to protect my husband and keep him alive." ...|$|E

My Percy was dead, {{and there was not}} even the consolation of knowing that he had been laid tenderly in some quiet churchyard, there to wait, under that burning Indian sky, till the time should come, when we should again meet, and never part more. But now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not even <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him so; I had not even that consolation; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him as lying anywhere; his body had fallen {{into the hands of the}} rebels, to be hacked and mutilated, before they left it to the jackals and wild dogs. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him at all, it was too horrible--Oh, Percy, Percy! ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2013, Mark Walport, the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser {{and head}} of the Government Office for Science, had this to say: [...] "My view scientifically is {{absolutely}} clear: homoeopathy is nonsense, it is non-science. My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect – it is then a political decision whether they spend money on it or not." [...] His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being [...] "fundamentally ignored" [...] by the Government, said: [...] "The only one [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points {{to the fact that it}} is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying this is wrong, but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading about Grandin renewed Gerson Saines' [...] "energy, {{motivation}} and spirit" [...] {{in coping with}} her son's condition. [...] "Temple's story brought me hope and (her mother)'s story gave me direction and purpose," [...] Gerson Saines said in a later interview. [...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was, 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here. This woman's my hero.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 22, 2016, Anselmo {{ended the}} [...] "Dimebash" [...] Dimebag Darrell tribute show by giving a Nazi salute and {{screaming}} the words [...] "white power" [...] to the crowd. The incident {{was captured by}} an audience member's cell phone camera and the video was posted on YouTube. Anselmo later claimed he was joking about drinking [...] "white wine". Anselmo commented on the YouTube video, writing: In an interview with Eddie Trunk on Sirius XM on December 15, 2016, Anselmo claimed he was being taunted throughout the show by [...] "two or three little hecklers" [...] who were standing near the stage. He stated that the hecklers called him all sorts of names throughout the show, {{and by the end}} he said he'd lost his patience. On the show Anselmo said, [...] "When people start screaming 'racist' {{over and over and over}} and over again at me, what I did was show them exactly what [...] the ugliest possible thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> at the time was." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Paths of Glory {{did not do}} well at the box office, it {{has since}} {{become one of the}} great anti-war films, and one of early films by {{director}} Stanley Kubrick. Douglas, a fluent French speaker, plays a sympathetic French officer during World War I who tries to save three soldiers from the firing squad. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto describes Douglas's [...] "seething but controlled portrayal exploding with the passion of his convictions at the injustice leveled at his men." [...] The film was banned in France until 1976. Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: [...] "I called Stanley to my room... I hit the ceiling. I called him every four-letter word <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of...</b> 'I got the money, based on that [...] script. Not this shit!' I threw the script across the room. 'We're going back to the original script, or we're not making the picture.' Stanley never blinked an eye. We shot the original script. I think the movie is a classic, {{one of the most important}} pictures—possibly the most important picture—Stanley Kubrick has ever made." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon {{as a way}} of subverting the cliché of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film". Whedon stated [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] was the first incarnation of Buffy in his head, [...] "the idea of a seemingly insignificant female who in fact turns out to be extraordinary." [...] When asked how he came up with the name of [...] "Buffy," [...] Whedon states [...] "It was the name that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that I could take the least seriously. There is no way you could hear the name Buffy and think, [...] "This is an important person. To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just felt like that kind of thinga B movie. But a B movie that had something more going on. That was my dream." [...] Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting [...] "You don't understand. It has to be this. This is what it is." [...] Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the [...] "final girl" [...] character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton's words, [...] "she... gets to have sex with boys and still kill the monster".|$|E
