40|$|Three-phase slurry reactors, {{which are}} {{characterized}} by a dispersed gas phase, a suspended solid phase, and a continuous liquid phase, are widely used in the chemical industry for gas-liquid-solid reactions. Understanding the physicochemical phenomena of the reactor is essential to design and control the reactor. Also, estimation of system parameters is important for reactor scale-up. ^ The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate the dynamic responses of the three-phase slurry reactor and to propose methods for the determination of system parameters for linear and nonlinear systems. The PM-PM-HS/ID model, which assumes perfect mixing (PM) in the gas and liquid phases and homogeneous suspension (HS) of the solid phase, is used for the study. The phenomenon of intraparticle diffusion (ID) is also considered in this model. ^ The effect of chemical kinetics, linear or nonlinear, on the dynamics of the reactor was studied. The kinetics include a first-order reaction with respect to a single gas reactant or a single liquid reactant, a power-law type reaction with respect to a single gas reactant, a Michaelis-Menten type reaction with respect to a single gas reactant or a single liquid reactant, and a substrate inhibition type reaction with respect to a single liquid reactant. ^ Analytical solutions were presented for first-order reaction systems under batch, semi-batch, and continuous operations. The results show that two types of responses exist if an input perturbation, i. e., the sudden introduction of catalyst into the reactor at time zero, is employed. The criteria to distinguish these two responses were obtained analytically. These criteria are independent of the parameters related to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>transport</b> processes such as liquid-solid mass transfer coefficients and intraparticle diffusion coefficient. With these criteria, simple experimental methods were proposed to obtain the intrinsic first-order rate constant directly from the experiments without considering the effect of <b>intermediate</b> <b>transport</b> processes. ^ Numerical solutions were also presented for non-linear systems by the method of orthogonal collocation. The criteria to distinguish two responses are no longer independent of the parameters related to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>transport</b> processes. However, if the system possesses a shifting order kinetics with an extreme condition of first-order reaction, the rate constants still can be obtained by using the proposed methods.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{a number}} of <b>intermediate</b> <b>transport</b> {{initiatives}} {{have been used in}} some developing countries, available evidence reveals a dearth of local knowledge on the effect of these rural informal transport mechanisms on access to maternal health care services, the cost of implementing such schemes and their scalability. This paper, attempts to provide insights into the functioning of the informal transport markets in facilitating access to maternal health care. It also demonstrates the role that higher institutions of learning can play in designing projects that can increase the utilization of maternal health services. Objectives To explore the use of <b>intermediate</b> <b>transport</b> mechanisms to improve access to maternal health services, with emphasis on the benefits and unintended consequences of the transport scheme, as well as challenges in the implementation of the scheme. Methods This paper is based on the pilot phase to inform a quasi experimental study aimed at increasing access to maternal health services using demand and supply side incentives. The data collection for this paper included qualitative and quantitative methods that included focus group interviews, review of project documents and facility level data. Results There was a marked increase in attendance of antenatal, and delivery care services, with the contracted transporters playing a leading role in mobilizing mothers to attend services. The project also had economic spill-over effects to the transport providers, their families and community generally. However, some challenges were faced including difficulty in setting prices for paying transporters, and poor enforcement of existing traffic regulations. Conclusions and implications The findings indicate that locally existing resources such as motorcycle riders, also known as “boda boda” can be used innovatively to reduce challenges caused by geographical inaccessibility and a poor transport network with resultant increases in the utilization of maternal health services. However, care must be taken to mobilize the resources needed and to ensure that there is enforcement of laws that will ensure the safety of clients and the transport providers themselves. </p...|$|E
