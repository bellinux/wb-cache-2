5|$|Arsenal {{had started}} the 1933–34 season solidly, but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died {{suddenly}} from pneumonia. Despite this, under caretaker manager Joe Shaw Arsenal retained the title that season; Hulme and James were both out with injury <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> portion, and so Arsenal were not the attacking side they had been the previous season, scoring only 75 in the League, compared with 118 in 1932–33.|$|E
