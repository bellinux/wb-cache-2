50|$|A {{government}} or division of government (i.e. on a municipal, provincial/state level) may declare that their area is {{in a state}} of emergency. This means that the government can suspend and/or change some functions of the executive, the legislative and/or the judiciary during this period of time. It alerts citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. A government can declare a state of emergency during a time of natural or <b>human-made</b> <b>disaster,</b> during a period of civil unrest, or following a declaration of war or situation of international/internal armed conflict. Justitium is its equivalent in Roman law, where the Senate could put forward a final decree (senatus consultum ultimum) that was not subject to dispute.|$|E

Whatever positive things happen in Katrina’s aftermath will be due, in large measure, to the long-term work of grassroots community and union-organizing groups who mobilized quickly to provide a voice for the have-nots and who found allies among professionals to help formulate alternative plans to those developed by business and political elites...|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{disaster}} is {{usually associated with}} human suffering caused by natural events: tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods. However, human-created disasters stemming from war, the conduct of repressive regimes, the use of sanctions, and economic and social policies represent an equally important dimension {{of disaster}}.

40|$|Cloud-computing {{services}} are provided to consumers through {{a network of}} servers and network equipment. Cloud-network (CN) providers virtualize resources [e. g., virtual machine (VM) and virtual network (VN) ] for efficient and secure resource allocation. Disasters {{are one of the}} worst threats for CNs as they can causemassive disruptions andCN disconnection. A disaster may also induce post-disaster correlated, cascading failures which can disconnect more CNs. Survivable virtual-network embedding (SVNE) approaches have been studied to protect VNs against single physicallink/- node and dual physical-link failures in communication infrastructure, but massive disruptions due to a disaster and their consequences can make SVNE approaches insufficient to guarantee cloud-computing survivability. In this work, we study the problem of survivable CN mapping from disaster. We consider risk assessment, VM backup location, and post-disaster survivability {{to reduce the risk of}} failure and probability of CN disconnection and the penalty paid by operators due to loss of capacity. We formulate the proposed approach as an integer linear program and study two scenarios: a natural disaster, e. g., earthquake and a <b>human-made</b> <b>disaster,</b> e. g., weapons-of-mass-destruction attack. Our illustrative examples show that our approach reduces the risk of CN disconnection and penalty up to 90 % compared with a baseline CNmapping approach and increases the CN survivability up to 100 % in both scenarios. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|Disaster {{scenarios}} are dismal and often result in mass displacement and migration of people. In eventuality of emergency situations, {{people need to}} be rehabilitated and provided with an adequate supply of drinking water, the most essential natural resource needed for survival, which is often not easily available even during non-disaster periods. In the aftermath of a natural or <b>human-made</b> <b>disaster</b> affecting mankind and livestock, the prime aim is to ensure supply of safe water to reduce the occurrence and spread of water borne disease due to interrupted, poor and polluted water supply. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) emergencies augment the dilemma as an additional risk of "contamination" is added. The associated risks posed to health and life should be reduced to as low as reasonably achievable. Maintaining a high level of preparedness is the crux of quick relief and efficient response to ensure continuous supply of safe water, enabling survival and sustenance. The underlying objective would be to educate and train the persons concerned to lay down the procedures for the detection, cleaning, and treatment, purification including desalination, disinfection, and decontamination of water. The basic information to influence the organization of preparedness and execution of relief measures at all levels while maintaining minimum standards in water management at the place of disaster, are discussed in this article...|$|E

40|$|Although the September 11, 2001, {{terrorist}} attacks were the largest <b>human-made</b> <b>disaster</b> in US history, {{there is little}} extant research documenting the attacks ’ consequences among those most directly affected, that is, persons {{who were in the}} World Trade Center towers. Data from a cross-sectional survey conducted 2 – 3 years after the attacks ascertained the prevalence of long-term, disaster-related posttraumatic stress symptoms and probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 3, 271 civilians who evacuatedWorld Trade Center towers 1 and 2. Overall, 95. 6 % of survivors reported at least 1 current posttraumatic stress symptom. The authors estimated the probable rate of PTSD at 15. 0 % by using the PTSD Checklist. Women and minorities were at an increased risk of PTSD. A strong inverse relation with annual income was observed. Five characteristics of direct exposure to the {{terrorist attacks}} independently predicted PTSD: being on a high floor in the towers, initiating evacuation late, being caught in the dust cloud that resulted from the tower collapses, personally witnessing horror, and sustaining an injury. Working for an employer that sustained fatalities also increased risk. Each addition of an experience of direct exposure resulted in a 2 -fold increase in the risk of PTSD (odds ratio 2. 09, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 84, 2. 36). Identification of these risk factors may be useful when screening survivors of large-scale terrorist events for long-term psychological sequelae. disasters; life change events; September 11 terrorist attacks; stress disorders, post-traumatic; terroris...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Nurses are {{challenged}} to thoughtfully analyze {{the balance of}} professional responsibility and risk, including moral obligation and options, in particular situations {{in order to preserve}} the ethical mandates of the profession. Nursing creates a relationship of trust between nurse and patient, with special duties for the nurse, including the responsibility to care for patients. The nurse has a moral obligation or duty to patients and is not at liberty to abandon patients in need of nursing care. ANA Position: The American Nurses Association (ANA) believes that nurses are obligated to care for patients in a non-discriminatory manner, with respect for all individuals. The ANA also recognizes there may be limits to the personal risk of harm nurses can be expected to accept as an ethical duty. History/Previous Position Statements: Historically, nurses have given care to those in need, even at risk to their own health, life, or limb. Indeed, the suggested Code of 1926 proclaims “the most precious possession of this profession is the ideal of service, extending even to the sacrifice of life itself [...] . ” (Committee on Ethical Standards, 1926). Nursing history is replete with examples of nurses who have knowingly incurred great risk in order to care for those in need of nursing or to contribute to the advancement of health science. Contemporary nurses, too, knowingly place themselves at risk when providing care in war-torn areas, places of poverty and poor sanitation, and situations of natural or <b>human-made</b> <b>disaster.</b> Nurses also encounter personal risk when providing care to patients with known and unknown, communicable or infectious diseases, as well as in other dangerous situations...|$|E

Studies after earlier disasters have reported rates of psychological disorders in the acute postdisaster period. However, data on postdisaster increases in substance use are sparse. A random digit dial telephone {{survey was conducted}} to estimate the prevalence of increased cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and marijuana use among residents of Manhattan, New York City, 5 – 8 weeks after the attacks. Among 988 persons included, 28. 8 % reported an increase in use {{of any of these}} three substances, 9. 7 % reported an increase in smoking, 24. 6 % reported an increase in alcohol consumption, and 3. 2 % reported an increase in marijuana use. Persons who increased smoking of cigarettes and marijuana were more likely to experience posttraumatic stress disorder than were those who did not (24. 2 % vs. 5. 6 % posttraumatic stress disorder for cigarettes; 36. 0 % vs. 6. 6 % for marijuana). Depression was more common among those who increased than for those who did not increase cigarette smoking (22. 1 vs 8. 2 %), alcohol consumption (15. 5 vs. 8. 3 %), and marijuana smoking (22. 3 vs. 9. 4 %).
