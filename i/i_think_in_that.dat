Kartheiser described Pete as doing [...] "what he thinks he needs to do to get the account. I don't know if that's always such a good thing, but it's common in business. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation, Pete represents that type of businessman." [...] Matthew Weiner and Jared Harris both characterized Lane's decision as two-fold—he gave Joan the best advice for her and for himself.|$|E

[...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

[...] Shooting began by March 24, alongside filming of the previous episode and continued through April 4. [...] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict {{that he is in}} third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. [...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season. [...] Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [...] is strong. [...] how he made that transition." [...] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that [...] "Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. [...] The scene where Jack is staring at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> moment he's thinking, my life right now is pretty good, I don't want to end up here." [...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. [...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even as McCarthy styled {{himself the}} clean politician, however, he dished it out, too. [...] Known for his wit, {{when asked if}} Michigan {{governor}} George Romney's comment {{that he had been}} [...] "brainwashed" [...] about the Vietnam War had ended his presidential hopes, McCarthy remarked, [...] "Well [...] [...] [...] er no, not really. Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case a light rinse would have been sufficient." [...] as cited in: [...] He mocked Robert Kennedy and his supporters. A major gaffe occurred in Oregon, when McCarthy sniffed that Kennedy supporters were [...] "less intelligent" [...] than his own and belittled Indiana (which had by then gone for Kennedy) for lacking a poet of the stature of Robert Lowell—a friend of McCarthy's who often traveled with him.|$|E
2500|$|Over a marching rhythm, she sings: [...] "If {{travel is}} searching/And home has been found/I'm not stopping/I'm going hunting." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted self-mockery towards [...] "her own idyllic disposition" [...] in the lyrics [...] "I thought I could {{organize}} freedom/How Scandinavian of me!" [...] That line {{was covered in}} various reviews; it {{has been described as}} [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "derisively" [...] delivered. When asked about the meaning of those lines, Björk replied: [...] "in Iceland, the people from Sweden, we think they're really not cool at all and they just have got no sense of humour, are really organized. And you can't organize everything. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> song, I was sort of... thinking that I could even organize freedom, just like very stupid. Quite Swedish, you know."

Another chance which we may count on is to be found, as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> strange handwriting, placed under the signature on the third page of the Letter, which you saw, but which you, unhappily, omitted to read.

I would therefore take the liberty of asking whether you are the author of said article, or any other over the same signature which has appeared in any of the late numbers of that paper. If so, I repeat my request of an absolute retraction of all offensive allusions contained therein in relation to my private character and standing.

"I am {{altogether}} {{unfit to}} make a plan, and still more unfit to carry it out," [...] he said, [...] "but my idea would certainly be to attack somewhere with half my force, to force the enemy back, and to hold positions {{at the end of}} the day, so that the Germans would concentrate to attack in the morning. At night I would withdraw the greater portion of them, march them straight across Paris; the other half of the army would attack there at daybreak, and would be reinforced soon after the fighting began by those who had fought the day before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> way they ought to be able to cut their way out, but what they would do when they once get out is more than I can tell you. They have no cavalry to speak of, while the Germans have a splendid cavalry force who would harass them continually. The infantry would pursue and would march infinitely better than we should do. We should scatter to get food, whole regiments would break up and become masses of fugitives, and finally we should be surrounded, either cut to pieces or forced to surrender. Of two things, I am not sure that it would not be best for us to be handsomely thrashed on the first day of our sortie." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR FRIEND,--I have at last {{got some}} photographs, and hasten to send you, as you asked, a {{portrait}} of Tusitala.

I shall never do a better book than Catriona, that is my high-water mark, and the trouble of production increases on me at a great rate--and mighty anxious about how I am to leave my family: an elderly man, with elderly preoccupations, whom I should be ashamed to show you for your old friend; but not a hope of my dying soon and cleanly, and [...] "winning off the stage." [...] Rather I am daily better in physical health. I shall have to see this business out, after all; and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case, they should have--they might have--spared me all my ill-health this decade past, if it were not to unbar the doors.
