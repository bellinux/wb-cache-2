40|$|The {{galvanic}} corrosion behavior of Alloy 690 coupled with magnetite {{has been investigated}} in an alkaline solution at 30 °C and 60 °C using a potentiodynamic polarization method and a zero resistance ammeter. The positive current values were recorded in the galvanic couple and the corrosion potential of Alloy 690 was relatively lower. These results indicate that Alloy 690 behaves as the anode of the pair. The galvanic coupling between Alloy 690 and magnetite increased the corrosion rate of Alloy 690. The temperature increase led {{to an increase in}} the extent of <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> and a decrease in the stability of passive film. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> between Alloy 690 and magnetite is proposed as an additional factor accelerating the corrosion rate of Alloy 690 steam generator tubing in secondary water...|$|E

In contrast, the addition of microorganism negatively affected the leaching efficiency at 30 C. XRD and iron K-edge XANES analysis indicate the presence of microorganisms decreased the chalcopyrite leaching selectivity, likely linked to the increased solution potential.

This reduction {{is known to}} be controlled by microbial dissimilation processes. Alternative sources of free electrons in nature are cloud-to-ground lightning events with thermal and <b>galvanic</b> <b>effects.</b> Where thermal effects of lightning events are well described, less is known about the impact of <b>galvanic</b> lightning <b>effects</b> on metal mobilization. Here we show that a significant mobilization of manganese occurs due to <b>galvanic</b> <b>effects</b> of both positive and negative lightning, where iron seems to be unaffected with manganese being abundant in oxic forms in soils/sediments. A mean of 0. 025 mmol manganese (negative lightning) or 0. 08 mmol manganese (positive lightning) mobilization may occur.

40|$|Spin-charge interconversion is {{currently}} the focus of intensive experimental and theoretical research both for its intrinsic interest and for its potential exploitation in the realization of new spintronic functionalities. Spin-orbit coupling {{is one of the}} key microscopic mechanisms to couple charge currents and spin polarizations. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a two- dimensional electron gas has been shown to give rise to the inverse spin <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e. the generation of a non-equilibrium spin polarization by a charge current. Whereas the Rashba model may be applied to the interpretation of experimental results in many cases, in general in a given real physical system spin-orbit coupling also occurs due other mechanisms such as Dresselhaus bulk inversion asymmetry and scattering from impurities. In this work we consider the inverse spin <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> in the presence of Rashba, Dresselhaus and impurity spin-orbit scattering. We nd that the size and form of the inverse spin <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> is greatly modied by the presence of the various sources of spin-orbit coupling. Indeed, spin-orbit coupling affects the spin relaxation time by adding the Elliott-Yafet mechanism to the Dyakonov-Perel and, furthermore, it changes the non-equilibrium value of the current-induced spin polarization. We use a diagrammatic Kubo formula approach to evaluate the spin polarization-charge current response function. We nally comment about the relevance of our results for the interpretation of experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Dense {{arrays of}} {{vertically}} aligned ZnO nanorods have been grown onto either silver or gold seedless substrates trough a simple hydrothermal method by exploiting the <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> between the substrate and metallic parts. The nanorods exhibit larger bases and more defined hexagonal shapes, {{in comparison with}} standard non-galvanic wet-chemistry synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that the iron contamination, associated with the galvanic contact, significantly improves the in-plane compatibility of ZnO with the Au and Ag cubic lattice. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements indicate that the contamination {{does not affect the}} number density of localized defects, but lowers their energy levels uniformly; differently, the band-edge emission is not altered appreciably. Finally, we have found that the ZnO hetero-nucleation by <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> initiates at different times in different sites of the substrate area.

40|$|The {{cooperative}} {{interactions between}} chalcopyrite and bornite during bioleaching by mixed moderately thermophilic culture were investigated mainly by bioleaching experiments and electrochemical experiments. Bioleaching {{results showed that}} a cooperative effect existed between chalcopyrite and bornite. When the mass ratio of chalcopyrite to bornite was 3 : 1, an extremely high copper extraction of more than 88 % was achieved after bioleaching for 27 days. One of the major reasons for the cooperative effect was that a certain redox potential range (370 - 450 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) could be maintained {{for a long period}} of time during bioleaching due to the mixture of chalcopyrite and bornite. Electrochemical measurements revealed that chalcopyrite was much easier to be reduced than oxidized, while bornite was prone to be directly oxidized. Hence, <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> between chalcopyrite and bornite enhanced the reduction of chalcopyrite to secondary copper-iron species and promoted the oxidative dissolution of bornite. Therefore, redox potential controlling and <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> both contributed to the cooperative bioleaching of chalcopyrite and bornite...|$|E
30|$|The {{methodology}} of Püthe and Kuvshinov ([2013]) is self-consistent, but depending on location, the presented results might still over- or underestimate the amplitudes {{of the actual}} electric field. This is due to <b>galvanic</b> <b>effects,</b> i.e. the build-up of electric charges along near-surface, small-scale conductivity contrasts or topographic inhomogeneities (e.g. Jiracek [1990]) that {{were not included in}} the model. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>effects</b> are well-known in the magnetotelluric (MT) community, where they are usually referred to as ‘static shift’ (e.g. Chave and Jones [2012]; Simpson and Bahr [2005]). This name reflects the frequency-independent shift of MT response functions (apparent resistivities) that the effect causes. MT responses are routinely corrected for the static shift by introducing a real-valued frequency-independent distortion matrix, which separates galvanic from (the usually desired) inductive effects (e.g. Groom and Bahr [1992]).|$|R

30|$|We {{introduced}} two new response functions {{which can}} be exploited for the interpretation of MT data. First, we present the electric phase tensor, {{which is based on}} the inter-site electric tensor. The electric phase tensor requires the simultaneous measurement of the horizontal electric field components at the base and a field site and is only distorted by <b>galvanic</b> <b>effects,</b> if present, at the base site. Second, we present the inter-site MT phase tensor, which we called the quasi-electric phase tensor. The quasi-electric phase tensor requires the simultaneous recording of the horizontal magnetic field components at the base site and the horizontal components of the electric field at a field site. The quasi-electric phase tensor is not distorted by <b>galvanic</b> <b>effects.</b> The base site has to be chosen carefully, preferably in a low-noise environment, and where the conductivity section is 1 -D, to ensure that the (quasi-) electric phase tensor is not contaminated by 2 -D or 3 -D effects at the base site.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the two {{important}} parts in the spintronic devices based on the spin field effect transistor: (1) the ferromagnetic GaMnAs thin films which is the source-drain material and (2) the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a two-dimensional electron gas in which the spin can be transported and its polarization can be tuned by external gates. We have grown GaMnAs samples using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with Mn composition up to 8 %. The intrinsic and extrinsic contribution to the lattice parameter of the low temperature grown GaMnAs is discussed. The influence of the defects on the electrical and magnetic properties of GaMnAs thin films is presented. We have also studied optical properties of GaMnAs thin films and quantum wells using absorption spectrum. The magnetic circular dichroism is employed to study the p-d exchange interaction induced spin splitting. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a InGaAs/InA 1 As two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) is demonstrated by the beating patterns in the Shubnikov de Hass oscillation. Based on the coupling between the spin and orbit momentum, we demonstrates the ways to use spin to drive current by the circular photo <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> (CPGE) and the spin <b>galvanic</b> <b>effect</b> (SGE) with interband excitation.
