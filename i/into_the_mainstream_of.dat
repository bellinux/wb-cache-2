25|$|Roberto Perin {{looks at}} the historiography of Canadian ethnic history and finds two {{alternative}} methodologies. One is more static and emphasizes how closely immigrant cultures replicate the Old World. This approach tends to be filiopietistic.

It sees the immigrant community as an essentially North American phenomenon and integrates it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>of</b> Canadian culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the Kingston Trio in its heyday had repercussions far beyond its voluminous album sales (including four albums {{simultaneously}} in the Top 10 in 1959), its host of imitators, and the relatively short-lived pop-folk boom it created. For the Kingston Trio's success took acoustic folk-based music out of the niche market it had occupied prior to the Trio's arrival and moved it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>of</b> American popular music, opening the door for major record labels to record and market both more traditional folk musicians and singer-songwriters as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods used}} by the Early Nationalists of passing resolutions and sending {{petitions}} were seen as inadequate by critics who argued that they depended on the generosity of the British instead of relying on their own strength and challenging the imperialist might. They failed to realise that British and Indian interests clashed {{with each other and}} that Britain was using India's resources to increase its wealth. The Early Nationalists failed to draw the masses <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>of</b> the national movement such that their area of influence remained limited to urban educated Indians. In particular, their leadership comprised only members of professional groups such as lawyers, doctors, journalists and teachers.|$|E
25|$|A new rite for Thanksgiving after Adoption {{preceded the}} {{revision}} of the Old 'Churching of Women' service. Baptism could now {{be incorporated into the}} main Sunday service, the result of other influences intended to bring it back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>of</b> worship. The Baptism of those able to answer for themselves was much more prominent, a result of the influence of those who questioned infant baptism in a post-Christian society. The questions, however, now addressed to the godparents or the person baptised directly, no longer required the renunciation of the devil or 'the vain pomp and glory of the world' or 'the carnal desires of the flesh' but instead a turning to Christ, a repentance from sin and a renunciation of evil. Likewise the ancient Apostles Creed was replaced by three tritheistic questions, which were criticised (by, among others, John Habgood, sometime Archbishop of York) as being unknown to the credal discussions of the Church, Eastern or Western, modern or ancient.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Nightnoise {{can be traced}} to the Bothy Band (disbanded in 1979), who made a name in Ireland and internationally with a lively fiddle-based sound that brought Irish music <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's founders, guitarist Mícheál Ó Domhnaill, came from a long line of Irish musicians, and was {{considered}} one of the finest performers of traditional Irish music.|$|R

500|$|Kill 'Em All {{features}} intricate riffing {{reminiscent of}} the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns {{in addition to his}} breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a [...] "naive charm". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>of</b> hard rock.|$|E
