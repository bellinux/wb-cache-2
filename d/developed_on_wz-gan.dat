40|$|A three-year study {{evaluated}} postweaning {{winter grazing}} system management on primiparous heifers at two locations. Weaned heifers {{were assigned to}} a development system: (1) graze corn residue then winter range, (2) graze winter range, or (3) graze winter range then placed in drylot. A combination of artificial insemination (AI) and natural mating was used at time of breeding based on location. Pregnant heifers were {{assigned to one of}} three corn residue fields in late gestation based on previous heifer development. Weaned heifers <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> corn residue had similar BW and ADG during winter grazing and after breeding, compared to heifers <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> winter range. The effect of post-weaning management on reproductive performance was similar for all heifer treatments.

40|$|Heterodera schachtii {{developed}} to maturity and reproduced on the lateral roots of defoliated sugarbeet which were buried {{to a depth}} of 2. 5 cm in sterilized soil and inoculated with cysts. Nematodes did not <b>develop</b> <b>on</b> detached lateral roots or on roots of young defoliated beets which did not have a large tap root. The storage roots of large rooted plants were sliced, placed in small jars, inoculated with cysts, covered with moist granulated agar or soil and incubated at 24 °C 12 - 62 days. The sugarbeet nematode developed in root slices of sugarbeet, red table beet, icicle and globe radish, turnip and rutabaga. Only a few males <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> slices of potato tubers.
