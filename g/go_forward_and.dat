Renzi {{appealed to the}} Supreme Court but it also declined to hear his appeal so he was put on trial.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Union skirmishers {{continued}} to {{fire at the}} Confederate positions from {{the house on the}} field and other outbuildings {{on the south side of}} the creek. Colonel Hill asked four volunteers to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> burn the house. Fire from across the main road stopped them and they dove to the ground. One of them, Private Henry L. Wyatt, had been killed. The others were called back and soon Major Randolph was able to destroy the house with artillery fire. Lieutenant Greble, whose guns had been hidden by the house, {{continued to}} fire and exposed his position. By this time the battle was ending and Peirce ordered all of his force to retire. It was clear that the Confederate position was too strong and his troops were too exhausted to continue a costly and increasingly futile attack.|$|E
25|$|For {{two and a}} half years, {{after five}} months {{training}} in Halifax and England, the Islanders in 3rd DAC, went about their primary task: hauling, packing or supplying to their guns, and in stables or on watering parade. With their horses and mules, they ‘hauled’ ammunition to their firing batteries, or they 'hauled' material for their Canadian Engineers. When the roads were impassable, they ‘packed’ ammunition forward on their mules; or when available to assist, with their wagons, to the rear, they ‘supplied’ ammunition to flanking or supporting divisions. When not drawing or supplying ammunition to affiliated battery wagon lines, the Islanders had to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> ‘collect’ empty cartridge cases, or ‘salvage’ ammunition left at vacated battery positions and on occasion found at abandoned enemy artillery positions. Of the 100 Islanders who saw active service with the 3rd DAC, or as transferred to a 3rd Divisional Artillery Battery, 10 were killed and 30 were wounded.|$|E

Campbell politely declined, {{and returned with}} his party to Cape Evans to report this development. Scott received the news on , during the first depot-laying expedition. According to Cherry-Garrard, the first reaction of Scott and his party was an urge to rush over to the Bay of Whales and [...] "have it out" [...] with Amundsen. However, Scott recorded the event calmly in his journal. [...] "One thing only fixes itself in my mind. The proper, {{as well as the}} wiser, course is for us to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> do our best for the honour of our country without fear or panic." ...|$|E
500|$|Hastert was {{initially}} {{represented in the}} civil case by his son, attorney Ethan Hastert, and then by Christian Poland, a Bryan Cave partner in Chicago. U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras twice dismissed the suit, but allowed John's attorneys to redraft the complaint. In July 2015, Kocoras reinstated the suit, finding that John's second amended complaint was sufficient to allow the suit to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> proceed to discovery. John claimed in court filings to {{have had at least}} three conversations with an FBI agent about Hastert's use of the post-speakership office. In September 2015, Hastert's attorneys issued subpoenas for records of conversations between John and FBI agents. John's attorneys moved to quash the subpoenas, arguing that they were overly broad and sought information [...] "unrelated to the present case or Hastert." [...] In October 2015, Judge Kocoras said that he would review the records in camera (privately) before deciding what information should be turned over, saying: [...] "This case has {{more than its share of}} sensitivity and unusual aspects." ...|$|E
2500|$|The court {{stressed}} {{that it was}} only calling for the case to <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> was not itself judging the cases merits, saying [...] "The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether either plaintiff has presented a justiciable controversy in their complaint. We conclude the complaint is sufficient to entitle both plaintiffs to litigate their claims under the Declaratory Judgment Act, though we are careful to express no opinion on the merits of those claims." ...|$|E

If the upper body moves, it is usually {{a sign that the}} rider is tense. The forward incline of the rider's upper body may vary, from very upright (used in a collected canter), to slightly forward (used in the lengthened canter if the rider is using the forward seat). However, the shoulders should still remain back and still.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{administration}} officials, {{torn between}} {{pressure from the}} Republicans to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> a reluctance to respond to any Iraqi confrontation (and there was sure to be one) with military force, had tried to convince Butler to postpone the inspection until [...] "a more opportune time." [...] Butler was convinced. To me, he called it a case of [...] "bad timing." [...] I viewed it as something elsean appalling lack of leadership, not only in Washington and London, but also on Butler's part. He was allowing a golden opportunity to slip through his fingers. I said as much in a long, critical memorandum that I wrote to him the next day.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "judges' houses" [...] round, each judge chose {{three of}} their {{remaining}} six acts to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> represent them on the live shows. The locations for the round were confirmed during episode 8 on 29 September; they were later revealed by Louis Walsh {{not to be the}} judges' real homes. Cowell took his six acts to Marbella; Osbourne to Los Angeles; Walsh to Dublin; and Minogue to Ibiza. As in previous series, the judges were joined by an assistant to help them make their decisions: Cowell was joined by former pop star Sinitta; Osbourne by The Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger; Walsh by Westlife singer Kian Egan; and Minogue by songwriter and producer Terry Ronald.|$|E

2500|$|Individualized acts of daring were encouraged, such as {{rushing out}} into the open to chop off the heads of wounded or dead enemies. A tally of these trophies was {{presented}} to the commanding general {{after the end of the}} engagement. Severe discipline prevailed in the Ashanti armies. Soldiers who faltered were whipped or slaswed with heavy swords carried by special contingents of [...] "enforcer" [...] troops – the [...] "sword-bearers." [...] Ashanti soldiers had to memorize the following saying: [...] "If I go forward, I die; if I flee, I die. Better to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> die in the mouth of battle." [...] Generally the [...] "enforcers" [...] were deployed forward, between the scouts and the main force. They eased back as the battle started to better observe and intimidate the weary and faltering. In a feature seldom seen among African armies, the Ashanti also deployed units of medical personnel behind the main forces, who were tasked with caring for the wounded and removing the dead.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell details {{noteworthy}} {{changes in}} the social and political atmosphere of Barcelona when he returns after three months at the front. He describes a lack of revolutionary atmosphere and the class division that he had thought would not reappear, i.e., with visible division between rich and poor and the return of servile language. Orwell had been determined to leave the POUM, and confesses here that he [...] "would have liked to join the Anarchists," [...] but instead sought a recommendation to join the International Column, so that he could go to the Madrid front. The latter half of this chapter is devoted to describing the conflict between the anarchist CNT and the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the resulting cancellation of the May Day demonstration and the build-up to the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. [...] "It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> those who wished to check or prevent it—ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists." ...|$|E
2500|$|International Men's Day {{was inaugurated}} in St. Kitts and Nevis on 19 November 2010. The Ministry of Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs {{is using the}} {{occasion}} of International Men's Day to highlight issues affecting and involving men. International Men's Day was observed on Friday and a few activities, such as a health fair, a church service and a panel discussion on general men's issues were organized by the ministry. Sharon Rattan, Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Gender Affairs said the Gender Affairs Department wants to reach out more to men as previously they focused mostly on women issues. Rattan told WINN FM that it was their hope to use the opportunity to gather {{more information about the}} issues affecting men to guide their plan of action in the future. [...] "We are trying to get men together and engage their minds on the issues that affect them so that we can <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> support them," [...] Rattan said, adding that the programs would also cater to young boys.|$|E

2500|$|Carrie oversees a {{prisoner}} exchange: Saul for five Taliban members. When Saul comes into view, however, Carrie sees {{a young boy}} behind him wearing a suicide vest. Carrie goes herself to retrieve Saul, and persuades him to let the exchange <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> come with her. As {{they go back to}} the U.S. Embassy, their car is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Marines pull Carrie and Saul from the wreckage, and take them back the embassy, which has been invaded by Haqqani's forces. The White House orders U.S. forces out of Pakistan and relieves Carrie of her command. [...] When Quinn kidnaps Farhad Ghazi (Tamer Burjaq), the ISI agent who kidnapped Saul, Carrie asks Lockhart to let her stay in Islamabad so she can bring him in. She finds Quinn and pleads with him to leave the country, but he refuses and escapes. She later stops him from assassinating Haqqani, and sees that Haqqani has Adal in his entourage. Meanwhile, she receives a phone call from Maggie, who tells her that their father has died. Carrie finds some solace in talking to Frannie, and decides to be a better mother to her.|$|E
2500|$|French {{arrived at}} Naawpoort on the {{afternoon}} of 20 November, and personally led a reconnaissance the following morning. Schoeman's Boer force had been reinforced by local Boers, and French, not strong enough to attack Arundel directly, conducted an active defence. At one stage, in late November and until 14 December, he was also required to extend his forces east to Rosmead to protect the railway to Port Elizabeth on the coast. A Boer penetration here would have cut off Cape Colony from Natal. French was proud of having achieved [...] "moral ascendancy" [...] (keeping the initiative, in modern parlance) over the Boers despite his force of 2,000 men being outnumbered by two to one. [...] French's subordinate Colonel T.C. Porter won a small action near Vaal Kop on 13 December, but the Boers captured that place on 16 December, causing French to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> take personal command. Around this time he offered to cancel his plans to advance on Colesberg and lend his cavalry to Methuen, who had been defeated at Magersfontein, but this was rejected as there was insufficient water even for Methuen's own horses in the Modder River sector.|$|E
2500|$|German individualist {{philosophers}} Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche were {{influential in}} French individualist anarchism. The {{influence of the}} thought of Max Stirner {{can be seen in}} this way: [...] "The theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism (see anarcho-naturism), the strong defense of birth control methods, the idea of [...] "unions of egoists" [...] with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others." [...] Emile Armand ´s stirnerist egoism (as well as his Nietzschetianism) can be appreciated when he writes in [...] "Anarchist Individualism as Life and Activity (1907)" [...] when he says anarchists [...] "are pioneers attached to no party, non-conformists, standing outside herd morality and conventional 'good' and 'evil' 'a-social'. A 'species' apart, one might say. They go forward, stumbling, sometimes falling, sometimes triumphant, sometimes vanquished. But they do <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> by living for themselves, these 'egoists', they dig the furrow, they open the broach through which will pass those who deny archism, the unique ones who will succeed them." ...|$|E
