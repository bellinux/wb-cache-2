40|$|Neonatal {{hyperbilirubinemia}} is {{a common}} occurrence yet it is often dismissed due to failure of clinicians to recognize the significance of jaundice. To better guide outpatient {{diagnosis and treatment of}} neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, healthcare providers should consider a systems approach to provide standardized, guidelines in <b>initiating</b> <b>identification,</b> treatment and follow-up for newborns. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of pre-discharge and guided follow-up transcutaneous bilirubin measurement in the neonate to determine the effects on management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and prevention of kernicterus. This is a replication of the first part of the 2006 study by Bhutani, Johnson, Schwoebel, and Gennaro. The sample will include 1, 800 infants for pre-implementation data who have been discharged from the “well-baby” nursery at a northeast Indiana hospital. The test group will include infants born in a two year period after implementation. The intervention will be routine transcutaneous bilirubin measurement to diagnose clinical jaundice, along with routine serum bilirubin testing pre-discharge, and use hour specific, percentile based bilirubin nomogram. Findings will provide information for clinicians in the application of evidence based practices that incorporate a systems approach to prevent complications of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

The effect of astrocyte function in cell production in neurodevelopment disorders is unknown. We used the Neural Colony Forming Cell assay {{to determine the effect}} of astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) on the generation of neurospheres originating from either progenitor cells or functional stem cells in the knock out (KO) Fragile X mouse model. ACM from both normal and Fmr 1 -KO mice generated higher percentages of smaller neurospheres indicative of restricted proliferation of the progenitor cell population in Fmr 1 -KO brains. Wild type neurospheres, but not KO neurospheres, showed enhanced responses to ACM from the Fmr 1 -KO mice. In particular, Fmr 1 -KO ACM increased the percentage of large neurospheres generated, representative of spheres produced from neural stem cells. We also used 2 D DIGE to <b>initiate</b> <b>identification</b> of the astrocyte-secreted proteins with differential expression between Fmr 1 -KO and WT cortices and hippocampi.

40|$|Hepatitis B and {{hepatitis}} C are contagious liver diseases {{caused by}} the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. In particular, chronic infection with HBV or HCV is a major public health problem throughout Europe. The majority of persons chronically infected (65 %- 75 %) {{are not aware of}} their infection status until symptoms of advanced liver disease appear. In addition, the peak in the number of patients suffering from advanced stages of the disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, has not yet been reached. In order to reduce the current and future morbidity and mortality associated with chronic HBV or HCV infection, the timely detection of chronically infected persons, with follow-up and case management, is crucial. However, the current screening strategies in Europe and Switzerland have to be considered as inadequate to detect the majority of chronically infected persons. Hence, we emphasise the importance of an alternative approach: the healthcare provider <b>initiated</b> <b>identification</b> of HBV or HCV infection in defined risk groups. This entails determining whether a person is not only at risk of being chronically infected, but also at risk of becoming infected with HBV or HCV and, if necessary, testing for HBV or HCV infection...|$|R
40|$|We report {{supporting}} {{evidence for the}} hypothesis that nesting round goby parental males release sex pheromones to attract females, {{and the results of}} preliminary experiments into pheromone isolation. We assessed pheromonal communication through physiological (electro-olfactogram, EOG) and behavioral responses of females to water conditioned by males. Reproductive (R) females responded with larger amplitude EOGs to water conditioned by (R) males compared with non-reproductive (NR) males. The R females reacted by directed movement to water conditioned by R males compared to untreated water, but not to water from NR males or females. We are isolating odorous compounds from this conditioned water by fractionating non-aqueous components, and testing for olfactory (EOG) potency. The R females showed strong EOG responses to a subset of HPLC fractions collected from water conditioned by R males, but not to NR male fractions; and the R male fractions were not stimulatory to N females.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{past three}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic increase in}} interest in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, owing to its nature as a taxonomically cryptic species, the damage it causes to a large number of herbaceous plants because of its specialized feeding in the phloem, and to its ability to serve as a vector of plant viruses. Among the most important plant viruses to be transmitted by B. tabaci are those in the genus Begomovirus (family, Geminiviridae). Surprisingly, {{little is known about the}} genome of this whitefly. The haploid genome size for male B. tabaci has been estimated to be approximately one billion bp by flow cytometry analysis, about five times the size of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. The genes involved in whitefly development, in host range plasticity, and in begomovirus vector specificity and competency, are unknown. Results To address this general shortage of genomic sequence information, we have constructed three cDNA libraries from non-viruliferous whiteflies (eggs, immature instars, and adults) and two from adult insects that fed on tomato plants infected by two geminiviruses: Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato mottle virus (ToMoV). In total, the sequence of 18, 976 clones was determined. After quality control, and removal of 5, 542 clones of mitochondrial origin 9, 110 sequences remained which included 3, 843 singletons and 1, 017 contigs. Comparisons with public databases indicated that the libraries contained genes involved in cellular and developmental processes. In addition, approximately 1, 000 bases aligned with the genome of the B. tabaci endosymbiotic bacterium Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidarum, originating primarily from the egg and instar libraries. Apart from the mitochondrial sequences, the longest and most abundant sequence encodes vitellogenin, which originated from whitefly adult libraries, indicating that much of the gene expression in this insect is directed toward the production of eggs. Conclusion This is the first functional genomics project involving a hemipteran (Homopteran) insect from the subtropics/tropics. The B. tabaci sequence database now provides an important tool to <b>initiate</b> <b>identification</b> of whitefly genes involved in development, behaviour, and B. tabaci -mediated begomovirus transmission. </p...|$|R

Herein, we <b>initiated</b> the <b>identification</b> and functional characterization of the five CHASE-containing histidine kinases (CHK) in the economically important Malus domestica species. These cytokinin receptors named MdCHK 2, MdCHK 3 a/MdCHK 3 b, and MdCHK 4 a/MdCHK 4 b by homology with Arabidopsis AHK clearly displayed three distinct profiles. The three groups exhibited architectural variations, especially in the N-terminal part including the cytokinin sensing domain.

Maraviroc demonstrated potent antiviral activity against all CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 viruses tested, including 43 primary isolates from various clades and diverse geographic origin (geometric mean 90 % inhibitory concentration of 2. 0 nM). Maraviroc was active against 200 clinically derived HIV- 1 envelope-recombinant pseudoviruses, 100 of which were derived from viruses resistant to existing drug classes.

Previous molecular cloning of CD 69 has revealed a type II transmembrane orientation {{and the presence}} of an extracellular domain related to the Ca(2 +) -dependent (C-type) animal lectins. As the predicted amino acid sequence for the lectin-like domain is highly divergent from those of other C-type lectin-like proteins - a feature shared with NKR-P 1 of natural killer cells - CD 69 and NKR-P 1 are among proteins assigned to a separate group, group V. To <b>initiate</b> ligand <b>identification</b> studies, we have prepared soluble forms of CD 69 protein by bacterial expression of its extracellular portion. We show that cysteine 68 located in the short membrane-proximal neck region of CD 69 which adjoins the C-terminal lectin-like domain is a critical element for dimerization. We have evidence that the soluble dimeric CD 69 has a tight association with calcium, a feature shared with NKR-P 1, and that it is a carbohydrate-binding protein with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine as the best inhibitors: 4 - 8 x 10 (- 5) M giving 50 % inhibition of binding to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine neoglycoprotein.

40|$|AbstractArthropod-borne {{diseases}} such as malaria and dengue virus afflict billions of people worldwide imposing major economic and social burdens. Control of such pathogens is mainly performed by vector management and treatment of affected individuals with drugs. The failure of these conventional approaches due to emergence of insecticide-resistant insects and drug-resistant parasites demonstrate the need of novel and efficacious control strategies to combat these diseases. Genetic modification (GM) of mosquito vectors to impair their ability to be infected and transmit pathogens {{has emerged as a}} new strategy to reduce transmission of many vector-borne diseases and deliver public health gains. Several advances in developing transgenic mosquitoes unable to transmit pathogens have gained support, some of them attempt to manipulate the naturally occurring endogenous refractory mechanisms, while others <b>initiate</b> the <b>identification</b> of an exogenous foreign gene which disrupt the pathogen development in insect vectors. Heterologous expression of transgenes under a native or heterologous promoter is important for the screening and effecting of the transgenic mosquitoes.

The knowledge about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this syndrome is relatively scant, {{probably due to the}} difficulty of reproducing the pathology in experimental animals. Zebrafish is an emerging model for human disease studies, and we therefore assessed it as a model for studying TCS. We identified in silico the putative zebrafish TCOF 1 ortholog and cloned the corresponding cDNA. The derived polypeptide shares the main structural domains found in mammals and amphibians. Tcof 1 expression is restricted to the anterior-most regions of zebrafish developing embryos, similar to what happens in mouse embryos.

Only limited data are available that objectively compare different vessel sealing methods. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare a broad variety of methods of surgical vessel closure in a reproducible, independent, standardized test-to-failure ex vivo pressure challenge. METHODS: Ten of the most common surgical sealing devices were represented in this study, including both mechanical and energy devices. Unfixed porcine carotid arteries were selected for testing. They were connected to a pump, and automated controlled infusion was <b>initiated.</b> Upon <b>identification</b> of a leak at the source of sealing, the maximum pressure in mmHg was logged. RESULTS: There were a total of 184 trials conducted using the 10 vessel sealing methods. The average burst pressure across all trials was 1100  mmHg with a range of 51. 3 - 5171  mmHg. Suture-based methods displayed the highest average pressure until failure. Stapling methods showed the lowest burst pressures. All methods showed mean burst pressures above the "physiologically relevant" level of 250  mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an independent, reproducible, ex vivo comparison of multiple methods of surgical arterial closure. In these laboratory conditions, tests to failure demonstrated widely varying sealing strength, highly dependent on method. All hemostatic modalities tested are capable of securing vessels safely and well above physiologic blood pressures, while suture-based methods were significantly stronger than other mechanical methods or modern energy devices...|$|R
40|$|This essay emerges at the {{intersection}} of theoretical and theological interrogations of Christian accounts of universality, especially as expressed in the Pauline corpus. Drawing on insurgent interpreters, Daniel Boyarin, John David Dawson, Alain Badiou, Giorgio Agamben, and Douglas Campbell, it explicates an ac-count of dispersive universality that avoids the evacuation of difference and elimination of particularity. On the contrary, rather than requiring others to become identical to us, identity is constructed by becoming identified with others. This alternative politics of identification is announced paradigmatically in the bap-tismal formula of Galatians 3 : 26 - 28, and is intrinsically related to Paul’s description of the new life of the Christian in 2 : 19 - 20. The unity of Christians in Christ (3 : 26 - 28) is constituted by the actuality of Christ living in them (2 : 19 - 20). Though as embodied beings the lives of Christians remain in the flesh, such life is now lived in Christ, and by Christ living in them. Individual and social bodies (the life lived in the flesh) are pneumatologically reconfigured within a Christological paradigm (the life lived by faith). Thus, baptism identifies the baptisand with Christ, inaugurates the new life of Christ living within, and <b>initiates</b> ongoing <b>identification</b> with others.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aggressiveness}} of melanoma tumors {{is likely}} to rely on their well-recognized heterogeneity and plasticity. Melanoma comprises multi-subpopulations of cancer cells {{some of which may}} possess stem cell-like properties. Although useful, the sphere-formation assay to identify stem cell-like or tumor initiating cell subpopulations in melanoma has been challenged, and it is unclear if this model can predict a functional phenotype associated with aggressive tumor cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the molecular and functional phenotypes of melanoma spheroids formed in neural crest cell medium. Whether from metastatic or advanced primary tumors, spheroid cells expressed melanoma-associated markers. They displayed higher capacity to differentiate along mesenchymal lineages and enhanced expression of SOX 2, NANOG, KLF 4, and/or OCT 4 transcription factors, but not enhanced self-renewal or tumorigenicity when compared to their adherent counterparts. Gene expression profiling attributed a neural crest cell signature to these spheroids and indicated that a migratory/invasive and immune-function modulating program could be associated with these cells. In vitro assays confirmed that spheroids display enhanced migratory/invasive capacities. In immune activation assays, spheroid cells elicited a poorer allogenic response from immune cells and inhibited mitogen-dependent T cells activation and proliferation more efficiently than their adherent counterparts. Our findings reveal a novel immune-modulator function of melanoma spheroids and suggest specific roles for spheroids in invasion and in evasion of antitumor immunity. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The association of a more plastic, invasive and evasive, thus a more aggressive tumor phenotype with melanoma spheroids reveals a previously unrecognized aspect of tumor cells expanded as spheroid cultures. While of limited efficiency for melanoma <b>initiating</b> cell <b>identification,</b> our melanoma spheroid model predicted aggressive phenotype and suggested that aggressiveness and heterogeneity of melanoma tumors can be supported by subpopulations other than cancer stem cells.

The theoretical basis for this examination is Michel Foucault's The History of Sexuality (Vol. l). In this work Foucault argues that {{during the nineteenth century}} sexuality was discussed and analysed as much, if not more than, it has been in our own century; that through various discourses a norm of sexuality was established, a norm against which all forms of sexual behaviour were defined and categorised. This transformation of sex into discourse resulted in the initiation of sexual heterogeneities. The process that Foucault outlines suggests film links with the creation of class hegemony. In the nineteenth century the emerging middle classes lacked a coherent class identity and it was this that they sought through the formation of new codes relating to sexual and moral issues. This thesis incorporates a discussion of David Copperfield as autobiographical fiction {{and the extent to which}} David's own narrative can be regarded as "truth". This reading of the novel centres on a view of David, a respectable middle-class gentleman, as supervisor of a panoptic structure, within which the world of the novel exists. His observations of the various domestic "cells" within this structure <b>initiate</b> the <b>identification</b> of a variety of peripheral sexualities, which correspond with those outlined in Foucault's History of Sexuality. Through this process David is shown to redefine and reinforce his own middle-class status. To the extent that this process of categorisation and marginalisation of peripheral sexualities, this endorsement of middle-class hegemony, is reproduced in this narrative, it can be said that David Copperfield is complicit with the general discourse on sexuality as outlined by Foucault in Volume one of The History of Sexuality...|$|R
40|$|The minimum {{information}} about a biofilm experiment (MIABiE) initiative has arisen from the need to find an adequate and scientifically sound way to control {{the quality of the}} documentation accompanying the public deposition of biofilm-related data, particularly those obtained using high-throughput devices and techniques. Thereby, the MIABiE consortium has <b>initiated</b> the <b>identification</b> and organization of a set of modules containing the {{minimum information}} that needs to be reported to guarantee the interpretability and independent verification of experimental results and their integration with knowledge coming from other fields. MIABiE does not intend to propose specific standards on how biofilms experiments should be performed, because it is acknowledged that specific research questions require specific conditions which may deviate from any standardization. Instead, MIABiE presents guidelines about the data to be recorded and published in order for the procedure and results to be easily and unequivocally interpreted and reproduced. Overall, MIABiE opens up the discussion about a number of particular areas of interest and attempts to achieve a broad consensus about which biofilm data and metadata should be reported in scientific journals in a systematic, rigorous and understandable manner.

40|$|Semantic Gap, High {{retrieval}} efficiency, {{and speed}} are important factors for content-based {{image retrieval system}} (CBIR). Recent research towards semantic gap reduction to improve the retrieval accuracy of CBIR is shifting towards machine learning methods, relevance feedback, object ontology etc. In this research study, we have put forward the idea that semantic gap {{can be reduced to}} improve the performance accuracy of image retrieval through a two-step process. It should be <b>initiated</b> with the <b>identification</b> of the semantic category of the query image in the first step, followed by retrieving of similar images from the identified semantic category in the second step. We have later demonstrated this idea through constructing a global feature vector using wavelet decomposition of color and texture information of the query image and then used feature vector to identify its semantic category. We have trained a stacked classifier consisting of deep neural network and logistic regression as base classifiers for identifying the semantic category of input image. The image retrieval process in the identified semantic category was achieved through Gabor Filter of the texture information of query image. This proposed algorithm has shown better precision rate of image retrieval than that of other researchers work...|$|R

Beginning November 30, 1999, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (EPD) {{suspended}} permitting of new agricultural withdrawals while {{conducting the}} Regional Water Development and Conservation Plan for the Lower Flint River and Upper Floridan Aquifer. The plan requires, among other things, an accurate determination of irrigated {{area in the}} region affected before permitting or other water management activities can resume. Determination of current irrigated area was <b>initiated</b> through <b>identification</b> of permanent irrigation structures visible on digital orthoquad images from the region. Subsequently, farmers and other permit holders identified which of their permits were associated with mapped fields and drew associated wells, surface pumps, and other irrigated fields directly to onscreen images. Each permittee was provided with documentation that contained an areal image of the permit site and official permit details. The Permit Maps eliminate confusion over which permit is associated with each parcel of land, document ownership during financial transactions, and help establish their water use. EPD was provided a GIS data base with irrigation shape and withdrawal point data layers labeled by permit numbers. The process illustrates how public agencies working cooperatively with water users can provide the action information the agency needs while protecting {{the rights of the}} established users.
