5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the <b>hairpin</b> <b>structure</b> can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E
25|$|SL-II {{has been}} {{suggested}} to contribute to nuclease resistance. It {{may be related to}} another hairpin loop identified in the 5'UTR of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genome.

500|$|Another use of strand {{displacement}} cascades {{is to make}} dynamically assembled structures. [...] These use a <b>hairpin</b> <b>structure</b> for the reactants, so {{that when}} the input strand binds, the newly revealed sequence is on the same molecule rather than disassembling. [...] This allows new opened hairpins to be added to a growing complex. [...] This approach has been used to make simple structures such as three- and four-arm junctions and dendrimers.|$|E

40|$|By {{performing}} a comprehensive study on 1832 segments of 1212 complete genomes of viruses, {{we show that}} in viral genomes the <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> of thermodynamically predicted RNA secondary structures are more abundant than expected under a simple random null hypothesis. The detected <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> of RNA secondary structures are present both in coding and in noncoding regions for the four groups of viruses categorized as dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA and ssRNA. For all groups <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> of RNA secondary structures are detected more frequently than expected for a random null hypothesis in noncoding rather than in coding regions. However, potential RNA secondary structures are also present in coding regions of dsDNA group. In fact we detect evolutionary conserved RNA secondary structures in conserved coding and noncoding regions of a large set of complete genomes of dsDNA herpesviruses.

40|$|The tandem repeats of trinucleotide {{sequences}} {{are present}} in many human genes and their expansion in specific genes causes a number of hereditary neurological disorders. The normal function of triplet repeats in transcripts is barely known {{and the role of}} expanded RNA repeats in the pathogenesis of Triplet Repeat Expansion Diseases needs to be more fully elucidated. Here we have described the structures formed by transcripts composed of AAG, CAG, CCG, CGG and CUG repeats, which were determined by chemical and enzymatic structure probing. With the exception of the repeated AAG motif, all studied repeats form <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> and these <b>hairpins</b> show several alternative alignments. We have determined the molecular architectures of these co-existing <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> by using transcripts with GC-clamps which imposed single alignments of hairpins. We have provided experimental evidence that CCUG repeats implicated in myotonic dystrophy type 2 also form <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> with properties similar to that composed of the CUG repeats...|$|R
2500|$|... m6A {{has been}} {{observed}} to be located within the loops opposite of the HNRNPC binding site. HNRNPC is single-stranded RNA binding protein where it participates in post-transcriptional regulation, specifically alternative splicing. HNRNPC protein binds to its site (uridine rich region on the stem loop) when methylated adenosine is present.The HNRNPC binding site on the mRNA consists of an abundance of uridine nucleotides. Methylated adenosine residues destabilize the <b>hairpin</b> <b>structure,</b> elongating the uridine nucleotide stretch, causing the binding site to be more accessible for efficient HNRNPC protein binding.|$|E
2500|$|Rho-independent {{transcription}} termination is {{the termination}} of transcription {{without the aid of}} the rho protein. [...] Transcription of a palindromic region of DNA causes the formation of a [...] "hairpin" [...] structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself. [...] This <b>hairpin</b> <b>structure</b> is often rich in G-C base-pairs, making it more stable than the DNA-RNA hybrid itself. [...] As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid. [...] These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.|$|E
2500|$|Several conserved {{secondary}} structure elements {{have been identified}} within the HIV RNA genome. The 5'UTR structure consists of series of stem-loop structures connected by small linkers. [...] These stem-loops (5' to 3') include the trans-activation region (TAR) element, the 5' polyadenylation signal , the PBS, the DIS, the major SD and the ψ <b>hairpin</b> <b>structure</b> located within the 5' end of the genome and the HIV Rev response element (RRE) within the env gene. Another RNA structure that has been identified is gag stem loop 3 (GSL3), thought {{to be involved in}} viral packaging. RNA {{secondary structure}}s have been proposed to affect the HIV life cycle by altering the function of HIV protease and reverse transcriptase, although not all elements identified have been assigned a function.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{contains}} “fragile sites” {{within the}} sequence {{that are more}} prone to recombination. These fragile sites are associated with the following trinucleotide repeats: CGG-CCG, GAG-CTG, GAA-TTC, and GCN-NGC. These fragile sites are conserved in mammals and in yeast, suggesting that the instability is caused by something inherent to the molecular structure of DNA and is associated with DNA-repeat instability. These fragile sites are thought to form <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> on the lagging strand during replication from single-stranded DNA base-pairing with itself in the trinucleotide repeat region. These <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> cause DNA breaks that lead to a higher frequency of recombination at these sites.|$|R
40|$|Triplet repeat {{expansion}} diseases (TREDs) {{are characterized}} by the coincidence of disease manifestation with amplification of d(CAG. CTG), d(CGG. CCG) or d(GAA. TTC) repeats contained within specific genes. Amplification of triplet repeats continues in offspring of affected individuals, which generally results in progressive severity of the disease and/or an earlier age of onset, phenomena clinically referred to as 'anticipation'. Recent biophysical and biochemical studies reveal that {{five of the six}} [d(CGG) n, d(CCG) n, (CAG) n, d(CTG) n and d(GAA) n] complementary sequences that are associated with human disease form stable <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures.</b> Although the triplet repeat sequences d(GAC) n and d(GTC) n also form hairpins, repeats of the double-stranded forms of these sequences are conspicuously absent from DNA sequence databases and are not anticipated to be associated with human disease. With the exception of d(GAG) n and d(GTG) n, the remaining triplet repeat sequences are unlikely to form <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> at physiological salt and temperature. The details of <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> containing trinucleotide repeats are summarized and discussed with respect to potential mechanisms of triplet repeat expansion and d(CGG.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{breakdown}} of localised disturbances into a turbulent {{spot in a}} Mach 2 boundary-layer flow have been investigated by direct numerical simulation. In particular, the interaction of a turbulent spot with a shock-induced separation bubble is studied. The primary vortex structures triggered by the injected low momentum fluid and the metamorphosis of the <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> into a turbulent spot are clearly identified in the present study. The spot-separation bubble interaction is found to enhance {{the breakdown of the}} <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> i. e. is capable of advancing the transition process. A substantial increase in the lateral spreading of the spot is observed due to the spot/bubble interaction. Locally averaged profiles of the flow quantities within the spot show behaviour similar to developed turbulent flows. ...|$|R
2500|$|H/ACA box snoRNAs have {{a common}} {{secondary}} structure consisting of a two hairpins and two single-stranded regions termed a hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail structure. [...] H/ACA snoRNAs also contain conserved sequence motifs known as H box (consensus ANANNA) and the ACA box (ACA). Both motifs are usually located in the single-stranded regions of the secondary structure. The H motif {{is located in the}} hinge and the ACA motif is located in the tail region; 3 nucleotides from the 3' end of the sequence. [...] The hairpin regions contain internal bulges known as recognition loops in which the antisense guide sequences (bases complementary to the target sequence) are located. This recognition sequence is bipartite (constructed from the two different arms of the loop region) and forms complex pseudo-knots with the target RNA. [...] H/ACA box snoRNAs associate with four evolutionary conserved and essential proteins—dyskerin (Cbf5p), GAR1, NHP2, and NOP10—which make up the core of the H/ACA box snoRNP. However, in lower eukaryotic cells such as trypanosomes, similar RNAs exist in the form of single <b>hairpin</b> <b>structure</b> and an AGA box instead of ACA box at the 3' end of the RNA.|$|E
2500|$|New microRNAs {{are created}} in {{multiple}} ways. Novel microRNAs can originate from the random formation of hairpins in [...] "non-coding" [...] sections of DNA (i.e. introns or intergene regions), {{but also by}} the duplication and modification of existing microRNAs. microRNAs can also form from inverted duplications of protein-coding sequences, which allows {{for the creation of a}} foldback <b>hairpin</b> <b>structure.</b> The rate of evolution (i.e. nucleotide substitution) in recently originated microRNAs is comparable to that elsewhere in the non-coding DNA, implying evolution by neutral drift; however, older microRNAs have a much lower rate of change (often less than one substitution per hundred million years), suggesting that once a microRNA gains a function, it undergoes purifying selection. Individual regions within an miRNA gene face different evolutionary pressures, where regions that are vital for processing and function have higher levels of conservation. At this point, a microRNA is rarely lost from an animal's genome, although newer microRNAs (thus presumably non-functional) are frequently lost. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the net flux of miRNA genes has been predicted to be between 1.2 and 3.3 genes per million years. This makes them a valuable phylogenetic marker, and they are being looked upon as a possible solution to outstanding phylogenetic problems such as the relationships of arthropods. On the other hand, in multiple cases microRNAs correlate poorly with phylogeny, and it is possible that their phylogenetic concordance largely reflects a limited sampling of microRNAs.|$|E

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} {{molecular}} non-coding RNAs that have {{important roles in}} the post-transcriptional mechanism of animals and plants. They are commonly 21 - 25 nucleotides (nt) long and derived from 60 - 90 nt RNA <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures,</b> called miRNA <b>hairpins.</b> A larger number of sequence segments in the human genome have been computationally identified with such 60 - 90 nt hairpins, however {{the majority of them}} are not miRNA hairpins. Most existing computational methods for predicting miRNA hairpins are based on a two-class classifier to distinguish between miRNA hairpins and other sequence segments with <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures.</b> The difficulty of these methods is how to select hairpins as negative examples of miRNA hairpins in the training dataset, since only a few miRNA hairpins are available. Therefore, these classifiers may be mis-trained due to some false negative examples of the training dataset. In this paper, we introduce a one-class support vector machine (SVM) method to predict miRNA hairpins among the <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures.</b> Different from existing methods for predicting miRNA hairpins, the one-class SVM classifier is trained only on the information of the miRNA class. We also illustrate some examples of predicting miRNA hairpins in human chromosomes 10, 15, and 21, where our method overcomes the above disadvantages of existing two-class methods...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} it is shown that <b>hairpin</b> vortex <b>structures</b> {{can be the}} outcome of a {{nonlinear}} optimal growth process, in a similar way as streaky structures can be the result of a linear optimal growth mechanism. With this purpose, nonlinear optimizations based on a Lagrange multiplier technique coupled with a direct-adjoint iterative procedure are performed in a plane Poiseuille flow at subcritical values of the Reynolds number, aiming at quickly triggering nonlinear effects. Choosing a suitable time scale for such an optimization process, it is found that the initial optimal perturbation is composed of sweeps and ejections resulting in a <b>hairpin</b> vortex <b>structure</b> at the target time. These alternating sweeps and ejections create an inflectional instability occurring in a localized region away from the wall, generating the head of the primary and secondary <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures,</b> quickly inducing transition to turbulent flow.

40|$|Hairpin DNA ends are {{evolutionarily}} conserved intermediates in DNA recombination. The <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures</b> {{present on}} the ends of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome are substrates for recombination that give rise to persistent circular and concatemeric DNA episomes through intramolecular and intermolecular recombination, respectively. We have developed circularization-dependent and orientation-specific self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors as a reporter system to examine recombination events involving distinct <b>hairpin</b> <b>structures,</b> i. e., closed versus open hairpins. The results suggest that intramolecular recombination (circularization) is far more efficient than intermolecular recombination (concatemerization). Among all possible combinations of terminal repeats (TRs) involved in intermolecular recombination, the closed-closed TR structures are twice as efficient as the open-open TR substrates for recombination. In addition, both intramolecular recombination and intermolecular recombination exhibit the common dependency on specific DNA polymerases and topoisomerases. The circularization-dependent and orientation-specific scAAV vectors can serve as an efficient and controlled system for the delivery of DNA structures that mimic mammalian recombination intermediates and should be useful in assaying recombination in different experimental settings as well as elucidating the molecular mechanism of recombinant AAV genome persistence. <b>Hairpin</b> (HP) DNA <b>structures</b> are recombination intermediate...|$|R
