The governmental system {{is based on the}} principle of self-determination and government by the people.*Article 2: Executive power and legislative responsibility is exercised by and concentrated {{in the hands of the}} Grand National Assembly which is the sole and real representative of the nation.*Article 3: The Turkish State is governed by the Grand National Assembly (Büyük Millet Meclisi) and its government is entitled 'the Government of Grand National Assembly' (Büyük Millet Meclisi Hükûmeti).*Article 4: The Grand National Assembly is composed of members who are elected by the people of the provinces.*Article 5: Elections to the Grand National Assembly are held every two years. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership</b> is limited to two years but re-election of a member is possible. The former assembly remains in office until the new assembly convenes. When holding a new election seems to be impossible the legislative period can be extended by only one year. Each member of the Grand National Assembly is not only a representative of the province by which he is elected but of the whole nation.*Article 6: The General Assembly of the Grand National Assembly convenes of its own accord on the first day of November.*Article 7: The basic rights of the application of the ordinances of the sacred law; the promulgation, amendment, and abrogation of all laws; the concluding of treaties and peace; the promulgation of the defence of the fatherland (i.e., the declaration of war) belong to the Grand National Assembly. The preparation of laws and regulations will be guided by juridical and religious provisions, which best conform to the modus operandi of the people and the needs of the times, as well as established customs. The functions and responsibilities of the Council of Ministers shall be fixed by a special law.*Article 8: The government of the Grand National Assembly exercises the executive function through ministers who are elected according to its special law. The Grand National Assembly directs the ministers on executive affairs and changes them when necessary.*Article 9: The Head of the Grand National Assembly who is elected by the General Assembly is the Head of the Grand National Assembly for one electoral period. With this status, he is entitled to sign on behalf of the Assembly and to approve the decisions of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers elects one member from among its number as the head of the Council of Ministers.

Brand experience is considered to consist of five dimensions, encompassing a behavioural, emotional, intellectual, relational and sensory component. The purpose of the research was to consider whether brand experience as mediator of satisfaction and loyalty is observed in the religious and church industry and whether it differs amongst specific churches. It also aimed to determine whether age, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership,</b> level of education or membership status is a mediating factor of these constructs. By undertaking a quantitative explanatory study, 12 churches participated in obtaining 675 valid responses by means of an electronic survey to achieve the research objectives. Using the Brand Experience Scale, as developed by Brakus, Schmitt and Zarantonello (2009) and enhanced to include a relational dimension as proposed by Nysveen, Pedersen and Skard (2013), 15 statements considered the five dimensions of brand experience, and ten statements evaluated loyalty and satisfaction perceptions. It was found that brand experience as mediator of loyalty and satisfaction is observed within the religious industry and that it differs amongst churches. Age and membership status were shown to influence the constructs, whereas <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership</b> or level of education was not confirmed.

40|$|Abstract: Trust is {{a crucial}} {{prerequisite}} for peer-to-peer rental and sharing. Therefore, platform operators such as Airbnb have implemented a host of trust-building mechanisms, user interface (UI) artefacts, and reputation systems. While the role of reputation systems for establishing trust is well-understood, {{little is known about}} how reputation actually translates into tangible economic value. In this paper, we thus consider the economic value of trust artefacts on Airbnb by quantifying price effects of common reputation features from a signalling theory perspective. Our analysis is based on a large-scale dataset from 86 German cities and hedonic price modelling. We find that index signals such as the hosts’ rating scores, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership,</b> and Superhost status provide economic value. Moreover, also conventional signals such as accommodation photographs consistently translate into price premiums. We discuss implications for platform operators, users, and the general design of IS artefacts intended to facilitate peer-to-peer platform interactions...|$|E

40|$|Women’s {{access to}} credit is {{generally}} believed to result in their economic empowerment. As a result, the provision of microfinance to women has been called for by various international and national organizations {{in light of their}} productive role for economic development and women’s rights. The impact of microfinance on income has been observed to be variable. It appears that, for the majority of borrowers’ income increases are small and even in some cases negative. This {{is due to the fact}} that most of the women invest in existing activities with low profit and insecure. In addition, women’s choices and ability to increase income is constrained by gender inequalities in access to other resources for investment in household responsibility and lack of mobility. The access to microfinance, by and large, has a positive economic impact. The impact becomes larger for those closer to the poverty line and it also increases with the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership</b> or intensity of loans as members begin to invest in assets rather than consumption.

Method: Details on each sexual partner reported by each man over a 12 month recall period included type of partner, months during which sexual relations took place, and condom use. Results: The men reported 471 sexual partners over the recall period, with a range of 0 – 16 partners, and an average of just under two partners. 8 % of men had had no sexual partner, half were monogamous, and 3 % had multiple partners with whom they used condoms exclusively, leaving 39 % at varying degrees of risk.

We also explore the impacts of other factors likely to influence the ability of PRIDE-supported enterprises to create jobs. The ANCOVA results of 159 surveyed microcredit clients in Iringa town show that although microcredit access has enabled women to fund their enterprise operations, credit access {{does not seem to have}} enabled them to achieve job creation to any substantial level. This study instead establishes that much of a PRIDE-supported enterprise‟s ability to create jobs seems to be related to other factors, such as <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership</b> in the PRIDE program and {{whether or not}} the owner of the enterprise has control over enterprise-related decision making and over the use of the loan and the proceeds generated. Notwithstanding, a significant part of the variance in an enterprise‟s ability to create jobs remains unexplained. These results suggest that microcredit alone is not a magic bullet in reducing poverty among women. Therefore, for any new policy to have a meaningful effect, a holistic approach needs to be brought to bear on the issues surrounding women ownership of micro and small businesses, women entrepreneurship, women‟s empowerment, and poverty reduction.

We have been particularly inspired by {{a study of the}} Commercial Court of Paris, a judicial institution whose members are peer-elected businesspeople and are partly replaced every year.

40|$|Kenyan {{community}} leaders called for strengthened sustainable livelihoods for farmers and in 1992 formed a self-help dairy {{group that was}} reorganized in 2009 to form the Wakulima Dairy Ltd. (WDL). At WDL, members sell surplus milk to the dairy and, through nongovernmental organization (NGO) partnerships, receive training to enhance dairy farm productivity. As a result, higher milk production has been reported; however, data are lacking on sustainability and livelihood outcomes of dairy training for women farmers. To inform future projects and interventions, our study objectives were to determine the relationships between dairy group membership and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership,</b> sustainable livelihood assets, household income, and food security. We thus conducted a cross-sectional survey of 88 WDL members (among four membership duration groups) and 23 nonmember farmers. Milk production and herd size were higher for greater-than-three-year members compared to nonmembers and one-to-three-year members. The proportion of households with an income from dairy of greater than 5, 000 ksh/month (ranging from 0 to 40 percent), food security (ranging from 4 to 30 percent), and number of improved household characteristics (ranging from 1. 7 to 3. 3), were positively associated with longer membership duration. While the cross-sectional design does not allow attribution of causality, results suggested that WDL membership strengthened the livelihood assets of women farmers, particularly after three years, and that positive outcomes were sustained with longer membership duration. Anecdotally, women indicated that WDL's role in women's control of dairy income, regular payments, and food and services on credit, were important. WDL is a model to strengthen sustainable livelihoods through relevant gendered training, supports, and market access for agricultural products. Research to understand the optimal asset mix to benefit from dairy {{groups as well as}} factors limiting per-cow milk production is needed to guide future interventions and enhance the role of dairy farming for sustainable livelihoods...|$|E
