5|$|Rick {{was one of}} {{only eight}} known hurricanes to form in the East Pacific in November. The others were Nina in 1957, Tara in 1961, Iwa in 1982, Nora in 1991, Sergio in 2006, Kenneth in 2011, and Sandra in 2015. Rick was the second one of these to make landfall, {{although}} it was the third weakest of them, <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> stronger than Nina and Iwa (Tara's central pressure is unknown). Rick is also the second-latest hurricane in official records to have hit either coast of Mexico, behind only Tara.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill {{the spaces between}} the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E
5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company {{had no other}} assets and {{it was reported that}} it was seeking to speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September.|$|E
25|$|The body {{should be}} upright or <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> leaning back. Leaning back too far causes {{momentum}} {{to be lost}} as it takes too long to transfer from back foot contact to front foot contact.|$|E
25|$|Berkowitz {{claimed that}} his first attack was {{committed}} on Christmas Eve, 1975, when he used a hunting knife to stab two women. One alleged victim was never identified by police, but the other was teenager Michelle Forman, whose injuries were serious {{enough for her to}} be hospitalized. Berkowitz was not suspected of these crimes, and soon afterward he relocated to an apartment in Yonkers, New York, <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> north of the New York City borderline.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 Installer 4 was ported to iOS 4+ by Infini Dev, {{however the}} package was <b>just</b> a <b>slightly</b> {{modified}} version of the last release by Ripdev. As a response, Ripdev reopened their Installer repository for Installer.|$|R

25|$|On April 7, 2013, {{the sixth}} season premiered to 3.37 million viewers, and a 1.1 adults 18–49. This was {{down from the}} fifth season premiere, but up from the fifth season finale. The sixth season finale on June 23, 2013, {{attracted}} 2.69 million total viewers, and achieved a 0.9 adults 18–49 demographic rating; on par with the fifth season finale. This helped bring the season average up to 2.49 million viewers, down <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> from the season five average.|$|E
25|$|The Somerville Circle {{is located}} on the border between Bridgewater Township and Raritan, New Jersey, <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> {{northwest}} of Somerville. The border runs down Route 28 with Raritan having a slightly larger portion of the circle within its borders. The border bisecting the circle usually causes minor confusion when accidents are reported as drivers are often not sure what side of the border they are on and which town's police department has jurisdiction. More traffic accidents occur on the Raritan side of the circle than the Bridgewater side.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from her}} attributes, {{there seems to}} be a {{relative}} consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling lips are usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long.|$|E

25|$|As in The Age of Intelligent Machines Kurzweil argues {{here that}} {{evolution}} has an intelligence quotient <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> greater than zero. He {{says it is}} not higher than that because evolution operates so slowly, and intelligence {{is a function of}} time. Kurzweil explains that humans are far more intelligent than evolution, based on what we have created in the last few thousand years, and that in turn our creations will soon be more intelligent than us. The law of accelerating returns predicts this will happen within decades, Kurzweil reveals.|$|E
25|$|Once the yerba mate has settled, {{the mate}} is {{carefully}} {{brought to a}} near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the yerba mate inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space {{on one side of}} the gourd and the lopsided pile of yerba on the other.|$|E
25|$|Of {{apparent}} magnitude 4.06, Upsilon Boötis has a spectral class of K5 and an absolute magnitude of −0.3. Dimmer than Upsilon Boötis is magnitude 4.54 Phi Boötis, with a spectral class of K2 and an absolute magnitude of −0.1. <b>Just</b> <b>slightly</b> dimmer than Phi at magnitude 4.60 is O Boötis, which, like Izar, has a spectral class of K0. O Boötis has an absolute magnitude of 0.2. The other four dim stars are magnitude 4.91 6 Boötis, class K4; magnitude 4.86 20 Boötis, class K3; magnitude 4.81 Omega Boötis, class K4; and magnitude 4.83 A Boötis, class K1.|$|E

25|$|A {{new version}} of the Alternate History List was posted to Usenet once every month or two over the next six years. The first web version was posted in 1995, but {{for the next two years}} it {{remained}} <b>just</b> a <b>slightly</b> modified copy of the same material that was still being posted to Usenet. In early 1997, the list became Web-only.|$|R
50|$|Living in a Moon so Blue is {{an album}} that's {{very hard to}} {{separate}} from its near-counterpart, Staring at the Cellophane. Both albums feature the same parlor guitar on the cover (<b>just</b> from <b>slightly</b> different views) and the contents are remarkably similar, with Jandek delving further into the deep, anarchic blues while putting aside - for now - the female vocals and any instruments besides guitar, vocals and harmonica.|$|R
25|$|As of 2010, {{the density}} of {{petroleum}} diesel is about 0.832kg/L (6.943lb/USgal), about 11.6% more than ethanol-free petrol (gasoline), which has a density of about 0.745kg/L (6.217lb/USgal). About 86.1% of the fuel mass is carbon, and when burned, it offers a net heating value of 43.1 MJ/kg as opposed to 43.2 MJ/kg for gasoline. However, due to the higher density, diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density at 35.86 MJ/L (128,700BTU/USgal) vs. 32.18 MJ/L (115,500BTU/USgal) for gasoline, some 11% higher, which should be considered when comparing the fuel efficiency by volume. The CO2 emissions from diesel are 73.25 g/MJ, <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than for gasoline at 73.38 g/MJ.|$|E
25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles. The corium temperature is now <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, seeping into pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple of}} busy {{intercity}} corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median traffic barriers. Highway 1 on Vancouver Island and Highway 97 through the Okanagan Valley are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds {{that range from}} 50km/h to maximums <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than the principal grade-separated highways. Numerous traffic lights operate in place of interchanges on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures. Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter-urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways {{is the responsibility of}} the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|Murici is a {{municipality}} {{located in}} {{the west of the}} Brazilian state of Alagoas. Its population is 22,132 (2005) and its area is 424 km². According to the Veja magazine, despite receiving generous public transfers, the city still lags behind most municipalities in Brazil in human development. 30.6% of its inhabitants are illiterate and 65% rely on Federal funds to survive, which contribute for an HDI of <b>just</b> 0.58, <b>slightly</b> below Iraq's HDI of 0.59.|$|R

25|$|Sub-Saharan Africa {{nations are}} {{globally}} achieving impressive improvements in well-being, {{according to a}} report by Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative and the Boston Consulting Group. Angola has upgraded critical infrastructure, an investment made possible by funds from the nation's development of oil resources. According to this report, <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> more than ten years after the end of the civil war Angola's standard of living has overall greatly improved. Life expectancy, which was just 46 years in 2002, reached 51 in 2011. Mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001. However, at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country since long has not diminished, but on the contrary deepened in all respects.|$|E
25|$|The {{fountain}} {{is a large}} granite surface, {{forming an}} elongated backrest, measuring about 3 metres wide and 1.20 metres high. On {{the left of the}} rock is a carved human figure, about 1.10 metres tall, upright, but deteriorated, and possibly male with a beard, wrapped in a toga, holding in his left arm a bulky object. It is flanked above by Latin inscription, the first word partially cut into the stone. To the right of the figure (<b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> below) is a rectangular building cut into the rock, about 0.7 metres high, 0.6 metres wide and 0.12 deep, with the worn figure of human head. The little house is crowned by a triangular pediment with a bird engraved into its triangular form, while other Latin inscriptions are engraved into its sides, extending to the base. At the base of this granite structure flows the fountain's water.|$|E
25|$|Tzotzil {{speakers}} number <b>just</b> <b>slightly</b> {{less than}} theTzeltals at 226,000, although {{those of the}} ethnicity are probably higher. Tzotzils {{are found in the}} highlands or Los Altos and spread out towards the northeast near the border with Tabasco. However, Tzotzil communities can be found in almost every municipality of the state. They are concentrated in Chamula, Zinacantán, Chenalhó, and Simojovel. Their language is closely related to Tzeltal and distantly related to Yucatec Mayan and Lacandon. Men dress in short pants tied with a red cotton belt and a shirt that hangs down to their knees. They also wear leather huaraches and a hat decorated with ribbons. The women wear a red or blue skirt, a short huipil as a blouse, and use a chal or rebozo to carry babies and bundles. Tzotzil communities are governed by a katinab who is selected for life by the leaders of each neighborhood. The Tzotzils are also known for their continued use of the temazcal for hygiene and medicinal purposes.|$|E
5000|$|British {{architects and}} {{industrial}} designers once used a size called [...] "Antiquarian", 31 × 53 in, as listed above, but {{given in the}} New Metric Handbook (Tutt & Adler 1981) as 813 × 1372 mm for board size. This is a little larger than ISO A0, 841 mm × 1189 mm. So for a short time, a size called A0a of 1000 × 1370 mm was used in Britain, which is actually <b>just</b> a <b>slightly</b> shorter version of ISO B0 at 1414 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Schokland (...) is {{a former}} island in the Dutch Zuiderzee, in the {{municipality}} of Noordoostpolder.
