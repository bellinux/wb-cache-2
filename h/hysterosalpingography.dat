50|$|Blockage of the fallopian tubes {{is mainly}} {{diagnosed}} today by <b>hysterosalpingography</b> (HSG) or Hystero Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy) in which either X-ray contrast media or aqueous fluid are forced up the fallopian tube {{to create an}} image on X-ray or ultrasound.

50|$|The {{history of}} a {{pregnancy}} event followed by a D&C leading to secondary amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea is typical. Hysteroscopy is {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis. Imaging by sonohysterography or <b>hysterosalpingography</b> will reveal the extent of the scar formation. Ultrasound is not a reliable method of diagnosing Asherman's Syndrome. Hormone studies show normal levels consistent with reproductive function.|$|E
50|$|Besides a {{physical}} examination, the physician will need imaging techniques {{to determine the}} character of the malformation: gynecologic ultrasonography, pelvic MRI, or <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> A hysterosalpingogram is not considered as useful due to the inability of the technique to evaluate the exterior contour of the uterus and distinguish between a bicornuate and septate uterus. In addition, laparoscopy and/or hysteroscopy may be indicated.In some patients the vaginal development may be affected.|$|E
50|$|Historically Lipiodol {{was often}} used as a {{contrast}} medium at <b>hysterosalpingography</b> (HSG: a procedure to determine tubal patency, used {{in the investigation of}} subfertility). It became less commonly utilised in the 1960s to 1980s because the more modern water-soluble media give images that are easier to interpret. There is also an important safety issue with Lipiodol in that intravasation (leakage) of the fluid into the venous system has caused complications in the past.|$|E

5000|$|Women {{are often}} {{diagnosed}} with this condition after several failed pregnancies, proceeded by exploratory diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance, sonography, and particularly <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> In such studies, a widening of the interstitial and isthmus of uterine tube is observed, {{as well as}} constrictions or narrowing of the uterus as a whole, especially the lower and lateral portions, hence the [...] "t" [...] denomination. The uterus might be simultaneously reduced in volume, and other abnormalities might be concomitantly present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hysterosalpingography</b> (HSG), {{also known}} as uterosalpingography, is a radiologic {{procedure}} to investigate {{the shape of the}} uterine cavity and the shape and patency of the fallopian tubes. It entails the injection of a radio-opaque material into the cervical canal and usually fluoroscopy with image intensification. A normal result shows the filling of the uterine cavity and the bilateral filling of the fallopian tube with the injection material. To demonstrate tubal rupture, spillage of the material into the peritoneal cavity needs to be observed.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis of {{cervical}} incompetence can {{be challenging}} {{and is based on}} a history of painless cervical dilation usually after the first trimester without contractions or labor {{and in the absence of}} other clear pathology. In addition to history, some providers use assessment of cervical length in second trimester to identify cervical shortening using ultrasound. However, short cervical length has actually been shown to be a marker of preterm birth rather than cervical incompetence. Other diagnostic tests that have been suggested which have not been validated include <b>hysterosalpingography</b> and radiographic imaging of balloon traction on the cervix, assessment of the patulous cervix with Hegar or Pratt dilators, the use of a balloon elastance test, and use of graduated cervical dilators to calculate a cervical resistance index.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{method of}} tubal evaluation, <b>hysterosalpingography,</b> has {{shortcomings}} {{in terms of}} false negative and false positive results. It {{has been argued that}} falloposcopy allows for a more accurate evaluation of the tubal canal. Obstructions, adhesions within the tubal canal, and debris can be identified. The procedure allows removal of debris or filmy adhesions from within the fallopian tube, further in selected cases proximal tubal obstruction can be overcome and the tube can be recanalized allowing for pregnancy. Proximal tubal occlusion has also been overcome by using hysteroscopy with tubal canalization using a catheter, not a falloposcope. Extensive tubal obstruction, however, cannot be overcome by falloposcopy and would require tubal surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF) to be overcome to achieve a pregnancy.|$|E
5000|$|Gynography (Spanish: ginógrafo) {{is defined}} as [...] "radiography of the female genital organs" [...] that uses [...] "air or other gas" [...] that is {{injected}} intraperitoneally as a contrast medium. The gynograph was invented by Abner I. Weisman, a medical doctor. The gynograph is a new improved gynoroentgenologic apparatus used by gynecologists and radiologists in performing <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> The advantage of the gynograph over uterosalpingography - which involves the installation of foreign material into the uterus - {{is that it is}} [...] "practically free from complications" [...] such as intravasation of the venous sinuses of the uterus, pulmonary emboli, foreign body retention cysts, pelvic peritonitis, [...] of the fallopian tube, and death. The only known rare side effect is the occasional flaring-up of an old chronic salpingitis.|$|E
50|$|Helpful {{techniques}} {{to investigate a}} septum are transvaginal ultrasonography and sonohysterography, MRI, and hysteroscopy. More recently 3-D ultrasonography has been advocated as an excellent non-invasive method to delineate the condition. Prior to modern imaging <b>hysterosalpingography</b> was used to help diagnose the uterine septum, however, a bicornuate uterus may deliver a similar image.An important category of septate uterus is the hybrid type a variant that may be misdiagnosed as bicornuate uterus when seen by laparoscopy Professor El Saman From Egypt {{was the first to}} describe this anomaly and warned gynecologist about this common misdiagnosis, whenever there is a uterine fundus depression on laparoscopy gynecologists should compare the depth of this depression with the depth of the dividing internal interface. Hybrid septate uterus benefit from hysteroscopic metroplasty under laparoscopic control.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} radiographic {{signs of}} mucosal damage by comparing <b>hysterosalpingography</b> with salpingoscopy in a prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one candidates for laparoscopy underwent <b>hysterosalpingography</b> and peroperative salpingoscopy; at both, tubal patency was noted. Radiographic criteria for mucosal abnormality were rounded filling defects (ie, the cobblestone pattern) {{and the absence}} of longitudinal radiolucent bands in the ampullary tract. At salpingoscopy, tubal mucosa was categorized by means of inspection into five classes of fold pattern: classes I and II, normal; classes III-V, abnormal. Hysterosalpingographic and salpingoscopic results were compared by means of a two-by-two table and k statistics. RESULTS: Seventy-four tubes were evaluated. At <b>hysterosalpingography,</b> 31 tubes were distally nonpatent. Of these, 26 showed a distal obstruction at salpingoscopy. None of the patent tubes at <b>hysterosalpingography</b> showed obstruction at salpingoscopy. The agreement between <b>hysterosalpingography</b> and salpingoscopy in detecting abnormal mucosal pattern was 89. 2...|$|E
30|$|In our Centre to {{evaluate}} tubal patency we first perform <b>hysterosalpingography</b> and then laparoscopy. Laparoscopy can first have a diagnostic role to confirm what seen at <b>hysterosalpingography</b> {{or it can}} diagnose some obstruction not seen by <b>hysterosalpingography</b> {{but the most important}} is that by laparoscopy it’s possible to treat tubal obstruction. For the prossimal tubal damage we use tranhysteroscopic Wallace catheter with a combined hysteroscopic-laparoscopic approach, for the distal tubal damage we usually perform salpingoplastic and adhesiolysis if necessary.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{conducted}} a prospective blinded study {{to evaluate the}} costs, accuracy, risks, and benefits of 3 -dimensional (3 D) transvaginal sonography compared to <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> METHODS: A total of 101 women aged 26 to 44 years with evidence of uterine anomalies were enrolled. All participants had routine <b>hysterosalpingography</b> {{as part of their}} infertility evaluation as well as 3 D transvaginal sonography as part of the study. Surgical findings were used as the standard for final diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 6 normal uteri and 119 uterine anomalies were classified: 30 congenital uterine anomalies (3 arcuate, 1 unicornuate, 4 bicornuate, 2 didelphys, and 20 septate uteri) and 89 acquired anomalies (38 polyps, 30 fibroids, 17 synechiae, and 4 adenomyosis). Congenital anomalies were correctly identified in 30 of 30 cases by 3 D sonography but from 10 to 30 of 30 cases by <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> The detection rates for acquired uterine anomalies were lower for both techniques: 44 to 89 of 89 cases for 3 D sonography and 22 to 74 of 89 cases for <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> Only 7 of the 20 septi would have been surgically corrected if patients only had <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> On the contrary, 30 of 30 patients with congenital uterine anomalies, 2 of 4 patients with adenomyosis, and all 6 patients with normal uteri were spared from surgery with diagnoses by 3 D sonography. No adverse effects were reported after sonography, and only 6 minor ones were reported after <b>hysterosalpingography.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional transvaginal sonography provides visualization and evaluation of the uterine cavity with similar or better accuracy than standard <b>hysterosalpingography</b> in the office setting, with lower cost and morbidity...|$|E
