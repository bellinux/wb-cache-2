60|$|I cannot {{conceive}} of <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> as a thing {{apart from the}} phenomena of my life. When I try to form such a conception I discover that, as Coleridge would have said, I only hypostatize a word, and it alters nothing if, with Fichte, I suppose the universe to be nothing but a manifestation of <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> I am neither more nor less eternal than I was before.|$|R

50|$|I've always {{considered}} myself an experimentalist. My {{subject matter is}} often whimsical or mysteriously off-beat. I've been told that my work reflects <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> pretty accurately.|$|R

5000|$|Halsted was a {{good friend}} of Kenneth Anger, and he loved Scorpio Rising. He said that [...] "I {{consider}} myself a pervert first and a homosexual second." [...] Also, he considered [...] "sadism... more basic to <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> than homosexuality".|$|R
5000|$|Discussing his {{character}} {{in an interview}} with The TV Chick, Overstreet commented: [...] "I think I {{put a little bit of}} <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> in him. I would say so. I’m such a nice, sweet guy that you don’t even have to act, it's me. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm not that full of myself. It's similar to <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> I would say. I'm kind of goofy and say stupid things to girls when I’m attracted to them. And when I like them, I say stupid things without thinking like the Avatar stuff, that's very much something I would say." [...] Overstreet said that the writers picked up lines from him and gave them to {{his character}}: ...|$|R

30|$|Nia: The store [J. Crew] is {{visually}} {{appealing to}} me, and I {{kind of like}} the mixture of classic stuff and things that are really feminine… and then they always have really great accessories. The style of the store really fits <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b>|$|R
3000|$|... “At first, I {{made much}} effort {{to look like}} a South Korean in terms of fashion or language. However, once I {{realized}} my identity and <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> I was satisfied with being either a South Korean or a North Korean.” (Participant D).|$|R
50|$|She {{was also}} {{quoted as saying}} her {{difficult}} first interview {{would not have been}} better for more preparation:"I'm still going to lose my words, my thought patterns are still going to get jumbled. In a way, that's a bit of <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> too".|$|R
5000|$|It was {{directed}} by Jim Wynorski, who made over 150 films. In 2013 he said this film [...] "comes closest to <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> and was the film I had the most fun making. It was the show I never wanted to end." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, she stated that [...] "Kelly" [...] is [...] "an exaggerated {{version of what}} I think the upper-level writers believe <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> is."

3000|$|I {{feel that}} I am self-centred and {{independent}}. Not many Chinese women can as independent as me. A lot of Chinese men expect their girlfriends or wives {{to rely on}} them. For <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> maybe it’s better for me to find a foreign man. (Grace) [...]...|$|R

In November 2013, O'Shaughnessy {{expressed an interest}} in representing the Republic of Ireland, stating that he feels [...] "more Irish than Finnish.

40|$|It {{is a basic}} {{truth that}} the artist must have {{independent}} experience and personality {{in order to create}} art from life. Combining a traditional realistic style with some elements of abstract composition fits <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> <b>My</b> paintings represent a pursuit of this idea that is the enhanced realism in the development of my painting...|$|R
5000|$|Larsson admitted, however, in {{the same}} memoirs that the {{pictures}} {{of his family and}} home [...] "became the most immediate and lasting part of my life's work.

5000|$|These {{drawings}} just represented what I was thinking. Except {{for a few}} instances, the flyers weren't done {{as commercial}} art or advertising. You could have stuck anything on a photocopy machine and put the band name and made an advertising flyer, but these weren't done like that. I was vehement about {{that as much as}} <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> allowed.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{constant}} battle, though, as some of our results ran full tilt into my intellectual ideas. In the beginning, I {{took it for granted}} that Seth was a subconscious fantasy, personified, because I simply couldnt accept the possibility of spirits or, for that matter, life after death. Then, after it became obvious that the Seth sessions were going to continue, we kept constant check on <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> characteristics and went to a psychologist - as any sane, red-blooded American would do under such circumstances in those days. Seth seemed far more mature and well-balanced than the psychologist, so finally I stopped worrying. Besides, <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> showed no adverse signs of instability. If anything, I was more competent in handling physical affairs. This is not to say the experience did not cause certain strains and stresses that could accompany any worthwhile venture in an entirely new field.|$|R
5000|$|... "Broken Heels" [...] {{was written}} by Bilal Hajji, Savan Kotecha and RedOne (who also {{produced}} the song). In an interview with IVillage, Alexandra Burke revealed {{that she had a}} lot of say in the making of the song because she did not want to be a [...] "toy" [...] or [...] "robot" [...] in the song's development process. Burke, in an interview with Popjustice, elaborated on her experience of working with RedOne. She said,I've got to say, Red was the one who basically got <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> out first. Then everything else slipped into place like a puzzle. Red really started it off for me. He had song already ready for me, right? And then I walked in, and he met me, and he was like, [...] "scrap every song we've just prepared for you, we're going to start from scratch, because you're not the person I thought you would be.' So then he wrote song according to <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{meant to}} be very {{energetic}} and final, but Captain Giles continued to gaze at me thoughtfully. Nothing could stop him. He went on {{to point out that}} <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> was involved in that conversation. When I tried to preserve the semblance of unconcern he became positively cruel. I heard what the man had said? Yes? What did I think of it then?--he wanted to know.|$|R
5000|$|Dalí himself brought Marcel Proust {{into the}} debate, {{whom he had}} already read as a {{juvenile}} and whose writing style - long sentences, metaphors - Dalí practiced, too. But Dalí invoked his name only in a comparison: [...] "It's mustache the most serious part of <b>my</b> <b>personality.</b> It's a very simple Hungarian moustache. Mister Marcel Proust used {{the same kind of}} pomade for this moustache." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, Chapa LaVia made racial {{comments}} by calling state Representative John Anthony a [...] "half." [...] Anthony is black with Puerto Rican heritage.

5000|$|Katy Perry as Smurfette, {{the female}} of the Smurfs. About gaining the voice role, Perry said: [...] "They {{had done a}} blind test where they took certain voices from {{previous}} interviews and matched them with the character. They liked my voice without even knowing who it was, and {{when they found out}} it was me, they thought that would work out. <b>My</b> <b>personality</b> was just a plus!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his YouTube career, Caylen also has appeared as an actor in several films and television series. In an interview with AOL, Caylen stated about his YouTube presence affecting his acting career, saying [...] "I'd say that it's impacted my career so much because people see <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> on YouTube {{and they want to}} work with me more. It's almost like a video resume because I have <b>my</b> own <b>personality</b> on YouTube and since I don't play a character, they can see who I am and what I'm about. I feel like they know me on a personal level and know what I will be like to work with." [...] Caylen played [...] "Mikey" [...] in the 2016 Tyler Perry comedy Boo! A Madea Halloween.|$|R
60|$|And {{tonight it}} jarred on {{me more than}} usual, because I was feeling pretty dashed fed with Jeeves. Over that matter of the mess jacket, I mean. True, I had forced him to climb down, quelling him, as described, with the quiet {{strength}} of <b>my</b> <b>personality,</b> but I was still a trifle shirty at his having brought the thing up at all. It {{seemed to me that}} what Jeeves wanted was the iron hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still," [...] he said, [...] "what {{you suggest}} is a trifle {{difficult}} to believe. If wheat keeps its value, my life, {{which is now}} in some ways a hard and lonely one, might be changed--it is <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> that presents the difficulty. There is so much you set value on that I know nothing about, and one could scarcely expect an English girl with any refinement to be attracted by a plain Western farmer." ...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor Thesis {{based on}} the topic Personal level of Melancholy. From the very {{beginning}} this topic was {{based on the}} fact that this work will touch me personally and will be based on the nature of <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> and build on my previous approaches to painting, that were formed during previous studies. My goal was to create abstract paintings, that matched their material meaning and are able to show them in the process of work...|$|R

The series of work split into two distinct styles and the relationships of the styles as they relate to aspects of <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> are explored...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{personal}} actor?s psychology. It {{is divided into}} two main parts, namely the theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part focuses on the overall analysis of the psychology of the actor - human. It depicts what is in the psychology of the actor's personality and what other factors are peculiar to it. The practical part describes stage fright, my experience with it, and how <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> deals with this issue...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{hated the}} 'dog-eat-dog' side of show-{{business}}," [...] Nedra Talley later commented. [...] "I hated {{pushing for the}} next record and the feeling of failure if we didn't get it. There was a continual demand on us to produce that I thought was unfair. <b>My</b> <b>personality</b> didn't like that." [...] Nedra's disdain for show business also became partly fueled by her desire to marry and settle down with her boyfriend, DJ Scott Ross.|$|R
5000|$|In {{its first}} few years the weekly stories were written with a style that {{reflected}} Wendy’s television writing: succinct stories with an irreverent flair. [...] "(Newsbytes) reflected her personality. It was, in some ways, the very first blog. It was infused with her being and when I joined her in 1985 I took that lesson to heart, putting <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> into <b>my</b> own work from Atlanta", said Dana Blankenhorn, one of the service’s early writers.|$|R

[...] "I have that rare gift, you know, Robert, of governing <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> from inside. When I am in this room, I feel Victorian, and I am Victorian. When I hear that Russian man's music which is driving every one crazy just now--well, I feel and I suppose I look different. Here's Meg coming. How well she looks!" ...|$|R
30|$|I want {{to embed}} more virtual {{work with my}} {{supervisor}} and probably if I look {{at the amount of}} time that the supervisor is investing in me, then being able to reduce that face to face and supporting virtual, not just email – I think email is probably not deep enough – a video conference whether it’s a Skype call or something like that, just adds that personal piece that <b>my</b> <b>personality</b> probably needs [STU 9].|$|R
