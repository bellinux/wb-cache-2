The treatments were: natural, vegetation removed, <b>erosion</b> <b>pavement</b> and vegetation removed, and tilled (moldboard plowed and disked). Runoff, infiltration, and soil loss varied significantly between treatments and, most interestingly, between the spring and fall runs.

40|$|An {{ecological}} {{study on the}} Morgan Creek and the East Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho, Bighorn Sheep herds was conducted from July 1, 1966 to February 28, 1970. The Morgan Creek population numbered about 100 animals upon termination of the study. The trend of this population was downward. The East Fork population numbered about 50 animals and the trend appeared to be stable or slightly downward. Productivity of both herds was low. Lamb mortality was high and recruitment to the breeding herd low. Low recruitment rates coupled with hunting pressure caused a decl ine in the ram component of both herds. The lungworm-pneumonia complex and scabies mites localized in the ears were common disease-parasite problems for bighorns on the Morgan Creek and East Fork ranges. Poor nutrition was postulated {{as the reason for}} endemic disease and parasite problems. Cougars, coyotes, bobcats and eagles were evaluated as mortaility factors. Evidence did not indicate that any of these were a serious limiting factor. Accidents and poaching also were evaluated as mortal ity factors, but {{it was not possible to}} determine the extent to which they contributed to mortality. Food habits of bighorns and deer were studied on the Morgan Creek winter range. Bighorns were found to use 69 percent grasses, 27 percent browse and 4 percent forbs. The primary grass utilized was Agropyron spicatum 11 anditfie primary browse was Cercocarpus ledifollus. Considerable competition for forage existed between deer and bighorns. Competition did not occur between bighorns and elk or antelope. Domestic livestock use has converted most of the range in the vicinity of Challis to sagebrush, which is not quality bighorn habitat. Deer numbers have greatly increased because of the habitat change. Livestock now compete with bighorns for the limited amount of remaining grass and deer compete by decimating the mountain mahogany (C. ledifolius. Shortage of protein during the winter is a serious problem for bighorns. Winter range rehabilitation, consisting of sagebrush eradication and accompanied by reduction of deer and domestic livestock usage, is suggested to restore ranges for the benefit of bighorns. Transplanting of bighorns to suitable areas historically inhabited by bighorns is suggested to increase bighorn distribution in Idaho and to stabilize current statewide downward trends In bighorn numbers until winter range rehabilitation problems can be solved. Breeding occurred in November and December, and lambing in May and June. Twinning did not occur. Several trapping methods were evaluated and a total of 43 bighorns were trapped, Of these, 7 were transplanted, 7 were instrumented with radio transmitters, 23 were neckbanded and 6 accidently killed. Morgan Creek bighorn sheep migrated an average of 22. 4 airline miles to summer ranges. The shortest migration was 19 miles and the longest 28. 5 miles. East Fork bighorns were found to migrate about 17 airline mi les to summer range. Analysis of winter range indicated a canopy coverage of 34 percent for shrubs, forbs and grasses, 42 percent bare soll and <b>erosion</b> <b>pavement</b> and 24 percent natural rock. Forage production was low at 128 to 669 pounds/acre green weight, Big sagebrush contributed 40 percent of the herbage production. Usage on all sites was moderate to excessive. Erosion was very evident, and range condition trend estimated to be downward. Only about 805 percent of the 16, 676 acres of winter range within the Morgan Creek study area was quality habitat avai lable to bighorns during most winters. Sagebrush, little used by bighorns, dominated 56 percent of the winter range. Grasses, indicative of quality bighorn habitat, dominated only 17 percent of the winter range. Idaho 2 ̆ 7 s statewide bighorn sheep populations have decreased approximately 50 percent since 1960. Ram components have decreased about 85 percent since 1960. Increased numbers of hunters have harvested fewer rams under the two-week open season 3 / 4 -curl regulation and the point of diminishing returns has begun to operate. Depresslng the ram component below an undetermined level may interfere with reproduction. Therefore, a limited harvest by control led permit regulations and controlled distribution of hunters is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess the impact of trampling by sheep on the downslope movement of rock fragments on steep, degraded rangeland slopes in the western part of Lesvos (Greece). Marked rock fragments were used as tracers which were monitored over a one-year period. It was shown that the slope gradient and the development of a fast encroaching shrub Sarcopoterium spinosum appeared to be major controlling factors of the rock fragment displacement distances. In this paper, downslope transport fluxes of rock fragments were calculated for different combinations of surface rock fragment mass and Sarcopoterium cover (%). The rock fragment displacement was also described as a diffusion type process. The diffusion constants (0. 1 to 121 kg m(- 1)) were strongly influenced by the Sarcopoterium cover. The highest transport rate, using regression equations for the displacement distance, was estimated to be 33. 8 kg(- 1) y(- 1) or 3. 4 ton ha(- 1) for high rock fragment covers (34 kg m(- 2)) and low Sarcopoterium cover (0 %, after burning) on a 100 in long and 20 % steep slope. Locally, measured values indicated a maximum flux of 61. 2 kg(- 1) y(- 1) on a 50 % slope with a Sarcopoterium cover of 1 %. The results show that the rock fragment fluxes are significant when compared to other processes of hillslope erosion, in extreme cases comparable to (but still lower than) published rates for tillage erosion. An exponential decrease in rock fragment loss with increasing Sarcopterium cover was found, similar to such relationships between soil loss and vegetation cover for water erosion. The disturbance of the rock fragment pavement by trampling also results in exposure of fine earth to erosion by water, as indicated by <b>erosion</b> <b>pavements</b> and gullies on neighbouring slopes, especially after burning of the Sarcopoterium cover. Rock fragment movement by trampling therefore significantly contributes to soil degradation in these Mediterranean environments. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although, in {{semi-arid}} environments, rock fragments at {{the soil}} surface and within the topsoil {{play an important role}} in desertification control, little is known about their spatial distribution. Therefore, this study analyses spatial patterns of rock fragment cover along catenas, and the vertical variations in volumetric rock fragment content in soil profiles in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Natural and anthropogenic processes inducing these patterns are assessed. Volumetric rock fragment content (R-V) was analysed in 10 soil pits. All rock fragments were extracted, and their volumes determined by pedo-stratigraphic unit, size and lithology. The rock fragment cover (R-C) was determined by the point-count method using vertical photographs of {{the soil surface}}. The following processes contribute to the vertical variability of R-V: (1) in Vertisols, upsqueezing as a consequence of swell-shrink cycles (argillipedoturbation) is responsible for high R-C at the soil surface; (2) large rock fragments (> 7. 5 cm) are rapidly brought to the soil surface by kinetic sieving through tillage, even in the case of continuous fine sediment deposition, what may result in a rock fragment rich subsoil, underlying a thick soil layer (up to 80 cm) without large rock fragments and a topsoil with a high R-C at the surface; (3) Skeletic Regosols at the foot of cliffs show no systematic vertical rock fragment distributions. As to rock fragment cover along the catena, some fundamental differences appear between the basalt and limestone substrate. On the basalt catena with slope gradients between 0. 06 and 0. 42 m m(- 1), R-C is high everywhere (57 - 85 %) and is unrelated to slope gradient. Vertical processes such as kinetic sieving through ploughing and argillipedoturbation determine the rock fragment distribution at the soil surface. In limestone areas, argillipedoturbation is less active and R-C is positively correlated with slope gradient (R- 2 = 0. 74; n = 6; P 2 cm) and more kinetic sieving sensitive rock fragments lowers R- 2 to 0. 46 (n = 6; n. s.). Preconditions for the present spatial distribution of rock fragments at the soil surface in the study area are the occurrence of two geomorphic processes in the past: (1) mudflows depositing diamictons including much coarse debris and (2) intense water erosion, which occurred after deforestation and exposed rock fragments at or near to the soil surface. Generally, the balance between lateral and vertical movements of rock fragments now, controls the spatial distribution of R-C. With respect to the lateral displacement processes: (1) lateral transport over the soil surface by trampling, tillage and concentrated runoff, especially on steep slopes, and (2) rockfall from the cliffs. Vertical supply of rock fragments to the soil surface is caused by (1) selective runoff erosion and the development of <b>erosion</b> <b>pavements,</b> (2) tillage induced kinetic sieving, bringing preferentially large rock fragments (> 7. 5 cm) to the soil surface, and (3) argillipedoturbation in Vertisol areas.

40|$|Normal faults {{exposed in}} the Volcanic Tableland {{in the southeastern}} part of the Bishop Tuff provide a unique {{opportunity}} to investigate whether tectonic faulting and associated fracturing control the rate of erosion in the vicinity of actively growing faults. If fracturing increases with fault displacement, erosion close to the faults should be more rapid for faults with higher displacement. Here we use in situ produced cosmogenic 21 Ne to quantify the erosion rate in the flat footwall blocks of three normal faults that have maximum vertical displacements between &# 8764; 12 and &# 8764; 160 m. 21 Ne concentrations in surface samples from volcanic bedrock and desert pavements along the three faults are nearly uniform and demonstrate that erosion is spatially invariant, both along individual faults and between faults with different tectonic offsets. Hence, faulting and fracturing of rocks adjacent to the active normal faults in the Bishop Tuff do not {{have a significant impact on}} the rate of erosion in the sub-horizontal footwall blocks next to the faults. This is further supported by samples from sites which are unaffected by faulting but record a similar erosion rate as samples located near faults. Using the density of the Bishop Tuff and a published 40 Ar/ 39 Ar eruption age for the tuff (760 ± 2 ka), the absolute amount of erosion since eruption has been quantified. At most sample sites the time-integrated amount of erosion ranges between &# 8764; 0. 9 and &# 8764; 1. 9 m, which is equivalent to average erosion rates between &# 8764; 1. 2 and &# 8764; 2. 5 m/Ma. Samples of bedrock-derived clasts from desert pavements have slightly higher 21 Ne concentrations than adjacent bedrock outcrops and thus yield higher apparent exposure ages (calculated assuming no <b>erosion).</b> Thus, desert <b>pavements</b> are more suitable for determining the minimum eruption ages of yet-undated welded tuffs than bedrock exposures. Desert pavements from the Bishop Tuff yield exposure ages that are &# 8764; 60 % of the tuff's 40 Ar/ 39 Ar eruption age...|$|R
40|$|Pumping of rigid {{pavements}} {{is a major}} contributor to rigid pavement failure. Fines can be removed through pore water pressure buildup in the subbase or through surface erosion of subbase and shoulder materials. A number of studies have been conducted since the 1940 s, and a number of remedies have been implemented, viz., granular, stabilized, open-graded, and lean concrete subbases. The effectiveness of these measures varied. Stabilized layers, although reducing pumping, do not eliminate pumping. Pumping in stabilized layers is caused primarily by surface erosion of these layers. The erosion of stabilized layers used in pavements and subject to service conditions in the pavement, have not been studied extensively. ^ An extensive literature review was conducted to obtain information regarding pumping, with emphasis on designs to prevent pumping, the performance of different subbase materials, and tests used to simulate pumping. Three testing procedures were selected to be used to investigate and characterize the <b>erosion</b> of rigid <b>pavement</b> subbase and shoulder materials, viz., a brush test, a jetting test, and a rotational shear technique. The latter was designed and built especially for testing of subbase materials, and is an improvement on earlier models used by other researchers. Portland cement stabilized, asphalt stabilized, lean concrete, and unstabilized materials were tested in a statistically designed program. The rotational shear device gave the most useful results for stabilized materials. However, this device {{can not be used to}} test cohesionless materials. An effort was made to correlate the laboratory erosion results with the performance of the materials in the pavement. Guidelines are provided on the required material properties to minimize pumping due to surface erosion of subbase and shoulder materials. ^ The feasibility of design and rehabilitation alternatives requires an economic analysis of the alternatives. A computer program (PEARDARP) was developed to evaluate the effect of rehabilitation and design alternatives on rigid pavement pumping and performance. The effects of different rehabilitation techniques on pavement distresses were quantified for inclusion in the program. An existing pumping prediction model was modified to include factors such as, drainage, climate, and subbase type. ...|$|R
