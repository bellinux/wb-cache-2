40|$|To better {{understand}} and explain processes of economic transformation, this paper proposes a new concept, “innovative opportunities”. Our interpretation of opportunities {{is based on}} an understanding of innovation in a business context, stressing perception and uncertainty during the choices involved in innovation processes. Based on Schumpeterian views of economic transformation, innovative opportunities refer to a set of different elements within the processes whereby actors identify, act upon and realize new combinations of resources and market needs to try to benefit from their future economic potential. To {{better understand}} and explain such processes, the proposed conceptualization of “innovative opportunities” consists of three elements: (1) <b>economic</b> value; (2) <b>mobilization</b> of resources; and (3) appropriability, which goes beyond existing types of opportunity conceptualizations found in the literature. The concluding discussion returns {{to the question of how}} this view of innovative opportunities modifies the existing understanding of innovation activities and industrial dynamics, and helps us identify new areas of research.

30|$|Considering Schumpeterian {{endogenous}} growth theory, many empirical {{studies have shown}} that financial services promote economic growth (e.g., Aghion and Howitt 1990; Howitt 2000; Dosi et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 1999). King and Levine (1993 a) argued that financial services expand financial activities, increase the rate of capital accumulation, and boost financial development; the introduction of new financial services in a financial system is the key output of financial innovation. The literature has also argued for financial innovation’s role in financial development by way of improving financial efficiency in financial systems. Financial innovation assists financial development through the expansion of financial services by offering new financial products, optimizing <b>economic</b> resource <b>mobilization</b> through efficient payment mechanisms, reducing investment risks, and accelerating capital formation. Therefore, financial innovation is regarded as an engine of financial growth in both developed and developing countries (Miller 1986, 1992). Ahmed (2006) argued that financial-sector growth expedites cross-county trade, wealth creation, and capital accumulation in an economy. Ahmad and Malik (2009), meanwhile, argued that financial-sector development reduces asymmetric information costs and enhances resource <b>mobilization,</b> thus boosting <b>economic</b> growth.|$|R

40|$|The {{roots of}} the 2008 global {{financial}} crisis that originated in the United States subprime mortgage market are firstly traced to the demand side of financing. Borrower preferences are explained {{to be based on}} excessiveness of ownership and spending. Such excessive consumer preferences are matched up with the suppliers’ decision to allow easy lending and accumulation of multiple debt-ridden loans. The cost of such financial excessiveness is shown to be the rate of interest. The relevance of interest rate in efficient financing and <b>economic</b> resource <b>mobilization</b> is questioned here from the theoretical side. Its rejection and replacement by participatory financing instruments in the good things of life is formalized. A new financial architectural design is thus laid out in terms of the central issue of money, finance and real economy complementary relations. These relations can be simulated by circular causation equations. The foundational conceptual premise is governed by the episteme of unity of knowledge.

30|$|Innovation {{is defined}} by Linder et al. (2003) as “implementing new ideas that create value”. From a practitioner's perspective, this means the {{adoption}} of new products and/or processes to increase competitiveness and overall profitability based on customers’ needs and requirements (Zahra et al. 1999). In this matter, it should be considered to recognize and exploit innovative opportunities among available opportunities in business. Innovative opportunities refer {{to a set of}} different elements within the processes whereby actors identify, act upon and realize new combinations of resources and market needs—in order to try to benefit from their future economic potential. “Innovation opportunities” consist of three elements: (1) <b>economic</b> value; (2) <b>mobilization</b> of resources; and (3) appropriability.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} decade, many {{empirical}} studies have confirmed a positive association between financial innovation {{and economic growth}} (e.g., Lumpkin 2010; Sekhar 2013). Financial innovation helps economic growth by allowing for capital mobilization, efficient financial intermediation, capital accumulation, and enhanced overall efficiency in financial institutions. That is why financial innovation is treated as a prime catalyst for financial development (Laeven et al. 2015). As with other innovations, financial innovation is a continuous process of bringing about changes in the financial system through the improvement and diversification of financial products and processes (Sood and Ranjan 2015). Demetriades and Andrianova (2005) argued that emergence of new financial assets and services in the financial system improves banking-sector performance and capital-market development, eventually boosting {{economic growth in the}} host country. Schumpeter (1912, 1982), meanwhile, argued that robust financial systems comprise efficient financial institutions, diversified financial assets and services, comprehensive financial services coverage, efficient channels for <b>economic</b> resource <b>mobilization,</b> and available credit flows for investment across a country. Financial innovation made credit available in economies by way of new and hybrid forms of financial institutions (e.g., microfinance institutions) outside the framework of formal banking systems (Blair 2011).|$|R

50|$|Ultimately, {{the goal}} was to do {{long-range}} and continuous planning to prepare the United States for adequate industrial and <b>economic</b> <b>mobilization.</b> The board was originally very ineffective, perhaps because authority was shared by all eight members of the board rather than any single point person.

Later, it was shifted to the Executive Office of the President. Its role was later eliminated when its responsibilities were transferred to the Office of Defense Mobilization in June 1953.|$|E

50|$|It is reorganizing the {{functioning}} of the national economy to use resources most effectively in support of the total war effort. Typically, the available resources and productive capabilities of each nation determined the degree and intensity of <b>economic</b> <b>mobilization.</b> Thus, effectively mobilizing economic resources to support the war effort is a complex process, requiring superior coordination and productive capability on a national scale. Importantly, some scholars have argued that such large scale mobilization of society and its resources for the purposes of warfare have the effect of aiding in state building. Herbst argues that the demands of reacting to an external aggressor provides a strong enough impetus to force structural changes and also forge a common national identity.|$|E

The cooperatives {{played a major role in}} the social and <b>economic</b> <b>mobilization</b> of the western Ukrainian people, most of whom were peasants. First begun in 1883, by 1939 cooperatives had 700,000 members in western Ukraine, employing 15,000 Ukrainians. The cooperatives were shut down by the Soviet authorities when western Ukraine was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939. However, they continue to exist and flourish among Ukrainian emigrants and their descendants in North and South America, Europe and Australia.|$|E

30|$|Financial {{development}} {{can take place}} with various financial innovations, such as {{the improvement of the}} capital market and the banking sector. A well-functioning capital market and banking sector contribute to economic development (Ndako 2010; Handa and Khan (2008)) through capital formation, the efficient allocation of resources, and by establishing a bridge between surplus units and deficit units. In the opinion of Wadud (2009), Adusei (2013), and Cavenaile et al. (2011), well-developed banks and the capital market both {{play a significant role in}} sustainable equitable development by allowing productive investment (Mhadhbi 2014; Orji et al. 2015; Ilhan, 2008; Ansong et al. 2011; Bakang 2016). These, in turn, accelerate economic growth (Ang 2008; Duasa 2014), but the impact of financial development is subject to economic conditions (Adusei 2013). Uddin et al. (2012) showed that financial development through the improvements in the banking sector can cause economic development and also assist in poverty reduction. Developing the financial sector allows people access to more institutional credit for investment (Uddin and Chakraborty 2014). According to Rana and Barua (2015), credit from financial institutions is yet to have an immense influence on promoting the overall economic development in South Asian countries. The development of the financial market is considered to be a channel of efficient <b>economic</b> resource <b>mobilization</b> (Kerr and Nanda 2014). Financial markets intensify the process of capital accumulation. A well-functioning capital market plays a driving role in sustainable economic development through the adoption of financial innovation in the economy (Levine 1997).|$|R
