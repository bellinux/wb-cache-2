5|$|In many {{instances}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> made the incidents more dramatic, would I have sacrificed my main object, {{the desire of}} exhibiting the misery and oppression, peculiar to women, that arise out of the partial laws and customs of society.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

60|$|If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> had my last melancholy hope {{realised}} in recovering {{the body}} of my beloved and lamented son, I should have returned home somewhat comforted, and <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> then <b>have</b> been comparatively resigned.|$|R

25|$|In {{the heat}} of the moment you {{sometimes}} do an act without thinking. I think this is what happened with Hodson. He had no need to interfere. He was stupid. He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete (i.e.Peter Walker) and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn't want to shoot him. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> shot a lot more.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> found support and understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and do what I thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1964, Audrey Hepburn {{starred in}} My Fair Lady, the {{film of the}} musical of the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. George Cukor's {{decision}} to award the role of Eliza Doolittle to Hepburn was perceived by many as a snub to Julie Andrews, who had played the part to great acclaim on Broadway. This is another film with some famous songs, including Wouldn't it be Loverly, <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>have</b> Danced all Night and Get Me to the Church on Time. Marni Nixon's voice was used in place of Audrey Hepburn's for the songs.|$|E

25|$|I had {{carefully}} learned to understand, about that experience which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> upon things of rule, how fortune is failing or great, subject to such rule in common, so that otherwise I {{would have had}} scant reason to desire such a rule, had I not found myself obliged to it through God’s bidding and nature. Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then my good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that I should take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|Gillard's {{mother told}} ABC TV's Australian Story program that Gillard had spoken {{from a young}} age of never wanting children. Gillard herself told the program that while she admired women who could balance child rearing with a career, [...] "I'm not sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have.</b> There's {{something}} in me that's focused and single-minded and if I {{was going to do}} that, I'm not sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done this." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} before his death, Schulz told Detroit News sports writer H. G. Salsinger that he had only one regret: [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> lasted 10minutes longer. [...] That was one game I wanted to finish".|$|E
500|$|French filmmaker Robert Bresson {{admired the}} film. [...] "It {{filled me with}} wonder because of its cinematographic writing... if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen it twice {{in a row and}} again the next day, I would have done." [...] Elsewhere Bresson said he also loved the film's ski chase.|$|E

'Got no boundaries, got no limits. [...] Don't stop me now. [...] If it's against the law, arrest me.' [...] Yes, that's me. It's the provocative me. The boring, predictable me." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{departure}} of manager Steve King, {{the vast majority of}} the title-winning side left the club.

500|$|At age 17, in 2000, Glover {{travelled}} to Belize with a Raleigh International project. [...] The {{ten weeks}} in Belize {{had a great}} impact on her motivation. [...] "It was the best thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> ever done at that point in my life", she said. At age 19, she represented Great Britain in the Miss Earth contest in the Philippines. Soon after, her modelling offers increased tenfold.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Jenkins {{exited the}} project, citing [...] "creative differences". She stated, [...] "I {{have had a}} great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again."

But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E

O'Hara was the second oldest of six children of Charles and Marguerite (née Lilburn) FitzSimons, and the only red-headed sibling in the family. Her {{father was in the}} clothing business and bought into Shamrock Rovers Football Club, a team O'Hara supported from childhood.|$|E
