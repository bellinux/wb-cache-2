500|$|The initial {{reaction}} of some fans was dismay, {{as there were}} concerns that The Next Generation would continue to lift stories from The Original Series. Staff writer Maurice Hurley said of [...] "The Naked Now," [...] "I didn't like that show at all. It just wasn't very good. What it did show, though, was that the new ensemble could interact, {{and that there were}} relationships between them that worked. But doing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible.</b> It was a warmed over premise. Why do it?" [...] The liaison between Data and Yar stood out as being controversial, with Data referring to himself as being [...] "fully functional" [...] in a sexual sense.|$|E
500|$|After Harrison turned 18 and the {{immigration}} problems had been solved, the Beatles {{went back to}} Hamburg for another residency at the Top Ten Club, playing from 27 March to 2 July 1961. To secure their return, Eckhorn paid DM 158 to the German authorities, which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter. Fellow musician, Tony Sheridan, later remembered the living conditions at the club: “John, George, Paul, Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn. We moved into a dormitory over the club and slept in bunks. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> really, now I look back. We all washed our own shirts and socks so the place smelt like a Chinese laundry. But we had great times and I’m afraid we used to tease {{the life out of}} the old lady who [...] us.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{net effect}} of the Simon Called Peter {{controversy}} was to make Keable a celebrity. The book became so well known that F. Scott Fitzgerald, who described the novel as [...] "really immoral", gave it to protagonist Nick Carraway to read in his famous novel The Great Gatsby, and had the character pronounce [...] "Either <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> stuff or the whiskey distorted things, because it didn't make sense to me." [...] The book's sequel, Recompense, was optioned as a film by Warner Brothers, starring Marie Prevost and Monte Blue. Keable himself found the screenplay so altered from the original text, he wryly proposed that he write another novel based on it. His {{first visit to the}} United States, in autumn 1924, was announced in the New York Times; he took in a production of the Simon Called Peter stage play in New York before returning to Polynesia via New Orleans, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. On his return, the Times printed a very lengthy letter from Keable {{on the subject of the}} origins of the cocktail, headlining it [...] "Robert Keable, in His Tahiti Retreat, Makes a Case for Englishmen, or Their [...] "Greek and Roman Ancestors," [...] as the Inventors." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant {{was at the}} Adler Theatre in Davenport, Iowa, on the {{afternoon}} of November 29, 1986, preparing for his performance in Conversation with Cary Grant when he was taken ill. Though his close friend Roderick Mann recalled that he had met up with Grant at the Hollywood Park Racetrack earlier that month and he had been in a jovial state and in good health, Grant had been feeling unwell as he arrived at the theatre. Basil Williams, who photographed him there, thought that though Grant still looked his usual suave self, he noticed that he seemed very tired and that he stumbled once in the auditorium. Williams recalls that Grant rehearsed for half an hour before [...] "something seemed wrong" [...] all of a sudden, and he disappeared backstage. Grant was taken back to the Blackhawk Hotel where he and his wife Barbara had checked in, and a doctor was called and discovered that Grant was having a massive stroke, with a blood pressure reading of 210 over 130. Grant refused to be taken to hospital. The doctor recalled that [...] "The stroke was getting worse. In only fifteen minutes he deteriorated rapidly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> watching him die {{and not being able to}} help. But he wouldn't let us". By 8:45p.m. Grant had slipped into a coma and was taken to St. Luke's Hospital. He spent 45 minutes in emergency before being transferred to intensive care, where he was pronounced dead at 11:22p.m. He was 82.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible...</b> but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt {{like something out of a}} bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E

2500|$|Many ships {{carrying}} {{civilians were}} sunk {{during the war}} by both the Allies and Axis.

2500|$|Even before Ronnie {{made her}} first {{appearance}} on-screen, the press hinted towards a future relationship {{between her and}} an upcoming character, Jack Branning. Jack Branning was introduced in October 2007, and his association with Ronnie was developed after he became her business partner at the soap's club, [...] "R". A flirtatious romance was established, {{which led to the}} start of a relationship in early 2008. The on-screen affair between Ronnie and Jack has reportedly been hard for actors Samantha Womack and Scott Maslen, as off-screen they are close friends – Womack's husband is best friends with Maslen, and Womack is best friends with Maslen's wife. Womack has commented, [...] "I was very honest and verbal about [...] Our first kissing scene felt really uncomfortable, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible,</b> but we're over it now [...] Both our sons are slightly freaked out that one mummy seems to be kissing the other daddy, but they've been on so many film sets that they're used to us doing ludicrous things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{attempts}} at founding a band proved unsuccessful. After turning 22, {{he says he}} was contacted by Aftermath Entertainment about showcasing his musical talents, but the opportunity ultimately fell through. For the next few years, Foster waited tables at a cafe while dealing with writer's block, but he remained in Los Angeles after landing a job as a commercial jingle writer for Mophonics in 2008. He said of the profession, [...] "I definitely learned from the commercial standpoint what works," [...] and he credited it with reviving his confidence in performing. The music Foster wrote spanned a wide range of genres, but he had difficulty reconciling his eclectic compositions. He explained: [...] "I'd write one song and it'd be a hip-hop song. I'd write another and it'd be heavily electronic. Another would be like a spiritual, and another would be classic piano song. I was constantly trying to pull those elements together. It took me six years to do it." [...] He still wished {{to be part of a}} group; reflecting on a residency he did at a venue performing electronic music, he said, [...] "It was just me and a laptop.
