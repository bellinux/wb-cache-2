This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> is an <b>equitable</b> (as {{opposed to}} common law) {{construct}} {{and is therefore}} discretionary. In the case of D & C Builders v Rees the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of £300 on a debt of £482 {{on the basis that}} it was extracted by duress.

Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them".

Two aspects of Sommers held particular interest for me. The first is that the parties appear to be arguing their opponent’s conventional position.

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of equitable tolling {{was developed to}} permit under certain circumstances the filing of a lawsuit that otherwise would be barred by a limitations period. See Bailey v. Glover, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 342, 22 L.Ed. 636 (1874). The tolling doctrine {{is used in the}} interests of justice to accommodate both a defendant's right not to be called upon to defend a stale claim and a plaintiff's right to assert a meritorious claim when equitable circumstances have prevented a timely filing. Equitable tolling is a type of equitable modification which “‘focuses on the plaintiff's excusable ignorance of the limitations period and on the lack of prejudice to the defendant.'” Cocke v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 817 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1987) (quoting Naton v. Bank of California, 649 F.2d 691, 696 (9th Cir.1981)). Contrary to the analysis of the majority below, <b>equitable</b> tolling, unlike <b>estoppel,</b> does not require active deception or employer misconduct, but focuses rather on the employee with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.|$|R

In Combe v Combe 1951 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant.

Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before.

However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in Evenden v Guildford City AFC 1975 QB 917, here the courts held [...] "that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action."Early cases indicated that there had to be a clear and unequivocal undertaking. However this was overruled by Secretary of State for Employment v Globe Elastic Thread Co Ltd 1980 AC 506. The promise or representation must be “precise” and “unambiguous” although it does not mean that such promise or representation must be expressly made. The concept of ‘waiver’ has been recognised by both the common law and equity as a means by which certain rights can be suspended, but then revived by appropriate notice. In Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co. (1877) 2 App. 439 HL, It can be seen that this case did not involve a [...] "promise" [...] as such, but merely an [...] "understanding". It had been suggested that Hughes could be restricted to [...] "relief against forfeiture" [...] cases, but this was specifically rejected in the later cases. This case was the one on which Denning placed considerable reliance in the High Trees case. It never applied to situations of part payment of debts, however, under the modern law the concept of waiver has been effectively considered within [...] "promissory estoppel".|$|R

5000|$|<b>Equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> is {{distinct}} from promissory estoppel.

It is also said that <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> lies in tort, while promissory estoppel lies in contract.

5000|$|Federal {{precedent}} permits <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> or equitable {{circumstances to}} extend the three-year limitations period. Many federal cases seem to merge these two doctrines. For example, Seattle Audubon Society v. Robertson F.2d 590 (9th Cir. 1991), rev'd on other grounds, 503 U.S. 429 (1992) stated that equitable tolling may be applied when plaintiffs are “prevented from asserting their claims by some kind of wrongful conduct {{on the part of}} the defendant.” But it is only <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> that requires wrongful conduct {{on the part of the}} defendant, i.e., fraud or misrepresentation. The federal equitable tolling doctrine, on the other hand, does not require any conduct by the defendant.|$|E

50|$|There {{is another}} {{possible}} way to analyze cases of this type, but the parties {{did not raise}} it and {{the court did not}} address it.

5000|$|Stated by Brennan J in Waltons Stores: [...] To {{establish}} an <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel,</b> {{it is necessary}} for the plaintiff to prove that 1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship would exist between them (and in the latter case) that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from that expected legal relationship; 2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; 3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; 4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; 5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption of expectation is not fulfilled; and 6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation of otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|In D & C Builders Ltd v Rees, a small {{building}} firm {{did some}} {{work on the}} house of a couple named Rees. The bill came to £732, of which the Rees had already paid £250. When the builders asked for the balance of £482, the Rees announced that the work was defective, and they were only prepared to pay £300. As the builders were in serious financial difficulties (as the Rees knew), they reluctantly accepted the £300 [...] "in completion of the account". The decision to accept the money would not normally be binding in contract law, and afterwards the builders sued the Rees for the outstanding amount. The Rees claimed that the court should apply the doctrine of <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel,</b> which can make promises binding when they would normally not be. However, Lord Denning refused to apply the doctrine, {{on the grounds that the}} Rees had taken unfair advantage of the builders' financial difficulties, and therefore had not come [...] "with clean hands".|$|E

50|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter.

5000|$|At common law, a {{mortgage}} was a conveyance of the property, with a condition subsequent, {{that if the}} grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain (the [...] "law" [...] day) then the conveyance would be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. As was inevitable, debtors {{would be unable to}} pay on the law day, and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed, the creditor owed no duty to give the land back. So then the debtor would run to the court of equity, plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur, and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the secured debt with interest to date. And the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for {{the amount of time that}} had lapsed since the law day had passed. The lender could interpose a defense of laches, saying that so much time had gone by (and so much improvement and betterment had taken place) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance. Other defenses, including <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel,</b> were used to bar redemption as well.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the {{requirements}} for entering into marriage are determined by state law. Courts in New York, North Carolina, and Virginia have ruled that, under applicable state law, ULC ministers are not authorized to solemnize marriages and a marriage at which a ULC minister officiated therefore is not valid. [...] North Carolina law subsequently was amended to validate marriages performed by ministers of the Universal Life Church prior to July 3, 1981, and marriages solemnized by a ULC minister after that date are voidable, although <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> may prevent the parties themselves from challenging the marriage. [...] A more recent New York court ruling, from a different appellate court, ruled {{that it is a}} factual question whether the ULC is a [...] "church" [...] whose ministers have authority under New York law to solemnize a marriage; on remand, the plaintiff offered no evidence, and the New York Supreme Court, which in New York is a trial court, accepted the defendant's evidence that the ULC fits the statutory definition of a [...] "church" [...] and the parties' marriage, performed by one of its authorized ministers, was valid. [...] However, that holding is not binding on other courts. A New York County trial judge stated in 2014 that marriages performed by ULC ministers in New York State are potentially invalid {{or at the very least}} in jeopardy. [...] The Supreme Court of Mississippi has ruled that Mississippi has a less restrictive statute and recognizes ULC ministers as able to perform valid marriages in that state. [...] Lower courts in Pennsylvania have split on the issue. [...] In the opinion of the Tennessee Attorney General, persons ordained by the ULC are not qualified under Tennessee law to solemnize a marriage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Equitable</b> <b>estoppel,</b> {{also known}} as “estoppel in pais,” is a common law {{doctrine}} that “prevent[s] one party from taking unfair advantage of another when, through false language or conduct, the person to be estopped has induced another person {{to act in a}} certain way, with the result that the other person has been injured in some way. ” While this doctrine has been invoked for hundreds of years among private litigants, courts still struggle mightily over if and when <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> should be applied against government action. Historically, <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> was not allowed against the government under any circumstance. The reasons for this are not without merit. These reasons include: protecting the public fisc (and fears of the resulting crushing liability from the numerous lawsuits emanating from the immense level of communication between the government and its citizenry), preventing the infringement of the federal government’s sovereign immunity, avoiding schemes to defraud the government, and recognizing separation of powers principles. In recent times, however, courts have realized that a failure to estop the government in every instance can lead to grave injustices. This Note explores the legal history of <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> as it is applied to the government, including Supreme Court case law and subsequent interpretations by lower courts. It then examines the various issues created by the current unsettled state of the <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> doctrine in the governmental context, and how various commentators have proposed remedying these issues. Next, it recognizes that there is no panacea; each of these remedies are inadequate. Finally, this Note puts forth a new idea, which is gaining traction in some circles, that when deciding <b>equitable</b> <b>estoppel</b> cases the government should apply each of these approaches in conjunction with each other, but with one additional element: when the government’s actions in effect allow it to substantially undermine the core legislative purpose of the Act in question, the government should be estopped...|$|E
