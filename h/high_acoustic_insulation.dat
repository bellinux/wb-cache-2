In addition, cork presents high water resistance due to its hydrophobic nature. In many applications, cork panels need to be bonded to other materials for manufacturing composite materials or agglomerated cork sheets. In this case, its lack of wettability becomes an important disadvantage. This paper aims to improve the wettability of cork by silanization, atmospheric plasma treatment, and vacuum plasma treatment. The processing conditions of the three treatments were optimized. The surface characterization was performed by surface energy, roughness, and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Pull-off adherence and peel tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of the treatments with an epoxy adhesive. Plasma treatment of cork plates could be a useful tool to enhance adhesion properties in the manufacturing process of cork sandwich panels or other applications where it could be joined to any material. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Present work {{purpose is}} to {{optimize}} the acoustic attenuation properties of a composite sandwich panel used for a high-speed train structure, choosing the best panel configuration which allows to improve the performances. Firstly, Nilsson’s analytical formulation for Transmission Loss (TL) evaluation has been implemented and experimentally validated on a typical material used for high-speed railway applications, highlighting the opportunity to use a different material to satisfy the new required design specifications. Different materials and stratifications have been then considered and TL parameter of each configuration have been calculated using Nilsson’s formulation, characterizing acoustic behavior in the frequency domain. Once found the composition which ensures the best compromise between <b>high</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> and low weight, the panel has been physically realized. Finally, an experimental and a numerical modal analysis have been performed on it. Starting from both FE simulation and impact testing outcomes, a correlation study through the computation of the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC), has been carried out. A good agreement between numerical and experimental analyses has been found, obtaining a reliable FE model for future improvements...|$|E
40|$|Sand-lime {{products}} are natural materials consisting of lime, sand and {{water with the}} least content of radioactive elements in comparison to other masonry elements. They are characterized by very high compressive strength, <b>high</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation,</b> good thermal properties, provide a friendly atmosphere and {{prevent the spread of}} mold and bacterial flora. In addition they are fully recyclable. White bricks through the porous structure and the occurrence of capillaries have the ability to rising water. The height of capillary action is dependent on the contact angle and the size of existing pores in the material. This property affects the frost resistance and other characteristics of durability of wall materials operated under conditions of intense exposure to moisture. The aim of the study is to determine the impact modifier on the properties of autoclaved sand-lime products. For testing used autoclaved sand-lime brick dimensions 40 x 40 x 160 [mm]. The weight of the products consists of 5 % lime, 90 % sand and 5 % lithium water glass (MP= 2, 6 and MP= 7, 0). The produced samples were subjected to autoclaving at temperatures of 203 ◦C and pressure of 1. 6 MPa in collaboration with the Silicate Production Plant in Ludynia. Three finished sets of samples (standard, modified with lithium silicate 2. 6 and 7. 0) have been immersed in water to the desired height during certain time. The results show the diversity of the internal structure of the tested products. In particular pore distribution, size and volume...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, model, build, and test a flat panel speaker and frame for a spherical dome {{structure}} being made into a simulator. The simulator will be a test bed for evaluating an immersive environment for human interfaces. This project focused on the loud speakers and a sound diffuser for the dome. The {{rest of the team}} worked on an Ambisonics 3 D sound system, video projection system, and multi-direction treadmill to create the most realistic scene possible. The main programs utilized in this project, were Pro-E and COMSOL. Pro-E was used for creating detailed figures for the fabrication of a frame that held a flat panel loud speaker. The loud speaker was made from a thin sheet of Plexiglas and 4 acoustic exciters. COMSOL, a multiphysics finite analysis simulator, was used to model and evaluate all stages of the loud speaker, frame, and sound diffuser. Acoustical testing measurements were utilized to create polar plots from the working prototype which were then compared to the COMSOL simulations to select the optimal design for the dome. The final goal of the project was to install the flat panel loud speaker design in addition to a sound diffuser on to the wall of the dome. After running tests in COMSOL on various speaker configurations, including a warped Plexiglas version, the optimal speaker design included a flat piece of Plexiglas with a rounded frame to match the curvature of the dome. Eight of these loud speakers will be mounted into {{an inch and a half}} of <b>high</b> performance <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation,</b> or Thinsulate, that will cover the inside of the dome.

40|$|The {{advances}} in additive manufacturing removed {{most of the}} limitations that were once stopping designers {{when it comes to}} the manufacturability of the design. It allowed designers to produce parts with high geometric complexity such as cellular structures. These structures are known for their high strength relative to their low mass, good energy absorption, and <b>high</b> thermal and <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> compared to their relative solid counter-parts. Lattice structures, a type of cellular structures, have received considerable attention due to their properties when producing light-weight with high strength parts. The design of these structures can pose a challenge to designers due to the sheer number of variables that are present. Traditional optimization approaches become an infeasible approach for designing them, which motivated researchers to search for other alternative approaches. In this research, a new method is proposed by utilizing the material density information obtained from the topology optimization of continuum structures. The efficacy of the developed method will be compared to existing methods, such as the Size Matching and Scaling (SMS) method that combines solid-body analysis and a predefined unit-cell library. The proposed method shows good potential in structures that are subjected to multiple loading conditions compared to SMS, which would be advantageous in creating reliable structures. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to practical engineering applications, the design problem of a commercial elevator sling will be considered. M. S...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> behaviour of hybrid sandwich composite panels for application in modular house construction. These sandwich panels are a sustainable, light-weight and durable solution, since are based on natural fibers structure impregnated with a thermosetting polymer. In this way, three different types of hybrid composite panels containing polyurethane core and laminated composite skins were produced and analyzed, varying the composition of laminates. The composite laminates of the prototypes were produced using a vacuum infusion technique and were composed of glass and jute fibers, impregnated with a polyester resin. The solutions developed were compared with a standard, composed of plasterboards having different thicknesses and used for thermal and <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> characterization was performed on specimens with 220 x 220 mm size in a sound proof acoustic chamber. The tested sandwich panels showed promising results; however, their overall performance was lower {{as compared to the}} performance of standard solutions used for comparison. Nevertheless, the specific <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> performance, i. e. sound reduction per unit mass of material for the developed sandwich panels was significantly higher as compared to the standard materials, indicating better suitability of this innovative solution for light-weight construction and modular housing.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{treats the}} noise control {{engineering}} using a double-leaf partition by {{the means of}} an analytical approach. This technique is widely used due to its efficiency in providing better <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> over a wide frequency range compared to single-leaf structures. The double-leaf partition is a construction comprising two leaves separated by an air space or cavity which will dynamically couples the two leaves. Therefore, its analysis is complicated and introduces several scientific aspects This paper deals with a very common case of the double-leaf partitions which is the double glazing: an analytical approach {{will be used to}} analyze the influence of the different parameters on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> e. g. plate thickness, gap width, etc [...] Several simulations are then performed for different double glazing configurations to assess the influence of the variables on the final <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation.</b> At low frequencies a better performance was achieved for thicker air layers, while at higher frequencies a thinner air layer is preferable.

So far, some of its assessed material properties (e. g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal insulation product, a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> performance is also a fundamental property required {{for most of the}} above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard.

The obtained <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e. g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e. g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose).
