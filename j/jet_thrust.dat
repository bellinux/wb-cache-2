5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution {{to one of the}} most vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following streamlines, but supersonic lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for supersonic performance only, and then using <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be tuned for high supersonic performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E
25|$|Earlier, in January, {{when the}} company formed, Henry Tizard, the rector of Imperial College London and {{chairman}} of the Aeronautical Research Committee (ARC), had prompted the Air Ministry's Director of Scientific Research to ask for a write-up of the design. The report was once again passed on to Griffith for comment, but was not received back until March 1937 by which point Whittle's design was well along. Griffith had already started construction of his own turbine engine design and, perhaps to avoid tainting his own efforts, he returned a somewhat more positive review. However, he remained highly critical of some features, notably the use of <b>jet</b> <b>thrust.</b> The Engine Sub-Committee of ARC studied Griffith's report, and decided to fund his effort instead.|$|E
500|$|As he {{continued}} these experiments, {{he found that}} the same thrust-direction system he intended for VTOL operations worked just as well for forward flight. In this case the disk shape was not of itself a good lifting surface, as it was neutral in terms of lift direction – that is, it would fly sideways as readily as it would fly forward. However, by modifying the airflow with the application of a small amount of <b>jet</b> <b>thrust,</b> the overall airflow over the craft could be dramatically altered, creating a sort of [...] "virtual airfoil" [...] of any needed configuration. For instance, by directing even a small amount of <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> down, a large mass of air would be pulled over the upper surface of the wing and dramatically augment the flow over the wing, creating lift.|$|E

The accident was attributed to the pilot's application of additional forward thrust after failing to properly deploy the <b>jet's</b> <b>thrust</b> reversers.|$|R
50|$|The orbiter {{continues}} to perform well. The only problem reported {{during the day}} was {{the failure of a}} primary reaction control system jet. The jet problem is not expected to have any effect on the mission since the orbiter has two other <b>jets</b> <b>thrusting</b> in the same direction.|$|R
50|$|As such, <b>jet</b> force, <b>thrust,</b> {{and lift}} are {{inherently}} linked.|$|R
500|$|The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less {{commonly}} used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force {{leads to an}} alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at [...] when subjected to a force of 1kgf. The kilogram-force is {{not a part of}} the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, <b>jet</b> <b>thrust,</b> bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000lbf.|$|E
500|$|Design {{work on the}} P.1127 was {{formally}} started in 1957 by Sir Sydney Camm, Ralph Hooper of Hawker Aircraft, and Stanley Hooker (later Sir Stanley Hooker) of the Bristol Engine Company. The close cooperation between Hawker, the airframe company, and Bristol, the engine company, was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis {{as one of the}} key factors that allowed the development of the Harrier to continue in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks. Rather than using rotors or a direct <b>jet</b> <b>thrust,</b> the P.1127 had an innovative vectored thrust turbofan engine, the Pegasus. The Pegasus I was rated at [...] of thrust and first ran in September 1959. A contract for two development prototypes was signed in June 1960 and the first flight followed in October 1960. Of the six prototypes built three crashed—including one during an air display at the 1963 Paris Air Show.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Frost was {{particularly}} interested in jet engine design and {{ways to improve the}} efficiency of the compressor without sacrificing the simplicity of the turbine engine. He found Frank Whittle's [...] "reverse flow" [...] design too complex and was interested in ways to clean up the layout. This led him to design a new type of engine layout with the flame cans lying directly outside the outer rim of the centrifugal compressor, pointed outwards like the spokes on a wheel. Power for the compressor was drawn from a new type of turbine similar to a centrifugal fan, as opposed to the more typical pinwheel-like design of conventional engines. The turbine drove the compressor using gearing, rather than a shaft. The resulting engine was arranged {{in the form of a}} large disk, which he referred to as a [...] "pancake engine." [...] The <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> exited from around the entire rim of the engine, and this presented problems trying to adapt the design to a typical aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|On {{aircraft}} using <b>jet</b> engines, <b>thrust</b> reversal {{is accomplished}} by causing the jet blast to flow forward. The engine does not run or rotate in reverse; instead, thrust reversing devices are used to block the blast and redirect it forward. High bypass ratio engines usually reverse thrust by changing the direction of only the fan airflow, since the majority of thrust is generated by this section, {{as opposed to the}} core.

2500|$|Early {{cephalopods}} {{are thought}} to have produced jets by drawing their body into their shells, as Nautilus does today. Nautilus is also capable of creating a jet by undulations of its funnel; this slower flow of water is more suited to the extraction of oxygen from the water. [...] The jet velocity in Nautilus is much slower than in coleoids, but less musculature and energy is involved in its production. <b>Jet</b> <b>thrust</b> in cephalopods is controlled primarily by the maximum diameter of the funnel orifice (or, perhaps, the average diameter of the funnel) and the diameter of the mantle cavity. Changes {{in the size of the}} orifice are used most at intermediate velocities. The absolute velocity achieved is limited by the cephalopod's requirement to inhale water for expulsion; this intake limits the maximum velocity to eight body-lengths per second, a speed which most cephalopods can attain after two funnel-blows. Water refills the cavity by entering not only through the orifices, but also through the funnel. [...] Squid can expel up to 94% of the fluid within their cavity in a single <b>jet</b> <b>thrust.</b> To accommodate the rapid changes in water intake and expulsion, the orifices are highly flexible and can change their size by a factor of twenty; the funnel radius, conversely, changes only by a factor of around 1.5.|$|E
2500|$|Besides the {{ubiquitous}} helicopter, {{there are currently}} two types of VTOL aircraft in military service: craft using a tiltrotor, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, and another using directed <b>jet</b> <b>thrust,</b> such as the Harrier family and new F-35B Lightning II Joint strike Fighter (JSF). In the civilian sector currently only helicopters are in general use (some other types of commercial VTOL aircraft have been proposed and are under development [...] ). Generally speaking, VTOL aircraft capable of STOVL use it wherever possible, since it typically significantly increases takeoff weight, range or payload compared to pure VTOL.|$|E

50|$|Telemetry {{data from}} the {{original}} failure suggested that the throat of its main engine, the orbit maneuver engine (OME) was still largely intact, and trial <b>jet</b> <b>thrusts</b> of the probe's onboard OME were performed twice, on 7 and 14 September 2011.

It was concluded that the remaining combustion chamber throat was completely destroyed by transient ignition of the engine. As a result, the selected strategy was to use four hydrazine attitude control thrusters, also called reaction control system (RCS), to drive the probe into orbit around Venus. Because the RCS thrusters do not need oxidiser, the remaining 65 kg of oxidiser (MON) was vented overboard in October 2011 to lighten the spacecraft.|$|R
