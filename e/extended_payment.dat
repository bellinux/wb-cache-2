50|$|With federal {{student loans}} the student may have {{multiple}} options for extending the repayment period, but though {{an extension of}} the loan term will reduce the monthly payment, it will also increase the amount of total interest paid on the principle balance during the life of the loan (the unpaid interest and any penalties become capitalized, i.e. added to the loan balance). Extension options include <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> periods offered by the original lender and federal loan consolidation.

5000|$|In {{its first}} year of operations, Service Seeking did not charge for its services. It now earns revenue from {{membership}} fees paid by businesses. As of 2017, Service Seeking has over 20,000 paying customers in Australia. [...] The capital for starting the business came from the co-founders {{and their families and}} friends; a venture capital fund that had committed to the business went under, and to keep Service Seeking from going under, they applied for a Research and Development grant and negotiated <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> terms with suppliers. They later raised enough money from their current chairman, Anthony Klok to grow the business, develop their revenue model and eventually break even. While the website currently facilitates online payments through PromisePay, co-founder and CEO Jeremy Levitt was reported to have said that “as long as the cash economy remains, tradesmen want a percentage of their revenue to be in cash because it lowers their tax”. Levitt explained that booking local services is more complex than an Uber-style transaction. [...] In total, the company has raised in excess of $10 million in capital since its beginning.|$|E

5000|$|Dealing {{with the}} {{pressing}} matter of war reparations {{had been a}} priority for the Cuno government from the day it took office, as it had earlier been for the Wirth government. The new government continued to follow the policies of its predecessor on this issue. The goal was to convince the Allies to accept an <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> moratorium {{for three to four}} years that would allow the Germans to stabilize their economy and currency first before resuming transfers. However, the French had budget problems of their own and refused to compromise on this, holding the German side to earlier agreements. The French government of prime minister/foreign minister Raymond Poincaré was convinced that Germany (and its industry) was unwilling rather than unable to make the reparations. A debt moratorium was considered possible only if France would be able to obtain [...] "productive collateral" [...] (such as direct Allied control over the coal mines of the Ruhr). On 26 December 1923, the reparations commission formally found that Germany had culpably failed to comply with its obligations concerning the delivery of wood, against the vote of the British commissioner. Similarly, it found on 9 January 1923 that the 1922 deliveries of coal to France had been deficient. Two days later French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr.|$|E
5000|$|The Israel {{bank card}} system is {{somewhat}} confusing to newcomers, comprising {{a blend of}} features taken from different types of cards. What may {{be referred to as}} a credit card, is most likely to be a deferred debit card on an associated bank current account, {{the most common type of}} card in Israel, somewhat like the situation in France, though the term [...] "debit card" [...] is not in common usage. Cards are nearly universally called cartis eshrei (כרטיס אשראי), literally, [...] "credit card", a term which may bely the card's characteristics. Its main feature may be a direct link to a connected bank account (through which they are mostly issued), with the total value of the transactions made on the card being debited from the bank account in full on a regular date once a month, without the option to carry the balance over; indeed certain types of transactions (such as online and/or foreign currency) may be debited directly from the connected bank account at the time of the transaction. Any such limited credit enjoyed is a result of the customer's assets and credibility with the bank, and not granted by the credit card company. The card usually enables immediate ATM cash withdrawals & balance inquiries (as debit cards do), instalment & deferred charge interest free transactions offered by merchants (also applicable in Brazil), interest bearing instalment plans/deferred charge/revolving credit which is transaction specific at the point of sale (though granted by the issuer, hence the interest), and a variety of automated/upon request types of credit schemes including loans, some of which revolve or resemble the <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> options sometimes offered by charge cards.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} optimal order quantities {{for firms}} that are offered a one-time opportunity to delay payment for {{an order of}} a commodity. Such delayed payments result in a reduction of the effective purchase cost, which {{is a function of}} the return available on alternative investments, the number of units of the commodity ordered, and the length of the extended period. Optimal order quantities are developed for <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> privileges that occur at a reorder point of between reorder points. Six suppliers' <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> scenarios are evaluated. A simulation analysis is conducted to determine the sensitivity of derived models to changes in the various input parameters. The simulation with realistic parameter values reveals that the additional discounted order quantity is insensitive to large changes in the ordering cost and unit price; sensitive to changes in the carrying cost and return rate of funds, but without significantly affecting the total cost; and extremely sensitive to the annual demand. Simple analytic decision rules are provided to guide firms that are offered such <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> privileges. inventory/production: deterministic models, inventory/production: parametric analysis, inventory/production: simulation...|$|E

Executive Summary When the housing bubble burst in 2007, millions of homeowners entered foreclosure and default. To reduce the burden of such defaults on borrowers, lenders and the economy, many banks introduced loan modification programs, such as writing down a portion of the loan, reducing interest rates or <b>extending</b> <b>payment</b> terms.

40|$|When {{information}} or control in a multiagent planning system is private to the agents, they may misreport this {{information or}} refuse to execute an agreed outcome, {{in order to}} change the resulting end state of such a system to their benefit. In some domains this may result in an execution failure. We show that in such settings VCG mechanisms lose truthfulness, and that the utility of truthful agents can become negative when using VCG payments (i. e., VCG is not strongly individually rational). To deal with this problem, we introduce an <b>extended</b> <b>payment</b> structure which {{takes into account the}} actual execution of the promised outcome.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{analysis}} of payment arrears in the Russian enterprise sector, using both official aggregate data and data from a World Bank survey of 439 large and medium industrial Russian enterprises conducted in mid- 1994. The focus is on trade credit arrears, tax arrears, and wage arrears (a companion paper discusses bad bank debts in detail). Among {{the findings of the}} paper are: contrary to the standard view of an ongoing "inter-enterprise arrears crisis" in Russia, levels of trade credit arrears in Russia are compable to those found both in other transition countries and in Western market economies; trade credit arrears and inflation are closely inversely correlated, the likely reason being that when macro policy is being tightened, firms try to create liquidity by <b>extending</b> <b>payment</b> periods; basic credit control mechanisms are in wide use by firms; and financially-distressed firms raise the priority of paying suppliers and lower the priority of paying taxes, with the result that tax arrears are significantly concentrated in financially-distressed firms.

50|$|More recently, {{there has}} been a pivot back to Receivables Financing Factoring (finance) programs, {{primarily}} driven by enhancements in technology which has increased the efficiency and attractiveness of Receivables-based programs. In a Supplier Financing model there is a heavy administrative burden caused by the need to negotiate Receivables Purchase Agreements with each individual Supplier, whereas in Factoring (finance) programs only one RPA is required with the Vendor. In addition, traditionally there was a larger effort involved in calculating the Funders credit risk exposure in a Receivables-based program due to the many Buyers which needed to be credit evaluated on an ongoing basis. Technology has now automated much of the credit evaluation process allowing program Funders access to real-time Buyer risk ratings across their portfolio. This transparency generates increased credit appetites from program Funders and Credit Insurers and benefits the Vendor through attractive rates and increased program credit limits on their Buyers. Vendors can also use the receivables-based approach to increase competitiveness by <b>extending</b> <b>payment</b> terms to their Buyers Off-balance-sheet.
