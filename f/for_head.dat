40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Responses to two {{cycles of}} mass {{selection}} <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date, followed by selfing or intermating, were studied in two diverse winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) crosses. Selection was bidirectional, resulting in {{early and late}} populations for each mating system, cycle, and cross. The influence of mass selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date on the expressions of eight other agronomic traits was also studied. Concurrent with selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date, generation means and variances within crosses were used to obtain genetic information about each of the nine traits. Additive effects of genes were {{an important source of}} variation among Cross I generation means for most traits. Predicted response to selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date was 7. 1 and 9. 1 days/cycle for 1981 and 1982, respectively. Most traits by which the parents differed in Cross II generations were primarily affected by non-additive genetic effects. Progress from selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date was predicted to be 6. 9 days/cycle in 1981, and 1. 4 day/cycle in 1982. Observed response to selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date in Cross I showed gains of - 4. 8 and 5. 5 days/cycle with selfing and - 4. 2 and 5. 1 days/cycle with intermating. Further progress from selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date could be achieved through additional cycles of selection and intermating in this cross. Response to selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date with intermating in Cross II was superior to selfing in the early direction (6. 0 vs. 5. 0 days/cycle) and inferior to selfing in the late direction (0. 9 vs. 1. 9 days/cycle). These results were ascribed to an accumulation of minor genes via intermating and rapid fixation of recessive genes via selfing, for early and late selection, respectively. Few large correlated responses in the eight unselected traits with selection <b>for</b> <b>heading</b> date were noted in either cross. In Cross I, intermating was more successful than selfing in retaining 'genetic variation' in most of the unselected traits. In Cross II, intermating showed a slight advantage in maintaining 'genetic variation' in unselected traits, probably due to the low levels of additive genetic variation present in this cross...|$|R

5|$|At this hill, the Sabines, {{creeping}} to the Citadel, were let {{in by the}} Roman maiden Tarpeia. For this treachery, Tarpeia was {{the first}} to be punished by being flung from a steep cliff overlooking the Roman Forum. This cliff was later named the Tarpeian Rock after the Vestal Virgin, and became a frequent execution site. The Sabines, who immigrated to Rome following the Rape of the Sabine Women, settled on the Capitoline. The Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), an 8th-century BC sacred precinct, occupied much of the eastern lower slopes of the Capitoline, at the head of what would later become the Roman Forum. The summit was the site of a temple for the Capitoline Triad, started by Rome's fifth king, Tarquinius Priscus (r. 616-579 BC), and completed by the seventh and last king, Tarquinius Superbus (535–496 BC). It was considered {{one of the largest and}} the most beautiful temples in the city (although little now remains). The city legend starts with the recovery of a human skull (the word <b>for</b> <b>head</b> in Latin is caput) when foundation trenches were being dug for the Temple of Jupiter at Tarquin's order. Recent excavations on the Capitoline uncovered an early cemetery under the Temple of Jupiter.|$|E

Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During one spring practice, a ball caught her right hand as she was warming up and shattered her thumb. After a surgery that inserted three pins in her thumb, she was put on the bench until the summer. At her first practice back with the Tar Heels in the summer of 2005, Harris tore her right anterior cruciate ligament, which kept her out for the entire 2005 season. Despite being hurt, Harris still made the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Honor Roll team.|$|E

5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed {{the problem of how}} to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word <b>for</b> <b>head</b> and cauda the Latin word for tail.|$|E

In the early 1940s he tried to buy the NFL's Cleveland Rams, owned by millionaire supermarket heir Dan Reeves, but was rebuffed. Having been awarded the Cleveland franchise in the AAFC, McBride asked Cleveland Plain Dealer sportswriter John Dietrich <b>for</b> <b>head</b> coaching suggestions. Dietrich recommended Paul Brown, the 36-year-old Ohio State Buckeyes coach. After consulting with Ward, McBride followed Dietrich's advice in early 1945, naming Brown head coach and giving him an ownership stake in the team and full control over player personnel. Brown, who had built an impressive record as coach of a Massillon, Ohio high school team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship, {{at the time was}} serving in the U.S. Navy and coached the football team at Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used <b>for</b> <b>head</b> trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E
5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor <b>for</b> <b>head</b> injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
