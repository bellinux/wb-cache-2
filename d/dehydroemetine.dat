50|$|A 1980 report {{described}} {{the use of}} <b>dehydroemetine</b> in treatment of herpes zoster, a condition which can produce painful neurological symptoms. The study involved 40 patients, {{all of whom were}} over 60, and compared <b>dehydroemetine</b> treatment to another drug. The study reported patients treated with <b>dehydroemetine</b> experienced relief of neuralgia with no changes in cardiovascular functions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{double-blind}} study of oral <b>dehydroemetine</b> {{in the treatment}} of amoebiasis performed at St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic Medical College, Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1973-1974 showed <b>dehydroemetine</b> treatment was effective. A total of 60 patients were treated, 20 with <b>dehydroemetine,</b> 20 with Tiberal, and 20 with metronidazole. One-fourth of the patients treated with <b>dehydroemetine</b> reported adverse reactions, compared to 20% with other drugs, but no patient discontinued therapy due to the reaction. In all three cases, the drug therapy resulted in clearance of the infection, defined as negative results through an O&P exam, in all but 1-2 patients.|$|E

5000|$|A 1979 {{study of}} 27 {{patients}} treated with <b>dehydroemetine</b> {{and various other}} drugs suggested all drug combinations were successful at treating amoebic liver abscesses.|$|E
5000|$|A 1986 {{in vitro}} study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} <b>dehydroemetine,</b> metronidazole, ornidazole, and secnidazole on Entamoeba histolytica. Metronidazole {{was found to be}} most effective, and the other three drugs were of similar effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dehydroemetine</b> is a {{synthetically}} produced antiprotozoal agent {{similar to}} emetine in its anti-amoebic properties and structure (they differ {{only in a}} double bond next to the ethyl group), but it produces fewer side effects.|$|E
50|$|In a {{research}} study, amebas {{were seen in}} stool samples of a patient and identified as I. bütschlii. The patient was treated with <b>dehydroemetine</b> and chloroquine. After treatment they noticed the patient’s complement fixation titer decreased to 1:2 in a serum sample, obtained two months later.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of invasive amoebiasis {{should be directed}} to all sites where E. histolytica may be present. Hence the ideal amoebicide {{should be able to}} act within the intestinal lumen, in the intestinal wall, and systemically, particularly in the liver. Systemic amoebicidal drugs include emetine, <b>dehydroemetine,</b> chloroquine diphosphate, metronidazole, and tinidazole.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} symptomatic. Local pain is treated by injecting <b>dehydroemetine</b> {{at the site}} of the sting. Hypovolaemia is {{corrected}} by oral rehydration solution. Agitated, confused and non-cooperative patients are given a 5% dextrose saline drip. Patients with hypertension on admission are given a single dose of 5 mg sublingual nifedipine and oral prazosin. The blood pressure in patients with hypertension is controlled with sublingual nifedipine alone. Patients with pulmonary oedema are propped up and given intravenous aminophylline, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, oral prazosin, and oxygen by mask.|$|E
50|$|Prevention of {{amoebiasis}} is by improved sanitation, including separating {{food and}} water from faeces. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on {{the location of the}} infection. Amoebiasis in tissues is treated with either metronidazole, tinidazole, nitazoxanide, <b>dehydroemetine</b> or chloroquine, while luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. For treatment to be effective against all stages of disease may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms do not require treatment but infected individuals can spread the parasite to others and treatment can be considered. Treatment of other Entamoeba infections apart from E. histolytica is not needed.|$|E
50|$|Until 1964, all {{available}} amoebicides were {{selective in their}} sites of action. The development of newer nitro-imidazole derivatives led to Niridazole. It was given in a daily dose of 25-30 mgm. per kg to 50 patients for seven days. The cure rate {{was found to be}} 84% with serious side effects in one patient. An Indian study of 30 patients on this drug revealed that it acted as a contact amoebicide and also against the invasive forms.23 The therapeutic action of Ambilhar was found to be significantly better than that produced by a combination of <b>dehydroemetine</b> and chloroquine.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{synthetic}} compound developed by Osbond et al. and Brossi et al. in 1959. It is {{as effective as}} emetine in its amoebicidal properties. Given parenterally <b>dehydroemetine</b> is surprisingly painless. Oral tablets have been introduced. But for some reason, these tablets have not become popular. A high cure rate can be obtained with this drug. Compared to emetine, its concentration in the heart is less. Electrocardiographic changes are not seen so often. When present, they are more transient than with emetine.Dehydroemetine is excreted by the kidneys, heart and the other organs more rapidly than emetine. Therefore, a daily dose of 1.25 mg or 1.5 mg/kg body weight is necessary. The total daily dose should not exceed 90 mg. The course should not be repeated in less than 14 days.|$|E
40|$|The uptake of <b>dehydroemetine</b> by {{adrenergic}} neurones was studied indirectly {{by testing}} {{the ability of}} various procedures to prevent or reverse adrenergic neurone blockade in the periarterially stimulated rabbit isolated ileum. Adrenergic neurone blockade was prevented but not reversed by equilibration with <b>dehydroemetine</b> at low temperature (0 ° C), {{in the absence of}} sodium or in the presence of tetrodotoxin.

40|$|The {{results of}} therapy in 56 {{consecutive}} cases of hepatic amebiasis are reviewed. In retrospect, {{the results in}} patients receiving metronidazole alone, <b>dehydroemetine</b> combined with chloroquine, and <b>dehydroemetine</b> combined with chloroquine and metronidazole were compared. No deaths occured. Our results confirm the great efficacy of metronidazole alone. The response to treatment was similar in patients receiving <b>dehydroemetine</b> combined with chloroquine but {{the average number of}} days of hospitalization was greater in these patients. No advantage was demonstrated for the combination of metronidazole with <b>dehydroemetine</b> and chloroquine. In retrospect these patients proved to have a more severe and protracted course with more frequent surgical complications and a greater need for closed aspiration of the abscess. Closed aspiration, not used routinely, has not reduced the number of days of hospitalization. Significant side effects were not observed...|$|E
40|$|Metronidazole cured 17 out of 20 {{children}} with acute amoebic dysentery.

40|$|The {{preparation}} and physico-chemical characterization of lyophilized polyisohexylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles loaded with <b>dehydroemetine</b> (DHE) {{for the treatment}} of visceral leishmaniasis disease is described. The resulting formulation was found to efficiently absorb DHE and gave very reproducible preparations with regard to the size and drug adsorption rate. Stability has been confirmed for at least 24 months. The acute toxicity of DHE was reduced in intravenous administration by its association with nanoparticles. Data concerning tissue distribution in mice showed that DHE nanoparticles were rapidly cleared from the blood stream and that they mainly concentrated in the reticuloendothelial system. Furthermore, DHE linkage to the carrier reduced the cardiac concentrations of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Amoeba proteus is {{proposed}} as a low-cost multi-purpose biochemical tool for screening and standardizing cytotoxic plant extracts with possible application in the laboratories of developing countries. Advantages {{and limitations of}} this test are examined and different mathematical treatments (probit analysis versus curve fitting to Von Bertalanffy and Hill functions) are investigated. Known anti-cancer (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dacarbazine, 5 -fluorouracil) and antiparasitic (emetine, <b>dehydroemetine,</b> metronidazole, cucurbitine, chloroquine) drugs were tested using this method and only metronidazole appeared inactive. Application of this model to Euphorbia hirta established that a 100 degrees C aqueous extraction of fresh aerial parts allows efficient extraction of active constituents and that drying the plant material before extraction considerably reduces activity.

40|$|Two {{cases of}} amoebic {{dysentery}} with ineffectiveness of metronidazole and tinidazole were reported. Patients were {{admitted to the}} hospital because of diarrhea and protein loosing enteropathy. The patient of the first case was a 73 -year-old man who has had diarrhea of several watery stools with mucus every day for 9 months before admission into the hospital. He has never been abroad for 9 years from 1973, and had no trouble previously. As a large number of Entamoeba histlytica cysts were found from his stool, tinidazole 2. 0 g/day and metronidazole 1500 mg/day were given to him. Despite these treatments the number of cysts in stools did not decrease and his symptoms did not change. Therefore, <b>dehydroemetine</b> 45 mg/day was given for 10 days. After this treatment, the cysts of amoeba disappeared in the stool and amount of serum protein increased to the normal level without supply of albumin. The second case was a 23 -year-old woman, who lives near the first patient. She has never been outside of Japan, and she has already noticed the distribution of the mucus and blood in her stools at 18 years of age, when E. histolytica cysts had been found at the examination of stool and metronidazole was prescribed for her, but her symptoms did not improve. Metronidazole and tinidazole were given again at age 23, because the abdominal pain and fever became severe for 2 months. As the symptoms continuied, <b>dehydroemetine</b> 60 mg/day was given for 10 days. After this treatment, the abdominal pain disappeared and mucus and blood decreased in the stool. Immunological examination was carried out with Ouchterlony's doublediffusion test using three strains of E. histolytica as antigen. Reactions of the sera of both patients were all negative...|$|E
40|$|Cationic {{compounds}} used in {{the treatment}} of veterinary African trypanosomiasis have structural properties similar to those of pentamidine, which has been {{used in the}} therapy of human trypanosomiasis and infection with Pneumocystis carinii. We have compared the activities of these drugs and other antimicrobial agents in an immunosuppressed rat model of P. carinii pneumonia. Diminazene, imidocarb, amicarbalide, quinapyramine, and isometamidium showed efficacy {{greater than or equal to}} that of pentamidine in the therapy of P. carinii infection, whereas ethidium and methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) were only slightly active against the organism. Diminazene and pentamidine also exhibited comparable efficacy in P. carinii prophylaxis, alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a polyamine inhibitor, was ineffective therapy when used alone and did not improve the effectiveness of pentamidine or diminazene. Quinine, quinidine, quinacrine, chlorpromazine, spiramycin, Pentostam, Astiban, <b>dehydroemetine,</b> ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin also showed little or no activity against the organism. Thus, in this model anti-P. carinii activity appears to be a common property of veterinary cationic trypanocidal compounds. This should be important in studying structure-activity relationships and in developing new drugs for the treatment of P. carinii infection in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{effectiveness of}} injectable emetine in amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscess was first demonstrated by Leonard Rogers in India in 1912. The previous year, Vedder {{had shown that}} emetine was the principal active alkaloid in ipecacuanha, the powdered root of the Brazilian plant, Cephaelis ipecacuanha, which had been brought back to Europe by Williams Piso in 1658. Doses of ipecacuanha {{large enough to be}} really effective in dysentery were used in India from 1858 onwards but usage was often limited by the emetic qualities of the drug that were later to give the principal alkaloid its name. Emetine remains a useful drug to this day and is still our most potent amoebicide. Although a miscellany of drugs destroy Entamoeba histolytica within the colonic lumen, the number of tissue amoebicides, used to treat invasive disease, is still relatively limited; chloroquine was introduced for hepatic amoebiasis in 1948, synthetic <b>dehydroemetine</b> in 1959 and the schistosomicidal drug niridazole in 1966. The second major milestone in therapy was the demonstration that metronidazole, a drug used for trichomoniasis since 1958, was effective in invasive amoebiasis (Powell et ai, 19666). Numerou...|$|E
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} thirty six {{patients}} with amoebic liver abscess were investigated for cholestasis, its mechanism and the natural course of the disease. Cholestasis was seen in 29 % of cases and it presented with some unusual features: it was frequently seen in young men (mean age 38. 6 +/- 6. 3 years) (87 %) with acute onset (69 %) and was associated with signs of peritonism, or peritonitis (28 %), splenomegaly (12 %) and hepatic encephalopathy (coma 13 %). Raised diaphragm was seen only in 37 % of cases. Alcoholism {{may have contributed to}} the cholestasis in 37 % of cases. Multiple (43 %) and single (32 %) large liver abscesses, especially on the inferior surface of the liver (25 %), were common in jaundiced patients with amoebic liver abscess, while size and number of abscesses were directly related to the raised serum bilirubin concentrations. Bromsulphalein excretion (BSP) was found to be significantly reduced (p less than 0. 01) in patients with jaundice (60 %). Retrograde injection of contrast media into the common bile duct during six necropsies showed compression by amoebic liver abscess on the hepatic ducts. The mortality (43 %) and the complications were significantly higher (p less than 0. 001) in patients with jaundice. The aspiration/surgical drainage of amoebic liver abscess together with a combination of metronidazole and di-iodohydroxyquinoline was more effective than either metronidazole alone, or <b>dehydroemetine</b> with chloroquine...|$|E
