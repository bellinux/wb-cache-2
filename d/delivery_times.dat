5|$|This shift by Timex came at {{an ideal}} time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved {{more popular than}} {{expected}} and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources {{to deal with the}} demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board.|$|E

25|$|ZipRefill – To {{alleviate}} the return <b>delivery</b> <b>times,</b> Zip.ca pledged to (for qualified customers), send a replacement disc once a customer indicates (via the website) that a disc has {{been returned to}} Zip.ca, without {{waiting for it to}} actually be received (the ZipRefill is not a guaranteed rental). Only a single ZipRefill is allowed at any one time, which allows a person with, for instance, a 4-disc membership to at times actually have 5 discs in their possession or in transit. Some other Canadian rental companies have incorporated a similar concept, often extending it to multiple active replacements.|$|E

25|$|The Lynx proved {{unreliable}} for {{the first}} decade of operation. The aircraft had a large number of technical problems, which were aggravated through long <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> for spare parts. Secondly the 337 had high turnover, amongst both pilots and mechanics. This caused an excessive number of flight hours to be used for training instead of service. The latter was largely solved when the number of crew members was cut from six to three. This gave each crew member more tasks, which increased the contentment and decreased turnover. Along with Denmark, Germany and Netherlands, a simulator was bought. This allowed more training there. Combined this allowed the Lynx to operate the requested number of service hours from 1992.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of freight shipments between the EU, Russia and the Asian Pacific Region currently go by sea via the Suez Canal – a distance of between 17,000 and 22,000km. By extending the broad-gauge line, the promoters of the Košice–Vienna project aim to make the Trans-Siberian Railway more competitive vis-à-vis the sea routes. By eliminating the need to change bogies, freight <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> from East Asia to Europe will be cut by 14 days to just half of the time required for transportation by sea. And as {{there will be no}} freight transshipment the risk of accidental damage to cargo could be reduced. Russian Railways CEO Vladimir Yakunin believes it is the faster freight delivery that will make the project competitive.|$|E
500|$|Parallel to his {{initiatives}} in Air Force education and training, Hewitt introduced a revised aircrew ranking scheme {{that consisted of}} skill categories with various levels, such as navigator level4 or pilot level1, rather than the regular military ranks such as sergeant or flight lieutenant. This was abandoned in 1950 due to dissatisfaction caused {{by the lack of}} obvious equivalence between these specialist 'ranks' and the traditional ranking system common {{to the rest of the}} RAAF and other defence forces. After completing his term as Air Member for Personnel in 1948, he was posted to London as the Australian Defence Representative. By now promoted air vice marshal, Hewitt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours. Returning from Britain the same year, he took over as Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) from Air Vice Marshal George Mackinolty, who had died suddenly of [...] cancer. Hewitt served as AMSE until his retirement from the RAAF in April 1956. In this role, he again cooperated with Air Vice Marshal Wackett—now the Air Member for Technical Services—to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on 'life-of-type', whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed operationally, to reduce support costs and <b>delivery</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
40|$|Consider a {{radio access}} network wherein a basestation is {{required}} to deliver a set of order-constrained messages {{to a set of}} users over independent erasure channels. This paper studies the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> reduction problem using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). Motivated by time-critical and order-constrained applications, the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> is defined, at each transmission, as the number of undelivered messages. The <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> minimization problem being computationally intractable, most of the existing literature on IDNC propose suboptimal online solutions. This paper suggests a novel method for solving the problem by introducing the delivery delay as a measure of distance to optimality. An expression characterizing the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> using the <b>delivery</b> delay is derived, allowing the approximation of the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> minimization problem by an optimization problem involving the delivery delay. The problem is, then, formulated as a maximum weight clique selection problem over the IDNC graph wherein the weight of each vertex reflects its corresponding user and message's delay. Simulation results suggest that the proposed solution achieves lower <b>delivery</b> and completion <b>times</b> as compared to the best-known heuristics for <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> reduction...|$|R
40|$|This article formulates a {{model for}} finding the optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> {{performance}} guarantee. The expected profit model is solved to find a closed-form expression for the optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> promise. The simple, yet powerful model gives new insights into performance service guarantees in general and <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> guarantees in particular. Many manufacturing and distribution firms guarantee to meet a standard <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> promise and pay significant compensation to customers when deliveries are late. If the firm promises its customers a <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> that is too short, it will frequently not make the promise, have to pay significant compensation, and possibly lose market share over <b>time.</b> If the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> guarantee is too long, customers will find the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> unattractive and will buy elsewhere. Hart (1993) and others (Hill 1995) call this a “performance service guarantee. ” Although a <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> performance-guarantee scenario {{will be used as}} the context for this article, other performance service guarantee contexts could have been used as well. Other similar performance service guarantees include no-stockout guarantees (Hart 1993), waiting time guarantees (Friedman and Friedman 1997; Kumar, Kalwani, and Dada 1997), and up-time maintenance guarantees (Hill 1992). It should be noted, however, that an unconditional satisfaction guarantee (Hart 1988) is more complex and is not addressed in this article.
