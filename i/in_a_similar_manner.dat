In live performances, Dylan often strummed the chords, or flatpicked, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar,</b> fast-paced <b>manner.</b> Moreover, the 1963 [...] "Witmark demos" [...] version of the song has Bob Dylan finger-picking, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>similar</b> <b>manner</b> to the original 1962 recording.

40|$|Terrestrial mammals of {{different}} sizes tend to move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dynamically <b>similar</b> <b>manner</b> when travelling at speeds corresponding to equal values of the Froude number. This means that certain dimensionless locomotor parameters, including peak vertical ground reaction force relative to body weight, stride length relative to leg length and duty factor, are independent of animal size. The Froude number is consequently used to define equivalent speeds for mammals {{of different}} sizes. However, most musculoskeletal-tissue properties, including tendon elastic modulus, do not scale <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dynamically <b>similar</b> <b>manner.</b> Therefore, mammals could not be completely dynamically similar, even if perfectly geometrically similar. We argue that, for mammals to move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dynamically <b>similar</b> <b>manner,</b> they must exhibit systematic 'distortions' of limb structure with size that compensate for the size independence of the tendon elastic modulus. An implication {{of this is that}} comparing mammals at equal Froude numbers cannot remove all size-dependent effects. We show that the previously published allometry of limb moment arms is sufficient to compensate for size-independent tendon properties. This suggests that it is <b>an</b> important factor <b>in</b> allowing mammals {{of different sizes}} to move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dynamically <b>similar</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (alternately known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the time, there were no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry.

5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>manner</b> to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
