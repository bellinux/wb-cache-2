5|$|Overall, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{homologous}} recombination during meiosis functions to repair DNA damages, and that BRCA2 {{plays a key}} role in performing this function.|$|E
5|$|Philanthropenos {{remained}} at Philadelphia until 1326, possibly also 1327, but <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{he was then}} appointed as governor of the strategically important Byzantine island of Lesbos, since he was dismissed from the same post in 1328 by Andronikos III Palaiologos.|$|E

5|$|This {{being the}} case, however, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the genetic {{variability}} of cultivated N. rajah plants is very small, as all commercially available tissue-cultured plants {{are thought to}} belong to just four clones originating from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England.|$|E
5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations {{were said to be}} easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method is}} to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the voter has spoiled his or her ballot, thus {{rendering}} it invalid. Typically this would be done by adding another mark to the paper, making <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the voter has voted for more candidates than entitled, for instance. It {{would be difficult to}} do this to a large number of paper ballots without detection.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Lü {{was not a}} {{particularly}} effective governor of his domain, and there were repeated rebellions against his rule. In response, he instituted strict laws. His official Duan Ye tried to speak against such strict laws in 388, and while Lü Guang indicated that he agreed with Duan, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> he did not actually make things easier for his people.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the}} first stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that {{globular clusters}} are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the Council of Chelsea {{approved}} Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, {{remained a}} bishop at its conclusion; {{he signed the}} council's report still as a bishop. There {{is no indication that}} he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the {{decision}} of the court of appeals was rested, in addition to other grounds, upon a distinct and independent ground, not involving any federal question, and sufficient in itself to maintain the judgment, the writ of error falls within the wellsettled rule on that subject, and cannot be maintained.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new archdiocese, Jaenberht retained his position as the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence. When Jaenberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by Hygeberht, now senior in his turn. Subsequently Æthelheard appears as a witness on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Offa continued to respect Canterbury's authority.|$|E
5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as a grown man and his father as an old one, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Duncan was still young in 1040, and Malcolm and his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's family did attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Elvish {{greetings}} can {{be expressed}} both by voice and by hand, and often involve {{a combination of the}} two. Elvish greetings are often, but not always, used just prior to a conversation. From the Lord of the Rings <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Elves do not have a very elaborate greeting ritual.|$|E

5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} {{researchers}} have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at the surface. A 2008 study published in Current Biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with {{both sides of the}} brain. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{the need}} for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed {{at least in part}} to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E

50|$|In the meantime, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> his family's ambitions {{had come}} to naught. His brother Angelo had stood for {{election}} as Doge in 1646, but lost out to Francesco Molin. Angelo's death in 1657 appeared to sound the death knell for the family's ambitions: Domenico Contarini was over seventy years old, while his son, Giulio, was still too young to achieve high political office. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> {{the work of a}} generation had been lost.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, {{as part of}} the Tawani Foundation 2008 Antarctic International Expedition (see below), Dale Andersen and Ian Hawes {{discovered}} conical stromatolites {{growing in}} Lake Untersee, the largest living ones known to date. Small microbial pinnacles are also present, and <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the large conical stromatolites and the small pinnacles are made by different microbial communities. These communities provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date.|$|E
5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> this was a conscious {{effort on the part}} of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Bishop Thomas {{remained}} pro-English and pro-Balliol {{after the}} rising in 1306 of Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick. Bruce had himself crowned king on 25 March (becoming King Robert I of Scotland). Bishop Thomas' positions mirrored those of William II, Earl of Ross. On 7 December 1307 King Edward II of England was seeking Bishop Thomas' support against King Robert.|$|E
