5|$|Athletics {{events were}} held in the National Sports Center Athletics Stadium. Ana Katiloka {{represented}} Tonga in the triple jump event of athletics. This event took place on 11 September 2011. Katiloka's best <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event was 10.41m, and she finished last (eighth) in the final standings. The gold medal in this event was won by Nat Apikotoa of Australia with a best jump of 12.55m.|$|E

5|$|At the 2007 World Championships, Lysacek {{made his}} first attempt at landing a quadruple <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short program. He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but {{stepped out of the}} quad and put his hand down, and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E

40|$|This article {{estimates}} stochastic volatility jump-diffusion processes {{using the}} continuous empirical characteristic function method {{based on the}} Joint characteristic function and the Marginal characteristic function.

Out of the models considered, stochastic volatility with normal <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asset log-price fits the best the S&P 500 index for the period from January 1980 to December 1999. Empirical characteristic unction estimation procedure based on the Marginal unconditional characteristic function {{is found to be}} more efficient when applied to the stochastic volatility models with <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asset log-price.

5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Lysacek resumed {{training}} {{a few weeks}} later. At the 2007 U.S. Championships, he performed his first clean short program of the season, {{then went on to}} land his first clean quadruple jump in competition, a quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop <b>jump,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long program, to win his first national title. A week later, Lysacek competed in the 2007 Four Continents. He was fourth after the short program, but made yet another comeback in the free skate, landing a clean quadruple combination, to earn a new personal best and to win his second Four Continents title.|$|E
5|$|The December 2012 (cover dateFebruary 2013) {{issue of}} V Jump {{announced}} that {{parts of the}} manga would be fully colored digitally and re-released. Twenty volumes, beginning from chapter one hundred and ninety-five and grouped by story arcs, were released between February 4, 2013, and July 4, 2014. Twelve volumes covering the first one hundred and ninety-four chapters were published between January 4 and March 4, 2016. Dragon Ball was also released in a sōshūhen edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same size, with the color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, in addition to foldout posters. Eighteen volumes were published between May 13, 2016, and January 13, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast {{that there would be}} a time <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode. After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen. The picture has since been taken down.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{itself is}} composed of two rounds. In round one, all 40 qualified athletes complete a single <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned World Cup order. After points for distance and style are achieved, only the top 30 scorers from the first round proceed to the second, while the rest are eliminated from the event. In round two, the starting order is instead {{based solely on the}} points gained in the first round: the lowest scoring athlete jumps first, while the leader has the very last jump of the competition. The athlete with the most points from both rounds wins that competition. For the second competition, the starting order for round one uses the results from the first competition – no longer based on World Cup ranking – with athletes again jumping in ascending order of points. After the second (and final) round, the athlete with the most points accumulated from both competitions is declared the Ski Flying World Champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{hill was}} {{scheduled}} to host two FIS Ski Jumping World Cup events in January 1991, {{but they had to}} be cancelled due to lack of snow. In 1993, the hills hosted a single large hill World Cup event. Since 1997, Tremplin du Praz has been used annually for the FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix, the premier international summer ski jumping tournament. Originally it consisted of a single competition in the large hill, but from 2010, a qualification run was introduced the day before the main event. The venue has hosted the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup four times, in 2000, 2002, 2010 and 2011. In February 2006, the venue hosted two FIS Cup competitions in the normal hill. In January 2007, Courchevel hosted two rounds of a FIS-organized junior ski <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal hill. In Nordic combined, the venue has hosted the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup twice, in 1991 and 1992. It also held a World Cup B event in 1997. The venue has been a popular training venue for national teams, and Germany often holds summer training in Courchevel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} adjusting for the intra-day volatility pattern on jump detection. Using tests that identify the intra-day timing of jumps, we show that before <b>the</b> adjustment, <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> financial market have high probability of occurring concurrently with pre-scheduled economy-wide news announcements. We demonstrate that adjustment for the U-shaped volatility pattern prior to jump detection effectively removes most of the association between jumps and macroeconomic news announcements. We find empirical evidence that only news that comes with large surprise can cause <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market index after the volatility adjustment, while the effect {{of other types of}} news is largely absorbed through the continuous volatility channel. The FOMC meeting announcement is shown to have the highest association with <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market {{both before and after the}} adjustment...|$|R

25|$|Fife left {{medical school}} and was {{commissioned}} Second Lieutenant in U.S. Army in June 1939. Fife then reported to the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington for training in Aug 1940. After receiving his basic infantry training, he reported to the 60th Infantry at Fort Bragg in North Carolina where he served as an Assistant Operations Officer in September 1940. Fife volunteered for the 18th class of Parachute Jump School in Fort Benning, Georgia in April 1942. Following his training in May 1942, he joined the newly formed 503rd parachute infantry battalion as Company Commander. As Company Commanding Officer of the 503rd parachute infantry regiment in Sept 1943, Fife led his company in a <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Markham Valley, New Guinea. This was the first successful airborne combat <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Theater of Operations.

40|$|In this work, a new {{enrichment}} {{space to}} accommodate <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pressure field at immersed interfaces in finite element formulations, is proposed.

The new space is tested and compared with the classical P 1 space and to the space proposed by Ausas et al (Comp. Meth. Appl. Mech.
