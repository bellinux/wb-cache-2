25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E
500|$|Tytell {{writes that}} Pound {{was in his}} element in Chestnut Ward. He was at last {{provided}} for, and was allowed to read, write and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, {{and turned it into}} his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of Sophocles's Women of Trachis and Electra, and continued work on The Cantos. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: [...] "E.P. has—as he had before—bats in the belfry but <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he has fewer not more than before his incarceration." ...|$|E
500|$|The fair {{organizers}} did not await {{congressional approval}} to begin planning the coin. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B. Davison {{came up with}} the concept for the designs. On December7, 1922, Commission of Fine Arts chairman Charles Moore wrote to Buffalo nickel designer and sculptor member of the commission James Earle Fraser, [...] "The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial. [...] They {{are going to have a}} 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal... <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the designs having been settled upon, the [...] models could be worked out quite readily and that a pretty swell thing could be made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't try me too high," [...] she begged. [...] "Not now, precious." [...] And, indeed, even as I spoke, <b>it</b> did <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the night}} was pretty still.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, not much. I {{can just}} see the island--the big one--still in the same place. <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> sir, <b>that,</b> for calms, this here sea is a devil of locality." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} mind," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think you had}} better tell me the rest on the nearest road to this man's house. <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> somehow, <b>that</b> {{there is no time}} to be lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right, Fred. D'you know, <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'm a {{far more}} selfish and despicable brute than I used to think myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good. But <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a}} want of harmony between your present mood of {{self-sacrifice}} and your past mood of self-preservation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this: <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you need}} looking after. We can't stay here indefinitely. Hadn't {{you better get}} back to Vancouver before your English friends ruin you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes, miss! Now I understand. I've {{had such}} {{people come in}} past years. But <b>it</b> didn't <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you looked of a sort to require blood-turning. What's the complaint? The wrong kind for this, I'll be bound.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't no {{business}} o' mine, but <b>it</b> sorter <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you chaps are a-playin' {{it just a}} little too fine this time! It ain't three miles from Three Pine Station and forty men. Of course, that's your lookout,--not mine!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, darling, {{what shall}} we do? We are making a mess of <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me.</b> Still, ANYTHING <b>that</b> pleases you will please me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{consider}} it when I've {{a little more}} to go on. <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'm learning things. And now I think I'll get to sleep; my head's aching." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George, <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you're upset," [...] said Dick, presently. [...] "I seem to {{remember}} you as a cool-headed fellow whom nothing could disturb. Has the army changed you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Sydney {{is one of}} Polly's new friends. Have n't you {{observed}} that she is uncommonly jolly, and don't {{that sort of thing}} account for it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Phoebe meditated a few moments; then looking up, said, 'I {{beg your}} pardon, Robin, but <b>it</b> does <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> {{if you think}} that this kind of life is not good for Lucilla, it cannot be right to {{sacrifice}} your own higher prospects to enable her to continue it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. <b>It</b> {{does not}} <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there is {{anything}} definite about that. I like to be stationary. But I am not particular." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did; I {{ought to}} have stopped you," [...] Kit agreed. [...] "For a moment, <b>it</b> did not <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you were looking for}} Miss Osborn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know, but <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{no matter}} how much you like Frazer, he was going pretty far when he said that anarchists had more sense than decent folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So am I, for <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> is an uncommonly 'nobby' little affair," [...] he said approvingly. Tom had a {{weakness}} for pale pink roses, and perhaps Polly knew it.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{the lady}} of the house, Mrs. S., <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you might offer a visitor, like this gentleman, some cake and wine, without making any {{particular}} hole in your manners!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the novel}} Royal Flash, by George MacDonald Fraser, the hero, Harry Flashman, on his marriage, is {{presented}} with the Royal Consort's portion of the Crown Jewels, and [...] "The Duchess did rather better"; the character, feeling hard done-by, thinks, [...] "It struck <b>me</b> then, and <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>that</b> the Salic Law was a damned sound idea".|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> however, <b>that</b> for {{millions}} of years the most honorable witnesses have been animals. Although they themselves are direct victims of the exterminations, they are witness to the savagery and pain through their stares, their bearing, and their wounds. Doesn’t the most hopeful way of avoiding the next extermination start by finding witnesses to the previous one? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{not know}} them by book," [...] replied the Captain promptly; [...] "for you have no books, but {{there is such a}} thing as the {{commands}} or law of God written in the heart, and <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> Chingatok, <b>that</b> you both know and obey more of your Maker's laws than many men who have His word." ...|$|R
60|$|Reviewing {{the matter}} as an {{impartial}} outsider, <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'm {{about the only}} person who has profited by the education of Otis Yeere. It comes to twenty-seven pages and bittock.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not a bit. Only {{when she}} is petting Basil <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I have heard the tones before. I only {{remember}} the time of misery under the crosspatches grandmamma got for us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I {{will not}} trouble your little heathen sultan {{to go so}} far. Still <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Chiffinch said you had company--some country cousin, or such a matter--Is there not such a person?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> Dinah, <b>that</b> our {{position}} {{here is a}} very dangerous one. You may be sure that the slaves {{will not be able to}} stand against the whites and the soldiers, and that numbers of them will go into hiding, and it is very likely that some who know the secret of this place will come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] {{continued}} Captain Jabez, [...] "I don't {{want to hurt}} nobody's feelin's, and I wouldn't say {{one word}} {{that would make the}} smallest infant think less of itself than it did afore I spoke, but <b>it</b> does <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> that there proposition of yours is a good deal like the California man's offer to the New York man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At that, though," [...] {{announced}} the first [...] "they're selling quite some booze in Zenith. Guess they are everywhere. I don't {{know how you}} fellows feel about prohibition, but the way <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a mighty beneficial thing for the poor zob that hasn't got any will-power but for fellows like us, it's an infringement of personal liberty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your 'reallys,' my dear Van, are {{a little}} formidable, but <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> before I tell you there's {{something}} I've a right to ask. Are you 'really' what they call thinking of my daughter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{take our}} chances {{rather than have}} such as you call us friends; but <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a fight, with all the weapons on our side, is too big a {{contract}} for you to tackle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't half like leaving you," [...] {{returned}} Sam. [...] "This learned gentleman here {{is rather}} a shifty sort of chap; and <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{two of us}} isn't {{a bit too much}} to watch him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're {{wrong about}} Wagner, father,' said Arthur, still glancing with {{paternal}} partiality at his sheet of manuscript: 'Lohengrin's {{a very fine}} work, a grand work, I assure you. I won't let you run it down. But, barring that, I think you're pretty nearly right in your main judgment. I'm not modest, and <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> somehow <b>that</b> I've invented a genre. That's about what it comes to.' ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course you}} can guess what happened? I was not so clever. When the news went abroad that Khem Singh had escaped from the Fort, I did not, since I was then living this story, not writing it, connect myself, or Lalun, or the fat gentleman of the gold pince-nez, with his disappearance. Nor did <b>it</b> <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Wali Dad {{was the man who}} should have convoyed him across the City, or that Lalun's arms round my neck were put there to hide the money that Nasiban gave to Kehm Singh, and that Lalun had used me and my white face as even a better {{safeguard}} than Wali Dad who proved himself so untrustworthy. All that I knew at the time was that, when Fort Amara was taken up with the riots, Khem Singh profited by the confusion to get away, and that his two Sikh guards also escaped.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> most strange <b>that</b> Love is now {{attacking the}} very group Narconon that per his earlier {{statements}} saved his life. He changed his mind, apparently, after he began receiving payments {{from members of}} the Anonymous network.|$|R
