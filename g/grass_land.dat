The Report says: [...] "It has been argued {{during the past few}} months that it is hopeless to attempt to plough out old <b>grass</b> <b>land</b> in the expectation of adding to the nation's food. The experience of 1917 does not support this contention. It shows not only that the successes far outnumber the failures, but that the latter are to some extent preventable." ...|$|E

60|$|At the sound, {{the mass}} of men before us opened out a little, and {{advanced}} towards the hill and up the spit of bare <b>grass</b> <b>land</b> at a slow trot, singing a deep-throated song as they ran.

To the south of us was a low ridge, over which was the road to France. Along this road the little group of cavalry was riding. So well had Count Stein obeyed his instructions that he had struck far to the south of us in his determination to get ahead of the Emperor. Now he was riding from the direction in which we were going--the last in which we could expect an enemy. When I caught that first glimpse of them they were still half a mile away.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Thurston halted on the topmost step of the lofty stile by which a {{footpath}} from the Hall entered the wood. Looking back across misty <b>grass</b> <b>land</b> and swelling ridges of heather, {{he could see a}} faint brightness behind the eastern rim of the moor; but, when he stepped down, it was very dark among the serried tree-trunks. The slender birches had faded utterly, the stately beeches resembled dim ghosts of trees and only the spruces retained, imperfectly, their shape and form. Thurston was country bred, and, lifting high his feet to clear bramble trailer and fallen twig, he walked by feeling instead of sight. The beck moaned a little more loudly, and there was a heavy astringent odor of damp earth and decaying leaves. When beast and bird were still again it seemed as if Nature, worn out by the productive effort of summer, were sinking under solemn silence into her winter sleep.|$|E
60|$|And as {{they built}} it, so, with some slight additions, it had {{remained}} to this day, for in those ages {{men did not}} skimp their flint, and oak, and mortar. It was a beautiful little spot, situated upon the flat top of a swelling hill, which comprised the ten acres of grazing ground originally granted, and was, strange to say, still the most magnificently-timbered piece of ground in the country side. For on the ten acres of <b>grass</b> <b>land</b> there stood over fifty great oaks, some of them pollards of the most enormous antiquity, and others which had, no doubt, originally grown very close together, fine upstanding trees with a wonderful length and girth of bole. This place, Colonel Quaritch's aunt, old Mrs. Massey, had bought nearly thirty years before when she became a widow, and now, together with a modest income of two hundred a year, it had passed to him under her will.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{collapse}} of the central government in Somalia, herders had an army of helping hands from the central government Ministry of Livestock and Forestry Management. Mashruuca Gosha iyo Gendiga was a Somali central government project which was founded in the early 1970s and it focused on treating and preventing diseases caused by large flies which were infested in Jubba Valley forests. This area of <b>grassing</b> <b>land</b> is used during barbax season (dry season) by camel herders from all neighboring regions such as the two Jubba regions, Gedo, Lower Shabeelle and Bay region. The project was later expanded to all major <b>grassing</b> <b>lands</b> in Somalia.|$|R

60|$|Behind {{and over}} us towered Sheba's snowy Breasts, and below, some five {{thousand}} feet beneath where we stood, lay league on league {{of the most}} lovely champaign country. Here were dense patches of lofty forest, there a great river wound its silvery way. To the left stretched a vast expanse of rich, undulating veld or <b>grass</b> <b>land,</b> whereon we {{could just make out}} countless herds of game or cattle, at that distance we could not tell which. This expanse appeared to be ringed in by a wall of distant mountains. To the right the country was more or less mountainous; that is, solitary hills stood up from its level, with stretches of cultivated land between, amongst which we could see groups of dome-shaped huts. The landscape lay before us as a map, wherein rivers flashed like silver snakes, and Alp-like peaks crowned with wildly twisted snow wreaths rose in grandeur, whilst over all was the glad sunlight and the breath of Nature's happy life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, in {{the first}} place," [...] said Forester, [...] "the fact that cotton and sugar can be {{cultivated}} by hired overseers, with slaves to do the work, enables rich men to carry on great plantations without laboring themselves. But a great grass farm could not be managed so. A man may have one thousand acres for his plantation at the south, and with a good overseer and good hands, it will all go on very well, so far as his profit is concerned. They will produce {{a great amount of}} cotton, which may be sent to market and sold, and the planter realize the money, so as to make a large profit after paying all his expenses. But if a man were to buy a thousand acres of <b>grass</b> <b>land,</b> and employ an overseer and slaves to cultivate it, every thing would go to ruin. The hay would get wet and spoiled,--the carts, wagons, and complicated tools necessary, would get broken to pieces,--the lambs would be neglected and die, and the property would soon go to destruction. Even when a rich man attempts to carry on a moderate farm by hired laborers, taking the best that he can find, he seldom succeeds." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a strange}} life that Suzanne led among the Umpondwana during the two years or more that, {{together}} with Sihamba, she ruled over them as chieftainess. Upon {{the top of the}} mountain was a space of <b>grass</b> <b>land</b> measuring about five hundred morgen, or a thousand acres in extent, where were placed the chief's huts and those of the head men and soldiers, surrounding a large cattle kraal, which, however, was only used in times of danger. The rest of the people dwelt upon the slopes of the mountain, and even on the rich plains at the foot of it, but if need were they could all retreat to the tableland upon its crest. Here they might have defied attack for ever, for beneath the cattle kraal grain was stored in pits, only there was but one spring, which in dry seasons was apt to fail. Therefore it was that the Umpondwana had built stone schanzes or fortifications about the mouth of the river which gushed from the mountain between the thumb and finger like ridges on the eastern slope, although it lay below their impregnable walls of rock, seeing that to this river they must look for their main supply of water.|$|E
