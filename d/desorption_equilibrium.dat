40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a larger {{research}} project where two metal hydride forming AB 5 type alloys have been investigated. A slightly non-stoichiometric alloy with mischmetal on A-site and nickel, cobalt, manganese and aluminium on B-site, La 0. 60 Ce 0. 29 Pr 0. 04 Nd 0. 07 Ni 3. 37 Co 0. 79 Mn 0. 25 Al 0. 74, has been characterized. The composition of this material, which will be referred to as Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15, is close to the normal battery composition. The other alloy characterized is LaNi 5 based, where nickel is partly substituted with tin, LaNi 4. 76 Sn 0. 24. This material will later be referred to as La(NiSn) 5. These materials were produced by melt spinning to vary the cooling rate during solidification. The main purpose of the study has been to characterize the electrochemical properties related to battery performance. The production as well as the metallurgical and structural characterization of the materials were performed in another part of the project. For Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 the unit cell volume was dependent on the cooling rate before heat treatment, while the unit cell volume was almost independent of the cooling rate for La(NiSn) 5. For both alloy compositions, the electrochemical properties seemed to change with varying cooling rate. The <b>desorption</b> <b>equilibrium</b> potential, the discharge capacity when discharging at a low current and the deterioration rate were found to be reduced with decreasing unit cell volume and increased with increasing unit cell volume, before heat treatment of Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15. The self discharge rate was observed to be inversely proportional to the unit cell volume for this material. For not heat treated La(NiSn) 5, produced at different cooling rates, the <b>desorption</b> <b>equilibrium</b> potential decreased when the self discharge rate and the discharge capacity increased after cycling for 300 cycles. The deterioration rate decreased when the <b>desorption</b> <b>equilibrium</b> potential was reduced for La(NiSn) 5. The electrochemical parameters both before and after heat treatment of La(NiSn) 5, did not seem to be related to the structural parameters, because the unit cell volume was almost independent of the cooling rate. After heat treatment of both melt spun Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 and La(NiSn) 5, the unit cell volume and the electrochemical properties seemed to be almost independent of the cooling rate, within the experimental error. La(NiSn) 5 showed an effect of storage of the materials. For Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 this effect was weaker.

For composites, barium aluminosilicate glass and pyrogenic silica was added to comonomer mixtures. Photopolymerization was effected by 0. 2 wt% each of camphorquinone and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine.

Thus, we studied the imbibition and desiccation kinetics and adsorption/ desorption isotherms of drumstick tree seeds. Seeds absorbed water readily when imbibed at 23 ºC. After 17 h of exposure to an atmosphere of 100 % relative humidity (RH), seed moisture content increased from 10 to 150 % on a dry weight basis (dwb). Seeds lost water rapidly in a 1 % RH still-air environment, and returned to their original seed moisture content in 24 h, indicating seed covering tissues are highly permeable to water.

The results obtained were used to determine adsorption constants that were incorporated in mathematical models using forward and backward stepwise linear regression to correlate data. The amount of adsorption was significantly different depending on soil properties, such as organic matter, iron oxide content, and surface area. Arsenic speciation on the soil surface was deduced from desorption data, with As(V) being more strongly retained in the soil. As(III) was oxidized on the soil surface and desorbed as As(V); an important factor since As(V) is less toxic. In order to develop an adequate adsorption model, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were obtained for each soil without pH alteration. Results indicated that the maximum amount of As(V) adsorbed was greater than the amount of As(III) adsorbed. Adsorption edges for As(III) and As(V), with pH varying from 3 to 10, were obtained at concentrations that ranged from 0. 1 to 200 mg L(- 1). The soils studied exhibited an L-type Langmuir isotherm.

The kinetics of sorption and desorption of diuron, total organic carbon, fulvic acid, humic acid and humin, pH and partition coefficient to organic carbon were evaluated. The Freundlich isotherm was adjusted appropriately to describe diuron sorption kinetics in all the studied treatments. The application of biochar provided increment in the sorption (Kf) and reduction in the desorption of diuron in 64 and 44 %, respectively. This effect is attributed to the biochar contribution to the total organic carbon and C-humin and of these to diuron through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The positive correlation between the partition coefficient to organic carbon and Kf confirms the importance of soil organic compartment in the sorption of diuron. There was no competition of NPK fertilizer for the same sorption site of diuron.

We {{show that a}} continuum model, incorporating a pore-blocking mechanism for <b>desorption</b> and <b>equilibrium</b> thermodynamics for adsorption, explains well the sorption hysteresis for a paste that remains above approximately 20 % RH.

In addition, most of the previous studies on MoS 2 -based composite photocatalysts reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the synergetic effect of effective light-response, p-n heterojunctions, and large surface areas. However, there are scarcely researches that focused on the influence of the coating effect to the relationship between adsorption capacity and photocatalysts. Indeed, the adsorption and <b>desorption</b> <b>equilibrium</b> between the dyes and the photocatalysts before light illumination show positive promotion effect on the photodegradation process. It has been reported that strong surface adsorption performance is beneficial for the effective degradation of organic dyes during the photocatalytic reaction [25, 26]. For example, the BiOI microspheres have more effective surface adsorption than random BiOI nanoplatelets, which lead to more excellent performance for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) [27].|$|E
40|$|Antibiotics, such as {{sulfadiazine}} (SDZ), {{may enter}} arable soil by spreading of manure of medicated husbandry or {{directly by the}} excrement of grazing animals. Knowledge of the fate of antibiotics in soils is crucial for assessing the environmental risk of these compounds, including possible transport to ground water. Kinetic sorption of (14) C-labeled SDZ (4 -amino-N-pyrimidin- 2 -yl-benzenesulfonamide) was investigated using the batch technique. The batch sorption-desorption experiments were conducted at various concentration levels (0. 044 - 13 mg L(- 1) initial solute concentration) and time scales (0. 75 - 272 d). Sorption of (14) C-SDZ in the investigated silty loam was time dependent and strongly nonlinear in the solution phase concentration. The time to reach an apparent sorption equilibrium was about 20 d. However, desorption was very slow, and 41 d were insufficient to reach the <b>desorption</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> An inverse modeling technique was used to identify relevant sorption processes of (14) C-SDZ during the batch experiments. Among the investigated two- and three-domain sorption models, adsorption and desorption of (14) C-SDZ were best described with a new model defining two sorption domains and four parameters. Whereas sorption in the first sorption domain was nonlinear and instantaneous, solute uptake in the second sorption domain was rate limited following first-order kinetics. Desorption followed the same rate law until an equilibrium distribution was reached. After that, desorption {{was assumed to be}} impossible due to partly irreversible sorption. Although the proposed model needs further validation, it contributes to the discussion on complex sorption processes of organic chemicals in soils...|$|E

The adsorption processes of metolachlor and 2, 4 -D {{on the soil}} solid matrix exhibited moderate rate of accumulation with 20. 30 % and, 24. 71 % respectively after 0. 5 h. Data revealed that the adsorption- desorption of metolachlor and 2, 4 -D on the selected soil samples followed the first order rate law. Linear and Freundlich models were {{used to describe the}} adsorption- desorption of the two pesticides. Variation in adsorption affinities of the soils to the pesticides was observed, distribution coefficient Kd values for adsorption process varied between 1. 882 - 3. 025 mlg- 1 and 2. 123 - 3. 989 mlg- 1 for metolachlor and 2, 4 -D respectively, and for desorption process varied between 4. 222 - 10. 986 and 4. 755 - 14. 54 mlg- 1 for metolachlor and 2, 4 -D respectively. Freundlich coefficient KF for metolachlor and 2, 4 -D ranged between 0. 105 - 0. 312 and 0. 119 - 0. 355 mlg- 1 for adsorption processes. The value Freundlich coefficient for desorption process KFdes ranged from 0. 479 to 1. 130 mlg- 1 and 0. 284 to 1. 012 mlg- 1 for metolachlor and 2, 4 -D respectively.

The bulbs of cultivated Fritillaria cirrhosa (BCFC) {{are used in}} China both for food and folk medicine due to its powerful biological activities. The {{aim of this study}} is to optimize the extraction and enrichment conditions of alkaloids from BCFC. Firstly, the orthogonal experimental design was used to optimize and evaluate four variables (ethanol concentration, solid-liquid ratio, extraction time, and temperature). Thereafter, resin adsorption was as a means to enrich alkaloids. Among 16 tested resins, H- 103 resin presented higher adsorption capacity and <b>desorption</b> ratio. The <b>equilibrium</b> experimental data of the adsorption of total alkaloids, imperialine, and peimisine were well-fitted to the pseudo-first-order kinetics model, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms models. Finally, in order to optimize the parameters for purifying alkaloids, dynamic adsorption and desorption tests were carried out. After one run treatment with H- 103 resin, the contents of total alkaloids, imperialine, and peimisine in the product were 21. 40 -, 18. 31 -, and 22. 88 -fold increased with recovery yields of 94. 43 %, 90. 57 %, and 96. 16 %, respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of blood coagulation factor X and its Gla-containing fragments with negatively charged phospholipid membranes composed of 25 mol% phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and 75 mol% phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) was studied by surface plasmon resonance. The binding to 100 mol% PtdCho membranes was negligible. The calcium dependence in the membrane binding was evaluated for intact bovine factor X (factor X) and the fragment containing the Gla-domain and the N-terminal EGF (epidermal growth factor) -like domain, Gla-EGFN, from factor X. Both proteins {{show the same}} calcium dependence in the membrane binding. Calcium binding is cooperative and half-maximum binding was observed at 1. 5 mm and 1. 4 mm, with the best fit to the experimental data with three cooperatively bound calcium ions for both the intact protein and the fragment. The dissociation constant (Kd) for binding to membranes containing 25 mol% PtdSer decreased from 4. 6 microm for the isolated Gla-domain to 1 microm for the fragments Gla-EGFN and Gla-EGFNC (the Gla-domain and both EGF-like domains) fragments and to 40 nm for the entire protein as zymogen, activated enzyme or in the active-site inhibited form.
