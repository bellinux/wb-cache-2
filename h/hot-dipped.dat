The cyclic oxidation resistance behavior of both <b>hot-dipping</b> Al samples and <b>hot-dipping</b> Al- 5 Si samples at 900 ℃ for 24 cycles have been investigated using muffle furnace. The element distribution, phase composition and morphology of the aluminide layer and the oxide film were characterized by SEM and EDS.

50|$|<b>Hot-dip</b> {{galvanized}} {{surfaces are}} not generally {{tested in a}} salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). <b>Hot-dip</b> galvanizing produces zinc carbonates when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate.

50|$|The {{protection}} {{provided by}} hot-dip galvanizing is insufficient for products {{that will be}} constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses. For these applications, more expensive stainless steel is preferred. Some nails made today are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many outdoor applications because it is cheaper than hot-dip zinc coating and looks good when new. Another reason not to use hot-dip zinc coating is that for bolts and nuts of size M10 (US 3/8") or smaller, the thick <b>hot-dipped</b> coating fills in {{too much of the}} threads, which reduces strength (because the dimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to fit together). This means that for cars, bicycles, and many other light mechanical products, the practical alternative to electroplating bolts and nuts is not hot-dip zinc coating, but making the fasteners from stainless steel.|$|E

40|$|Using laser {{scanning}} confocal microscope, failure process of aluminized ductile iron samples were in-situ observed during three-point bending test, while crack initiation and propagation mechanism were analyzed {{in the area}} of coating and matrix.

The material variations studied include zinc coating integrity, structure, composition, thickness, roughness, oil, and the amount and type of Fe-Zn intermetallics. Process modifications studied include upsloping and downsloping of the weld current, preheat current, postheat current, electrode tip geometry, and applied force. It was found that <b>hot-dipped</b> galvanized materials with coatings which have a very thin Fe-Zn alloy layer have {{a wider range of}} acceptable welding conditions than the commercial galvannealed products, which have a fully alloyed Fe-Zn coating. The decreased lobe width of the galvannealed material is due to the discontinuous Fe-Zn coating structure and morphology.
