50|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Alexis Boutros, Mr. Georges Haddad was {{appointed}} dean of Alba in 1979. He struggled during the civil war <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>programs</b> running. He managed to achieve the fusion with University of Balamand in 1988.|$|R
40|$|The {{world of}} SAS ® is an ever-expanding, ever-changing one. With each new release come new {{features}} and new capabilities. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> up <b>programming</b> skills, SAS users need opportunities both to learn SAS and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> learning SAS. This paper outlines various methods to acquire and update SAS knowledge, including users groups, Web resources, listservs and other opportunities...|$|R
50|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>{{programs}}</b> going, NAEYC members {{must pay}} dues for {{funding of the}} programs they run. In September 2012, the NAEYC members at that time received a letter/e-mail regarding a due increase. This {{was the first time}} since 2000 that there was an increase in dues.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Heck called Social Security a [...] "pyramid scheme". The remark aroused a {{political}} controversy in Nevada, and Heck clarified {{that he meant}} to {{refer to it as}} an [...] "inverted pyramid". He has suggested that today's young people may need to retire later <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> fiscally viable.|$|R
25|$|Starting in 1956, the United States Air Force funded {{a highly}} secretive program of {{research}} and development on high-speed aircraft for long-range reconnaissance. Lockheed's Skunk Works was the natural partner for this work, having successfully delivered the U-2 and having all the required secrecy and security arrangements <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> secret.|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the plot}} {{concerns}} {{the resolution of the}} Truson-Mara love story, the attempts of the adults to bring back the children, and the townsfolk and the Mayor. A happy ending showing the Piper's forgiveness and his returning of the children was added to the story in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> a family special.|$|R

KMBC was ranked 10th by an InsideCollege review of colleges for student acceptance. In an article titled [...] "Colleges Students Don't Turn Down", InsideCollege found that 83.9% {{of students who are}} accepted to KMBC enroll.|$|R
40|$|A {{definition}} of 'management philosophies' is discussed explaining {{the position of}} NASA in the planning and control of space programs and technology. The impact of these philosophies on the Apollo and Saturn 1 programs are described along {{with the need for}} the Saturn 5 spacecraft and launch site development. Case studies are included and describe unscheduled events where management decisions were necessary <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>programs</b> on track...|$|R
40|$|NIST invites your {{comments}} on this {{assessment of the}} measurement needs of the U. S. electric-power industry as that industry undergoes major changes during deregulation and seeks to adopt new technology. NIST regularly reassesses the needs of U. S. industries for measurement support in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> NIST’s <b>programs</b> focused on the highest priority requirements. Comments should be sent to...|$|R
50|$|When {{designing}} a prevention program, {{it is important}} <b>to</b> remember <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> age and gender appropriate. For example, Early Childhood Friendship Project and You Can't Say You Can't Play have visual activities for the preschoolers and integrate puppet shows into the lesson plan. In addition, because males and females approach aggression differently there must be personalized plans to fit both genders.|$|R
50|$|The Institute strives <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its <b>programs</b> up {{with the}} {{requirements}} of the national and international professional community. Its Energy Supply program is accredited by the Russian Association for Engineering Education, the member of ENAEE. The EUR-ACE quality label confirms the engineering program compliance with international standards.Every year the Institute hosts the international scientific conference “Energy Efficiency and Safety of Production Process”.|$|R
5000|$|Sarant's {{definition}} of the zero-base based on the federal training experience is: [...] "A minimum level is actually the grass roots funding level necessary <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a <b>program</b> alive. Therefore, the minimal level is the [...] "program or funding level below which it is not feasible <b>to</b> continue a <b>program...</b> because no constructive contribution can be made toward fulfilling its objective." [...] Identifying this level of program funding has been subjective and problematic.|$|R
25|$|In 1949, another curly top {{management}} program {{was developed in}} southern Idaho. It focused {{on the use of}} insecticides and specific planting times to control the virus. The method of specific planting dates was inconsistent and led to an unsuccessful management of the virus. In 1969, the program was eliminated due to the increase in urbanization and shortage of funds available <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> running.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} Our Secret Weapon {{went on the}} air in 1942, the CBS shortwave {{listening}} station directed by John W. (Jack) Gerber employed 11 linguists monitoring Axis broadcasts 19 hours a day. [...] "We wondered if they'd tell enough lies in a week <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> interesting," [...] Gerber told Time magazine. [...] "They sure do. We hear twice as many as we can use." ...|$|R
25|$|Popular opinion {{surveys show}} that the public views Medicare’s {{problems}} as serious, but not as urgent as other concerns. In January 2006, the Pew Research Center found 62 {{percent of the public}} said addressing Medicare’s financial problems should be a high priority for the government, but that still put it behind other priorities. Surveys suggest that there’s no public consensus behind any specific strategy <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> solvent.|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>programs</b> as {{subroutine}} oriented as possible. Usually only the main programs are directly concerned {{with the problem of}} total cross sections. In particular the subroutines POLFIT, BILINR, GASS 59 /MAXLIK, SYMOR, MATIN, STUDNT, DNTERP, DIFTAB, FORDIF, EPSALG, REGFAL and ADSIMP are completely general, and are concerned only with the problems of numerical analysis and statistics. Each subroutine is independently documented...|$|R

50|$|For {{the several}} years it {{remained}} in business, {{officials of the}} DuMont network wished <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its <b>programs</b> as intact as possible. However, the network ceased to exist in 1956 and its archive, as previously noted, was discarded in the 1970s. The corporate successor to DuMont, Fox, not only has never aired any daytime programming (other than its Fox Kids block from 1990 to 2001) but debuted in 1986, well beyond the wiping era.|$|R
50|$|Even more astonishing, a {{few years}} later, Turner would buy the team {{outright}} before the 1976 season, mainly <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a <b>programming</b> staple of his in Atlanta. Before the purchase, rumors had spread alleging that the Braves' owners were looking to move the franchise to another city, following dismal stadium attendance during the 1974 and 1975 seasons, after the excitement of Hank Aaron hitting his then-record-breaking 715th home run (on April 8, 1974) wore off.|$|R
50|$|LM-3 now {{became the}} first manned LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and {{practice}} the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until Apollo 9 on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit manned practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> timeline on track.|$|R
5000|$|Named Filipino {{actors and}} actresses {{including}} unknown ones who would later become entertainment icons worked with Father Reuter's [...] "Family Theater" [...] productions for free. At first [...] "Family Theater" [...] was airing for free on Channel 3 (later Channel 2 in 1969) of ABS-CBN but later the group was asked to bring advertising into the network, and when the call was made, people continued <b>to</b> donate <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> airing.|$|R
50|$|California {{finished}} the 2011 regular {{season as the}} #6 team in the Pac-12 Conference with a 25-21 record, and {{made it to the}} 2011 College World Series finishing tied for 5th place. The program also staved off elimination as a varsity program in 2011 by raising approximately 10 million dollars in {{a little more than a}} month. The funds raised were able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the California baseball program running and set up the Cal Baseball Foundation <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> running into perpetuity. The university also had planned to eliminate Rugby, Men's and Women's Gymnastics, and Women's Lacrosse, but enough funds were raised <b>to</b> save those <b>programs</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|Family Rosary Crusade {{was being}} run by Gennie Q. Jota who served as Executive Director and ably {{recruited}} volunteers to write, contribute almost anything <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> running. Veteran sound engineer, Beda Orquejo who was met by Father Peyton at the old government television network under Marcos' time left his regular work with the network to serve as all-around technical person. Orquejo would serve as director, cameraman {{and editor of the}} weekly episodes of Family Rosary Crusade.|$|R
50|$|According to {{some school}} administrators, states have cut funding for K-12 {{education}} consistently {{for the last}} eight years causing many districts to cut jobs, increase class size, and cut spending on supplies. Using advertisements in schools is a way to raise money for school districts. According to proponents, schools, especially in less affluent areas, need ways to raise money in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> school <b>programs</b> alive and alleviate the financial burden presented by the funding cuts.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Temple {{has complained}} about the schools {{resources}} being supposedly wasted on the dance program. When Pierre is brought to {{a meeting with the}} parents' association, he convinces them <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> going after demonstrating how ballroom dancing has taught the students [...] "teamwork, respect, and dignity". On the night of the contest, Rock is told he must participate in a theft. He intentionally shoots the sprinkler system, setting off the alarm and causing the thugs to flee.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 CCI's State Department {{contract}} was terminated prematurely. CCI developed the means <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> running and eventually Russian entrepreneurs were paying the full costs {{of training and}} CCI's operational costs. By 2008, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> PEP afloat, CCI had cut staff, moved operations, reduced salaries {{and the number of}} PEP participants. In late 2008 as Russia was pulled into the global financial crisis, Russian entrepreneurs were no longer able to pay for the business training in the U.S. Participants canceled 2009 training trips, and CCI was forced to close the doors of the PEP program in February.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our experience}} in extending {{a set of}} tools, designed for user interface construction, to support multiuser execution. The enhancement of the tools {{was based on an}} existing user interface architecture. The goal was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>programming</b> paradigms {{as close as possible to}} the ones of the available environment. The strategy was to enhance a particular category of user interface components through specialization mechanisms #inheritance#. Two alternatives for this specialization have been evaluated, shared and replicated objects...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, when Fox {{moved its}} Detroit {{affiliation}} from WKBD to WJBK, many Michigan cable systems outside the Detroit area replaced WKBD with the network's Cadillac affiliate WGKI (now WFQX-TV), in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Fox <b>programming</b> {{available in the}} Upper Peninsula. However, in areas where Fox was already available locally, mainly in television markets located in southern and central Michigan (especially the Tri-Cities), much of WGKI's programming was blacked out. In 1996, some systems that dropped WKBD for WGKI brought the former back.|$|R
50|$|Pressures on {{the entire}} team <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> {{on-track}} were compounded by the coaching change. The return of previous head coach Mike Riley from the NFL meant learning an entirely new system. With help from teammate and star running back Steven Jackson, Anderson again rose to the occasion and {{played a leading role}} in propelling the team to an 8-5 record, this time ending the 2003 season with a 55-14 Las Vegas Bowl win over a then up-and-coming New Mexico program.|$|R
5000|$|The Eagle Eye {{prototype}} {{crashed in}} 2006, and Bell {{could not get}} enough interest or money <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>program</b> going. However, in January 2016, the U.S. Army said it was searching for a mid-sized [...] "runway independent" [...] UAV, years after losing interest in the Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout. Although the Army has not specified whether it wants a rotorcraft, VTOL, tiltrotor, launch and recover, or other runway independent design, Bell sees potential for the Eagle Eye to meet Army requirements.|$|R
5000|$|On September 17, 2004, with no advance warning, WBUR Group {{general manager}} Jane Christo {{announced}} that WRNI and WXNI were {{being put on}} the market. She wouldn't give any specifics, only {{saying that it was}} time for Rhode Islanders to buy the stations if they wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> NPR <b>programming</b> in the state. [...] Indeed, WBUR claimed that it never intended to operate WRNI on a long-term basis, and had only intended to help develop it into a self-sustaining service.|$|R
