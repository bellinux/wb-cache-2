5000|$|Oligo- or polystannanes {{were first}} {{described}} by Löwig in 1852, only 2 years after Edward Frankland's {{report on the}} isolation of the first organotin compounds. Löwig' route involved treating an Sn/K and Sn/Na alloys with <b>iodoethane,</b> in the presence of quartz sand which was used to control the reaction rate. Products with elemental compositions close to those of oligo(diethylstannane)s or poly(diethylstannane) were obtained. Cahours obtained similar products and attributed the formation of the so-called [...] "stannic ethyl" [...] to a reaction of the Wurtz type. Already in 1858, [...] "stannic ethyl" [...] was formulated as a polymeric compound denoted with the composition n(SnC4H5). In 1917 Grüttner, who reinvestigated results on hexaethyl-distannanes(H5C2)3Sn-Sn(C2H5)3 (reported by Ladenburg in 1870) confirmed the presence of Sn-Sn bonds and predicated {{for the first time that}} tin could form chain like compounds. In 1943, it was postulated that “diphenyltin” exists as a type of polymeric material because of its yellow color 8, and indeed a bathochromic shift of the wavelength at maximum absorption with increasing number of Sn atoms was found later in the case of oligo(dibutylstannane)s comprising up to 15 Sn atoms.|$|E

The 266 nm spectra, resonant with the directly dissociative A-state absorption, display long overtone progressions in the nominal C-I stretch (ca. 500 cm- 1) and some intensity in fundamentals, overtones and combination bands of bending and C-C stretching modes.

40|$|Accurate second-order rate {{constants}} {{were measured}} at 5 K intervals in the temperature range 298. 15 - 328. 15 K for the quaternisation reaction of triethylphosphine with <b>iodoethane</b> in methanol, ethanol, propan- 1 -ol and butan- 1 -ol. These data are complemented previously reported rate constants for the quaternisation reaction of triethylamine with <b>iodoethane</b> {{in the same}} solvents and at similar temperatures. Each of these two reaction series is analysed {{in terms of the}} isokinetic relationship (IKR) with respect to solvent variation and of the isosolvent relationship (ISoR) with respect to temperature variation, using in the latter case five different empirical solvent scales. Statistically validated IKR and ISoR have been found for both reaction series. The resulting isokinetic temperatures of 347 K (phosphine series) and of 730 K (amine series) are discussed in terms of Linert's theory of the isokinetic relationship. The best ISoR correlation is obtained using the Dimroth-Reichardt E-T(N) solvent scale for the phosphine series and the Kamlet-Taft a(KT) solvent scale for the amine series. It is demonstrated that no real solvent can be envisaged as having the characteristics of an isokinetic solvent. The selectivity of the nucleophiles triethylphosphine and triethylamine in the attack on <b>iodoethane</b> is examined by treating together both reaction series in terms of the isoselective relationship (ISeR). The isoselective temperature with respect to solvent is found to be 289 K, which is close to the value of 302 K predicted by Exner and Giese's formula {{on the basis of the}} individual isokinetic temperatures. A novel ISeR analysis with respect to temperature is performed. It reveals that the a(KT) scale is the most appropriate solvent scale for describing this selectivity series, and that it is feasible to find an isoselective solvent. A new equation is developed for predicting the isoselective solvent parameter from individual isosolvent parameters and is shown to yield realistic values. The present similarity analysis shows that there are significant differences between the courses of these quaternisation reactions. On the basis of the experimentally determined isoparameter values, in liquid alcohols as solvent it is proposed that the reaction between triethylphosphine and <b>iodoethane</b> follows a classic bimolecular nucleophilic substitution pathway, whereas the desolvation of triethylamine molecules has to be taken into account to describe the mechanism of the original Menshutkin reaction...|$|E

For monohalogenated ethanes, acetaldehyde was the major organic product and little or none of any of the alternate predicted products (2 -halogenated alcohols) were detected. The maximum rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight from <b>iodoethane</b> to chloroethane (19 to 221 nmol/min per mg of protein). In addition, the amount of substrate required for the highest rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight.

We screened a number of GSTs from insecticide resistant mosquito species for their ability to catalyse iodoalkane biotransformation reactions. AaGSTE 2 was found to metabolise <b>iodoethane</b> with high turnover, which resulted in a dark blue colour in the enzymatic reaction. Following assay optimisation we exploited the high recognition affinity of the AgGSTE 2 for insecticides to develop a novel colorimetric detection assay for organochlorine and pyrethroid quantification. Calibration curves were obtained for permethim, deltamethrin. lambda-cyhalothrin and DDT, with useful concentration ranges of 0 - 40 mu g/ml (0 - 100 mu M), 0 - 50 mu g/ml (0 - 100 mu M), 0 - 100 mu g/ml (0 - 220 mu M), and 0 - 50 mu g/ml (0 - 140 mu M), respectively. The assay was validated with extracts from insecticide sprayed surfaces and found to be reproducible and reliable compared with HPLC. The assay is therefore suitable for monitoring insecticide residues in insecticide treated materials, and therefore has potential for insect vector control operations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Cyanine dyes are an {{interesting}} class of near infrared (NIR) dyes that have captured the in-terest of the scientific community. The NIR cyanine dye of interest, heptamethine cyanine dye NIR- 1, exhibits characteristics that satisfy the qualifications as an acceptor in a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensor [Wher, 1976]. Applications of FRET systems include structure determination and conformation of proteins [Hammer et al., 2002], receptor/ligand interactions [Hammer et al., 2002], and the cellular exposure to environmental toxins [Schwartz and Ulfelder, 1992]. This research stems from an interdepartmental collaboration to develop a NIR FRET bio-sensor, with significant advantages over the existing systems. A critical component of this endeavor {{is the development of}} an efficient environmentally conscious synthesis of novel NIR cyanine dyes utilizing microwave technology. Herein, we report the microwave synthesis of NIR- 1. 2, 3, 3 -Trimethyl- 1 -ethyl- 3 H-indolium iodide (I) synthesis is advantageous over the reported synthesis due to the significantly reduced reaction time of 450 s from 15 h and a decrease in the amount of <b>iodoethane</b> from 5 eq. to 3 eq.

The resonance Raman intensities and A-band absorption spectrum were simulated using a simple model and time-dependent wave packet calculations. The simulation results and normal mode descriptions were used to find the short-time photodissociation dynamics in terms of internal coordinate displacements. The A-band short-time photodissociation dynamics for trans- 1 -bromo- 2 -iodoethane show that the C-I, C-Br, and C-C bonds {{as well as the}} CCI, CCBr, HCC, ICH, and BrCH angles have significant changes during the initial stages of the photodissociation reaction. This indicates the photodissociation reaction has a large degree of multidimensional character and suggests that the bromoethyl photofragment receives substantial internal excitation in so far as the short-time photodissociation dynamics determines the energy partitioning. Comparison of our results for 1 -bromo- 2 -iodoethane with the A-band short-time dynamics of <b>iodoethane,</b> 1 -chloro- 2 -iodoethane, and 1, 2 -diiodoethane and the trends observed for their A-band absorption spectra suggest that both the C-I and C-Br bonds experience a noticeable amount of photoexcitation. © 1999 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a shipboard observation over the Chukchi Sea and the Canada Basin {{in the western}} Arctic Ocean in September and October 2012 to obtain vertical distributions of four volatile organic iodine compounds (VOIs) in seawater. The VOIs observed {{in this study were}} iodomethane (CH 3 I), <b>iodoethane</b> (C 2 H 5 I), diiodomethane (CH 2 I 2), and chloroiodomethane (CH 2 ClI). Maximum concentrations of the four VOIs were found in the bottom layer water over the Chukchi Sea shelf, in which layer the maximum concentration of ammonium (NH 4 +) also occurred. A significant correlation was observed between C 2 H 5 I and NH 4 + (correlation coefficient R [*]=[*] 0. 93, P  <  0. 01, n [*]=[*] 64) and between CH 3 I and NH 4 + (R =[*] 0. 77, P  <  0. 01, n [*]=[*]  64), suggesting that the production of these VOIs increased with the degradation of organic matter. Over the northern Chukchi Sea shelf–slope area, concentration maxima of CH I 2, CH 2 ClI, and CH 3 I were found in the subsurface cold, dense water (CDW). A large nitrogen deficit (N deficit [*]=[*] NH 4 + + NO 3 − + NO 2 − − 16 PO 4 3 −) occurred simultaneously in this water, suggesting the production of the three VOIs in the sediment or the bottom layer water over the shelf, probably in association with the degradation of organic matter. We conclude that VOI production over the Chukchi Sea shelf can be largely attributed to the degradation of organic matter that is produced in the highly productive shelf water. High concentrations of CH 2 ClI were also found in the Alaskan Coastal Water (ACW) from the Bering Strait {{to the surface of the}} northern Chukchi slope. The VOIs that originated at the Chukchi Sea shelf are expected to be laterally transported to the Arctic Ocean basin through the CDW and the surface ACW...|$|E
40|$|The Baltic Sea is {{a unique}} {{environment}} as the largest body of brackish water in the world. Acidification of the surface oceans due to absorption of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions is an additional stressor facing the pelagic community of the already challenging Baltic Sea. To investigate its impact on trace gas biogeochemistry, a large-scale mesocosm experiment was performed off Tvärminne Research Station, Finland in summer 2012. During {{the second half of}} the experiment, dimethylsulphide (DMS) concentrations in the highest fCO 2 mesocosms (1075 - 1333 µatm) were 34 % lower than at ambient CO 2 (350 µatm). However the net production (as measured by concentration change) of seven halocarbons analysed was not significantly affected by even the highest CO 2 levels after 5 weeks exposure. Methyl iodide (CH 3 I) and diiodomethane (CH 2 I 2) showed 15 % and 57 % increases in mean mesocosm concentration (3. 8 ± 0. 6 pmol L- 1 increasing to 4. 3 ± 0. 4 pmol L- 1 and 87. 4 ± 14. 9 pmol L- 1 increasing to 134. 4 ± 24. 1 pmol L- 1 respectively) during Phase II of the experiment, which were unrelated to CO 2 and corresponded to 30 % lower Chl-? concentrations compared to Phase I. No other iodocarbons increased or showed a peak, with mean chloroiodomethane (CH 2 ClI) concentrations measured at 5. 3 (± 0. 9) pmol L- 1 and <b>iodoethane</b> (C 2 H 5 I) at 0. 5 (± 0. 1) pmol L- 1. Of the concentrations of bromoform (CHBr 3; mean 88. 1 ± 13. 2 pmol L- 1), dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2; mean 5. 3 ± 0. 8 pmol L- 1) and dibromochloromethane (CHBr 2 Cl, mean 3. 0 ± 0. 5 pmol L- 1), only CH 2 Br 2 showed a decrease of 17 % between Phases I and II, with CHBr 3 and CHBr 2 Cl showing similar mean concentrations in both Phases. Outside the mesocosms, an upwelling event was responsible for bringing colder, high CO 2, low pH water to the surface starting on day t 16 of the experiment; this variable CO 2 system with frequent upwelling events implies the community of the Baltic Sea is acclimated to regular significant declines in pH caused by up to 800 µatm fCO 2. After this upwelling, DMS concentrations declined, but halocarbon concentrations remained similar or increased compared to measurements prior to the change in conditions. Based on our findings, with future acidification of Baltic Sea waters, biogenic halocarbon emissions are likely to remain at similar values to today, however emissions of biogenic sulphur could significantly decrease from this region...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes synthetic investigations {{aimed to}} expand the fundamental chemistry of thorium. Chapter 1 describes the radical reactivity of thorium-ligand bonds with the molecular radical 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidin- 1 -oxyl (TEMPO). Organothorium bonds {{are found to be}} very reactive with TEMPO and reveal previously unobserved reaction pathways for thorium. Chapter 2 discusses the isolation and characterization the first molecular complexes which contain thorium in the formal + 2 oxidation state: [K(2. 2. 2 -cryptand) ]{[C 5 H 3 (SiMe 3) 2] 3 Th} and [K(18 -crown- 6) (THF) 2]{[C 5 H 3 (SiMe 3) 2] 3 Th}. Physical, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies of these new Th 2 + ions conclude they the first examples of a [Rn] 6 d 2 electronic ground state in an isolable metal complex of any kind. The 6 d 2 configuration is what is expected for the radioactive fourth row transition metal ions such as Rf 2 + and Db 3 +. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the reactivity of the new Th 2 + complexes, with comparisons to the analogous Th 3 + compounds where appropriate. Substrates investigated include H 2, [Et 3 NH][BPh 4], cyclooctatetraene, iodomethane, <b>iodoethane,</b> benzyl bromide, chlorbenzene, fluoropentane, and benzyl isocyanide. Th 2 + is shown to affect both one- and two-electron reductions of substrates. The isolation of new Th 3 + complexes, including the first mixed-valent thorium complex and first hydride of Th 3 +, [K(18 -crown- 6) (Et 2 O) ]{[C 5 H 3 (SiMe 3) 2) 2 ThH 2]} 2, is described, as well as evidence for the in situ generation of a transient Th 2 + complex with the (C 5 Me 4 H) 33 − ligand set. Chapter 5 involves the synthesis and reactivity of the sterically-crowded Th 3 + complex (C 5 Me 5) 3 Th. Other sterically-crowded Th 4 + complexes are also isolated and their reactivity is reported. Substrates examined include iodomethane, diiodide, chlorobenzene, trimethylaluminum, dihydrogen, and carbon monoxide. Investigations with carbon monoxide {{led to the formation of}} [(C 5 Me 5) 3 Th(CO) ][BPh 4], the first room temperature stable carbonyl complex of thorium. Chapter 6 describes an initial investigation into the reactivity of the Th 3 + complexes (C 5 Me 4 H) 3 Th and [C 5 H 3 (SiMe 3) 2] 3 Th with nitric oxide (NO). Two structurally different bimetallic complexes are isolated, namely [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Th] 2 (μ-ONNO), and {[C 5 H 3 (SiMe 3) 2] 2 Th(μ-O) } 2. Chapter 7 describes the synthesis of the nitrile-solvated [(C 5 Me 5) 2 Th(NCR) 5][BPh 4] 2 (R = Me, Ph, tBu) complexes, which are the first examples of linear metallocenes of thorium containing cyclopentadienyl ligands. Chapter 8 presents preliminary results on other synthetic attempts to isolate low-valent thorium compounds. Evidence of transient low-valent species is described and factors leading to the instability are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Die bekannte Umwandlung des Bromtricycloheptans 4 in den Homoallylalkohol 76 durch Hydroborierung/Oxidation wurde anders als früher mit einer in situ aus Natriumborhydrid und elementarem Iod erzeugten Boran-THF-Lösung bewirkt. Darüber hinaus konnten unter den gleichen Bedingungen das Chlortricycloheptan 26 und das Methyltricycloheptan 62 in den Homoallylalkohol 108 bzw. 109 überführt werden. Über 4, 26, 62 und das Phenyltricycloheptan 15 hinaus, dessen Hydroborierung/ Oxidation zum Homoallylalkohol 45 a schon früher gelungen war, wurde eine Reihe von Bicyclo[1. 1. 0]butan-Derivaten mit Boran behandelt und das Gemisch dann oxidiert. Allerdings ergab sich in keinem Fall ein zu den Homoallylalkoholen 45 a, 76, 108 und 109 analoges Produkt. Über die Ursachen dieser Misserfolge kann gegenwärtig nur spekuliert werden. Immerhin fand sich bei 3, 4 -Benzotricyclo[4. 1. 0. 02, 7]heptan (83) ein Hinweis auf eine Oligomerenbildung des Substrats. Als Grund für die Anlagerung von Boran an 4, 15, 26 und 62 wird die Fähigkeit der Substituenten am Tricycloheptan-System, eine {{positive}} Ladung zu stabilisieren, gesehen. Durch die Umsetzung von Trideuteroboran mit 4 wurden bestimmte Reaktions-mechanismen ausgeschlossen, etwa der via das Umlagerungsprodukt 119 von 4 und Hydroborierung von 119, und der mit dem Zwitterion 120 gestützt, das durch 1, 2 -Deuteridverschiebung in das Cyclohexenylmethylboran 121 umlagern sollte, das als die Vorstufe des nach der Oxidation isolierten Produkts 87 angesprochen wird. Die Reaktionen von 4 und 15 mit 9 -Borabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan (9 -BBN), gefolgt von der Oxidation des Gemisches, lieferten je nach der Geschwindigkeit der Zugabe von 9 -BBN entweder die Dialkohole 122 bzw. 123, jeweils als Diastereomerengemische, oder/und die Homoallylalkohole 76 bzw. 45 a. Als Vorstufen der Verbindungen 122 und 123 werden Zwitterionen des Typs 124, Trialkylborane 125, Zwitterionen 127 und Trialkylborane 128 und 129 gesehen. Die Zwitterionen 124 sollten durch Addition von 9 -BBN an die Substrate 4 und 15 entstehen und durch Hydridwanderung in 125 übergehen, deren Anlagerung von 4 / 15 die Zwitterionen 126 und dann 127 hervorbringen sollte. Die 1, 2 -Wanderung eines Achtring-Kohlenstoffatoms müsste zu 128 und 129 führen, die durch Oxidation in 122 / 123 umgewandelt werden dürften. Das Dimesylat exo,exo- 142 wurde in einer mehrstufigen Synthese über den bekannten Dibromdialkohol 148 ausgehend von Benzvalen (82) synthetisiert. Die Alkoholfunktionen von 148 wurden mit Trimethylsilylchlorid geschützt unter Bildung des Bis(silylethers) 151. Aus 151 wurde durch Umsetzung mit tert-Butyllithium das Bicyclobutan exo,exo- 152 dargestellt. Nach Abspaltung der Schutzgruppen mit Kaliumcarbonat in Methanol wurde der Dialkohol exo,exo- 150 erhalten, welcher mit Methansulfonsäurechlorid zum Zielmolekül exo,exo- 142 reagierte. Die Reaktion einer 2 : 1 -Mischung aus exo,exo- 150 und 157 mit Natriumhydrid und Iodethan lieferte die Bis(ethylether) 160 und 161 in 38 % bzw. 19 % Ausbeute. In den Solvolyse-Reaktionen wurde ein 36 : 1 : 16 -Gemisch aus exo,exo- 142, endo,-endo- 142 und 159 eingesetzt. Bei der Reaktion des Gemischs in 60 % wässrigem Aceton in Gegenwart von Triethylamin bei 40 °C über fünf Tage zeigten die NMR-Spektren die Abnahme von exo,exo- 142 um 75 % (bezogen auf 159 als internen Standard), es konnte aber kein Produkt identifiziert werden. Die Ethanolyse bei 40 °C in Gegenwart von Triethylamin lieferte nach drei Tagen ein 3. 5 : 2. 8 : 1. 0 -Gemisch aus exo,exo- 142, 159 und 162. Die Verbindung 162 wurde mit 70 % Ausbeute (bezogen auf umgesetztes exo,exo- 142) gebildet. Die NMR-Spektren zeigten einen Umsatz von exo,exo- 142 von 30 % (bezogen auf 159 als internen Standard). Wurde die Reaktion unter den gleichen Bedingungen sieben Tage durchgeführt, verringerte sich der Anteil an exo,exo- 142 um 50 % und man erhielt eine 1 : 1 : 1 -Mischung aus exo,exo- 142, 159 und 162. Die Ausbeute von 162 lag bei 50 % (bezogen auf umgesetztes exo,exo- 142). Bei der Solvolyse in 2, 2, 2 -Trifluorethanol über drei Tage bei 40 °C in Gegenwart von Triethylamin erhielt man ein 3. 2 : 2. 0 : 1. 0 -Gemisch aus exo,exo- 142, 159 und 163. Anhand der NMR-Spektren wurde ein Umsatz von exo,exo- 142 von 20 % beobachtet (bezogen auf 159 als internen Standard). Die Solvolyse-Reaktionen des Dimesylats exo,exo- 142 verlaufen, anders als die seines Diastereomers endo,endo- 142, unter ausschließlicher Bildung von Produkten mit nicht umgelagertem Gerüst und liefern damit erstmals einen deutlichen Hinweis für die Existenz eines Bicyclo[1. 1. 0]but- 2 -exo-ylcarbinyl-Kations (166) als Intermediat. Es ist zu erwarten, dass 162 und 163 ihrerseits solvolysieren unter Bildung des Bis(ethylethers) 160 bzw. dessen Hexafluor-Derivates, aber diese Verbindungen sind unter den Solvolysebedingungen nicht stabil. Dies konnte in einem Kontrollexperiment bestätigt werden. The known {{transformation of}} bromotricycloheptane 4 into the homoallylalcohol 76 by hydroboration/oxidation was performed different {{to the earlier}} procedure by using in the first step a THF solution of borane generated in situ from sodiumborohydride and elemental iodine. Furthermore chlorotricycloheptane 26 and methyltricycloheptane 62 could be transformed into the homoallylalcohol 108 and 109, respectively, by using the same reaction conditions. Beside 4, 26, 62 and phenyltricycloheptane 15, which hydroboration/oxidation to homoallylalcohol 45 a succeeded earlier, a variety of bicyclo[1. 1. 0]butane derivatives was treated with borane and then the mixture was oxidized. But no reaction resulted in a product analogous to the homoallylalcohols 45 a, 76, 108 and 109. About {{the reason for the}} failure of these reactions at this time only can be speculated. However, in the case of 3, 4 -benzotricyclo[4. 1. 0. 02, 7]heptane (83) evidence was given for formation of oligomers from the substrate. The ability to stabilize a positive charge of the substituents at the tricycloheptane system is to be considered as a reason for the addition of borane to 4, 15, 26 and 62. Based on the transformation of 4 with trideuteroborane certain reaction mechanisms, for example that via the rearrangement product 119 of 4 and hydroboration of 119, were excluded and that with the zwitterion 120 was supported. 120 should rearrange through a 1, 2 -shift of deuteride into cyclohexenylmethylborane 121 which is seen as a precursor in the oxidation reaction to the isolated product 87. The reactions of 4 and 15 with 9 -borabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane (9 -BBN) followed by oxidation of the mixture generated depending on the addition rate of 9 -BBN to the substrate the dialcohols 122 and 123, respectively, in both cases as a diastereomeric mixture and/or the homoallylalcohol 76 and 45 a, respectively. Zwitterions 124, trialkylboranes 125, zwitterions 127 and trialkylboranes 128 and 129 are considered as precursors for the compounds 122 and 123. The zwitterions 124 should be formed by addition of 9 -BBN to the substrates 4 and 15 and should be transformed by hydride shift into 125 which should give rise to zwitterions 126 and then 127 after addition of 4 / 15. 1, 2 -Shift of a carbon atom of the eight-membered ring should lead to 128 and 129 which should be transformed into 122 / 123 by oxidation. Dimesylate exo,exo- 142 was obtained in a more step reaction via the known dibromodialcohol 148 starting from benzvalene (82). The alcohol groups of 148 were protected with trimethylsilyl chloride by formation of the bis(silyl ether) 151. Bicyclo-butane exo,exo- 152 was obtained from 151 by reaction with tert-butyllithium. After removing the protecting groups with potassium carbonate in methanol the dialcohol exo,exo- 150 was formed. This alcohol reacted with methanesulfonyl chloride to the target molecule exo,exo- 142. The reaction of a 2 : 1 mixture of exo,exo- 150 and 157 with sodium hydride and <b>iodoethane</b> generated the bis(silyl ethers) 160 and 161 in 38 % and 19 % yield, respectively. For the solvolyses reactions a 36 : 1 : 16 mixture of exo,exo- 142, endo,endo- 142 and 159 was used. After reacting the mixture in 60 % acetone/water in the presence of triethylamine at 40 °C during five days the NMR spectra showed a decrease of exo,exo- 142 by 75 % (determined by using 159 as internal standard) while no product could be identified. The ethanolysis at 40 °C during three days in the presence of triethylamine produced a 3. 5 : 2. 8 : 1. 0 mixture of exo,exo- 142, 159 and 162. The compound 162 was formed with 70 % yield (based on exo,exo- 142 consumed). The NMR spectra showed that the proportion of exo,exo- 142 had decreased by 30 % (determined by using 159 as internal standard). After seven days using the same reaction conditions the proportion of exo,exo- 142 decreased by 50 % (determined by using 159 as internal standard) and a 1 : 1 : 1 mixture of exo,exo- 142, 159 and 162 was obtained. 162 was formed with 50 % yield (based on exo,exo- 142 consumed). Solvolysis in 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol at 40 °C during three days in the presence of triethylamine produced a 3. 2 : 2. 0 : 1. 0 mixture of exo,exo- 142, 159 und 163. In the NMR spectra a decrease of exo,exo- 142 by 20 % was observed (determined by using 159 as internal standard). The solvolyses reactions of the dimesylate exo,exo- 142 proceed, in contrast to those of its diastereomer endo,endo- 142, solely with formation of unrearranged products and therefore they offer for the first time strong evidence for the intermediacy of a bicyclo[1. 1. 0]-but- 2 -exo-ylcarbinyl cation (166). It should be expected that the compounds 162 and 163 solvolyses on their part to give the bis(ethyl ether) 160 and its hexafluoro-derivative, respectively, but these compounds are not stable under the solvolyses conditions. This was proved by a control experiment...|$|E
