5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} {{a contract to}} void the contract with a payment of only 3.5 percent of the contract price (or about 1/30 the contract). Thus, investors bought increasingly expensive contracts. A speculator could sign a contract to purchase a tulip for 100 guilders. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> rose above 100 guilders, the speculator would pocket the difference as profit. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> remained low, the speculator could void the contract for only 3½ guilders. Thus, a contract nominally for 100 guilders, would actually cost an investor no more than 3½ guilders. In early February, as contract prices reached a peak, Dutch authorities stepped in and halted the trading of these contracts.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E
5|$|Google is a {{computer}} software and a web search engine company that has been acquiring, on average, more than one company per week in 2010 and 2011. The table below is an incomplete list of acquisitions, with each acquisition listed being for the respective company in its entirety, unless otherwise specified. The acquisition date listed is {{the date of the}} agreement between Google and the acquisition subject. As Google is headquartered in the United States, acquisition is listed in US dollars. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of an acquisition is unlisted, then it is undisclosed. If the Google service that is derived from the acquired company is known, then it is also listed here. Google itself was re-organized into a subsidiary of a larger holding company known as Alphabet Inc. in 2015.|$|E

50|$|Combined {{with price}} instructions, this gives market on close (MOC), market on open (MOO), limit on close (LOC), and limit on open (LOO). For example, a market-on-open order is {{guaranteed}} to get <b>the</b> open <b>price,</b> whatever that may be. A buy limit-on-open order is filled <b>if</b> <b>the</b> open <b>price</b> is lower, not filled <b>if</b> <b>the</b> open <b>price</b> is higher, and {{may or may not}} be filled <b>if</b> <b>the</b> open <b>price</b> is <b>the</b> same.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>price</b> index {{should not}} change <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> in both periods are {{increased}} {{by a factor}} and the quantities in both periods are increased by another factor. In other words, {{the magnitude of the}} values of quantities and prices should not affect <b>the</b> <b>price</b> index.|$|R
5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E
25|$|If these curves are plotted {{for many}} {{different}} prices of good Y, a demand curve for good Y can be constructed. The diagram below shows the demand curve for good Y as its price varies.

5000|$|Another {{shortcoming}} of mark-to-model is {{that even}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> models are accurate during typical market conditions there can be periods of market stress and illiquidity where <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of less liquid securities declines significantly, for instance through the widening of their bid-ask spread.|$|R
50|$|Ehrlich and {{his colleagues}} picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price increases: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then, on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> on September 29, 1980, as an index. They {{designated}} September 29, 1990, 10 years hence, as <b>the</b> payoff date. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> inflation-adjusted <b>prices</b> of <b>the</b> various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich <b>the</b> combined difference. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> fell, Ehrlich et al. would pay Simon.|$|R
25|$|Relative {{changes in}} output goods prices drive the {{relative}} {{prices of the}} factors used to produce them. If the world price of capital-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative rental rate and decreases the relative wage rate (the return on capital as against the return to labor). Also, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of labor-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative wage rate and decreases the relative rental rate.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{short selling}} (also known as {{shorting}} or going short) is {{the practice of}} selling securities or other financial instruments that are not currently owned (usually borrowed), and subsequently repurchasing them ("covering"). In {{the event of an}} interim price decline, the short seller profits, since the cost of (re)purchase is less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short position closes out at a loss <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.|$|E
25|$|Skyscrapers {{are usually}} {{situated}} in city centers where {{the price of}} land is high. Constructing a skyscraper becomes justified <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of land is so high that it makes economic sense to build upwards as to minimize {{the cost of the}} land per the total floor area of a building. Thus the construction of skyscrapers is dictated by economics and results in skyscrapers in a certain part of a large city unless a building code restricts the height of buildings.|$|E

50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> sale <b>price</b> {{is higher}} than <b>the</b> market-clearing <b>price,</b> then supply will exceed demand, and a surplus {{inventory}} will build up over <b>the</b> long run. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> sale <b>price</b> is lower than <b>the</b> market-clearing <b>price,</b> then demand will exceed supply, {{and in the long}} run shortages will result, where buyers sometimes find no products for sale at any price.|$|R
25|$|Contracts are {{negotiated}} at futures exchanges, which act as {{a marketplace}} between buyers and sellers. The buyer of a contract {{is said to be}} long position holder, and the selling party is said to be short position holder. As both parties risk their counter-party walking away <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> goes against them, the contract may involve both parties lodging a margin {{of the value of the}} contract with a mutually trusted third party. For example, in gold futures trading, the margin varies between 2% and 20% depending on the volatility of the spot market.|$|E
25|$|Hennepin County {{claimed that}} {{accepting}} the price set by an eminent domain judge {{was not an}} option for them, due to the infrastructure cap. Any additional money needed for the land would have to come out of some other piece of infrastructure. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> set by a judge came in over their budget, they would have no funds to pay, and the project could collapse. But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.|$|E
25|$|In {{relation}} to American depositary receipts (ADRs), a local custodian bank (also {{known as a}} sub-custodian or agent bank) is a bank in a country outside the United States that holds the corresponding number of shares of stock trading on the home stock market represented by an ADR trading in the USA, with each multiple representing some multiple of the underlying foreign share. This multiple allows the ADRs to possess a price per share conventional for the US market (typically between $20 and $50 per share) even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the foreign share is unconventional when converted to US dollars directly. This bank acts as custodian bank for the company that issues the ADRs in the US stock.|$|E

25|$|The {{holder of}} an American style call option can sell his option holding {{at any time}} until the {{expiration}} date, and would consider doing so when <b>the</b> stock's spot <b>price</b> is above <b>the</b> exercise <b>price,</b> especially <b>if</b> he expects <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> option to drop. By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can realise an immediate profit. Alternatively, he can exercise the option — for example, {{if there is no}} secondary market for the options — and then sell the stock, realising a profit. A trader would make a profit <b>if</b> <b>the</b> spot <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> shares rises by more than the premium. For example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> exercise <b>price</b> is 100 and premium paid is 10, then <b>if</b> <b>the</b> spot <b>price</b> of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} was the price of coffee, Colombia's largest export and {{the main source of}} its foreign exchange. The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) attempted to have the maximum price of coffee frozen at the level existing on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, Colombia objected on the basis that the cost of producing and transporting coffee had increased due to wartime conditions, and, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> was not adjusted to factor in these conditions, the economy would decline. The OPA relented, and agreed to raise prices immediately and to adjust them in the future based on increased production and transportation costs.|$|E
25|$|In November 1937, Ribbentrop {{was placed}} in a highly {{embarrassing}} situation, when his forceful advocacy of the return of the former German colonies led the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos to offer to open talks on returning the former German colonies, in return for which the Germans would make binding commitments to respect their borders in central and eastern Europe. Since Hitler was not interested in obtaining the former colonies, especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> was a brake on expansion into eastern Europe, Ribbentrop was forced to turn down the Anglo-French offer that he had largely brought about. Immediately after turning down the Anglo-French offer on colonial restoration, Ribbentrop, for reasons of pure malice, ordered the Reichskolonialbund to increase the agitation for the former German colonies, a move that exasperated both the Foreign Office and the Quai d'Orsay.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide area}} {{fronting}} St Martin's Church formed the marketplace. The Street Commissioners {{decided that a}} sheltered market hall was needed. They bought the market rights from {{the lord of the}} manor and, by 1832, all properties on site had been purchased, with exception of two, whose owners demanded a higher price. To fund the purchase of these properties, two buildings were constructed either side of the market hall and the leases sold at auction. Construction of the Market Hall, designed by Charles Edge (an architect of Birmingham Town Hall), began in February 1833. It was completed by Dewsbury and Walthews at a cost of £20,000 (£44,800 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of acquiring the land is included) and opened on 12 February 1835 and contained 600 market stalls. The building was grand and the façade consisted of stone mined from Bath, Somerset. Two grand Doric columns supported both wide entrances. At the end of the market day, metal gates were pulled in front of the entrances.|$|E

500|$|PEDs, in {{combination}} with price elasticity of supply (PES), {{can be used to}} assess where the incidence (or [...] "burden") of a per-unit tax is falling or to predict where it will fall if the tax is imposed. For example, when demand is perfectly inelastic, by definition consumers have no alternative to purchasing the good or service <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> increases, so the quantity demanded would remain constant. [...] Hence, suppliers can increase the price by the full amount of the tax, and the consumer would end up paying the entirety. In the opposite case, when demand is perfectly elastic, by definition consumers have an infinite ability to switch to alternatives <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> increases, so they would stop buying the good or service in question completely—quantity demanded would fall to zero. [...] As a result, firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices, so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves.|$|E
500|$|Non-stochastic {{mathematical}} models may be purely qualitative (for example, models {{involved in}} some aspect of social choice theory) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with hyperbolic coordinates, and/or specific forms of functional relationships between variables). [...] In some cases economic predictions of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only in a qualitative sense: for example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of an item increases, then the demand for that item will decrease. [...] For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.|$|E
5000|$|Intrinsic value: This {{is simply}} the {{difference}} between <b>the</b> exercise (strike) <b>price</b> and <b>the</b> underlying stock <b>price.</b> Warrants are {{also referred to as}} in-the-money or out-of-the-money, depending on where <b>the</b> current asset <b>price</b> is in relation to <b>the</b> warrant's exercise <b>price.</b> Thus, for instance, for call warrants, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>price</b> is below <b>the</b> strike <b>price,</b> <b>the</b> warrant has no intrinsic value (only time value—to be explained shortly). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>price</b> is above <b>the</b> strike, the warrant has intrinsic value and is said to be in-the-money.|$|R
