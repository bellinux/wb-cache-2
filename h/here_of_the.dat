Mason formed a partnership with David Ross (1827–1908) a Scottish-born Fellow of the Institute of British Architects who was already resident.

Of numerous small commissions the Dunedin Public Warehouse, for William Dalrymple, now 386 Princes Street, is a more substantial example. A three story building in brick it has a vigorously modelled street front with emphatic quoining used to define the edges and apertures of the facade. Those around the windows rise to form round-topped columns.

25|$|What {{served to}} launch Beuys {{into the public}} {{consciousness}} was that which transpired following his performance at the Technical College Aachen in 1964. As part of a festival of new art coinciding with the 20th anniversary of an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, Beuys created a performance or Aktion. The performance {{was interrupted by a}} group of students, one of whom attacked Beuys, punching him in the face. A photograph of the artist, nose bloodied and arm raised, was circulated in the media. It was for this 1964 festival that Beuys produced an idiosyncratic CV, which he titled Lebenslauf/Werklauf (Life Course/Work Course). The document was a self-consciously fictionalised account of the artist's life, in which historical events mingle with metaphorical and mythical speech (he refers to his birth as the ‘Exhibition of a wound;’ he claims his Ulysses Extension to have been carried out ‘at James Joyce's request’ – impossible, given that the writer was, by 1961, long dead). This document marks a blurring of fact and fiction that was to be characteristic of Beuys' self-created persona, as well as the source of much controversy (although, significantly, there is no mention <b>here</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous plane crash).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, as {{expected}} Janus {{is present in}} region I of Martianus Capella's division of Heaven and in region XVI, the last one, {{are to be found}} the Ianitores terrestres (along with Nocturnus), perhaps to be identified in Forculus, Limentinus and Cardea, deities strictly related to Janus as his auxiliaries (or perhaps even no more than concrete subdivisions of his functions) as the meaning of their names implies: Forculus is the god of the forca, a iugum, low passage, Limentinus the guardian of the limes, boundary, Cardea the goddess of hinges, <b>here</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gates separating Earth and Heaven. The problem posed by the qualifying adjective terrestres earthly, can be addressed in two different ways. One hypothesis is that Martianus's depiction implies a descent from Heaven onto Earth. However Martianus's depiction does not look to be confined to a division Heaven-Earth as it includes the Underworld and other obscure regions or remote recesses of Heaven. Thence one may argue that the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the theologem of the Gates of Heaven (the Synplegades) which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.|$|E

Because farming was still the predominant industry, Harrisburg did not develop in the arts, music, and science as did Philadelphia. In 1860, Harrisburg was chartered as a city.|$|E

If asked where she lived, she reflected, must not she {{be able to answer}} with Christ, [...] "The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to rest my head." [...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question <b>here</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine."

2500|$|The {{criticism}} of writing in Plato's dialogues (German: Schriftkritik). Many dialogues accepted as authentic are {{skeptical about the}} written word as a medium for transferring knowledge and express a preference for oral transmission. Plato's Phaedrus explains this position in detail. [...] There the superiority of oral over written teaching for transmitting philosophy {{is grounded in the}} far greater flexibility of oral discourse, which is held to be a decisive advantage. [...] Authors of texts cannot adapt to the level of knowledge and the needs of individual readers. Moreover, they cannot answer readers' questions and criticisms. These are only possible in conversation, which is alive and psychologically responsive. Written texts are mere images of speech. Writing and reading are thought not only to lead to a weakening of our minds, but also to be unsuited for communicating wisdom, which can only succeed in oral instruction. [...] Written words are useful only as reminders for those who already know something but may have forgotten it. Literary activity is therefore portrayed as mere play. Personal discussions with students are essential and may permit words in various individualized ways to be inscribed in the soul. Only those who can teach in this way, the Phaedrus continues, can be considered true philosophers. In contrast, those authors who have nothing 'more precious' (Gk., [...] timiōtera) than a written text, which they have long polished, are only authors or writers but not yet philosophers. The meaning <b>here</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek for 'more precious' is debated but is thought to point toward the unwritten doctrines.|$|E
2500|$|Gyarmati {{shows that}} his {{definition}} of [...] "the heat flow vector" [...] is strictly speaking a definition of flow of internal energy, not specifically of heat, and so {{it turns out that}} his use <b>here</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word heat is contrary to the strict thermodynamic definition of heat, though it is more or less compatible with historical custom, that often enough did not clearly distinguish between heat and internal energy; he writes [...] "that this relation must be considered to be the exact definition of the concept of heat flow, fairly loosely used in experimental physics and heat technics." [...] Apparently in a different frame of thinking from that of the above-mentioned paradoxical usage in the earlier sections of the historic 1947 work by Prigogine, about discrete systems, this usage of Gyarmati is consistent with the later sections of the same 1947 work by Prigogine, about continuous-flow systems, which use the term [...] "heat flux" [...] in just this way. This usage is also followed by Glansdorff and Prigogine in their 1971 text about continuous-flow systems. They write: [...] "Again the flow of internal energy may be split into a convection flow [...] and a conduction flow. This conduction flow is by definition the heat flow [...] Therefore: [...] where [...] denotes the [...] energy per unit mass. [...] " [...] This usage is followed also by other writers on non-equilibrium thermodynamics such as Lebon, Jou, and Casas-Vásquez, and de Groot and Mazur. This usage is described by Bailyn as stating the non-convective flow of internal energy, and is listed as his definition number 1, according to the first law of thermodynamics. This usage is also followed by workers in the kinetic theory of gases. This is not the ad hoc definition of [...] "reduced heat flux" [...] of Haase.|$|E
