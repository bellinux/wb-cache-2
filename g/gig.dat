50|$|Eucha Lake, {{named for}} the town, is noted for its lake which has the Delaware County <b>Gigging</b> Tournament every year in April. <b>Gigging</b> is an old-fashioned method of fishing that {{utilizes}} <b>gigs,</b> a long pole that has been tipped with a multi-pronged spear. Fishermen use these trident-like <b>gigs</b> to spear fish while on flat boats. The use of <b>gigging</b> spears reflects the area's Cherokee heritage and keeps the fishing tradition alive. The average household income for a Eucha family is $30,268.|$|R
5|$|However, the PlayStation 2 version {{does not}} include this {{challenge}} feature.

Phil Collen, later to play in Def Leppard, was in the audience for the Rainbow <b>gig</b> as captured on the sleeve.|$|E
5000|$|I don't really tour. This {{is another}} misconception. I stopped touring {{in the true}} {{sense of the word}} in the late 1970s, early 1980s, possibly. I just do <b>gigs</b> now. I average two <b>gigs</b> a week. Only in America do I do more, because you can't really do a couple of <b>gigs</b> there, so I do more, 10 <b>gigs</b> or {{something}} there.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} Global Index Grammars (<b>GIGs),</b> a grammar formalism {{that uses}} a stack of indices associated with productions and has restricted context-sensitive power.

5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the <b>gig.</b> Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator <b>gig</b> manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the gradual}} estrangement of Brian Jones and his {{decreasing}} musical contributions – {{he had only}} appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed — made a return to touring problematic. They had shelved The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after having been upstaged by The Who. By June 1969, matters had finally come to a head and {{it was decided that}} Jones should be replaced for the <b>gig.</b>|$|E

50|$|In recent years, the {{resurgence}} {{in the tradition}} of boatbuilding in Essex has seen the development of East Coast <b>gigs.</b> Built by the Pioneer Sailing Trust in Brightlingsea, the coxed four Harker's Yard <b>gigs</b> are based on a 19th-century design. A strong racing scene has developed around these <b>gigs</b> and club affiliation extends from Manningtree, on the Essex/Suffolk border, to Maldon, in the South of the county. The <b>gigs</b> are traditionally named after fishing smacks built in Brightlingsea before WWII. The first boat to be built, the Velocity, is owned and raced by Brightlingsea Coastal Rowing Club.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} nature of building blocks of galaxies in the early universe, we investigate "genuine irregular galaxies (<b>GIGs)</b> " in the nearby universe. Here, <b>GIGs</b> are defined as isolated galaxies without regular structures (spheroid, bulge, disk, bar, spiral arm, and nucleus). Using the results of two excellent studies on galaxy morphology based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we obtain a sample of 66 irregular galaxies. We carry out new classification of them into <b>GIGs</b> and non-GIGs which have regular structure or show evidence for galaxy interaction, by using the SDSS Data Release 10 images. We then find that a half of these irregular galaxies (33 / 66) are <b>GIGs</b> and obtain an unambiguous sample of 33 <b>GIGs</b> for the first time. We discuss their observational properties by comparing them with those of elliptical, S 0, spiral galaxies, and irregular galaxies without the <b>GIGs.</b> We find that our <b>GIGs</b> have smaller sizes, lower optical luminosities, bluer rest-frame optical colors, lower surface stellar mass densities, and lower gas metallicity than normal galaxies. All these properties suggest {{that they are in}} chemically and dynamically younger phases even in the nearby universe. Comment: submitted to the Astrophysical Journal on 21 st October, 201...|$|R
