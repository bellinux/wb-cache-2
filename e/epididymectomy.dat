5000|$|Household {{remedies}} such as {{elevation of}} the scrotum and cold compresses applied regularly to the scrotum may relieve the pain in acute cases. Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs are often used for treatment of both chronic and acute forms. Hospitalisation is indicated for severe cases, and check-ups can ensure the infection has cleared up. Surgical removal of the epididymis is rarely necessary, causes sterility, and only gives relief from pain in approximately 50% of cases. [...] However, in acute suppurating epididymitis (acute epididymitis with a discharge of pus), a epididymotomy may be recommended; in refractory cases, a full <b>epididymectomy</b> may be required.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{modifications}} in lipid profile, blood glucose and pressure, and morphological {{aspects of the}} adrenal gland in animals with hypogonadism secondary to total bilateral <b>epididymectomy</b> and orchiectomy. Methods: Young and adult male Wistar rats were distributed into the following groups: Group 1 – control, animals submitted only to scrotal incision and suture. Group 2 – animals submitted to total bilateral <b>epididymectomy</b> and orchiectomy. After these operations, {{studies were carried out}} to analyze possible repercussions of hypogonadism. In Study A, serum levels of free testosterone were measured, along with the body weight and cortical thickness of the adrenal gland of 30 adult rats. In Study B, serum values of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HDL, LDL and VLDL fractions were measured in 20 young rats and 10 adult rats. In Study C, pressure of the caudal artery was measured by plethysmography in 24 adult animals. Rresults: Total bilateral <b>epididymectomy</b> and orchiectomy reduced serum levels of testosterone regardless of the age of the animal, and apparently does not modify macro- or microscopically the morphology of the adrenal gland. Hypogonadism secondary to total bilateral <b>epididymectomy</b> and orchiectomy did not modify the serum values of glucose, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL fractions. However, orchiectomy reduced the blood levels of triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol when performed in young rats. Testosterone deficiency was related to smaller weight gain and increased arterial pressure. Cconclusions: Castration reduces blood levels of triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol in young rats. In adult animals, it increases arterial pressure and is related to smaller weight gain...|$|E

40|$|Introduction	 Orchialgia is an {{uncommon}} pain syndrome of the scrotum, nonetheless complicated to treat. When all conservative methods have failed, one can consider invasive treatments as vasovasostomy, <b>epididymectomy,</b> inguinal hemicastration or microsurgical denervation of the spermatic cord. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate I: the effectiveness the aforementioned modalities and II: a possible relationship with the preoperatively performed scrotal ultrasound and the results of the histopathological investigations. Methods 	 16 patients who were operated because of orchialgia between 2000 and 2010 in our university hospital were included. We recorded age, affected side, previous scrotal surgery, ultrasound findings and the results of the histopathological examinations. Patients were interviewed by telephone survey whether their pain had resolved, improved or persevered. If we could not contact by phone, the data from the files were used. Results	Fourteen out of sixteen patients could be reached by telephone. The average age at the time of surgery was 44 years (range 21 to 77). Mean follow-up was 55 months (range 1 - 135). Eight out of the sixteen patients had an epididymectomy; five (63 %) had a subsequent inguinal hemicastration. Over all eleven men had an inguinal hemicastration; two out of sixteen men had a vasovastomy. Of the eight men that underwent an epididymectomie, six (75 %) had persisting pain while the remaining two (25 %) experienced some improvement. Eight out of the eleven men (73 %) who underwent inguinal hemicastration experienced complete relief of pain, one (9 %) experienced some improvement and two (18 %) had enduring pain. After their vasovasostomy, both men had complete pain relief. Conclusion	Inguinal hemicastration following unsuccessful conservative treatments in patients with orchialgia gives good results in three quarters of the cases. The same holds for vasovasostomy in patients with the post vasectomy pain syndrome. <b>Epididymectomy,</b> however, gives poor results. ...|$|E

40|$|The use of Judas goats {{to locate}} remnant animals is a {{potentially}} {{powerful tool for}} enhancing goat-eradication efforts, which are especially important to island conservation. However, current Judas goat methodology falls short of its potential efficacy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{recommendations}} regarding posthumous sperm retrieval (PSR) {{are based}} on a small number of cases. Our purpose was to determine the time interval from death to a successful procedure. METHODS: Seventeen consecutive PSR procedures in 14 deceased and 3 neurologically brain-dead patients at two male infertility centres [Sheba Medical Center (SMC), Tel-Hashomer, Israel and University of California San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, CA, USA] were analysed. Main outcome measures were retrieval of vital sperm, pregnancies and births. RESULTS: PSR methods included resection of testis and epididymis (n = 8), en-block excision of testis, epidi-dymis and proximal vas deferens with vasal irrigation (n = 6), electroejaculation (EEJ) (n = 2) and <b>epididymectomy</b> (n = 1). PSR was performed 7. 5 – 36 h after death. Sperm was retrieved in all cases and was motile in 14 cases.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic orchialgia is {{historically}} and currently a challenging disease to treat. It is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for physicians. Conservative therapy {{has served as}} the first line of treatment. For those who fail conservative therapy, surgical intervention may be required. We aim to provide a review of currently available surgical options and novel surgical treatment options. Methods: A review of current literature was performed using PubMed. Literature discussing treatment options for chronic orchialgia were identified. The following search terms were used to identify literature that was relevant to this review: Chronic orchialgia, testicular pain, scrotal content pain, and microsurgical denervation of the spermatic cord (MDSC). Results: The incidence of chronic orchialgia has been increasing over time. In the USA, it affects up to 100, 000 men per year due to varying etiologies. The etiology of chronic orchialgia can be a confounding problem. Conservative therapy should be viewed as the first line therapy. Studies have reported poor success rates. Current surgical options for those who fail conservative options include varicocelectomy, MDSC, <b>epididymectomy,</b> and orchiectomy. Novel treatment options include microcryoablation of the peri-spermatic cord, botox injection, and amniofix injection. Conclusion: Chronic orchialgia has been {{and will continue to be}} a challenging disease to treat due to its multiple etiologies and variable treatment outcomes. Further studies are needed to better understand the problem. Treatment options for patients with chronic orchialgia are improving. Additional studies are warranted to better understand the long-term durability of this treatment options...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the clinical characteristics and treatments of patients with genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) over the past 10 years. Materials and Methods: The study population comprised 101 patients who were diagnosed with GUTB and hospitalized from January 2000 to December 2009. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, urine tuberculosis culture, urine tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR), intravenous urography, cystoscopy, and histopathologic findings were used for patient selection. Yearly proportion, gender, patient distribution according to age, history of tuberculosis, and presence of other organ tuberculosis were analyzed. Results: The patients hospitalized with GUTB counted for 0. 9 % of all patients admitted to the department of urology. The sex ratio was 1 : 1. 53 (male:female), and the patients’ mean age was 45. 57 ± 12. 55 years (range, 19 - 81 years). Among the patients, there was one immunocompromised patient. A total of 22 patients (21. 8 %) had a medical history of tuberculosis, mostly pulmonary tuberculosis (90. 9 %). The sensitivity of AFB stain, tuberculosis culture, and PCR was 41. 6 %, 55. 4 %, 33. 7 %, respectively. A total of 54 patients required additional surgical treatment: 30 cases of nephrectomy, 8 cases of <b>epididymectomy,</b> 8 cases of ureteral stent, 5 cases of nephrostomy, 1 case of ureterectomy, 1 case of augmentation cystoplasty, and 1 case of transurethral resection of prostate. Conclusions: The frequency of GUTB tended to decrease progressively. However, GUTB is still a threat to public health. There was no previous history of tuberculosis in two-thirds of the cases of GUTB {{and more than half of}} them required further surgical treatment.

40|$|Background: Tuberculous {{epididymitis}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of chronic epididymal lesions. It is difficult to diagnose in the absence of renal involvement. Aim : To profile isolated tuberculous epididymitis and to assess our approach in the evaluation of this group of patients. Setting and Design : Retrospective study done at Christian Medical College, Vellore, South India. Methods and Materials : Between 1992 and 2002, 156 fine needle aspiration cytology specimens and 108 epididymal biopsies were carried out in 187 men for evaluation of chronic epididymal nodules. Isolated epididymal tuberculosis was defined as "tuberculous infection affecting the epididymis without evidence of renal involvement as documented by the absence of acid fast bacilli in the urine sample and on imaging". The age, laterality, mode of presentation and method of histological diagnosis were studied with the objective of profiling isolated tuberculous epididymitis. Results : Fifty-four of the 187 men (median age 32 years; interquartile range: 21 - 37 years) had tuberculous epididymitis. Fourteen were excluded from the analysis (10 had associated urinary tract tuberculosis and 4 were lost to follow-up). None of the 40 men with isolated tuberculous epididymitis had urinary symptoms. Bilateral involvement was seen in five (12. 5 &#x 0025;) cases. The salient presenting features included painful swelling (16 subjects, 40 &#x 0025;), scrotal sinus (4, 20 &#x 0025;) and acute epididymitis (2, 10 &#x 0025;). Past history or concomitant presence of tuberculosis was noted in three subjects each. Anti TB treatment resulted in a complete response in 10 and partial response in 18.

40|$|Summary The {{amount of}} 17 -KS {{excreted}} into the urine was clinically investigated on the patients with various urogenital diseases. (1) Diseases on the kidney and ureter Most {{of these cases}} presented the normal 17 -KS excretion into the uine, and any specificity has not been recognized on each disease. The average value of 17 -KS in the urine, however, was highest in the neoplastic diseases, and next came the tuberculous diseases and the stone diseases in order. In generally, {{it seems that the}} severe cases presented a lower level within the normal limit. On the patients who recieved nephrectomy and well recovered, their 17 -KS excretion into the urine was higher at the time of two weeks after the operation than before the operation. Precisely speaking, it increased on the first day after the operation, and then gradually decreased. And it increased again up to the preoperative level two weeks after the operation. (2) Diseases on the bladder Most of these also presented the normal 17 -KS excretion into the urine, but it was obviously low in the severe cases. The change of 17 -KS level in the urine before and after the total cystectomy was analogous to the cases nephrectomy was done. (3) Diseases on, the prostate gland On the patients with prosta tic hypertrophy and prostatic cancer, the average 17 -KS value in the urine was normal. The patients with hypertrophy excreted much more 17 -KS into the urine than that of prostatic cancer. In most of the patients whose 17 -KS excretion were over or under the normal limit, their renal function was disturbed on PSP test. In most of the cases with hypertrophy the prostatectomy accompanied by hormonal therapy caused no influence upon 17 -KS level in the urine. On the other hand, the increased 17 -KS excretion into the u rine was observed on the patients whose general condition and renal function greatly improved after the treatment, In the cases of prostatic cancer, 17 -KS level in the urine presented no change after the treatment. Generally speaking, an estrogen therapy caused decrease or no change, an androgen therapy caused increase, an surgical procedure upon the prostate gland caused a temporary decrease followed by recovering up to the preoperative level. (4) Other urogenital diseases No peculiar finding was observed in each disease. Bilateral <b>epididymectomy</b> caused a temporary decrease of 17 -KS in the urine. Bilateral orchiectomy caused a more remarkable decrease of 17 -KS in the urine and it more delayed to recover up to the preoperative level by bilateral orchiectomy than by unilateral orchiectomy. (5) Sexual dysfunction 17 -KS in the urine of the patients with this disease was under the normal limit or lower within the normal limit even at highest. In almost all of the cases which were administrated gonadotropic and androgenic hormones, 17 -KS excretion into the urine gradually increased with simultaneous improvement of their clinical symptoms. And it seems that the treatment with androgenic hormone for male infertility promoted their spermatogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{results were}} obtained by measuring the levels of serum sodium, potassium, and calcium in the preoperative period and at 24 hours, 48 hours, 5 th, 8 th, and 14 th days in the postoperative period in order to evaluate the effects of surgical operations and excision of the ill site on 103 surgical cases. 1. Effects of surgical operations on t h e levels of serum sodium, potassium, and calcium The serum electrolytes levels were measured by the flame photometer in the pr e o perative period and at 24 hours, 48 hours, 5 th, 8 th, and 14 th days in the postoperative period on nephrectomy (20 cases), renopexy (2 cases), nephrolithotomy (5 cases), pyeloureterolithotomy (10 cases), total cystectomy (10 cases), total prostatectomy (7 cases), meatotomy (2 cases), urethroplasty (4 cases), <b>epididymectomy</b> (3 cases), orchidopexy (1 cases). i).

40|$|The use of Judas goats (JGs; Capra hircus) {{to locate}} remnant animals is a {{powerful}} tool for enhancing feral goat eradication efforts, being especially important to some island conservation programs. JGs are goats that are captured, fitted with radio telemetry collars and released. As goats are gregarious, JGs seek out and associate with other goats. JGs are periodically tracked down and any associated feral goats removed. JGs increase the efficiency of removing animals at low densities by reducing search time for hunters locating remnant herds, making JGs indispensable on large islands for detecting remnant goats and confirming eradication. However, current JG methodology falls short of its potential efficacy. Female JGs are often pregnant at the time of deployment or become impregnated in the field; pregnant females leave associated goats to give birth and may remain alone with their offspring for many months, causing downtime of JG operations. Further, male JGs may inseminate remnant females. Sterilising JGs prior to deployment removes these inefficiencies, provided that it doesnt interfere with normal goat behaviour. Two methods (<b>epididymectomy</b> for males and tubal occlusion for females) are described that sterilise JGs while still maintaining sexual motivation and other behaviours associated with intact animals. These surgeries are straightforward, time efficient, and may be conducted in the field by staff with minimal training. Terminating pregnancy in goats was conducted with PGF 2 &# 8733;, terminating pregnancy from day four of conception until term. Pregnancy termination in female JGs prior to deployment compliments sterilisation of does pregnant {{at the time of their}} capture. Additionally, prolonged duration or increased frequency of oestrus in female JGs was hypothesized to increase their efficiency; does in oestrus actively seek out and are searched for by bucks, and are more active than non-oestrus does. Work was conducted to find out how to best induce a prolonged oestrus effect and whether this increased the efficacy of female JGs. Two experiments under controlled, farm conditions demonstrated that oestrus could be prolonged with one or two Compudose- 100 implants (single dose 21. 1 mg estradiol 17 &# 946;) or a single Synovex-S implant (200 mg progesterone and 20 mg estradiol benzoate). Two Synovex-S implants failed to significantly prolong oestrus. Single Compudose- 100 implants provided the most dramatic effect with oestrus increased 6 - 16 -fold over control treatment, and when combined with 15 mg PGF 2 &# 8733; and sterilisation by tubal occlusion provided an effective means of terminating pregnancy, inducing sterility and prolonging oestrus with a single intervention. Sterilised single Compudose- 100 implant treated does showed an 82 -fold increase in oestrus activity compared to unaltered does (traditional JGs) that would typically become pregnant during their first oestrus. Single Compudose- 100 treated does maintained a prolonged oestrus response until day 140, when the experiment ended. To compare the efficacy of sterile single Compudose- 100 implanted female JGs (hereafter Mata Hari JGs) to sterile JG bucks and does a large-scale field trial involving 213 JGs was incorporated into the feral goat eradication campaign on Santiago Island, Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. Mata Hari JGs associated with ~ 1. 5 times more males than either sterilised male or sterilised female JGs. There was no significant difference in the probability of any treatment associating with feral does or all goats. Mata Hari JGs caused males to be removed early in the JG phase of the campaign, leaving more females; reproductive potential was limited by the lack of males, evidenced by many non-pregnant does without kids at foot. This is the first use of Mata Hari JGs and it demonstrates that a sex bias in associated animals is possible; other campaigns have shown no such bias. This field study also demonstrated that male and female JGs are equally effective, dispelling previous qualitative assessments which assumed that JG does were more effective than bucks at associating with remnant herds. JG programs are becoming technologically more advanced, however further applications of relevant technologies are required to solve specific inefficiencies and increase the cost effectiveness of JG programs. Given the widespread and deleterious impacts of non-native herbivores to ecosystems and the importance of Judas operations in detecting animals at low densities, sterilisation, pregnancy termination and hormone treatment should be applied routinely in JG (and possibly other species) programs to increase the efficacy of low-density control operations and eradication campaigns...|$|E
