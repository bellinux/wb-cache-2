40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} Spade − the System S {{declarative}} stream processing engine. System S is a large-scale, distributed data stream processing middleware under development at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. As a front-end for {{rapid application development}} for System <b>S,</b> <b>Spade</b> provides (1) an intermediate language for flexible composition of parallel and distributed data-flow graphs, (2) a toolkit of type-generic, built-in stream processing operators, that support scalar as well as vectorized processing and can seamlessly inter-operate with user-defined operators, and (3) a rich set of stream adapters to ingest/publish data from/to outside sources. More importantly, Spade automatically brings performance optimization and scalability to System S applications. To that end, Spade employs a code generation framework to create highly-optimized applications that run natively on the Stream Processing Core (SPC), the execution and communication substrate of System S, and {{take full advantage of}} other System <b>S</b> services. <b>Spade</b> allows developers to construct their applications with fine granular stream operators without worrying about the performance implications that might exist, even in a distributed system. Spade’s optimizing compiler automatically maps applications into appropriately sized execution units in order to minimize communication overhead, {{while at the same time}} exploiting available parallelism. By virtue of the scalability of the System <b>S</b> runtime and <b>Spade’s</b> effective code generation and optimization, we can scale applications to a large number of nodes. Currently, we can run Spade jobs on ≈ 500 processors within more than 100 physical nodes in a tightly connected cluster environment. Spade has been in use at IBM Research to create real-world streaming appli...|$|R

50|$|In 1909 the Sunshine Gardens were {{developed}} to provide an amenity for the employees of the Sunshine Harvester Works.> Designed by the assistant city engineer at Ballarat Mr F. A. Horsfall and laid out by head <b>gardener</b> <b>S.</b> G. Thompson, the eight-acre Gardens were sited alongside the factory and incorporated recreation facilities and popular horticultural displays. According to Bill Bampton, the Gardens included tennis courts and pavilion, a bandstand, a bowling green, a substantial house for the head gardener, a conservatory and associated works areas. Under inaugural curator Thompson (1909-27), and curators James Willan (1930-39) and Harold Gray (1939-50), the Gardens developed a reputation for its chrysanthemums and dahlias, attracting workers and their families, {{as well as other}} local residents. In 1953, the management of Sunshine Gardens was handed to the newly established City of Sunshine. At this time, it was renamed the H.V. McKay Memorial Gardens. In the 1990s, the garden was listed by the National Trust of Australia and in the Register of the National Estate. In 2007 the Friends of McKay Gardens was formed to help maintain the gardens.|$|R

40|$|X-linked {{intellectual}} disability (XLID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. During {{the past two}} decades in excess of 100 X-chromosome ID genes have been identified. Yet, a large number of families mapping to the X-chromosome remained unresolved suggesting that more XLID genes or loci are yet to be identified. Here, we have investigated 405 unresolved families with XLID. We employed massively parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons in the index males. The majority of these males were previously tested negative for copy number variations and for mutations in a subset of known XLID genes by Sanger sequencing. In total, 745 X-chromosomal genes were screened. After stringent filtering, a total of 1297 non-recurrent exonic variants remained for prioritization. Co-segregation analysis of potential clinically relevant changes revealed that 80 families (20 %) carried pathogenic variants in established XLID genes. In 19 families, we detected likely causative protein truncating and missense variants in 7 novel and validated XLID genes (CLCN 4, CNKSR 2, FRMPD 4, KLHL 15, LAS 1 L, RLIM and USP 27 X) and potentially deleterious variants in 2 novel candidate XLID genes (CDK 16 and TAF 1). We show that the CLCN 4 and CNKSR 2 variants impair protein functions as indicated by electrophysiological studies and altered differentiation of cultured primary neurons from Clcn 4 (-/-) mice or after mRNA knock-down. The newly identified and candidate XLID proteins belong to pathways and networks with established roles in cognitive function and {{intellectual disability}} in particular. We suggest that systematic sequencing of all X-chromosomal genes in a cohort of patients with genetic evidence for X-chromosome locus involvement may resolve up to 58 % of Fragile X-negative cases.

The siting of the lake meant the driveway had to be moved, and ornate bridges were constructed to cross the water. Built from granite, the northern bridge has three arches with ashlar starlings, the southern bridge has a single arch and the third, smaller bridge crosses a large stream that drains into the lake.|$|R
50|$|The Rockhampton Botanic Gardens were {{established}} in 1869 when Mayor R M Hunter requested that the government turn the Native Police paddock into a reserve for botanic gardens. This was approved and the land was gazetted. However a working gardener was not appointed until 1873. The impetus for the gardens came from Frenchman Monsieur Anthelme Thozet who {{was among the first}} to re-establish substantial plantings in Rockhampton by planting trees from his private nursery along the river bank in Quay Street. The first appointed <b>gardener</b> was J <b>S</b> Edgar, partially trained by Thozet. His successor was R Simmons, a naturalist whose skills were frequently called upon by local and overseas scientists. In his capacity as curator of the gardens, Simmons laid out the grounds surrounding the memorial.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 <b>s,</b> Paul V. <b>Spade</b> {{advanced}} {{the thesis that}} obligational reasoning was counterfactual reasoning, based upon his interpretation of the obligationes of Walter Burley, Richard Kilvington, and Roger Swyneshed.

In this paper, we revisit the connection between counterfactual reasoning and obligationes, focusing on one particular treatise, the anonymous early twelfth-century Obligationes Parisienses edited by L. M. de Rijk in the late 70 s. We show that while positio in this treatise does not involve counterfactual reasoning, the species sit verum or rei veritas apparently does, and it is precisely this which distinguishes the two species in this treatise...|$|R

At the 1994 European Indoor Championships he became a double European champion: winning in both the 60 metres hurdles and 60 metres sprint race as well. His 60 m dash time of 6.49 s was a European record, as well as a championship record. These records remained unbeaten for 5 years, when Jason <b>Gardener</b> ran 6.46 <b>s</b> in 1999 in Maebashi, Japan.|$|R
40|$|THESIS 9131 An {{analysis}} of the literary stereotypes of Germans in 19 th century Russian literature with specific attention to how these images describe Russia in spatial terms and construct Russian identity. Considering the prevalence of German literary characters {{in the works of}} Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Anton Chekhov, the scarcity of scholarly literature on the topic is striking. Many of these characters present a puzzle, because their "Germanness" does not appear to bear upon the action of the story, especially in the work of Chekhov and Turgenev. According to one of the few scholars to take on the problem, the presence of these characters " [...] . was usually meant to provide comic relief (as in Pushkin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 The Undertaker 2 ̆ 7 or Gogol 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 Nevsky Prospect 2 ̆ 7), supply fodder for parody (cf. Hermann in pushkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Queen of <b>Spades),</b> or give impetus to moralistic diatribes (as is often the case in Gogol) [Diament, Goncharov 2 ̆ 7 s Oblomov, p. 29]. My thesis challenges this received assumption with an {{analysis of}} the deep structures of the interaction between the Russian and German characters. I aim to demonstrate that the role of the Germans in Russian literature goes beyond what the above scholar implies, because the depiction of Germans constructs and modifies the Self Image of Russian identity. This is effected by casting the Russian as open, free, unpredictable, vital, simple, youthful, abstract, spiritual, and disorderly, as opposed to the German, who is constricted, restricted, rational, dull, condescending, elderly, explicit, material, and orderly. Given the hybrid and synthetic nature of the Russian-German interaction through history, and considering the prevalence of Germans within the Russian Empire, I argue that the literary German can function both as an external foreign Other, and also as an internal aspect of Russianness. Two competing visions of Russia and Russianness vis-a-vis the German thus emerged in the mid- 19 th century - as Mutually Exclusive and as Synthetic. The depiction of Gennans in Russian literature thus depends upon which of these two lenses a given writer chooses to deploy...|$|R
