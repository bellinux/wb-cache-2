40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of inorganic pollution is pronounced in water adjacent to Bor Copper Smelter Complex (RTB Bor, Serbia), with Cu, Zn, Pb, and As being the main determinants of aquatic pollution pattern. Communities of microorganisms present in the sediments are mainly affected by heavy metal pollution. Some groups of bacteria can be considered pollution bio-indicators, due to their sensibility and ability to bioaccumulate heavy metals, thus contributing to reducing pollution. This study investigates the relationships between trace element accumulation and heterogeneity in sediment bacteria community structure found in water streams adjacent to the Bor Copper Smelter Complex (RTB Bor, Serbia). Our results showed no contamination with copper, zinc, nickel, iron, and chromium, but did show a low to moderate contamination with lead and a moderate to high contamination with arsenic in aquatic sediments within the area of interest. Spatial heterogeneity in sediment-associated bacterial communities did not relate significantly to location of sampling sites, except for <b>iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria.</b> <b>Iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> and nitrifying bacteria were the best distinguishing groups of <b>bacteria.</b> However, only <b>iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> were significantly influenced by sampling locations. The <b>iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> has correlated negatively with the degree of sediment contamination with lead, and therefore, we suggest that this group of bacteria could serve as potential bio-indicators of inorganic water contamination in Bor RTB area...|$|R

In this study, the effect of <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> on the leaching of a {{manganese nodule}} was studied. Although the manganese nodule was not leached in a 0. 01 N sulfuric acid solution, the extraction was increased by adding ferrous ion as a reducing agent. As the <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> can utilized ferrous ion as a substrate, the leaching of the manganese nodule {{was carried out in}} the presence of ferrous ion and the <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria.</b> The results show that the extraction of a mangannese nodule increased with the initial cell concentration. In the oxidative-reductive leaching of a manganese nodule and nickel sulfide, the leaching rates of these two materials incresed.

40|$|The {{potential}} of microbial mediated iron plaque reduction, and associated arsenic (As) mobility were examined by <b>iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> enriched from As contaminated paddy soil. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} first time to report the impact of microbial iron plaque reduction on As mobility. Iron reduction occurred during the inoculation of iron reducing enrichment culture in the treatments with iron plaque and ferrihydrite as the electron acceptors, respectively. The Fe(II) concentration with the treatment of anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonic acid (AQDS) and <b>iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> increased much faster than the control. Arsenic released from iron plaque with the iron reduction, and a significant correlation between Fe(II) and total As in culture was observed. However, compared with control, the increasing rate of As was inhibited by <b>iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> especially in the presence of AQDS. In addition, the concentrations of As(III) and As(V) in abiotic treatments were higher than those in the biotic treatments at day 30. These results indicated that both microbial and chemical reductions of iron plaque caused As release from iron plaque to aqueous phase, however, microbial iron reduction induced the formation of more crystalline iron minerals, leading to As sequestration. In addition, the presence of AQDS in solution can accelerate the iron reduction, the As release from iron plaque and subsequently the As retention in the crystalline iron mineral. Thus, our results suggested that it is possible to remediate As contaminated soils by utilizing <b>iron</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> and AQDS...|$|R

Both the mixed cultures were grown at various concentration of either ferrous sulfate or elemental sulfur. Bioleaching process {{was conducted by}} varying the reaction time, effect of substrates and effect of catalyst amount. Under the most favourable transport conditions examined, (5 g/L spent catalysts, 10 g/L ferrous sulfate, reaction time 7 days) the mixed <b>iron</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> were able to recover Ni, V, and Mo of 90, 80 and 54 % respectively. Higher catalyst and ferrous sulfate concentration showed decline result in recovery of Mo and V. Ni showed consistent results throughout the series of experiments (88 to 90 % recovery).

50|$|Iron filters {{have been}} used to treat <b>iron</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Iron filters are similar in {{appearance}} and size to conventional water softeners but contain beds of media which have mild oxidizing power. As the iron-bearing water is passed through the bed, any soluble ferrous iron is converted to the insoluble ferric state and then filtered from the water. Any previously precipitated iron is removed by simple mechanical filtration. Several different filter media may be used in these iron filters, including manganese greensand, Birm, MTM, multi-media, sand, and other synthetic materials. In most cases, the higher oxides of manganese produce the desired oxidizing action. Iron filters do have limitations. Since the oxidizing action is relatively mild, it will not work well when organic matter, either combined with the iron or completely separate, is present in the water and <b>iron</b> <b>bacteria</b> will not be killed. Extremely high iron concentrations may require inconvenient frequent backwashing and/or regeneration. Finally, iron filter media requires high flow rates for proper backwashing and such water flows are not always available.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{test hole}} cores of {{overburden}} grab {{samples from the}} Bear Creek Study Site of the West Moorhead coal deposit in eastern Montana were received from the U. S. Geological Survey. The samples were visually inspected for evidence of mineralization, which was aided by an accompanying geological log for each core. Each sample was ground prior to its analysis for lead content, pH value, conductivity value, and chemoautotrophic bacteria presence. The mineralization of the core samples was quantitatively different for the strata, with no consistent relation between physical and chemical descriptions.

5000|$|Just as the {{septic tank}} is sized {{to support a}} {{community}} of anaerobic organisms capable of liquifying anticipated amounts of putresible materials in wastewater, the drain field should be sized to support a community of aerobic soil microorganisms capable of decomposing the anaerobic septic tank's effluent into aerobic water.

50|$|In an {{open loop}} system (also called a {{groundwater}} heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural water from a well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. ASHRAE calls {{open loop system}}s groundwater heat pumps or surface water heat pumps, depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the primary refrigerant loop, and the water is returned to a separate injection well, irrigation trench, tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance {{may need to be}} protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. Limescale may foul the system over time and require periodic acid cleaning. This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems. Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, <b>iron</b> <b>bacteria</b> or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a risk}} factor for respiratory infections, and one of its main components is particulate matter (PM), which is comprised of a number of particles that contain iron, such as coal fly ash (CFA). Since free iron concentrations are extremely low in airway surface liquid (ASL), we hypothesize that CFA impairs antimicrobial peptides (AMP) function and can be a source of <b>iron</b> to <b>bacteria.</b> We tested this hypothesis in vivo by instilling mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA 01) and CFA and determine the percentage of bacterial clearance. In addition, we tested bacterial clearance in cell culture by exposing primary human airway epithelial cells to PA 01 and CFA and determining the AMP activity and bacterial growth in vitro. We report that CFA is a bioavailable source of <b>iron</b> for <b>bacteria.</b> We show that CFA interferes with bacterial clearance in vivo and in primary human airway epithelial cultures. Also, we demonstrate that CFA inhibits AMP activity in vitro, which we propose as a mechanism of our cell culture and in vivo results. Furthermore, PA 01 uses CFA as an iron source with a direct correlation between CFA iron dissolution and bacterial growth. CFA concentrations used are very relevant to human daily exposures, thus posing a potential public health risk for susceptible subjects. Although CFA provides a source of bioavailable <b>iron</b> for <b>bacteria,</b> not all CFA particles have the same biological effects, and their propensity for iron dissolution is an important factor.

50|$|More specifically, several Paenibacillus species {{serve as}} {{efficient}} plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), which competitively colonize plant roots and can simultaneously act as biofertilizers and as antagonists (biopesticides) of recognized root pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. They enhance plant growth by several {{direct and indirect}} mechanisms. Direct mechanisms include phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, degradation of environmental pollutants, and hormone production. Indirect mechanisms include controlling phytopathogens by competing for resources such as iron, amino acids and sugars, {{as well as by}} producing antibiotics or lytic enzymes. Competition for iron also serves as a strong selective force determining the microbial population in the rhizosphere. Several studies show that PGPR exert their plant growth-promoting activity by depriving native microflora of iron. Although iron is abundant in nature, the extremely low solubility of Fe at pH 7 means that most organisms face the problem of obtaining enough iron from their environments. To fulfill their requirements for <b>iron,</b> <b>bacteria</b> have developed several strategies, including the reduction of ferric to ferrous ions, the secretion of high-affinity iron-chelating compounds, called siderophores, and the uptake of heterologous siderophores.
