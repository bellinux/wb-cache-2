In contrast with the greatly impaired induction of delta-aminolaevulinate synthase, the induction of haem oxygenase in response to CoCl 2 remained unaltered in pregnant rats.

30|$|First of all, {{the issues}} of {{organizational}} independence and capacity building are core ingredients in the partnership theory, {{but they are not}} existing in China mainland. The relationship between state and society in China is obscure. In China’s history, the relationship between the “state” and “society” has been in a subtle equilibrium, that is, the boundary of both parts is not absolute, but related in essence (Yang 1998). There has never been a national civil society (Deng 2005). The long-term integration of government administration with commune management (zheng she he yi, 政社合一) made the state-society relationship unclear. “Regulations on the registration and administration of social organizations” in 1998 required that social organizations be supervised by a service master unit (ye wu zhu guan dan wei, 业务主管单位) and register in a registration authority (deng ji dan wei, 登记单位). This dual supervision led to the weak development of the social organization, unclear responsibilities and the messy development of the social organizations, etc. The system of <b>differential</b> <b>controls</b> of social organizations reflects the blending of the boundaries of the government and social organizations (Wang and Liu 2007). The development of social organizations is leading to a complex and diverse combination of “independence” and “autonomy,” generalized as “dependent autonomy” (Wang and Song 2013). The premises of partnership theory (the independence and the growth of the nonprofit sectors) do not exist in China.|$|E

We therefore investigated the role of acid invertase (AI) in determining fruit sugar composition in these two species. At all stages of fruit development, the majority of AI was localized in the vacuole with about 10 &percent; of the total activity in the extra-cellular space. Four forms of soluble AI activity were identified. Isoform 1 persisted throughout development. Isoform 2 showed a strong relationship to total fruit sugar content in both species, suggesting that this isoform is the tiv 1 gene product located in the vacuole, and that it {{plays a major role in}} determining fruit soluble solids. Isoform 3 was very high in L. pimpinellfolium but not in L. esculentum. We suggest that AI has a major role in determining fruit sugar accumulation in L. pimpinellifolium, but not in L. esculentum. Pulse-chase in vitro unloading experiments with [3 h]-glucose showed that a substantial amount of [3 h]-sucrose was present in the apoplast, suggesting an exchange of sugars between extra- and intra-cellular spaces.

The potential bioavailability of metals was assessed with a biomimetic extraction method using the sipunculan gut juices. The sediments {{were characterized by}} relatively high concentrations of trace metals. Field collected sediments were highly anoxic and the ratio of simultaneously extractable metal (ΣSEM) to acid volatile sulfide (AVS) was much less than one in these sediments. The majority (> 67 %) of Cd, Pb, and Zn were bound to AVS, thus their concentrations in the sediment porewater were low. In contrast, Ni was little bound to AVS due to its lower ratios of SEM-Ni to total Ni concentrations. For Cu, relatively high concentrations in the sediment porewater was found, and total organic carbon, AVS and other resistant sulfide phase were the controlling factors for sedimentary Cu partitioning. Net metal adsorption from gut juices to anoxic sediments was observed in metal extraction experiments, suggesting that AVS determined the bioaccumulation and potential bioavailability of most metals in these sediments. Extraction of metals from the oxidized sediments by the gut juices was mainly attributed to metal redistribution from AVS to other geochemical phases. The gut juices were the most effective solvent or extractant than the simple electrolyte solution [I (NaNO 3) = 0. 01 M] and the natural overlying water. Cd was more easily extracted from the oxidized sediments than Zn that tended to have a stronger binding affinity with Fe-Mn oxide, clay and organic matter.

The activity of the following three groups of neurons is characterized: 1) neurons of the motor cortex that project to the pyramidal tract (PTNs), 2) neurons of the ventrolateral thalamus (VL), many identified as projecting to the motor cortex (thalamo-cortical neurons, TCs), and 3) neurons of the reticular nucleus of thalamus (RE), which inhibit TCs. Neurons were grouped according to their receptive field into shoulder-, elbow-, and wrist/paw-related categories. During simple locomotion, shoulder-related PTNs were most active in the late stance and early swing, and on the ladder, often increased activity and step-related modulation while reducing discharge duration. Elbow-related PTNs were most active during late swing/early stance and typically remained similar on the ladder. Wrist-related PTNs were most active during swing, and on the ladder often decreased activity and increased modulation while reducing discharge duration. In the VL, shoulder-related neurons were more active during transition from swing to stance. Elbow-related cells tended to be more active during transition from stance to swing and on the ladder often decreased their activity and increased modulation. Wrist-related neurons were more active throughout the stance phase. In the RE, shoulder-related cells had low discharge rates and depths of modulation and long periods of activity distributed evenly across the cycle.

40|$|One of the best-characterized {{actions of}} steroids is the {{regulation}} of brain areas involved in endocrine function and in the activation of reproductive behaviors in male and female vertebrates. Progress {{in the understanding of}} the mechanisms that control the expression of the eukaryotic genome by nuclear receptors has brought forward the importance of steroid receptor coactivators in mediating efficient gene transcription. However, little is know about the specific physiological requirements of these coactivators in vivo. In Japanese quail, testosterone treatment of castrated males restores the full copulatory behavior and increases the volume of the sexually dimorphic medial preoptic nucleus (POM) to the level observed in intact males [1]. Testosterone also affects a number of sexually dimorphic neurochemical characteristics such as the vasotocineric innervation of the septum and meadial preoptic nucleus [2]. The quail therefore provides an excellent model to study steroid-dependent sexual behavior and the associated neuroplasticity and should provide insights into the modulation of steroid action by steroid receptor coactivators. The present studies were focused on the steroid receptor co-activator- 1 (SRC- 1), which was already shown {{to be involved in the}} process of sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in rats [3]. We first amplified by RT-PCR from quail brains a 3, 411 bp fragment highly homologous with the chicken (94. 5 %) and mammalian (70 %) SRC- 1 and designed digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotides for in situ hybridization. A broad distribution of SRC- 1 transcripts was observed throughout the male quail brain. A particularly dense coactivator expression was observed in limbic (e. g. POM, nucleus striae terminalis) and mesencephalic (e. g. substantia grisea centralis) nuclei associated with the control of male sexual behavior [4]. Because male and female quail exhibit a very pronounced sexual dimorphism in the steroid-dependent mechanisms that activate male-typical copulatory behavior, we investigated the potential role of SRC- 1 in the sexually differentiated responses to steroids by quantifiying the SRC- 1 mRNA by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the corresponding protein by western blot (WB). Contrary to previous results, which had identified a higher SRC- 1 mRNA expression in the POM of males compared to females [4], we found in two separate experiments that sexually mature females had higher concentrations of SRC- 1 in the preoptic area-hypothalamus (HPOA) compared to males. Additional studies should be carried out to identify the origins of this discrepancy but seasonality and time of the day when brains were collected are potentially involved. We also quantified the SRC- 1 mRNA and protein in the preoptic area-hypothalamus (HPOA) of castrated males treated or not with testosterone. SRC- 1 mRNA was increased by testosterone in two independent experiments but not in a third one. This difference is likely due to the differential manipulations of the birds during these experiments. Birds had been repeatedly handled to test their sexual behavior in the first experiment and we showed that stress tends to decrease the coactivator expression in the male HPOA. This interpretation is strengthened by recent work in rats indicating that stress regulates SRC- 1 expression in hypothalamus and hippocampus [5]. More surprisingly, we found a significant correlation between the expression of SRC- 1 and the time of the day when birds were killed in the optic lobes, hippocampus and hindbrain. The expression of SRC- 1 in the optic lobes increased throughout the day, independently of sex, testosterone treatment or stress. In the hippocampus and hindbrain, the coactivator concentration varied in opposite directions during the morning and afternoon and reached respectively its lowest or highest concentration around the middle of the day, here again independently of sex, stress and hormonal treatment. Together, these data support the idea that SRC- 1 is not constitutively expressed but regulated by steroids, stress and possibly other unidentified factors. <b>Differential</b> <b>controls</b> also appear to take place in specific brain nuclei and these <b>differential</b> <b>controls</b> should be further analyzed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. A second part of our work was dedicated to the study of the physiological significance of SRC- 1 whith the use of daily intra-cerebroventricular injections of modified antisense (AS) oligonucleotides (Locked nucleic acid LNA) to disrupt SRC- 1 expression in the POM. AS injections significantly reduced the expression of male copulatory behavior in response to exogenous testosterone compared to control animals (Ctrl group) that received the vehicle alone or scrambled (SC) oligonucleotides. Moreover, sexual behavior was restored and even enhanced within 48 hours after interruption of AS injection (ASSC group). Western blot analysis confirmed the decrease of SRC- 1 expression in AS animals and demonstrated an over-expression of the coactivator in ASSC animals. The effects of SRC- 1 knock down on behavior was related to a reduced POM volume defined by Nissl-staining and aromatase immunohistochemistry. The aromatase index, indicative of the relative amount of aromatase in the POM as well as the vasotocinergic innervation of this nucleus were higher in the Ctrl group. Taken together, these findings indicate that SRC- 1 functions as a critical regulatory molecule in the brain to modulate steroid-dependent gene transcription and behavior. The study of the modulation of nuclear receptors activity by different co-regulatory proteins is still in its infancy. Abnormal co-activator expression or function is currently being linked to some endocrine/neurological disorders in humans and it is thus critical to understand how co-activator expression and function are controlled in the developing as well as in the adult brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{adrenal gland}} is an {{important}} endocrine organ, protecting the body against acute and chronic stress. The adrenal cortex consists of three morphologically and functionally distinct zones: the outer zona glomerulosa (zG), the zona fasciculata (zF), and the innermost zona reticularis (zR). In rodents, zG cells produce mineralocorticoids (mainly aldosterone), while zF cells secrete glucocorticoids (mainly corticosterone). The functions of zG and zF are defined by the mutually exclusive expression of Cyp 11 b 2 and Cyp 11 b 1 that encode the enzymes aldosterone synthase and 11 β-hydroxylase, which catalyze the terminal reactions {{in the production of}} aldosterone and corticosterone, respectively. This thesis aims to investigate the maintenance of the definitive mouse adrenal cortex. This involves studies to identify the location of adrenal stem/progenitor cells, and the mechanisms by which differentiated adrenocortical cells are replenished in the adult mice. BrdU pulse-chase studies provided valuable information about cell division and cell fate under physiological or pathophysiological stimulations. The distribution of adrenocortical cells with nuclei stained positively for BrdU and/or Ki 67 was identified. Ki 67 labelling marked actively dividing cells and showed that adrenocortical cells originate at or around the zG/zF interface. BrdU labelling indicated that, following cell division, cells are displaced inwards and outwards. Acute angiotensin II treatment was shown to have no significant effects on the cell proliferation or turnover in any of the adrenocortical zones. The pathophysiological effects of long-term ACTH treatment were analyzed in a mouse model of congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by a null mutation of Cyp 11 b 1. Cell hypertrophy was evident in all regions of the adrenal cortex due to the impaired negative-feedback of the HPA axis. Adrenocortical cell proliferation was also increased particularly in the outer zona fasciculata at the border between zG and zF where adrenocortical stem/progenitor cells might be located. The intervening steps between cell proliferation and the final differentiation into steroidogenic zG and zF cells have yet to be discovered. A visual method of monitoring levels of Cyp 11 b 2 and Cyp 11 b 1 would offer a convenient approach to track the stages of adult stem cell differentiation that lead to normal adrenal maintenance in vivo and in vitro. In the present study an AS-mCherry- 11 B-EGFP BAC construct was successfully engineered, in which Cyp 11 b 2 and Cyp 11 b 1 were substituted by mCherry and EGFP, respectively. This BAC construct was characterized in mouse adrenocortical Y 1 cells. It was determined that EGFP faithfully recapitulated the expression of Cyp 11 b 1. Forskolin or cAMP treatment induced a rapid cell rounding effect and caused the increased expression of EGFP transgene and endogenous Cyp 11 b 1. An attempt was made to establish a transgenic mouse model, in which zG and zF cells would be marked with mCherry and EGFP respectively, allowing the differentiation of an adrenocortical stem cell to be traced. Following microinjection of the BAC into mouse zygotes, twoAS-mCherry- 11 B-EGFP transgenic founder mice were identified. Unfortunately, neither of them was able to transmit the transgene through germline, suggesting the mosaicism of transgene integration. Indeed, mosaicism of the transgenic adrenals was demonstrated by RT-PCR and immunostaining, which also revealed that the exogenous EGFP expression faithfully recapitulated the endogenous Cyp 11 b 1 in adrenals. Although it is assumed that expression of Cyp 11 b 2 and Cyp 11 b 1 are mutually exclusive, zG and zF cells may have the plasticity to allow the transition from one cell type into another. The AS-mCherry- 11 B-EGFP BAC construct is a useful tool for studying in vitro ES cell differentiation towards the adrenocortical lineage. Transgenic AS-mCherry- 11 B-EGFP ES cells were successfully differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells, as identified by the expression of molecular markers for the mesenchymal lineage. It has been reported that steroidogenic factor (Sf 1) can promote the differentiation of MSCs into steroidogenic cells, and Shh {{plays an important role in}} Sf 1 expression and the consequent adrenal development. However, Shh treatment failed to achieve transformation of mesenchymal cells into adrenocortical cells. It is thought there might be a requirement for additional factors to combine with Shh in promoting the transdifferentiation of ESC-derived mesenchymal cells. Future studies will focus on the genetic control of Cyp 11 b 1 and Cyp 11 b 2 in transgenic AS-mCherry- 11 B-EGFP ES cells. In conclusion, the location and fate of the adrenocortical progenitor cells were demonstrated by the BrdU pulse-chase studies in different mouse models. An AS-mCherry- 11 B-EGFP BAC construct was generated, and used to study the mutual and <b>differential</b> <b>controls</b> of Cyp 11 b 1 and Cyp 11 b 2 expression in adrenocortical cells in vitro and in transgenic mice in vivo...|$|E

Because it requires just three Euclidean parameters instead of the four non-Euclidean parameters of quaternions, RQ is more efficient, less difficult to incorporate into large systems, and able to make use of Euclidean interpolants, such as cubic splines. While RQ does possess singularities in its parameter space, we show how they can be easily avoided for the intended applications. After discussing RQ's properties and limitations when applied to interpolation and spacetime optimizations, we derive an extension to two DOF rotations, and show how {{it can be used to}} model a ball-and-socket joint to a very good approximation.
