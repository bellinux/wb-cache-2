Since liberalization era in 1990's emphasis on governmental cost cutting has been the norm department has been facing shortages in officer and staff cadre. Approximately {{more than half of}} the junior officers and staff positions are lying vacant as on date. [...] It was hoped that computerization would reduce the dependence on staff during 2001 restructuring of the department following <b>desk</b> <b>officer</b> system. Subsequently,unscientific promotion policies owing to pressure tactics [...] of the unions have resulted in creation of situation where staff with out any proper experience or qualification are promoted to supervisory ranks seriously jeopardizing the efficiency and service delivery and leaving huge vacancies at the investigation and assessment charges. There have been many instances where drivers have been promoted to the rank of Inspector of Income Tax which is a bedrock of the investigation mechanism for detecting tax evasion with out proper screening. While this indicates a democratic scenario where every competent worker can aspire to rise up in the hierarchy but no safeguards have been put in place to ensure merit of the promoted candidates. According to the Economic Times, Severe shortages may be negatively impacting the government's ability to scrutinise returns and catch instances of black money.|$|E
