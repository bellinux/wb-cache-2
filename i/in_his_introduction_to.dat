5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. He felt {{he was the best}} villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E
5|$|Southard and Mary Jarrett {{founded the}} field of {{psychiatric}} social work, applying psychiatry to industrial employees. The Kingdom of Evils, a book on psychiatric social work by Southard and Jarrett, was published after his death. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> the book, physician Richard Cabot wrote that it highlighted the collaboration between doctor and social worker; the physician excels at diagnosis, and the social worker is better able to provide resources for treatment.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of}} the 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E

5|$|Larkin was {{a notable}} critic of modernism in {{contemporary}} art and literature. His scepticism {{is at its}} most nuanced and illuminating in Required Writing, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> his collected jazz reviews, All What Jazz, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as an enemy of modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The {{continuous}} {{historical development}} of modern arithmetic {{starts with the}} Hellenistic civilization of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of Euclid around 300BC, Greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs.

25|$|Much of what {{is known}} of Hooke's early life comes from an {{autobiography}} that he commenced in 1696 but never completed. Richard Waller mentions it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S., printed in 1705. In the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, Hooke argues that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography, to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I. The work of Waller, along with John Ward's Lives of the Gresham Professors and John Aubrey's Brief Lives, form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of Hooke.|$|E

[...] Moore {{said that he had}} [...] "no inclination to unleash yet another 'Tough Bitch With A Disintegrator And An Extra Y-Chromosome' upon the world". The idea to base the strip around an ordinary, unremarkable woman, typical of the society she lived in, was also very different for 2000 AD.|$|R

25|$|Originally named Plymouth North Road, it {{was opened}} in 1877 as a joint station for the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR).

25|$|Marsden {{cites the}} works of Australian Children's Author Mary Grant Bruce as major {{influence}} on the series. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> the John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel Peter and Co Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia. Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate Peter and Co when he wrote Tomorrow, When the War Began he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.|$|E
25|$|Countering the {{argument}} of a Celtic origin is the literary evidence that the Cimbri originally came from northern Jutland, an area with no Celtic placenames, instead only Germanic ones. This does not rule out Cimbric Gallicization during the period when they lived in Gaul. Boiorix, who may have a Celtic name if not a Celticized Germanic name, was king of the Cimbri after they moved away for their ancestral home of northern Jutland; Boiorix and his tribe lived around Celtic peoples during his era as J. B. Rives points out <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> Tacitus's Germania (book) and moreover that the name Boiorix can work in Proto-Germanic as well as Celtic.|$|E

25|$|Particularly revered among Ballard's admirers is {{his short}} story {{collection}} Vermilion Sands (1971), set in an eponymous desert resort town inhabited by forgotten starlets, insane heirs, very eccentric artists, and the merchants and bizarre servants who provide for them. Each story features peculiarly exotic technology such as cloud-carving sculptors performing {{for a party}} of eccentric onlookers, poetry-composing computers, orchids with operatic voices and egos to match, phototropic self-painting canvases, etc. In keeping with Ballard's central themes, most notably technologically mediated masochism, these tawdry and weird technologies service the dark and hidden desires and schemes of the human castaways who occupy Vermilion Sands, typically with psychologically grotesque and physically fatal results. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> Vermilion Sands, Ballard cites this as his favourite collection.|$|E
25|$|An {{error in}} {{the first volume of}} the series led to a long-running under-estimate of the number of New Zealanders who fought in the Gallipoli Campaign. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> The New Zealanders at Gallipoli, Sir Ian Hamilton stated that 8,556 New Zealanders had served at Gallipoli. While this figure did not appear {{in the body of the}} book, which did not provide an alternative, it was {{frequently}} repeated by historians until the 1980s. A 2005 book by Richard Stowers included an estimate that the actual figure was 13,977. In 2013, David Green determined that Hamilton had calculated his figure from a mistaken interpretation of tables in The New Zealanders at Gallipoli. Research by New Zealand Government agencies published in 2016, found that the number of New Zealanders landed at Gallipoli was approximately 16,000.|$|E
25|$|Erdman {{includes}} {{the two pieces}} in Poetical Sketches simply {{because there is no}} other collection with which to associate them. His decision, however, {{is by no means the}} norm amongst Blake's editors. For example, R.H. Shepherd did not include them in his publication of Poetical Sketches in 1868. In his 1905 edition of the collected works, Sampson mentioned them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Introduction</b> <b>to</b> Poetical Sketches but did not include them in the collection itself. In The Complete Writings of William Blake (1957 and 1966) Geoffrey Keynes included them but divided them from Poetical Sketches, indexed them separately and dated them both 1777. Alicia Ostriker, in her William Blake: The Complete Poems (1977), makes no reference at all to either piece throughout the volume. W.H. Stevenson in Blake: The Complete Poems (1971, 1989 and 2007), mentions them in a footnote, but does not reproduce them.|$|E
