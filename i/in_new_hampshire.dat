5|$|As the New Hampshire primary neared, Rockefeller {{began to}} attack Goldwater, {{claiming}} he supported a voluntary social security {{plan that would}} bankrupt the nation. Goldwater denied the charge. He campaigned <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> until the primary vote, spending approximately $150,000 as opposed to $250,000 by Rockefeller.

As a result, the electorate sought out other candidates. Surprisingly, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. won the primary with 35.5 percent as a write-in candidate while still serving in Vietnam and without making any public appearances <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> Goldwater finished in second with 22.3 percent, followed by Rockefeller with 21.0 percent.
