Empirical reconstitution (purified <b>factors</b> VIIa, X, IX, VIII, V, prothrombin, and relipidated tissue <b>factor)</b> showed that plasma concentrations of <b>factor</b> VII (10 nM) prolong the initiation phase of thrombin generation significantly at low concentrations of tissue <b>factor</b> and 100 pM <b>factor</b> VIIa.

Analysis method used to measure <b>factors</b> of loyalitas by using <b>factor</b> analysis with correlation matrix step, <b>factor</b> ekstraksi, and <b>factor</b> giration, functioning correlation matrix step to test do from 18 competent accurate <b>factor</b> to use <b>factor</b> analysis, <b>factor</b> ekstraksi used to reply formulation of problem of no 1 that is <b>factors</b> any kind of having an effect on to employees loyalitas, and <b>factor</b> giration step is to reply formulation of problem of no 2 that is which <b>factor</b> is which is most of signifikan have an effect on to employees loyalitas. From [is] the result obtained that result of <b>factor</b> ekstraksi find 6 new <b>factor</b> formation which influence employees loyalitas that is prosperity <b>factor,</b> attention <b>factor</b> to employees, <b>factor</b> of[is availibility of facility, incentive <b>factor,</b> salary <b>factor,</b> easy going atmosphere <b>factor.</b> From 6 new <b>factor</b> of prosperity <b>factor</b> represent most <b>factor</b> of signifikan have an effect on to employees loyalitas formed by proportionate value <b>factor</b> with UMR, existence of spiritial, existence of confession of employees, existence of insurance program and also the existence of saving program with value eigen totality 47. 92...|$|R
40|$|Generation of {{coagulation}} <b>factor</b> Xa by {{the intrinsic}} pathway protease complex {{is essential for}} normal activation of the coagulation cascade in vivo. Monocytes and platelets provide membrane sites for assembly of components of this protease complex, <b>factors</b> IXa and VIII. Under biologically relevant conditions, expression of functional activity by this complex is associated with activation of <b>factor</b> VIII to VIIIa. In the present studies, autocatalytic regulatory pathways operating on monocyte and platelet membranes were investigated by comparing the cofactor function of thrombinactivated <b>factor</b> VIII to that of <b>factor</b> Xa-activated <b>factor</b> VIII. Reciprocal functional titrations with purified human <b>factor</b> VIII and <b>factor</b> IXa were performed at fixed concentrations of human monocytes, CaC 12, <b>factor</b> X, and either <b>factor</b> IXa or <b>factor</b> VIII. <b>Factor</b> VIII was preactivated with either thrombin or <b>factor</b> Xa, and reactions were initiated by addition of <b>factor</b> X. Rates of <b>factor</b> X activation were measured using chromogenic substrate specific for <b>factor</b> Xa. The KIA values, i. e., concentration of <b>factor</b> VIIIa at which rates were half maximal, were 0. 96 nM with thrombin-activated <b>factor</b> VIII and 1. 1 nM with <b>factor</b> Xa-activated <b>factor</b> VIII. These values are close to <b>factor</b> VIII concentration in plasma. The Vsat, i. e., rates at saturating concentrations of <b>factor</b> VIII, were 33. 3 and 13. 6 nM <b>factor</b> Xa/min, respectively. The K 1 /u and Vsat value...|$|R
