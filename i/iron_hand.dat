25|$|His cover-drive {{was still}} his chief glory, but other shots were {{scarcely}} inferior: {{the glory of}} the moon and stars as opposed to the rich glory of the sun. There seemed to be no effort about his work. With a short back-swing he persuaded the ball through the gaps, guiding it with an <b>iron</b> <b>hand</b> inside the velvet glove which disguised his power and purpose.|$|E
25|$|The couple {{remained}} {{close and}} {{theirs was a}} happy marriage. They lived in their own large residence in Saint Petersburg, the New Mikhailovsky Palace, which was built for them in 1861. They also had a summer residence, Mikhailovskoe on the Baltic in Peterhof, and Grushevska, a vast rural estate in southern Ukraine. The couple had seven children. Grand Duchess Olga, with a stronger personality than her husband, was the dominating force in the family. She raised her seven children with an <b>iron</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|She {{received}} a strict {{education at the}} court of Baden in Karlsruhe, becoming a cultured woman. On 28 August 1857, she married Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich of Russia, the youngest son of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. Upon her marriage, she converted to the Russian Orthodox faith and took the name Olga Fyodorovna with the title of Grand Duchess of Russia. Unusually among the Romanovs of her generation, her marriage was a long and happy union. The couple remained devoted to each other. She raised their seven children with an <b>iron</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Grand Duchess Olga was {{witty and}} had a strong personality. Her sharp tongue brought her {{a lot of trouble}} at the Russian court. She despised the morganatic wife of Alexander II and later she was {{particularly}} indignant at Alexander III's decision {{to limit the number of}} Grand Dukes, a title her own grandchildren would be deprived of. While her husband busied himself with his military and governmental career, Grand Duchess Olga ruled her family with an <b>iron</b> <b>hand.</b> She demanded complete obedience from her children. She was particularly close to her eldest son Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia, whose intellectual interests were like hers, but she remained aloof and cold towards the others. Her second son, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, who was not intellectually gifted (she called him a fool), was a constant source of disappointment for her. In 1879, Olga with Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna arranged the marriage between her only daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, with Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Maria Pavlovna's brother. Anastasia carried some bitterness about her upbringing and relationship with her mother - her daughter Cäcilie recounts that at a party to celebrate her engagement, when she committed some infraction she was sent to bed by Olga like a naughty child. There was also an incident involving an apricot tree, which belonged to Anastasia but whose fruit she was not allowed to eat.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>iron</b> <b>hands</b> {{are based}} on the same {{constructive}} principles, although there are considerable differences in complexity.

First into the target areas were specialized <b>Iron</b> <b>Hand</b> flak suppression missions.

When Hughes' representative in England, Colonel John Wallace Carson, secured preferential accommodation for the Canadian soldiers {{at the expense}} of a British brigade, Alderson refused the barracks and in doing so, made both Carson and Hughes into determined enemies. Carson wrote to the Canadian Prime Minister Robert Laird Borden that Alderson [...] "does not treat our men with a firm <b>iron</b> <b>hand</b> covered with the velvet glove which their special temperaments require".|$|E

Their primarch, Ferrus Manus, {{was the first}} primarch casualty of the Horus Heresy, having been killed by his sworn friend (and later enemy) Fulgrim, the primarch of the Emperor's Children. Known as the Gorgon, Ferrus Manus along with his sons from the <b>Iron</b> <b>Hands</b> both revered metal and technology, with the latter often replacing organic parts with metal ones while greatly admiring mechanical skills. In fact, the first augmentation the chapter's initiates receive is replacing their left hand upon being inducted into the chapter. They are also known for greatly disdaining {{anything that can be}} a potential weakness, whether it be physical or psychological. They possess no chapter master, instead relying on a Council of Iron Fathers for leadership with Iron Father Kardan Stronos as their current elected head.|$|R

500|$|In 1925, {{the studio}} {{expanded}} its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company, Vitagraph. Later that year, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, {{to sign an}} agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of talking [...] "shorts" [...] using the newly developed Vitaphone technology. Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 (just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer), and Jack became sole head of production. Sam's death left Jack inconsolable. One biographer writes, [...] "Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam's sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature. Sam had {{also served as a}} buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry. In the years to come, Jack ran the Warner Bros.

500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an <b>iron</b> <b>hand,</b> crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E

Employed at low altitudes, the [...] "hunters" [...] located the missiles and attacked their radar control vans with canisters of napalm, both to knock out the SAM's missile guidance and to mark the target for the [...] "killers", which followed up the initial attack using 750-pound bombs to destroy the site.|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{uncommon}} in Portugal that a married woman has two given names and six surnames, two from her mother's family, two from her father's family, and the last two coming from her husband. In addition, some of these names may be made {{of more than one}} word, so that a full feminine name can have more than 12 words. For instance, the name [...] "Maria do Carmo Mão de Ferro e Cunha de Almeida Santa Rita Santos Abreu" [...] would not be surprising in a married woman. Mão de Ferro (<b>iron</b> <b>hand)</b> and Santa Rita (after Saint Rita of Cascia) count only as one surname each. In this case, Santos Abreu would probably have come from this woman's husband.|$|E

2500|$|Noriko’s father, Shukichi, {{works as}} a college {{professor}} and is the sole breadwinner of the Somiya family. It {{has been suggested that}} the character represents a transition from the traditional image of the Japanese father to a very different one. Sato points out that the national prewar ideal of the father was that of the stern patriarch, who ruled his family lovingly, but with an <b>iron</b> <b>hand.</b> Ozu himself, however, in several prewar films, such as I Was Born, But… and Passing Fancy, had undercut, according to Sato, this image of the archetypal strong father by depicting parents who were downtrodden [...] "salarymen" [...] (sarariman, to use the Japanese term), or poor working-class laborers, who sometimes lost the respect of their rebellious children.

[...] Risner's aircraft was at very low altitude flying at approximately 600mph, approaching a site that was likely a decoy luring aircraft into a concentration of AAA. Heavy ground fire struck Risner's F-105 in its air intakes when he popped up over a hill to make his attack. Again he attempted to fly to the Gulf of Tonkin, but ejected when the aircraft, on fire, pitched up out of control.
