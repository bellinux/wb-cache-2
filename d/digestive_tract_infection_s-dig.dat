40|$|Background: <b>Digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> with {{clinical}} manifestation of diarrhea is an infectious disease that has the highest {{morbidity and mortality}} rate, especially in developing countries. Diarrhea causes mortality mostly in infants under one year old. Improvement in management is done continuously, but advances in diagnosis and therapy cannot be reached by developing countries. One of the etiological agents causing <b>infection</b> of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> is bacteria.  Therefore, knowledge of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal infection and their resistance patterns may support the management of this disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine microbes that were isolated from the digestive tract and their resistance patterns against antibiotics. Methods: Samples (stool, rectal/anal swab) were collected from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, FKUI during  2005 - 2008. Isolation, identifi cation and sensitivity test were conducted according to standard laboratory procedures.  Interpretation of sensitivity test was done according to NCCLS/CLSI guidance. Data was analyzed using WHOnet version 5. 3. Results: We found 28 isolates of pathogenic Escherichia coli, 1 isolate of S. paratyphi A and 4 isolates of yeasts.  Pathogenic Escherichia coli were still sensitive against some antibiotics, but the sensitivity was reduced against amoxicillin, sulbenicillin, ticarcillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Conclusion: The most predominant gastrointestinal <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> causing microbes was pathogenic Escherichia coli.

To date, {{there have been no}} studies of the rheological properties of blood during the course of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections.</b> The aim of our {{study was to examine the}} effects of CDI on red blood cell (RBC) rheology, specifically RBC deformability, RBC aggregation, and plasma viscosity. In addition, the activity of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in RBC was studied. Our study group included 20 patients with CDI, 20 healthy persons comprised the control group. We examined the effects of CDI on the rheology of RBCs, their deformability and aggregation, using a Laser–assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer (LORCA). Plasma viscosity was determined using a capillary tube plasma viscosymeter. Moreover, we estimated the activity of AChE and G 6 PD in RBC using spectrophotometric method. A statistically significant increase was found in the aggregation index, viscosity and activity of G 6 PD whereas the amount of time to reach half of maximum aggregation (t½) and the amplitude of aggregation (AMP) both showed statistically significantly decreases among patients with CDI compared to the control group. We also observed that the Elongation Index (EI) was decreased when shear stress values were low, between 0. 3 Pa and 0. 58 Pa, whereas EI was increased for shear stress in the range of 1. 13 - 59. 97 Pa. These observations were statistically significant. We report for the first time that acute infection of the gastrointestinal tract with Clostridium difficile is associated with abnormalities in rheological properties of blood, increased serum viscosity as well as increased aggregation of RBCs, which correlated with severity of inflammation. These abnormalities may be an additional mechanism causing increased incidence of VTE in CDI...|$|R

40|$|The Pacific Coast {{band-tailed pigeon}} (Patagioenas fasciata monilis) is a migratory game bird of North America {{that is at}} risk for {{population}} decline. Epidemics of avian trichomonosis caused by upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> with Trichomonas spp. protozoa in these and other doves and pigeons of the United States are sporadic, but can involve {{tens of thousands of}} birds in a single event. Herein, we analyze the role of trichomonosis in band-tailed pigeon mortality and relate spatial, temporal and demographic patterns of parasite transmission to the genetic background of the infecting organism. Infections were most common in adult birds and prevalence was high in band-tailed pigeons sampled at mortality events (96 %) and rehabilitation centers (36 %) compared to those that were hunter-killed (11 %) or live-caught (4 %). During non-epidemic periods, animals were primarily infected with T. gallinae Fe-hydrogenase subtype A 2, and were less often infected with either T. gallinae subtype A 1 (the British finch epidemic strain), T. stableri n. sp. (a T. vaginalis-like species), or Tritrichomonas blagburni n. sp. -like organisms. Birds sampled during multiple epidemics in California were only infected with T. gallinae subtype A 2 and T. stableri. The non-clonal etiology of avian trichomonosis outbreaks in band-tailed pigeons and the risk of spill-over to raptor and passerine species highlights the need for additional studies that clarify the host range and evolutionary relationships between strains of Trichomonas spp. in regions of trichomonosis endemicity. © 2014 Elsevier B.

We reviewed all the medical events onboard a large commercial 471 -cargo ship company for 4 years. Medical events were recorded within 20 categories as routinely used by Medical Maritime Consulting Centers, using a 4 -level medical gravity score. The chi(2) test and logistic regression and correspondence analyses {{were used for the}} analysis of qualitative variables. Results. Excluding wounds and burns, a total of 322 illness events were notified by onboard health officers for 471 ships totalizing 46 navigation/months. 250 non-infectious events and 72 cases of infection yielded an incidence of 7. 75 medical events for 1000 person-years. <b>Infections</b> comprised 25 <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> 17 skin <b>infections,</b> 8 urinary <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> 5 dental infections, 4 isolated fevers, 3 Ear-Nose-Throat and respiratory <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> 2 ocular infections, myalgia and orchitis and 1 case of mediastinal infection. The mean age for sailors diagnosed with infection (37. 7 +/- 10. 5 years) was significantly younger than the mean age of sailors diagnosed with non-infectious disease (40. 8 +/- 11. 2 years) (P = 0. 04). In affected sailors, the proportion of death and hospitalization among infectious disease cases (26 / 69, 37. 7 %) was significantly higher than the proportion of death and hospitalization for non-infectious disease cases (48 / 242, 19. 8 %) (P = 0. 02). The correspondence analysis showed that the routes may be classified according to two main independent risks, digestive infections and skin infections. We observed a statistically significant correlation between the severity of medical events and the maritime route ``North Europe-OI- Australia-India-North Europe''. Conclusions. These data illustrate a previously underreported variability of the medical risks in various maritime routes; and help promoting targeted medical interventions including the implementation of onboard point-of-care laboratories, to further increase the rapidity of the diagnosis and the medical management onboard cargo ships...|$|R
40|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} postulates {{that the}} increase in atopic diseases may in part be due to diminished exposure to microorganisms. But it is unknown which type of infection does render protection. An epidemiological study was conducted in Leipzig, Germany, and its rural county, involving 3347 school starters. Two types of infection were considered: (1) gastrointestinal colonisation (Helicobacter pylori detection using in vivo [13 C] urea breath test) and (2) respiratory infections (physician‐diagnosed lower (bronchitis) and upper (common cold) respiratory infections). H pylori colonisation was selected because it is very common and {{plays an important role in}} gastrointestinal disorders. Atopic eczema was selected as the (allergic) target variable because of its high frequency in the age of the study participants. The results, adjusted for relevant confounders, showed a significant inverse association between H pylori infection and eczema (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)  =  0. 31, p =  0. 006) in children not predisposed to atopy.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} data of patients admitted {{with an initial}} diagnosis of digestive diseases who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and to guide clinical diagnosis. MethodsThe clinical data of HIV/AIDS patients who were hospitalized due to digestive system symptoms from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 were collected, including epidemiological data, clinical symptoms and signs, auxiliary examinations, and complications. The features of each parameter were observed. The t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between groups, and the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups. ResultsA total of 95 HIV/AIDS patients with digestive diseases were enrolled, and the male/female ratio was 1. 4 ∶ 1. Among these patients, 57 (60 %) were aged 30 - 50 years, 85 (89. 47 %) were Yi people, and 86 (90. 53 %) were farmers. Of all patients, 46 (48. 42 %) were infected via sexual transmission and 44 (46. 32 %) were infected via intravenous drug use. In these patients, common clinical symptoms included abdominal pain (71. 58 %), pyrexia (43. 16 %), and diarrhea (17. 89 %), and common signs included ascites (28. 42 %), superficial lymphadenectasis (21. 05 %), and hepatosplenomegaly (16. 84 %). The auxiliary examination showed {{a significant increase in}} globulin. The proportion of patients with opportunistic infection reached 83. 16 %, mainly lung and <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections.</b> Among the patients who underwent gastroscopy, 31. 58 % had mycotic esophagitis. Chronic non-atrophic gastritis, electrolyte disturbance, and intestinal obstruction were commonly seen in patients with noninfectious complications. Of all HIV/AIDS patients, 54  74 % (52 / 95) were complicated by HBV and/or HCV infection, and the liver function parameters globulin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and A/G showed significant differences between these patients and the patients with HIV infection alone (all P＜ 0. 01).

Twenty-six sheep were allocated on two paddocks of 0. 7 ha, one fertilised with sludge and the other with cattle slurry. The delay between application and actual grazing was 6 weeks; grazing on these paddocks extended from mid July to beginning of November 2002. The herbage biomass was slightly increased in the sludge paddock but it did not result in an increase of lamb live weight, compared with the slurry paddock. The lambs did not acquire cysticercosis or any other larval cestodoses in the sewage sludge group and only very limited infections with Cooperia spp. and Nematodirus spp. were observed in the slurry group.

In the gut, persistence of the inoculum was observed up to 21 dpi. No inflammatory lesions were observed in the ileum or colon during infection. Mutant strains lacking the ureABC genes of the ure 1 operon, virB 2, or pmm encoding phosphomannomutase were constructed and compared to the wild-type strain for infectivity through the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> Mutants lacking the virB 2 and pmm genes were attenuated in the spleen (P < 0. 05) and MLN (P < 0. 001), respectively.

Here we have investigated the neurochemical complexity (through in silico gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry) of the gastric ganglion in Octopus vulgaris and tested whether the expression of a selected number of genes was influenced by the magnitude of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> parasitic <b>infection</b> by Aggregata octopiana. Novel evidence was obtained for putative peptide and non-peptide neurotransmitters in the gastric ganglion: cephalotocin, corticotrophin releasing factor, FMRFamide, gamma amino butyric acid, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, molluscan insulin-related peptide 3, peptide PRQFV-amide, and tachykinin–related peptide. Receptors for cholecystokininA and cholecystokininB, and orexin 2 were also identified in this context for the first time. We report evidence for acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, octopamine, small cardioactive peptide related peptide, and receptors for cephalotocin and octopressin, confirming previous publications. The effects of Aggregata observed here extend those previously described by showing effects on the gastric ganglion; in animals with a higher level of infection, genes implicated in inflammation (NFκB, fascin, serpinB 10 and the toll-like 3 receptor) increased their relative expression, but TNF-α gene expression was lower as was expression of other genes implicated in oxidative stress (i. e., superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin 6, and glutathione peroxidase). Elevated Aggregata levels in the octopuses corresponded to an increase in the expression of the cholecystokininA receptor and the small cardioactive peptide-related peptide. In contrast, we observed decreased relative expression of cephalotocin, dopamine β-hydroxylase, peptide PRQFV-amide, and tachykinin-related peptide genes. A discussion is provided on (i) potential roles of the various molecules in food intake regulation and <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> motility control and (ii) the difference in relative gene expression in the gastric ganglion in octopus with relatively high and low parasitic loads and the similarities to changes in the enteric innervation of mammals with <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> parasites.

Intestinal colonization was measured, and cytokine expression was determined in various organs recovered from mice after oral challenge. UPEC strain 536 efficiently colonized the mouse <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> and prior Enterobacteriaceae colonization was found to impact strain 536 colonization efficiency. An innate immune response, detected as the production of TNFα, IL- 6 and IL- 10 cytokines, was activated in the ileum 48 hours after oral challenge with strain 536, and returned to baseline within 8 days, without a drop in fecal pathogen load. Although inflammation was detected in the ileum, histology was normal at the time of cytokine peak. Comparison of cytokine secretion 48 h after oral gavage with E. coli strain 536, CFT 073, MG 1655 or ΔPAI- 536 showed that inflammation was more pronounced with UPECs than with non-pathogenic or attenuated strains. Pathogenicity islands also seemed to be involved in host detection, as IL- 6 intestinal secretion was increased after administration of E. coli strain 536, but not after administration of ΔPAI- 536. In conclusion, UPEC colonization of the mouse <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> activates acute phase inflammatory cytokine secretion but does not trigger any pathological changes, illustrating the opportunistic nature of UPECs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the clinical benefits of selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in patients treated {{in intensive care}} units. DESIGN [...] Meta-analysis of 22 randomised trials that compared different combinations of oral non-absorbable antibiotics, {{with or without a}} systemic component, with no treatment in controls. SUBJECTS [...] 4142 patients seen in general and specialised intensive care units around the world. 2047 received some form of antibiotic treatment, the remainder no prophylaxis. DATA ANALYSIS [...] Each trial was reviewed through direct contact with study investigators. Data collected were: the randomisation procedure, number of patients, number excluded from the analysis, and numbers of respiratory <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> and deaths. Data were combined according to an intention to treat analysis with the Mantel-Haenszel-Peto method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Respiratory <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> and total mortality. RESULTS [...] Selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> significantly reduced respiratory <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (odds ratio 0. 37; 95 % confidence interval 0. 31 to 0. 43). The value of the common odds ratio for total mortality (0. 90; 0. 79 to 1. 04) suggested at best a moderate treatment effect, reaching statistical significance only when the subgroup of trials of topical and systemic treatment combined was considered separately (odds ratio 0. 80; 0. 67 to 0. 97). No firm conclusions could be drawn owing to large variations in patient mix and severity within and between trials.

40|$|Background and Methods. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to find out}} whether translocation of bacteria to the abdominal cavity and endotoxemia in rats with sterile peritonitis could be prevented by selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> Sterile peritonitis was caused by the intraperitoneal injection of either 100, 150, 200, or 300 mg of zymosan suspended in paraffin. Results: The frequency of infection of the abdominal cavity depended on the dose of zymosan given, ranging from 20 % in rats receiving 100 mg to 89 % in rats receiving 300 mg of zymosan. In rats not receiving antibiotics for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> (the control group), Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in all rats, and Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the abdominal cavity in ten of 19 rats. In rats receiving antibioties for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in none of the 14 rats, and likewise, Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the abdominal cavity in none of the 14 rats (p <. 005). Moreover, in rats receiving antibiotics for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> endotoxin levels in feces and plasma were significantly lower, as compared with rats not receiving antibiotics for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> Conclusion: Selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> prevents translocation of Gram-negative bacilli to the abdominal cavity, and endotoxemia and mortality in rats with sterile peritonitis...|$|R

The bacterial species reported within the intestines of the earthworms belong to the genuses Bacillus, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Nocardia, Gordonia, Vibrio, Clostridium, Proteus, Serratia, Mycobacterium, Klebsiella, Azotobacte and Enterobacter. These bacteria inhabit the soil and develop considerably when there are easily degradable organic soil nutrients. The bacterial community inside the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> of earthworms pertains to at least four physiological groups: plant growth promoters, free-living nitrogen fixers, biocides and phosphate solubilizers. The diversity of bacterial communities within the <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> of earthworms depends on climate, soil type and organic matter.

Urinary <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> are very common particularly in women, babies and the elderly. About one in two women, and one in 20 men will get the infection in their lifetime. The majority of urinary <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> are urethritis, cystitis, and pyeleonephritis. The most common bacteria causes the infection is a bacterium common to the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> called Escherichia coli. The most common symptoms of the infection are, burning sensation during urination, blood in urine, and Lower abdominal pain, therefore the infection needs to be investigated as it may indicates more serious conditions. A study with patients, who have come with the symptoms of urinary <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> in the cities of Sobrata, and Algmel in Libya has been made the number of patients in the study were 582 cases and 926 cases respectively. After the investigations have been made the results shows those 301 women, 66 men in Sobrata city and 354 women, 171 men in Algmel city were infected. The percentage of infection are 63 % and 56. 69 %. Number of women and men who infected by Escherichia coli are (165, 46) and (179, 90) cases respectively, this result approves that bacteria Escherichia coli is the major causes of urinary <b>tract</b> <b>infection</b> symptoms in most of the patients.
