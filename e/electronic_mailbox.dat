In the context of interdisciplinary design fields and digital communication relationships, there is a digital artistic medium of interaction where the designers and also the audience interested in art meet. In particular, exhibits related to the design areas, explaining the factors such as catalog of the works in digital media, the artist's biography and interviews, reach the audience with an effective presentation. The art audience, can watch the art scene through an outsider perspective with the information presented to him/her in a virtual environment. With the art space transferred to the virtual sphere (museums, galleries, exhibition halls, etc.) the concept of distance is removed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to analyze the current implementation of {{information and communication technologies}} in public administration in the Czech Republic and its development. The presented results come from my partial researches of this area, which I was doing in the whole course of my doctoral study. The thesis is divided into several parts. The first part deals with review of various e-Government definitions and its objectives identification as e-Government has already {{become an integral part of}} public administration transformation process. There are also discussed individual e-Government development stages within the broader context of information society development as well as in the context of connections created within the European Union. The second part of the thesis deals with two different points of view of e-Government. The first one includes separate components and institutes of e-Government such as an <b>electronic</b> signature, data <b>mailboxes</b> and contact points of public administration. The second point of view is based on projects. There are mentioned both state level projects such as the Portal of public administration, information system of data mailboxes, Czech POINT, basic registries of public administration and resort level projects as well as projects of particular authorities. Typical examples of regional and local level e-Government projects, which are provided by municipalities, are also included in this part. The third part of the thesis deals with legal, economic, social and regional aspects of e-Government. Indivisible part of this chapter is precise identification and description of constraints that limit implementation possibilities of information and communication technologies within the public administration. These constraints must not be understood as barriers that have to be overcome at any costs or as barriers restraining development of e-Government, but as borders of properly defined space, where the electronization of public administration should operate. Correct understanding of these constraints can help to decrease failure risk of e-Government projects. One of these constraints is legal framework, which I suppose to be crucial and that is why I pay to it the most attention. Besides proving the stated working hypothesis there are given three recommendations for next development of e-Government in the Czech Republic. I suppose that e-Government is a meaningful part of transformation process of public administration and that while keeping some rules it can bring significantly positive results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Continuous Speech Understanding System that allows information services to be accessed through the telephone line. It accepts queries within a restricted semantic domain, expressed in free but syntactically correct natural language, with a lexicon {{of the order}} of 800 words. In the implementation here described, a user can access an <b>electronic</b> <b>mailbox</b> or a train information service through a PABX telephone line. The architecture of the system is based on two main modules that represent and use different knowledge sources. A speaker independent recognition module generates, for each utterance, a lattice of word hypotheses which is the interface to an understanding module that performs the syntactic and semantic analysis. The recognition module is based on Hidden Markov Models of subword units, and performs the acoustic decoding process according to a beam search strategy. The understanding module finds the most likely sequence of words and represents its meaning in a format which facilitates the access to a database. It makes use of a modified caseframe analysis guided by the word hypotheses scores. Experiments were performed with 600 sentences from 10 speakers on the E-Mail application task. Using 15 Gaussian mixtures per state, a word accuracy of 75. 7 was obtained with a test vocabulary of 787 words and no linguistic constraints. Linguistic processing of the corresponding lattices achieved a sentence understanding rate of 82...|$|E

40|$|As {{wide area}} {{networking}} technology and interconnection improve, {{an increasingly important}} problem is allowing users to navigate through the vast array of network accessible resources. In this paper we discuss experience with one technique we have developed in this regard, applied to a specific resource class. We have built a prototype tool that provides a simple Internet "white pages" directory facility. Given {{the name of a}} user and a rough description of where the user works (e. g., the company name or city), the tool attempts to locate telephone and <b>electronic</b> <b>mailbox</b> information about that user. Measurements indicate that the scope of the directory is upwards of 1, 147, 000 users in 1, 929 administrative domains, yet the tool does not require the type of global cooperation that many existing or proposed directory services require, namely, running special directory servers at many sites around the Internet. We accomplish this by building an understanding of the semantics of this particular resource discovery application into the algorithms that support searches, allowing the tool to make aggressive use of existing sources of relatively unstructured information. Being able to make use of such information is important in heterogeneous, administratively decentralized environments, where global agreement about highly structured information formats is difficult to achieve. At present, the tool utilizes information from USENET news messages, the Domain Naming System, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and the "finger" protocol, as well as a variety of information about the meaning of and relationships between these information sources. Other sources of resource information (such as the CCITT X. 500 directory service) can easily be incorporated into the tool as they become availa [...] ...|$|E
40|$|At a {{time when}} the inequalities between men and women in Benin are diminishing, access to ICTs is still rather unequal, and many {{information}} and communication services remain inaccessible to women, especially those living and working in rural areas. The National Institute of Agricultural Research of Benin (INRAB), through its Public Relations and Outreach Service (SRVP), used the GenARDIS grant to launch a project to strengthen the capacities of women civil servants working at six Regional Centres for Action in Rural Development (CARDERs). The project involved the organization of training programmes for these women in the use of computers and the Internet, to enable them to collect information that will be useful in their work with rural women. INRAB contacted the managers of the six regional centres to explain the purpose of the project. Each manager then suggested six women to participate in the training. In each CARDER home town, a cybercafe was identified to serve as a training venue. These cybercafes were then invited to propose a training programme, based on specifications set by the SRPV to ensure that the six courses were comparable. Each programme consisted of basic training in text and data processing using software such as Word and Excel, and a course in the use of Internet as a communication and research tool. At the end of the course, the 36 participants were required to perform a test, which all of them passed. Each of them now has an <b>electronic</b> <b>mailbox</b> so that they can send and receive email messages, they can surf and search the Internet, and they can prepare documents and use spreadsheets. The participants were generally very satisfied with the training programmes, and recommended that follow-up courses be organized to enable them to keep abreast of technological developments.
