Citing <b>internal</b> <b>company</b> <b>documents,</b> the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E

40|$|The tobacco {{industry}} publicly contends that ammonia compounds are solely used as tobacco additive {{for purposes of}} tobacco flavoring, process conditioning and reduction of its subjective harshness and irritation. However, neither objective scientific reports, nor {{the contents of a}} large number of <b>internal</b> tobacco <b>company</b> <b>documents</b> support this contention. The present review focuses on the hypothesis that addition of ammonium compounds to tobacco enhances global tobacco use due to smoke alkalization and enhanced free-nicotine nicotine exposure. Obviously, ammonia enhances the alkalinity of tobacco smoke. Consequently, the equilibrium shifts from non-volatile nicotine salts to the volatile free base that is more readily absorbed from the airways. The observed change in the kinetics of nicotine (i. e., shorter t(1 / 2) and higher c(max)) after ammoniation is, however, predominantly due to the higher concentration of nicotine in the smoke, rather than to an increase in the absorption rate of free-base nicotine in the respiratory tract. Although several findings support the hypothesis, additional studies are required and suggested to provide a proper, objective and independent scientific judgment about the effect of tobacco ammoniation on nicotine bioavailability. Scientific and public awareness of the effects of tobacco-specific ammonia compounds may stimulate global control, legislation and restriction of their use in cigarette manufacture...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Despite public denials, <b>internal</b> tobacco <b>company</b> <b>documents</b> {{indicate}} that adolescents {{have long been}} the target of cigarette advertising and promotional activities. Recent longitudinal evidence suggests that 34 % of new experimentation occurs because of advertising and promotions.  OBJECTIVE—To apportion responsibility for smoking experimentation and future smoking-attributable mortality among major cigarette brands attractive to young people (Camel and Marlboro).  DATA SOURCES, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Data were from confirmed never-smoking adolescents (12 - 17 years old) responding to the 1993  (n = 2659) and 1996  (n = 2779) population-based California Tobacco Surveys.  MAIN OUTCOMES—Adolescents named the brand of their favourite cigarette advertisements and tobacco promotional items. Using these "market shares" and the relative importance of advertising and promotions in encouraging smoking, we estimated how many new experimenters from 1988  to 1998  in the United States can be attributed to Camel and Marlboro. From other data on the natural history of smoking, we projected how many future deaths in the United States can be attributed to each brand.  RESULTS—Although Camel advertisements were favoured more than Marlboro and other brands in 1993  and 1996, the "market share" for promotional items shifted markedly during this period from Camel and other brands towards Marlboro. We estimated that between 1988  and 1998, there will be 7. 9  million new experimenters because of tobacco advertising and promotions. This will result in 4. 7  million new established smokers: 2. 1,  1. 2, and 1. 4  million due to Camel, Marlboro, and other brands' advertising and promotions, respectively. Of these, 1. 2  million will eventually die from smoking-attributable diseases: 520   000 from Camel, 300   000 from Marlboro, and the remainder from other brands.  CONCLUSIONS—Our analysis provides a reasonable first estimate at sharing the blame for the long-term health consequences of smoking among the major brands that encourage adolescents to start smoking.    Keywords: adolescence; smoking initiation; smoking-attributable diseases; advertisin...|$|R
