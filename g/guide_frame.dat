5000|$|Telescoping holders {{fall into}} two subcategories. The earlier of the {{telescoping}} variety were column-guided variations and were built from 1824. To guide the telescoping walls, or [...] "lifts", they have an external fixed frame, visible at a fixed height at all times. A refinement was the <b>guide</b> <b>frame</b> gas holder, where the heavy columns were replaced a lighter and more extensive framework. Vertical girders (standards) were intersected by horizontal girders and cross-braced. This could be bolted onto an underground or aboveground tank. The Cutler patented <b>guide</b> <b>frame</b> dispensed with the horizontal girders using diagonal triangulated framing instead[...] Cable-guided gas holders, invented by Pease in 1880, had a limited use, but were useful on unstable ground where the rigid systems could buckle and jam the lift.|$|E

It is not a scissors bridge, it is transported in its entire length. The storage beam is mounted between the two tracking beams, which is connected to a hydraulic ram. The laying of the bridge is {{carried out by the}} hydraulically operated bar with which the whole bridge is moved over the <b>guide</b> <b>frame</b> (support bar). For laying, the storage beam is first extended and placed with the tip on the ground (thus, no support shield is necessary). Then the bridge is moved along the storage beam. After laying down the bridge, the storage beam is detached and is retracted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{patent for}} a practical [...] "endless chain saw" [...] (a saw comprising {{a chain of}} links carrying saw teeth and running in a <b>guide</b> <b>frame)</b> was granted to Samuel J. Bens of San Francisco on January 17, 1905. His intent being to fell giant redwoods. The first portable chainsaw was developed and patented in 1918 by Canadian millwright James Shand. After he allowed his rights to lapse in 1930 his invention was further developed by what became the German company Festo in 1933. The company now operates as Festool producing portable power tools. Other important contributors to the modern chainsaw are Joseph Buford Cox and Andreas Stihl; the latter patented and developed an electrical chainsaw for use on bucking sites in 1926 and a gasoline-powered chainsaw in 1929, and founded a company to mass-produce them. In 1927, Emil Lerp, the founder of Dolmar, developed the world's first gasoline-powered chainsaw and mass-produced them.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{variants}} of the ST-26 (with a sliding system of bridge laying {{and with a}} tipping system of bridge laying) were also tested from 1932. The first had a massive <b>guide</b> <b>frame</b> and a special boom (the bridge could be laid in 3 min 20 sec, the raise operation took 6-7 min), while the second was equipped with a special swinging-boom with a rack-and-pinion drive. All three {{variants of}} the ST-26 participated in military maneuvers of the Leningrad Military District {{in the summer of}} 1933; subsequently series production of the ST-26 with a cable system of bridge laying was begun as it proved to be more reliable and less complicated to maintain. The Defence Committee of the USSR ordered the production of 100 ST-26 to the end of 1933, but only 44 vehicles were assembled by the Factory No. 174 by 1934, and 20 in 1935. The delay was attributed to the manufacture of the metal bridges, carried out by the Gipstalmost Factory and several workshops using semi-handicraft techniques.|$|E

40|$|Macroeconomic models play an {{increasingly}} important role in economic policy-making and evaluation. They cost large sums of money, yet appear unable to forecast {{the ups and downs}} of economic activity with any accuracy. Drawing on material gathered during interviews with leading UK economists, I draw a distinction between `strong' and `weak' claims in econometrics, and discuss how these relate to the falsification of economic models and theories. Empirical work in econometrics is shown to be chronically ambiguous, and it is argued that the stochastic properties of macroeconomic models swamp any trends identified. Furthermore, although macroeconomic models can support economic forecasts, they cannot produce them unaided — forecasters must use their skill and judgement to anticipate future events and render forecasts plausible. The conclusion drawn is that although their pedagogic value is undisputed, the case for using macroeconomic models to <b>guide,</b> <b>frame</b> and evaluate economic policy has not yet been made...|$|E

A theoretical framework, named THE Medium model was developed to support the design process. Furthermore, design considerations were produced for technologies that encourage the sharing of positive emotions. This latter involved two studies, paper-based and online, which showed the potential for a prefixbased elicitation of positive emotions and drove the design and development of a mobile tool called PosiPost Me (Mobile edition). The second stage of the design process focused on how positive emotions can be mediated by technology in a mobile context and how such tools were used and understood. The iterative design study process continued, resulting in PosiPost Be, a Bluetooth edition, which allows sharing of positive messages with people in close proximity to explore the social and potential positive effects of contextualizing posiposting by adding location as a factor. Results suggest that by using a prefix-strategy, messages of a positive and mundane nature can be shared and mediated by mobile technology. Analysis of the shared messages provides insights into people’s pleasant moments in daily life. A questionnaire instrument named SPOT was developed and used for the measurement of the effects of sharing pleasant moments with the developed mobile expressive technologies in further detail. The results suggest that lightweight positive expressive technologies can have beneficial social wellness effects. In particular, the study showed significant beneficial effects in reducing depressed feelings and increasing social interest in others. Participants also believed that the mobile PosiPost applications supported social connectedness, socio-pleasure, social and positive awareness, and positive thinking.

40|$|DE 102007026100 A 1 UPAB: 20090103 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{providing a}} milling tool with a cutting depth limiter, where maximum cutting {{depth of the}} milling tool {{is limited by the}} limiter. A <b>guiding</b> <b>frame</b> (106) including an inner guiding contour (108) is fastened at a fixing section of a laminated composite material (100), where the fixing section is adjacent to a surface section (102). A maximum dimension of the surface section is limited by the <b>guiding</b> <b>frame.</b> The surface section is milled under guidance of the milling tool by the guiding contour. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a machining device for machining a laminated composite material at a surface section. USE - Method for machining a laminated composite material i. e. fiber-metal-laminated composite material such as glass fiber-aluminum-laminated composite material, at a surface section of an outer shell of an aircraft i. e. commercial aircraft airbus A 380, and a spacecraft, for repairing the glass fiber-aluminum-laminated composite material and a damage i. e. scratch, in the outer shell (all claimed). Can also be used for machining other materials such as aluminum or carbon fiber reinforced plastic. ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the guiding contours of the <b>guiding</b> <b>frame</b> enables <b>guiding</b> of the milling tool, so that the forces of the milling tool occurred during breaking of fiber layers are not diverted in a direction parallel to the surface section, thus achieving high machining precision in directions parallel to the surface section, and hence enabling repairing at the laminated composite material with reduced expenditure, high precision and high quality...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program is {{developed for the}} dynamic analysis of a spar platform coupled with mooring lines and risers in waves, winds, and currents. The new multi-contact analysis program is developed for the nonlinear multi-contact coupling between vertical risers and <b>guide</b> <b>frames</b> inside of the spar moon-pool. The program extends capability of the current coupled dynamic analysis program, WINPOST, by adding the capability of analyzing riser effects caused by the contact forces and moments from buoyancy-cans inside the spar moon-pool on the global spar motions. The gap between the buoyancy can and riser <b>guide</b> <b>frames</b> are modeled using three different types of nonlinear gap springs. The new riser model also considers the Coulomb damping between the buoyancy-cans and riser <b>guide</b> <b>frames,</b> and it also calculates the impact force on risers for use in fatigue analysis. The spar platform generally uses vertical risers with dry trees. However, as the water depth increases, {{the size of the}} buoyancy-can increases, and it makes installation more difficult. The pneumatic riser support system does not use buoyancy-cans and is an alternative solution to the buoyancy-can approach. The dynamic characteristics of pneumatic riser support system are studied by using the newly developed numerical analysis program. The damped Mathieu instability diagram for the damped Mathieu's equation is developed. Due to spar heave and pitch coupling, Mathieu's instability may become excited in long period waves. In the numerical analysis program, pitch and roll hydrostatic stiffness are recalculated for heave motion in every time step to check Mathieu's instability for the spar platform. Simplified vortex-induced vibration effects on the spar platform are considered in newly developed numerical analysis program, and the results are systematically compared with those of the original program WINPOST. The results in this paper show that the buoyancy-can effect significantly reduces the spar pitch motion, and the Coulomb damping effect also significantly reduces the spar heave motion. The buoyancy-can effect also {{plays an important role in}} Mathieu instability. The results also show that a pneumatic riser support system increases the spar heave motion and payload...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the discourses around emerging Internet connectivity solutions for rural and resource-constrained {{populations in the}} developing world. It draws primarily on interviews undertaken with 26 experts within the Information and Communications Technologies for Development (ICTD) field, {{as well as on}} institutional explanatory and publicity materials put forward by several industry actors. We identify a sustained disconnect between different conceptions of how technology alters or bridges space—spatial imaginaries. Institutions use narratives that assume technologies eradicate or collapse distance, and thus drive transformative socioeconomic change. By contrast, expert accounts underscore the socially embedded nature of technologically mediated relations and non-infrastructural barriers to connectivity. The paper draws attention to the ways that these spatial ideas are used to justify the development of new infrastructures to extend Internet access in the developing world. The paper identifies a need for continued attention to spatial imaginaries in ICTD, not only as a <b>guiding</b> <b>frame</b> for critical research, but also as a means to improve collaboration between research and industrial practice...|$|R

One method explored in the current study for alleviating the peak accelerations resulting from impact is to isolate fragile components from the product housing using internal shock mounts.

This paper presents an experimental and analytical study on the dynamic behaviour during impact of portable products with internal shock mounting. Using a special drop tower with <b>guiding</b> <b>frame</b> for controlled-angle free-fall drop impact, representative products are dropped at different angles and the acceleration is recorded both on the outer case and on an internally-mounted plate.
