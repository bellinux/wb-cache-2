5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} come to be known as the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently <b>hipped,</b> round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by <b>hipped</b> roofs.|$|E

40|$|Anterior <b>hip</b> or groin pain is {{a common}} {{complaint}} for which people are referred for physical therapy. We have observed that people with anterior <b>hip</b> pain often walk in greater <b>hip</b> extension than people without anterior <b>hip</b> pain, and that the pain is reduced when they walk in less <b>hip</b> extension. Therefore, we investigated anterior <b>hip</b> joint forces which may contribute to anterior <b>hip</b> pain and examined the effect of end range <b>hip</b> extension on the anterior <b>hip</b> joint force during gait. To do this, we used a 6 degree of freedom, 3 -dimensional musculoskeletal model to estimate <b>hip</b> joint forces during gait. Within subjects, the maximum anterior <b>hip</b> joint force for gait trials with the most <b>hip</b> extension was compared to the anterior <b>hip</b> joint force for gait trials with the least <b>hip</b> extension.

50|$|Acquired <b>hip</b> {{dislocation}} has {{the highest}} incidence rate immediately after <b>hip</b> replacement surgery and continues {{to have a high}} level for possibility of incidence throughout the first three months following the surgery. Following a primary total <b>hip</b> replacement surgery, 3.9% of patients experience <b>hip</b> dislocation during the twenty-six postoperative weeks. Following a revision total <b>hip</b> replacement surgery, approximately 14.4% of patients experience <b>hip</b> dislocation during the twenty-six postoperative weeks. The incidence of <b>hip</b> dislocation following <b>hip</b> replacement surgery greatly depends on patient, surgical and <b>hip</b> implant factors.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{investigated}} the selective activation of the gluteus maximus during a prone <b>hip</b> extension with knee flexion exercise, with the <b>hip</b> joint in different positions. [Subjects] The subjects were 21 healthy, male volunteers. [Methods] Activities of the right gluteus maximus, right hamstrings, bilateral lumbar erector spinae, and bilateral lumbar multifidus were measured using surface electromyography during a prone <b>hip</b> extension with knee flexion exercise. Measurements were made with the <b>hip</b> joint in each of 3 positions: (1) a neutral <b>hip</b> joint position, (2) an abduction <b>hip</b> joint position, and (3) an abduction with external rotation <b>hip</b> joint position. [Results] Gluteus maximus activity was significantly higher when the <b>hip</b> was in the abduction with external rota-tion <b>hip</b> joint position than when {{it was in the}} neutral <b>hip</b> joint and abduction <b>hip</b> joint positions. Gluteus maximus activity was also significantly higher in the abduction <b>hip</b> joint position than in the neutral <b>hip</b> joint position.

40|$|In {{mice and}} humans, {{there are two}} known members of the Huntingtin {{interacting}} protein 1 (<b>HIP</b> 1) family, <b>HIP</b> 1 and <b>HIP</b> 1 -related (<b>HIP</b> 1 r). Based on structural and functional data, these proteins participate in the clathrin trafficking network. The inactivation of <b>Hip</b> 1 in mice leads to spinal, hematopoietic, and testicular defects. To investigate the biological function of <b>HIP</b> 1 r, we generated a <b>Hip</b> 1 r mutant allele in mice. <b>Hip</b> 1 r homozygous mutant mice are viable and fertile without obvious morphological abnormalities. In addition, embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice do not have gross abnormalities in survival, proliferation, or clathrin trafficking pathways. Altogether, this demonstrates that <b>HIP</b> 1 r is not necessary for normal development of the embryo or for normal adulthood and suggests that <b>HIP</b> 1 or other functionally related members of the clathrin trafficking network can compensate for <b>HIP</b> 1 r absence. To test the latter, we generated mice deficient in both <b>HIP</b> 1 and <b>HIP</b> 1 r. These mice have accelerated development of abnormalities seen in <b>Hip</b> 1 -deficient mice, including kypholordosis and growth defects. The severity of the <b>Hip</b> 1 r/Hip 1 double-knockout phenotype compared to the <b>Hip</b> 1 knockout indicates that <b>HIP</b> 1 r partially compensates for <b>HIP</b> 1 function {{in the absence of}} <b>HIP</b> 1 expression, providing strong evidence that <b>HIP</b> 1 and <b>HIP</b> 1 r have overlapping roles in vivo...|$|R

In addition, a fusion between <b>HIP</b> 1 and platelet-derived growth factor Î² {{receptor}} causes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The <b>HIP</b> 1 proteins, including <b>HIP</b> 1 and <b>HIP</b> 1 -related (<b>HIP</b> 1 r), have an N-terminal polyphosphoinositide-interacting epsin N-terminal homology, domain, which {{is found in}} proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. <b>HIP</b> 1 and <b>HIP</b> 1 r also share a central leucine zipper and an actin binding TALIN homology domain. Here we show that <b>HIP</b> 1, like <b>HIP</b> 1 r, colocalizes with clathrin coat components. We also show that <b>HIP</b> 1 physically associates with clathrin and AP- 2, the major components of the clathrin coat. To further understand the putative biological role(s) of <b>HIP</b> 1, we have generated a targeted deletion of murine <b>HIP</b> 1. <b>HIP</b> 1 âˆ’/âˆ’ mice developed into adulthood, did not develop overt neurologic symptoms {{in the first year}} of life, and had normal peripheral blood counts. However, <b>HIP</b> 1 -deficient mice exhibited testicular degeneration with increased apoptosis of postmeiotic spermatids.

These findings indicate that <b>HIP</b> 1 is required for differentiation, proliferation, and/or survival of spermatogenic progenitors.

40|$|At {{the limits}} of the range of <b>hip</b> motion, impingement, {{subluxation}} and edge loading can cause osteoarthritis in natural <b>hips</b> or early failure <b>hip</b> replacements. The aim of this PhD was to investigate the role of <b>hip</b> joint soft tissues throughout the range of <b>hip</b> motion to better understand their role in preventing (or perhaps even causing) these problematic load cases. A musculoskeletal model was used to investigate the muscular contribution to edge loading and found that in the mid-range of <b>hip</b> motion, the lines of action of <b>hip</b> muscles pointed inward from the acetabular rim and thus would stabilise the <b>hip.</b> However, in deep <b>hip</b> flexion with adduction, nearly half the muscles had unfavourable lines of action which could encourage edge loading. Conversely, in-vitro tests on nine cadaveric <b>hips</b> found that the <b>hip</b> capsular ligaments were slack in the mid-range of <b>hip</b> motion but tightened to restrain excessive <b>hip</b> rotation in positions close to {{the limits of}} <b>hip</b> motion. This passive restraint prevented the <b>hip</b> from moving into positions where the muscle lines of action were found to be unfavourable and thus could help protect the <b>hip</b> from edge loading. The ligaments were also found to protect the <b>hip</b> against impingement and dislocation. Out of the labrum, the ligamentum teres and the three capsular ligaments, {{it was found that the}} iliofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments were primary restraints to <b>hip</b> rotation. These two capsular ligaments should be prioritised for protection/repair during <b>hip</b> surgery to maintain normal <b>hip</b> passive restraint.
