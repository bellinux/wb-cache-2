If 1<q≤4 {{there will be a}} finite number of objects greater than a given size, but the expected value of their combined mass would be infinite. If q is 4 or more, {{the law would}} imply an <b>infinite</b> <b>mass</b> of small objects.

It seems that Pluto is somewhat unexpectedly large, having several percent of the total mass of the Kuiper belt. It is not expected that anything larger than Pluto exists in the Kuiper belt, and in fact most of the brightest (largest) objects at inclinations less than 5° have probably been found.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities {{does not come}} from a priori or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations [...] One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an <b>infinite</b> <b>mass</b> object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the <b>infinite</b> <b>mass</b> object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.|$|E
2500|$|In physics, approximations of real {{numbers are}} used for {{continuous}} measurements and natural numbers {{are used for}} discrete measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no measurable quantity could have an infinite value, [...] for instance by taking an infinite value in an extended real number system, or by requiring the counting of {{an infinite number of}} events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have <b>infinite</b> <b>mass</b> or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite plane wave exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.|$|E

The fissile uranium in nuclear weapon primaries usually contains 85% {{or more of}} 235U known as weapons-grade, though theoretically for an implosion design, a minimum of 20% could be sufficient (called weapon(s)-usable) although it would require hundreds of kilograms of material and [...] "would not be practical to design"; even lower enrichment is hypothetically possible, but as the enrichment percentage decreases the critical mass for unmoderated fast neutrons rapidly increases, with for example, an <b>infinite</b> <b>mass</b> of 5.4% 235U being required.

40|$|Vanishing of the {{equilibrium}} Green-Kubo fluctuation expression for the friction coefficient {{of a massive}} particle moving in a finite-volume liquid is usually interpreted as an unphysical consequence of the finite volume.
