In this basin, several counter-measures against changes of flood runoff due to urbanization have been completed or are continueing, such as the construction of the Kumiyama Pump Station with a pump of 30 m^ 3 /s in 1973 and the channel improvements to the River Furu since 1971. Moreover, a pump of 30 m^ 3 /s was added at the Kumiyama Pump Station in 1987 and the Jouyou Pump Station with the drainage capacity of 10 m^ 3 /s composed of two pumps of 5 m^ 3 /s, was constructed at a point of the upper stream of the River Furu in 1990. In the previous paper, we discussed an optimum plan of drainage system from the viewpoint of minimum cost of costruction, on the basis of drainage conditions in 1960. This paper deals continually with an optimum plan of drainage system in future {{on the basis of the}} present condition of drainage system. As the result, it has been clarified that the optimum plan of drainage system in future is the combination of the improvement of channels and the increase of pump capacities at the existing pump stations, and that the construction of new <b>drainage</b> <b>equipments</b> become difficult because mainly of high price of lands...|$|R

40|$|The Ogura low-lying basin {{located in}} the south of Kyoto has been {{urbanized}} rapidly in recent years. To cope with changes of flood runoff due to urbanization, the improvement of the River Furu was begun in 1971, and the Kumiyama Pump station with a pump of 30 m^ 3 /s was constructed at the downstream end of the River Furu in 1973. Moreover, a pump of 30 m^ 3 /s was added to this pump station in 1987, and the Joyo Pump station with two pumps of 5 m^ 3 /s was constructed at Haccho {{located in the}} upstream of the River Furu in 1990. In addition to these counter-measures, several measures have been proposed in our previous papers. The latest paper showed an optimum plan of drainage systems along the River Furu from the viewpoint of minimum cost of construction. This paper deals continually with an optimum plan of drainage systems in the whole of the Ogura basin which consists of three sub-basins such as the Jodan, the Chudan, and the Gedan Zones from the viewpoint of minimizing a total amount of annual interests, depreciation, and maintenance of <b>drainage</b> <b>equipment.</b> In particular, two counter-measures against the increase of flood runoff due to urbanization in the Nakauchi and Ouchi sub-basins situated {{in the western part of}} the Gedan Zone are examined. The one of them is the improvement of existing drainage systems in these sub-basins connected with the Gedan Main Channel through two culverts, and the other is the separation of the drainage systems from the Gedan Main Channel after closing these culverts and constructing the new drainage pump station at the downstream end of the River Ouchi. As the result, it has been clarified that there is little difference in total amount of annual cost of these measures, and that the separating plan has an advantage of reduction of annual flood damage of paddy field in the Gedan Zone...|$|E

Another innovation {{in recent years is}} the use of closed circuit escape respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised. Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation in America, when measured by fatality rate. However, these numbers include all mining, with oil and gas mining contributing the majority of fatalities; coal mining resulted in only 47 fatalities that year.|$|R

Levanta-se entÃo a hipÃtese da captaÃÃo dos recursos para construÃÃo de infraestrutura hÃdrica por meio da cobranÃa pelo uso da Ãgua bruta. Pergunta-se entÃo qual seria o impacto na cobranÃa da Ãgua se o custo da construÃÃo da infraestrutura hÃdrica fosse aplicado na cobranÃa pelo uso da Ãgua bruta, juntamente com os custos de AOM (AdministraÃÃo, OperaÃÃo e ManutenÃÃo). Avaliou-se o custo financeiro da implantaÃÃo de sistemas de armazenamento e transferÃncia hÃdrica em atividades de abastecimento dâÃgua, comparando-se o custo unitÃrio da Ãgua bruta com a capacidade de pagamento dos usuÃrios de Ãgua. Utilizaram-se dados de construÃÃo de reservatÃrios e adutoras no CearÃ, calculou-se a anuidade para pagamento destas obras aplicando variÃveis correntes de tempo de pagamento e juros. Com a vazÃo anual regularizada e o custo de construÃÃo das obras, pÃde-se estimar um custo para esta Ãgua, e assim comparÃ-lo Ãs tarifas pagas pelos usuÃrios atualmente e a sua capacidade de pagamento. PÃde-se observar uma relaÃÃo entre os custos de construÃÃo das infraestruturas e as vazÃes regularizadas dos equipamentos de abastecimento estudados (barragens e adutoras). A melhor curva de tendÃncia que se encaixou nos grÃficos de dispersÃo entre os custos de abastecimento estimados para pagamento de infraestrutura âversusâ vazÃo regularizada foi a curva de potÃncia. Os valores obtidos para a capacidade de pagamento em outros trabalhos publicados (Marques, 2009 e Tahal, 2003) se mostraram dentro da ordem de grandeza dos valores obtidos no presente trabalho, levando a se {{considerar}} que existe a possibilidade do pagamento destas obras, de maneira amortizada, para os usuÃrios nÃo a tornando totalmente inviÃvel. The {{works of}} water infrastructure often clash {{over the issue}} of lack of financial resources for the construction and operation. It then becomes the hypothesis of obtaining the funds for water infrastructure construction by charging for the raw water. Then, comes up the question: what is the impact on water charges if the cost of water infrastructure construction would be applied in charging for the raw water, together with the costs of MOM (Management, Operation and Maintenance). We evaluated the financial cost of the deployment of systems of water storage and transfer activities in water supply, comparing the unitary cost of raw water with the ability of users to pay for this water. The data set used was the total costs for the construction of reservoirs and aqueducts in CearÃ, we calculated the annuity payment for these works by applying current variables of time and interest payment. With the annual regulated flow and cost of construction works, we could estimate a cost for this water, and then compare it to current user fees and payment capacity. Was observed a relationship between the cost of building infrastructure and regular <b>drainage</b> <b>equipment</b> supply studied (dams and pipelines). The best trend line that fit the scatterplots between supply costs estimated for the payment of infrastructure âversusâ regulated flow was the power curve. The values obtained for the ability to pay in other published works (Marques, 2009 and Tahal, 2003) were within an order of magnitude of values obtained in this work, leading to consider that there is a possibility for the users to pay for these works, in an amortized way, so it doesnât become totally impracticable...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} spatial panel data models can be {{successfully}} applied to an econometric analysis of farm-scale precision agriculture data. The application {{focuses on the}} estimation {{of the effect of}} controlled <b>drainage</b> water management <b>equipment</b> on corn yields. Using field-level precision agriculture data and spatial panel techniques, the yield response equation is estimated using the spatial autoregressive error random effects model with temporal heterogeneity, incorporating spatial dependence in the error term, while controlling for the topography, weather and the controlled drainage treatment. Controlling for random effects allows for the disentanglement of the effects of spatial dependence from spatial heterogeneity and omitted variables, and thus, to properly investigate the yield response. The results show that controlled drainage has a statistically significant effect on corn yields. The effect is generally positive but varies widely from year to year and field-to-field. For the two years of data controlled drainage was linked to a 2. 2 % increase in field average yield, but that varied from a - 2. 6 % to a + 6. 5 %. Evaluated at mean elevation and slope in the east part of the field, controlled drainage is associated with 10 bu/a increase and a 0. 6 bu/a decrease in yields in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In the West part of the field, controlled drainage is associated with a 11 bu/a increase in 2006 and 2. 81 bu/a decrease in 2005.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} depends much on uncontrollable weather conditions, {{which often}} threatens farmers' livelihoods. Weather risks are {{especially important for}} farmers in developing countries where they are still cultivating with conventional methods and less well developed irrigation and <b>drainage</b> systems and <b>equipment.</b> Moreover, seasonality and cyclicality hinder growth of agricultural sectors and make farm households' incomes unstable. Two measures for dealing with such problems in the agricultural sector include 1) Governmental price intervention {{and the expansion of}} farming bases, and 2) the establishment of governmentally run agricultural disaster insurance. As stated later, even though government {{plays a major role in}} an agricultural insurance program in most developing countries through the subsidization of premiums for insurance, there is still little difference in the basic principles of insurance between developed and undeveloped countries. Generally speaking, conditions for farming in Korea are never very good. Due to monsoons and continental climate Korea often is in the range of typhoons with heavy rains during summertime but with very dry weather in the springtime, which adversely affects paddy-crop farming. A crop insurance program for the purpose of stabilizing farm income fluctuation is discussed, along with the obstacles, in chapter VII. These obstacles have repeatedly blocked the idea of introducing crop insurance programs for the agricultural sector. This paper is the result of my strong desire to establish agricultural insurance programs in the rural area of Korea to help farmers enjoy more stable lives and contribute to agricultural production. Even though agriculture is decreasing in Korea as a proportion of the national economy, about ten million people still depend on the success of agriculture. Korean agriculture is still producing more then fifteen percent of the national GNP. I will specialize on crop insurance for rice which is Korea's major crop and probably the leading candidate for the introduction of crop insurance programs into Korean agriculture.
