500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{character}} Zampanò came from Fellini's youth in the coastal town of Rimini.

[...] The accident is also {{referred to in the}} 1998 film One of Them. In Money, Love: A Novel by Brad Barkley, the character Roman organizes a show of Celebrity Death Cars, including that of Dean and Mansfield, to win back his love interest Gladys. In the song Movie Star by the rock band Cracker sang, [...] "Well the movie star, well she crashed her car, but <b>everyone</b> <b>said</b> she was beautiful even without her head, <b>everyone</b> <b>said</b> she was dangerous", making an allusion to the accident.

The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls dreaming of becoming Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-synching the song. Halliwell commented about the shoot: [...] "The women were all really warm and funny and nice. The freakiest thing about it was seeing Jennifer Saunders. She looked just like me and <b>everyone</b> <b>said</b> they thought she was me. It was alsolutely bizarre–the make-up, everything. It was scary–like, do I really do that?".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} SpongeBob and Patrick {{playing a game}} of Eels and Escalators, which is a parody of Snakes and Ladders, was {{difficult}} for the crew to animate, since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location. According to the series' season 2 DVD commentary, it was planned to have a scene that had SpongeBob saying [...] "Go 'dolphin noise' yourself" [...] followed by Patrick saying [...] "'Dolphin noise' you too!" [...] during the Eels and Escalators game. It was removed in the final episode check {{because it would have}} been inappropriate for the younger audience. The initial decision to use dolphin noises in place of a traditional bleep was also influenced by concerns over the episode's suitability for its audience. Stephen Hillenburg recalled in 2016, [...] "I pitched the idea that SpongeBob and Patrick learn a swearword. <b>Everyone</b> <b>said</b> no. I couldn't even use a bleep. So I used a dolphin sound instead." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them."

On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. <b>Everyone</b> <b>said</b> don't worry about it, but every time I did one of those scenes I had to watch it back and see how it looked because there will be 10 million people watching it.

500|$|Seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Hamence made 38. Hamence was the ninth man to fall as partners ran out and Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361. Despite this, they completed an innings victory. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Hamence batted at No. 7 and only had a limited opportunity to contribute, coming in at 5/532 and scoring 24 before Bradman declared at 5/610 when Hassett reached 200. Hamence bowled in both innings for a total of 1/41 as Australia won by an innings. In the next match against Somerset, Hamence put on 195 for the fifth wicket with Ian Johnson to take Australia to 4/501 with his score on 99. The other batsmen had all made centuries, and the Australian players were keen to see Hamence do the same. With his score on 99, {{the rest of the team}} left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone. However, Hamence hit two balls from the middle of the bat, only to see them travel directly to the fielder, yielding no runs. Anxious to reach his century, Hamence then charged down the pitch and was then stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. According to Bradman, Hamence [...] "fell to what <b>everyone</b> <b>said</b> was the best ball all day". Nevertheless, Australia won by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the South of England, Hamence made seven as Australia declared at 7/522. The match was washed out; Hamence bowled three overs without success in the hosts' only innings.|$|E

[...] Harris was fond of the development, {{in spite of the}} fact that the record did not sell as well as its predecessor in the United States; [...] "I thought it was the best album we did since Piece of Mind. I loved it because it was more progressive—I thought the keyboards really fitted in brilliantly—'cause that's the influences I grew up with, and I was so pissed off with the Americans, because they didn't really seem to accept it. <b>Everyone</b> <b>said</b> afterwards that it was a European-sounding album.

Pederick was released after serving eight years in jail and stated: [...] "I guess I was quite unique in the prison system in that I had to keep proving my guilt, whereas <b>everyone</b> else <b>said</b> they were innocent." ...|$|R

Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and <b>everyone</b> <b>said</b> [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
2500|$|They also {{formed an}} {{organisation}} called the Association for the Revitalization of China. It {{was dedicated to}} getting support from China for independence movements in smaller Asian countries, starting with Vietnam of course. Using a medical centre as a front, and a fancy office they managed to create the false impression {{that they were a}} huge successful organisation. They got hundreds of people to join, and sold a huge amount of their made-up currency. They changed some of the leadership positions of the [...] "Vietnam Restoration League" [...] to allow the Chinese to take part. However, they could not get enough money to buy more weapons until they had proved themselves with a military attack of some sort. <b>Everyone</b> <b>said</b> they needed something big and explosive because the people of Vietnam were short on patience. So Phan sent five people with a few grenades to the three regions of Vietnam. The grenades they sent to the North were used on a minor target, the governor of Thái Bình province, two officers and a French restaurateur. They were meant to be used at the mandarin examinations when all the officials would be gathered. Those they sent to the centre via Thailand did not make it to Vietnam at the time, and they had to throw their grenades away. Those that they sent to the south were used on some Vietnamese. The attacks in the North enraged the French, and they demanded Phan be arrested, but the Chinese government refused. But the value of Phan's special currency dropped dramatically after the failure.|$|E
