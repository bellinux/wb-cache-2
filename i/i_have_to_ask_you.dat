6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{you will not}} {{consider}} my errand here a particularly pleasant one, Herr Captain. I have a warrant here for the arrest of one of your passengers, whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to hand over to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|After Mr. Longways had finished, he smacked {{his lips}} and set down his glass with a great air. [...] "And now," [...] says he, with a comical grimace of vanity and self-importance, [...] "let us to {{business}} without loss of more time. First of all, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> sir, {{do you know what}} all this treasure is for?" ...|$|E
5000|$|William Fitzpatrick: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her <b>to</b> {{take off}} her {{knickers}} four times before she did it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear," [...] {{continued}} Sharpeye, with a smile, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your {{forgiveness for}} <b>having</b> ventured really <b>to</b> practise deception on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} {{mentioned}} that, sir, because I purpose staying at Silverdale now," [...] he said. [...] "It leads up <b>to</b> what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that I am in a tiff, Sir Francis. I hope I am not, because what I have to say is too serious for ill-humour." [...] Then she paused. [...] "What I have got to say is of some importance;--of very great importance. Sir Francis Geraldine, I feel that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to forgive me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{it went on}} {{till the}} {{afternoon}} when we saw you. As I told you, he made us go down at once. I {{could see that he}} was furiously angry and excited. The steward came to our cabin early in the morning, and said that Mr. Carthew requested that we would dress and come up at once. As I was anxious to know what was going on, I did so; and he said when we came on deck, 'I am very sorry, Miss Greendale, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to go on shore with us at once.' ...|$|E
60|$|AUSTIN. Surely. I know. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> then to {{find what}} friends you can among this company; {{and if you have}} none, to make them. Let {{everybody}} hear the news. Tell it (if I may offer the suggestion) with humour: how Mr. Austin, somewhat upon the wane, but still filled with sufficiency, gloriously presumed and was most ingloriously set down by a young lady from the north: the lady's name a secret, which you will permit to be divined. The laugh--the position of the hero--will make it circulate;--you perceive I am in earnest;--and in this way I believe our young friend will find himself forestalled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to do so. I cannot but feel, however, how little right <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her, seeing that I am likely to be so poor a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, that is arranged. Now for {{the first}} thing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of you. If Mr. Rosario comes, I do not wish that message from my husband to be delivered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} keep you waiting such a long time," [...] she murmured, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you first--for your friendship, and you weren't very kind to die. But I can't." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a {{thousand}} pardons for not fulfilling some orders before I left town; {{but if you}} knew all the cursed entanglements I had to wade through, it would be unnecessary to beg your forgiveness.--When will Parliament (the new one) meet [8]?--in sixty days, on account of Ireland, I presume: the Irish election will demand a longer period for completion than the constitutional allotment. Yours, of course, is safe, and all {{your side of the}} question. Salamanca is the ministerial watchword, and all will go well with you. I hope you will speak more frequently, I am sure at least you ought, and it will be expected. I see Portman means to stand again. Good night.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{just one}} other thing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> sir, and I should {{take it as a}} kind return for all this explanation, if you could do it for me. You {{remember}} that Testament that was picked up. I always carried it in my inside pocket, and it must have come out in my fall. I value it very highly, for it was the family book with my birth and my brother's marked by my father in the beginning of it. I wish you would apply at the proper place and have it sent to me. It can be of no possible value to anyone else. If you address it to X, Bassano's Library, Broadway, New York, it is sure to come to hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|But he did {{not leave}} her. When he had gone from her down the hill the {{distance}} that has been named, he turned back, and came up to her slowly. He had a trick of standing and walking with his thumbs fixed into the armholes of his waistcoat, while his large hands rested on his breast. He would always assume this attitude when he was assured that he was right in his views, and was eager to carry some point at issue. Clara already understood that this attitude signified his intention to be autocratic. He now came close up to her, and again stood over her, before he spoke. [...] "My dear," [...] he said, [...] "I have been rough and hasty in what I have said to you, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to pardon my want of manners." ...|$|E
60|$|DICK. But I {{shall be}} {{of age in}} a year; my money's my own, it's not as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any one's leave; and I mean, I do know my own mind.|$|R
60|$|We {{unloaded}} {{the canoe}} and ate. Bastin's appetite was splendid. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>to</b> {{remember that when}} this supply was done I {{did not know where}} we should find any more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Dorcas, {{that is all}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you." [...] He {{rose and}} strolled to the window. [...] "I have been admiring these flower beds. How many gardeners are {{employed}} here, by the way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must tell}} you, sir," [...] said the lady, {{after she had}} {{permitted}} her guest to examine {{this for a while}} in silence, [...] "that though this appears to you to be of little worth, it is yet of extreme value. After all, however, it is nothing but a curiosity that any one who is interested in such matters might possess. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> is this: Will you be willing to take this into your charge, to guard it with the utmost care and fidelity--yes, even as the apple of your eye--during your continuance in these parts, and to return it to me in safety the day before your departure. By so doing you will render me a service which you may neither understand nor comprehend, but which shall make me your debtor for my entire life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will believe," [...] she began, [...] "that the few {{questions}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> are to satisfy my own heart, and for no other purpose." [...] She smiled sadly as she went on. [...] "Had it been otherwise, I should have instituted a legal inquiry, and left this interview to some one cooler, calmer, and less interested than myself. But I think, I know I can trust you. Perhaps we women are weak and foolish to talk of an instinct, and when you know my story you may {{have reason to believe}} that but little dependence can be placed on that; but I am not wrong in saying,--am I?" [...] (with a sad smile) [...] "that you are not above that weakness?" [...] She paused, closed her lips tightly, and grasped her hands before her. [...] "You say you found that ring in the road some three months before--the--the--you know what I mean--the body--was discovered?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is quite}} horrid {{for me to}} have to tell you (and after a little delay caused by a glut of correspondence, at once, and a {{pressure}} of other occupations) that your gentle appeal, on your friend's behalf, in the matter of the [...] "favourite quotation," [...] finds me utterly helpless and embarrassed. The perverse collectress proposes, I fear, to collect the impossible! I haven't a favourite quotation--absolutely not: any more than I have a favourite day in the year, a favourite letter in the alphabet or a favourite wave in the sea! And the collectress, in general, has ever found me dark and dumb and odious, and I am too aged and obstinate and brutal to change! Such is the sorry tale <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> all patiently to hear. I wish you were, or had been, coming over to see me from Canterbury--instead of labouring in that barren vineyard of other friendship. Do come without fail the next time you are there; and believe me your--and your sister's--very faithful even if very flowerless and leafless well-wisher from long ago, ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sam's {{account of}} the matter,' replied Perker, 'is, I will venture to say, a {{perfectly}} correct one. Well now, my dear Sir, the first question <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> is, whether this woman is to remain here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} no {{progress}} with my work," [...] she said slowly, [...] "and the money was gone. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mr. Courtlaw for his true verdict, and he gave it me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> given up painting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{a friend}} of Duncombe's, Mr. Pelham," [...] he said, [...] "and that is enough. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> not only you, but all three of you, to {{consider}} what I am {{going to tell you}} as absolutely confidential." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} here, as I said, upon business; but, had I {{come looking for}} pleasure, I {{could not have been}} more displeased with my {{reception}} nor more dissatisfied with my company. You, sir," [...] addressing Mr. Rolles, [...] "you have treated your superior in station with discourtesy; you, Vandeleur, receive me with a smile, but you know right well that your hands are not yet cleansed from misconduct. I do not desire to be interrupted, sir," [...] he added imperiously; [...] "I am here to speak, and not to listen; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to hear me with respect, and to obey punctiliously. At the earliest possible date your daughter shall be married at the Embassy to my friend, Francis Scrymgeour, your brother's acknowledged son. You will oblige me by offering not less than ten thousand pounds dowry. For yourself, I will indicate to you in writing a mission of some importance in Siam which I destine to your care. And now, sir, you will answer me in two words whether or not you agree to these conditions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the first}} part of the service: now for the second. You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those {{obstacles}} that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] she said, {{speaking}} in accents {{of the most}} silvery and musical cadence, [...] "you are no doubt vastly surprised to find yourself thus unexpectedly, and almost as by violence, introduced into the house of one who is such an entire stranger to you as myself. But though I am unknown to you, I must inform you that I am better acquainted with my visitor, for my agents have been observing you ever since you landed this afternoon at the dock, and they have followed you ever since, until a little while ago, when you stopped immediately opposite my garden gate. These agents have observed you with a closeness of scrutiny of which you are doubtless entirely unaware. They have even informed me that, owing doubtless to your extreme interest in your new surroundings, you have not as yet supped. Knowing this, and that you must now be enjoying a very hearty appetite, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you will do me the extreme favor of sitting at table with me at a repast which you will doubtless {{be surprised to learn}} has been hastily prepared entirely in your honor." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CICELY (relieved). Oh, that's all right. It {{would have}} been so awkward if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> one of your men to turn out. You won't mind, I know. (All the men stare at her. Even Drinkwater forgets his sorrows in his stupefaction.) ...|$|R
6000|$|This was a poser to me. I {{could not}} at the moment recall Enoch's appositeness, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was {{lowering}} myself {{in the eyes of}} the lunatic. [...] "And why with Enoch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was in {{too much}} of a hurry to get one, and I gave all my money to the man who drove the car. That's why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> pay my fare. You see, I'm not too proud to use your money after all.' ...|$|R
60|$|As for coin, you see I don't spend much, {{only you}} and Henley both {{seem to think}} my work rather bosh nowadays, and I do want to make as much as I was making, that is 200 pounds; if I can do that, I can swim: last year, with my ill health I touched only 109 pounds, that would not do, I could not fight it through on that; but on 200 pounds, as I say, I am good for the world, and can even in this quiet way save a little, and that I must do. The worst is my health; it is {{suspected}} I had an ague chill yesterday; I shall know by to-morrow, and you know if I am to be laid down with ague the game is pretty well lost. But I don't know; I managed to write a good deal down in Monterey, when I was pretty sickly most of the time, and, by God, I'll try, ague and all. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> frankly, when you write, to give me any good news you can, and chat a little, but JUST IN THE MEANTIME, give me no bad. If I could get THOREAU, EMIGRANT and VENDETTA all finished and out of my hand, I should feel {{like a man who}} had made half a year's income in a half year; but until the two last are FINISHED, you see, they don't fairly count.|$|E
5000|$|Interviewer: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{this because}} it's been killing {{me for the}} past five years. On the song A Sorta Fairytale ... you sing about pulling back the hood. Are you talking about the hood I think you're talking about? ...|$|E
5000|$|On 4 February 1940, Mackensen {{wrote to}} Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch:"As a man becomes older, {{he has to}} watch {{carefully}} that age has not reduced his creativity. After reaching the age of 90, I {{have decided not to}} involve myself any longer with matters that are not concerned with my private life. However, I am still the most senior German officer. Many turn to me, sometimes with wishes, but more often with their concerns.During these weeks our concern is with the spirit of our unique and successful Army. The concern results from the crimes committed in Poland, looting and murder that take place before the eyes of our troops, who appear unable {{to put an end to}} them. An apparent indifference has serious consequences for the morale of our soldiers and it is damaging to the esteem of our Army and our whole nation.I am sure that you are aware of these events and that you certainly condemn them. These lines intend to convey my daily growing concern at the reports that constantly reach me, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to take up this matter with the highest authority. The messages I receive are so numerous, many come from high ranking persons and from witnesses. As the most senior officer I cannot keep them to myself. In transmitting them to you, I fulfil my duty to the Army. The honour of the Army and the esteem in which it is held must not be jeopardised by the actions of hired subhumans and criminals. Sieg heil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Bounderby,' {{she went}} on in a steady, {{straight}} way, without regarding this, 'asks me to marry him. The question <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> myself is, shall I marry him? That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father. Have you not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because your {{presence}} {{may be required}} here. You and Mr Mason will remain where you are to guard the girls, until I return. All that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is, that you be in readiness to follow me at a moment's notice when the time comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing whatever, ma'am,' replied Mr. Jackson. 'How de do, ladies? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> pardon, ladies, for intruding--but the law, ladies--the law.' With this apology Mr. Jackson smiled, made a {{comprehensive}} bow, {{and gave his}} hair another wind. Mrs. Rogers whispered Mrs. Raddle {{that he was really}} an elegant young man.|$|R
