40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} calculation of thermal conductivity of nanofluids contain-ing nanoparticles and nanotubes {{on the basis of}} statistical mechanics is presented. This appears to be the first such attempt published in the scientific literature. We focus on the influence of the liquid layer structure around nanoparticles as the reason for enhancement of the thermal con-ductivity of nanofluids. Analytical results of both the current analysis and statistical mechanics are compared with experimental data reported in the scientific literature, which show good agreement.

40|$|Summary The {{heat output}} from {{conventional}} hot water radiators falls as the return temperature is reduced. Experimental results show {{a much lower}} heat output from a pressed steel radiator than that calculated using the conventional formula based on the mean of flow and return water temperatures. The fall in output is especially marked when using bottom, opposite end water connections to the radiator, as in conventional British practice. This reduction in output has implications {{for the design of}} systems which are designed to operate a t low flow rates. Output of radiators at reduced flow rate D. A.

40|$|The {{infrared}} plasma reflectivity {{and free}} carrier absorption of heavily Si-doped n-type GaAs are examined {{and the results}} show that shallow re-flectivity minima (Rm ~ 14 %) and increased free carrier absorption cross sections are a consequence of high levels of compensation in the samples. The frequency dependence of the extinction coefficient k in compensated as well as uncompensated samples is found to be different from that described by the Drude-Zener theory in the frequency region near or higher than the plasma-edge frequency. Based on the experimental ly observed frequency dependence of <b>k,</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are evaluated in determining carrier con-centration from the frequency of the infrared plasma reflectivity minimum when the reflectivity minimum is shallow. The <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are applied to the measured results of a series of samples and the resulting carrier con-centrations are compared with those obtained from Hall effect measurements. Infrared plasma reflectivity and free carrier absorp-tion measurements of n-type GaAs have been re-ported by a number of investigators. The reflectivity of samples with a carrier concentration e> 1017 cm- 3 shows the effect of a plasma frequency ~p which is higher than that for the fundamental lattice reflectiv-ity band (1) (restrahl). A reflectivity minimum is ob-served (1) at a frequency above the plasma-edge fre-quency. The minimum is deep with Rm [...] ~ 2 % and the frequency-'(Rm) - ~'m {{has been used as a}} measure-ment (2, 3) of ne. In some cases ne is determined from another measurement and the reflectivity data have been used with ne to obtain carrier effective mass val-ues in a number of semiconductor materials (1, 4). In some recently reported measurements (3) of Si-doped GaAs it was found that the Rm value could vary from < 4 % to as large as 14 %. The Si doping level and the thermal history of the sample both influence the Rm value. The present study relates the presence of the shallow reflectivity minimum (large Rm) to an increase in the free carrier absorption cross section. The validity of using ~m as a measure of ne for a sam-ple with a shallow minimum is also examined...|$|R

Model atmospheres for {{pulsating}} Mira variables {{have been}} used to examine the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> that should be used to convert radial velocities derived from the Doppler profiles of observed infrared lines into the velocities immediately above and below the strong shock in the atmosphere. The <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> varies by a moderate amount depending on the lines selected. <b>Correction</b> <b>factors</b> of ∼ 1. 25 and 1. 4 are appropriate for the conversion of the observed velocities of the outflowing, post-shock and infalling pre-shock material, respectively, when the lines are strong. This is the case for the low excitation CO 1 st vibrational overtone lines in the <b>K</b> band. A <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 6 or more is appropriate for the weaker lines of OH and the 2 nd vibrational overtone of CO in the H band. These results mean that the true pulsation velocity amplitude of a typical Mira variable is ∼ 34 km s − 1.

Previous workers indicated that a small but reproducible fractionation of (34 S) /S- 32 exists between the product SO, gas and the mineral. The magnitude of this fractionation varies with bond strength, as reflected in Gibbs free energy of formation at 298. 15 <b>K.</b> The <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are known for common sulfides and anhydrite but not, hitherto, for stibnite and the sulfosalt minerals, which are important constituents of many classes of ore deposits. We present the <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for the following chemically and crystallographically well- characterized minerals: stibnite (weighted mean = - 1. 2 %o), bournonite (+ 0. 6 %o), tetrahedrite (+ 1. 3 %o), and boulangerite (+ 1. 4 %o). The Gibbs free energies of formation of these phases have been approximated by the sulfide summation method, and the correlation of DeltaG(298) (0), with the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for the sulfosalts fits well with the trend previously established for simple sulfides. There is an excellent correlation between the fractionation factor and mineral composition, a parameter that does result in bond strength variations (e. g., mol fraction of PbS in sulfosalts), allowing estimation of the <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for simple intermediate compositions. Finally, bond strength also varies with variation in interatomic distances, and we have, therefore, investigated the behaviour of stibnite, a strongly anisotropic mineral. Our results indicate that there is a significant variation in fractionation factor, depending on crystal orientation. The fractionation factor along the prismatic b-axis, which displays the strongest chemical bonds (as monitored by the shortest bond lengths), is more negative (- 1. 7 %o) than along the other crystallographic directions (- 0. 7 to - 1. 0 %o), which is in full agreement with theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the application of the technique in unravelling source- and process-related sulfur isotope systematics in two hydrothermal vein systems in the classic mining area of the NE Rhenish Massif, both studies requiring resolution beyond the scale of conventional sulfur isotope analysis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the aerodynamics of elastic membrane flapping wings. Several {{applications of the}} actuator disk theory to the flapping wings of insects and birds are reviewed. In previous studies, to account for spatial and temporal variance in the wake behind the flapping wings, empirical corrections were proposed for the induced velocity and power. In the present paper, a new procedure for determination of the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is proposed, using membrane-type flapping-wing devices. Wind-tunnel experiments were conducted and the stroke-averaged propulsive thrust was measured on 25 -cm-wingspan (flat and 9 % camber) and 74 -cm-wingspan flapping-wing models. Either flapping frequency or input power was held constant during the tests. Obtained thrust forces were compared to theoretical values predicted by the actuator disk theory. Empirical <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> to the actuator disk theory were determined, providing a best fit to the experimental data when the flapping axis aligned with freestream velocity. It is noteworthy that the numerical value for the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for the 25 cm cambered wing agrees with {{the results obtained on}} large insects.

40|$|Field CO 2 {{production}} {{was related to}} soil carbon pools and fluxes determined by laboratory incubation of soils from agroecosystems designed to test the possibility of substituting biological for chemical inputs. Treatments included: conventional and organic-based row crops, woody and herbaceous perennial crops and historically tilled and never tilled successional fields. The CO 2 efflux in corn and soybeans was affected by crop residues from previous years and growing season temperatures but not soil moisture. Overwinter cover crops and perennials such as alfalfa and poplar, resulted in fairly uniform fluxes of approximately 20 kg CO 2 –C ha ÿ 1 dayÿ 1 throughout the non-frozen period. Highest fluxes occurred in alfalfa, historically tilled successional and never tilled, grassland successional treatments, although, highest aboveground productivity occurred in the corn and poplar.

40|$|Sandwich panels {{have been}} {{developed}} to either design a lighter structure capable of carrying prescribed loads or to increase the load-carrying capacity subject to limitations on the weight. The major load-carrying elements of a sandwich structure are its facings, while the core primarily serves to resist transverse shear loads, enhance local strength and stability of the facings, and combine two facings into a single structural system. The facings being subject to bending and in-plane tensile/compressive loads and to in-plane shear, their strength and stiffness are paramount to the sandwich structure. In the present paper we investigate advantages of so-called “stepped ” facings with geometry modified to locally enhance the strength and stiffness at strategically important locations with a minimum effect on the weight. We illustrate that sandwich designs with stepped facings can be attractive in static problems concerned with strength and stability, while their advantage in situations where it is necessary to increase the fundamental frequency of the panel is less pronounced.

The sensitivity of the finite-width <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> {{as a function of the}} opening aspect ratio is also discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} document provides details of derived <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for the Eberline R 0 - 20 survey meter, which uses an ionization chamber to measure ambient exposure rates. A thin end window allows the instrument to measure exposure rates from non-penetrating radiation (i. e., beta radiation). <b>Correction</b> <b>factors</b> are provided for contact measurements with beta and gamma disk sources, gamma beams and, finally, general area beta fields. Beta <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> {{are based on}} the instrument's response to 204 Tl, selected as the most conservative isotope for beta <b>correction</b> <b>factors,</b> as indicated in previous studies of similar instruments using 204 Tl, 147 Pm, and 90 Sr(Y) isotopes (LANL 1982). Gamma <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are based on 137 Cs, considered the predominant source of gamma radiation on the Hanford Site...|$|R

40|$|A {{continuum}} {{formulation of}} spreading resistance <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> {{is derived from}} the Choo et al. recursion relation for the kernel of the spread-ing resistance <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> integral. Specifically, a differential equation for the kernel of the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> integral is derived in the limit as the layer thickness approaches zero. The resulting differential equation is non-l inear and inhomogeneous but can be transformed into a l inear second order equation which can be solved analytically in several cases. The continuum form of the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is compared with the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> generated from the finite-layer thickness version of the Laplace equation description for the case of an exponential ly varying resistivity. Depending upon the number of layers used, the exponential constant, and the total thickness of the structure, the continuum and discrete forms of the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> differ by factors as large as 2. 75 thus indicating a limitation in the accuracy of finite layer algorithms for spreading resistance data interpretation...|$|R

The present <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> were found to overestimate actual moisture content by 0. 6 to 4. 5 percent moisture content. A new table of <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> has been generated for both black spruce and jack pine. Implications of applying this new <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> in industry are also discussed. OBJECTIVES The primary objective {{of this study was to}} develop new <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> to be used on D. C. resistance moisture meter readings taken on high temperature dried material. The secondary objectives were to test the application of this <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> on industrially dried material and recommend procedures for its application by industry or grading association personnel...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} three {{dimensional}} radiative transfer model {{to examine the}} effects of resonance line scattering in the post-shock flow behind a non-radiative supernova remnant shock. For a rippled shock front viewed edge-on, line scattering significantly reduces the observed flux of C IV λ 1549 and N V λ 1240, two important diagnostic lines in the ultraviolet spectra of supernova remnants. The <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (defined to be the ratio of the line flux that would be observed neglecting scattering, to the actual observed line flux) is a function of position within the filament. For sufficiently large regions that include crisp edges as well as more diffuse regions of the filament structure, the C IV and N V <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are between about 1. 5 and 3. 5 (and the C IV <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is invariably larger than the N V <b>correction</b> <b>factor).</b> The <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> have a larger range when smaller regions are considered. The C IV <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is about 6 at the filament edges, while the N V <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is about 4. These simulations of resonance line scattering will be useful for the analysis of supernova remnant shock spectra...|$|R
40|$|Biliary {{clearance}} (CL b) {{is often}} underestimated by in vitro – in vivo extrapolation from sandwich‐cultured hepatocytes (SCHs). The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the performance of a universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> with transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> in correcting underestimation of CL b. The apparent in vitro CL b of a training set of 21 compounds was determined using the SCH model and extrapolated to apparent in vivo CL b (CL b, app). A universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (10. 2) was obtained by a linear regression of the predicted CL b, app and observed in vivo CL b of training set compounds and applied to an independent test set (n = 20); the corrected CL b predictions of 13 compounds were within twofold error of observed values. Furthermore, two transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> (Organic anion transporting polypeptides/multidrug‐resistance‐related protein 2 and diffusion/P‐glycoprotein) were estimated by linear regression analysis of training set compounds. The applications of the two <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> to the test set resulted in improved prediction precision. In conclusion, both the universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> and transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> provided reasonable <b>corrections</b> of CL b values, which are often underestimated by the SCH model. The use of transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> resulted in an even greater improvement of predictions for compounds with intermediate‐to‐high CL b values. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 102 : 2837 – 2850, 201...|$|R
