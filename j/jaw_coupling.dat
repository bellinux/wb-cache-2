5000|$|A <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> {{is a type}} {{of general}} purpose power {{transmission}} coupling that also can be used in motion control (servo) applications. It is designed to transmit torque (by connecting two shafts) while damping system vibrations and accommodating misalignment, which protects other components from damage. Jaw couplings are composed of three parts: two metallic hubs and an elastomer insert called an element, but commonly referred to as a [...] "spider". The three parts press fit together with a jaw from each hub fitted alternately with the lobes of the spider. <b>Jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> torque is transmitted through the elastomer lobes in compression.|$|E
5000|$|Jaw {{couplings}} {{are considered}} [...] "fail-safe" [...] because, should the elastomer fail or wear away, the <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> hub teeth will mate, much like teeth on two gears, {{and continue to}} transmit torque. This {{may or may not}} be desirable to the user depending on the application.|$|E

5000|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic predators, but scientists propose that C. megalodon was [...] "arguably {{the most formidable}} carnivore ever to have existed". Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful <b>jaws,</b> <b>coupled</b> with a formidable killing apparatus, made it a super-predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} fauna. A study about calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranchs revealed that C. megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark.|$|R
5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful <b>jaws,</b> <b>coupled</b> with a formidable feeding apparatus, {{made it an}} apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to say it was higher up in the food chain.|$|R
50|$|Jaw {{couplings}} elastomers {{are wearing}} elements that {{do need to}} be inspected and replaced. <b>Jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> elastomers often have signature wear patterns, and failures can often be root caused based {{on the condition of}} the elastomer and hubs. Common failure causes include misalignment, over-torque, chemical exposure, temperature exposure, torsional vibrations, and hub failure.|$|E
50|$|Zero-backlash curved jaw {{couplings}} {{are best}} suited for applications that rely on a stop-and-go type of movement, where accuracy needs to take place upon stopping in order to perform any number of precision tasks, such as taking a high resolution picture (machine vision system). Absorbing vibrations decreases the settling time the system needs, which increases through-put. The curved <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> is less suited for applications that rely on a constant scanning type of motion, where accuracy is required during movement, which requires a torsionally stronger coupling.|$|E
50|$|The {{powered axles}} of the ER2 {{trainset}} are individually driven: each axle {{is powered by}} its own traction motor, which {{is connected to the}} axle by a pair of spur gears with a torque ratio of 3.17 (73:23) in a fully enclosed gearbox. The large gear with a transmission modulus of 10 is mounted directly on the axle, whereas the small gear is on a shaft which is mounted on 2 ball bearings (on early trains) or roller bearings (on later trains). The gearbox casing is mounted on the axle by means of a sealed roller bearing, and is also attached to the truck frame via a special suspension. Initially this suspension comprised a sickle-shaped link with 2 rubber and metal shock absorbers, but beginning in 1969 this was replaced by a vertical rod with 4 such shock absorbers (as on the ER22). During motion of the train, the frame-suspended motors constantly move relative to the axles, which requires some kind of flexible drive to accommodate this motion. On early ER2s this was achieved by means of a <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> between the motor shaft and the intermediate drive shaft, but on later trains, rubber rag joints were used instead. The first such joint was fitted to an ER2 in 1964 as an experiment; in late 1965, five more prototypes with rubber couplings were built, and from 1966 onward these became standard on all new ER2s.|$|E
40|$|Trait decoupling, wherein {{evolutionary}} {{release of}} constraints permits specialization of formerly integrated structures, represents a major {{conceptual framework for}} interpreting patterns of organismal diversity. However, few empirical tests of this hypothesis exist. A central prediction, that the tempo of morphological evolution and ecological diversification should increase following decoupling events, remains inadequately tested. In damselfishes (Pomacentridae), a ceratomandibular ligament links the hyoid bar and lower <b>jaws,</b> <b>coupling</b> two main morphofunctional units directly involved in both feeding and sound production. Here, we test the decoupling hypothesis by examining the evolutionary consequences {{of the loss of}} the ceratomandibular ligament in multiple damselfish lineages. As predicted, we find that rates of morphological evolution of trophic structures increased following the loss of the ligament. However, this increase in evolutionary rate is not associated with an increase in trophic breadth, but rather with morphofunctional specialization for the capture of zooplanktonic prey. Lineages lacking the ceratomandibular ligament also shows different acoustic signals (i. e. higher variation of pulse periods) from others, resulting in an increase of the acoustic diversity across the family. Our results support the idea that trait decoupling can increase morphological and behavioral diversity through increased specialization rather than the generation of novel ecotypes.

40|$|Among odontocetes, {{members of}} the {{currently}} monotypic family Kogiidae are known as small-sized and largely enigmatic relatives of the great sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus. Most of the still scanty fossil record of Kogiidae is represented by isolated skulls and ear bones from Neogene deposits of the Northern Hemisphere, with the significant exception of Scaphokogia, a highly autapomorphic genus from the late Miocene deposits of the Pisco Formation, southern coast of Peru. Here we report on a new fossil kogiid specimen from Aguada de Lomas, a site where the upper Miocene beds of the Pisco Formation are exposed. This specimen (MUSM 888) consists of an almost complete Kogia-like cranium, which represents a new taxon of Kogiidae sharing many similarities with the recently described Nanokogia isthmia, from the late Miocene of Panama. MUSM 888 mainly differs from the latter taxon and from extant Kogia spp. by displaying a larger, anterolaterally elongated temporal fossa and well-defined dental alveoli on the upper <b>jaws.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with a relatively elongated rostrum, these characters suggest that MUSM 888 retained some degree of raptorial feeding abilities, contrasting with the strong suction feeding specialization seen in Kogia spp. Interestingly, MUSM 888 shared the southern coast of present day Peru with {{members of the}} subfamily Scaphokogiinae, whose unique convex rostrum and unusual neurocranial morphology seemingly indicate a peculiar foraging specialization that has still to be understood. In conclusion, the finding of MUSM 888 supports a long history of high diversity, morphological disparity, and sympatric habits in fossil kogiids, thus suggesting that our comprehension of the evolutionary path of pygmy sperm whales is still far from being exhaustive...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a numerical analysis of the orbital forging process for producing a <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> sleeve-disk. The analysis was performed using the programme Deform- 3 D, based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). It is assumed that a forging of the <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> sleeve-disk is made of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy. A hollow preform is used as the billet. The hot orbital forging process is run using an industrial orbital forging press, MCOF 4000. The analysis focuses on the pattern of material flow, accuracy of the shape of the produced workpiece, as well as changes in the temperature of the material being formed...|$|E
40|$|Several models {{explain how}} a complex {{integrated}} system like the rodent mandible can arise from multiple developmental modules. The models propose various integrating mechanisms, including epigenetic effects of muscles on bones. We test five {{for their ability}} to predict correlations found in the individual (symmetric) and fluctuating asymmetric (FA) components of shape variation. We also use exploratory methods to discern patterns unanticipated by any model. Two models fit observed correlation matrices from both components: (1) parts originating in same mesenchymal condensation are integrated, (2) parts developmentally dependent on the same muscle form an integrated complex as do those dependent on teeth. Another fits the correlations observed in FA: each muscle insertion site is an integrated unit. However, no model fits well, and none predicts the complex structure found in the exploratory analyses, best described as a reticulated network. Furthermore, no model predicts the correlation between proximal parts of the condyloid and coronoid, which can exceed the correlations between proximal and distal parts of the same process. Additionally, no model predicts the correlation between molar alveolus and ramus and/or angular process, one of the highest correlations found in the FA component. That correlation contradicts the basic premise of all five developmental models, yet it should be anticipated from the epigenetic effects of mastication, possibly the primary morphogenetic process integrating the <b>jaw</b> <b>coupling</b> forces generated by muscle contraction with those experienced at teeth...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{and song}} are {{universal}} forms of vocalization that may share aspects of emotional expression. Research {{has focused on}} parallels in acoustic features, overlooking facial cues to emotion. In three experiments, we compared moving facial expressions in speech and song. In Experiment 1, vocalists spoke and sang statements each with five emotions. Vocalists exhibited emotion-dependent movements of the eyebrows and lip corners that transcended speech–song differences. Vocalists’ <b>jaw</b> movements were <b>coupled</b> to their acoustic intensity, exhibiting differences across emotion and speech–song. Vocalists’ emotional movements extended beyond vocal sound to include large sustained expressions, suggesting a communicative function. In Experiment 2, viewers judged silent videos of vocalists’ facial expressions prior to, during, and following vocalization. Emotional intentions were identified accurately for movements during and after vocalization, suggesting that these movements support the acoustic message. Experiment 3 compared emotional identification in voice-only, face-only, and face-and-voice recordings. Emotion judgements for voice-only singing were poorly identified, yet were accurate for all other conditions, confirming that facial expressions conveyed emotion more accurately than the voice in song, yet were equivalent in speech. Collectively, these findings highlight broad commonalities in the facial cues to emotion in speech and song, yet highlight differences in perception and acoustic-motor production. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{myelin sheath}} was a {{transformative}} vertebrate acquisition, enabling great increases in impulse propagation velocity along axons. Not all vertebrates possess myelinated axons, however, and when myelin {{first appeared in}} the vertebrate lineage is an important open question. It has been suggested that the dual, apparently unrelated acquisitions of myelin and the hinged <b>jaw</b> were actually <b>coupled</b> in evolution [1, 2]. If so, it would be expected that myelin was first acquired during the Devonian period by the oldest jawed fish, the placoderms [3]. Although myelin itself is not retained in the fossil record, within the skulls of fossilized Paleozoic vertebrate fish are exquisitely preserved imprints of cranial nerves and the foramina they traversed. Examination of these structures now suggests how the nerves functioned in vivo. In placoderms, the first hinge-jawed fish, oculomotor nerve diameters remained constant, but nerve lengths were ten times longer than in the jawless osteostraci. We infer that to accommodate this ten-fold increase in length, while maintaining a constant diameter, the oculomotor system in placoderms must have been myelinated to function as a rapidly conducting motor pathway. Placoderms were the first fish with hinged jaws and some can grow to formidable lengths, requiring a rapid conduction system, so it is highly likely that they were the first organisms with myelinated axons in the craniate lineage...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of {{ligament}} morphology and musculoskeletal mechanics in elasmobranchs {{that use}} suction (white-spotted bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium plagiosum and Ornate wobbegong, Orectolobus ornatus), bite (sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus) and generalist (suction and bite, spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias) feeding mechanisms reveal ligament morphologies and musculoskeletal mechanics specific to feeding mode, and novel ligament linkages in obligate suction feeders (C. plagiosum and O. ornatus) that <b>couple</b> <b>jaw</b> and hyoid depression. In vivo data of muscle strain, activation, skeletal kinematics and buccal pressure during suction capture and prey processing in C. plagiosum support {{the function of}} linkage systems in suction feeders during both behaviors. ^ The arrangements of the postspiracularis (LPI), hyomandibuloceratohyal (LHCC), hyoidiomandibular (LHMM) and hyomandibuloceratohyomandibular ligaments (LHCM) morphology at the chondrocraniohyomandibular (CHMA), hyomandibuloceratohyal (HMCA) and hyomandibulomandibular (HMMA) articulations are specific to feeding mode. The LPI and LHCC in Chiloscyllium plagiosum and Orectolobus ornatus and Squalus acanthias forms a moveable pulley and tether system that link hyomandibula (HMD) depression with ceratohyal (CER) in suction feeders and feeding generalists. The LHMM is split into two divisions in the four species the LHMM (medial division) and LHML (lateral division). The LHMM of C. plumbeus and S. acanthias forms a twisting linkage between the HMDs and CERs that results in anterolateral and ventral motion of the HMD in bite and generalist feeders. ^ Musculoskeletal morphology and mechanics underlining jaw and hyoid depression and jaw adduction in Chiloscyllium plagiosum, Carcharhinus plumbeus, and Squalus acanthias reveal a mosaic of convergent and divergent features. Coracomandibularis (CM, jaw depressor) physiological cross-sectional PSCA is the main contributor to variation in force output to the lower jaw during jaw depression in the three species. Morphology of the coracohyoideus (CH) and coracoarcualis (CA) (hyoid depressors) are similar in the three species. Mechanics of hyoid depression in C. plagiosum differ from C. plumbeus and S. acanthias in that the initial in-lever is {{much smaller than the}} other species due to alignment of the hyoid with the hyomandibuloceratohyal articulation. Application of four-bar linkage mechanics to the jaws and hyoid of C. plagiosum suggests that the jaw and hyoid depression are linked by the lateral hyoidiomandibular ligament (LHML-linkage) and result in levels of force transfer to the jaws and hyoid during suction feeding that are greater than that possible from un-linked systems. The jaw adductors and protruders in the three species, quadratomandibularis (QM), preorbitalis (PO) and levator palatoquadrati (LP, a jaw proturder in C. plumbeus only), are subdivided and complex in architecture. ^ Simultaneously measurement of hyoid and jaw kinematics, buccal pressure and fascicle shortening and muscle activity in the CM, CH and CA using Sonomicrometry in Chiloscyllium plagiosum reveal interaction of the feeding muscles and the LHML-linkage. Active shortening of the CM occurs prior to the onset of jaw opening and buccal pressure decrease, while jaw depression to peak gape occurs during CM lengthening. The CH actively lengthens and the CA actively shortens prior to jaw and hyoid depression. Peak active CM shortening, onset of active CH shortening, depression of the hyoid, and buccal pressure decrease occur simultaneously. A catch mechanism involving the LHML, LHMM and CM that would allow the CH to be lengthened by the CA and released, resulting in high-powered expansion during suction feeding is proposed. The CM initiates jaw lower depression while the CH and CA drive the jaw and hyoid to peak depression. The LHML in bamboo sharks appears to be a biomechanical link <b>coupling</b> lower <b>jaw</b> and hyoid depression that is convergent with the mandibulohyoid ligament in bony fishes. During bite processing, the CM shortens to depress the lower jaw and hyoid. Elevation of the hyoid prior to the onset of jaw depression results in increased positive orobranchial pressure and may help to secure prey in the mouth when the jaws are repositioned to deliver a processing bite. However, the LHML-linkage may constrain PO and QM function. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
