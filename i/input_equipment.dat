40|$|Smart {{glasses are}} {{becoming}} popular for users to access various {{services such as}} email. To protect these services, password-based user authentication is widely used. Unfortunately, the passwordbased user authentication has inherent vulnerability against password leakage. Many efforts {{have been put on}} designing leakageresilient password entry schemes on PCs and mobile phones with traditional <b>input</b> <b>equipment</b> including keyboards and touch screens. However, such traditional <b>input</b> <b>equipment</b> is not available on smart glasses. Existing password entry on smart glasses relies on additional PCs or mobile devices. Such solutions force users to switch between different systems, which causes interrupted experience and may lower the practicability and usability of smart glasses. In this paper, we propose a series of leakage-resilient password entry schemes on stand-alone smart glasses, which are gTapper, gRotator, and gTalker. These schemes ensure no leakage in password entry by breaking the correlation between the underlying password and the interaction observable to adversaries. They are practical {{in the sense that they}} only require a touch pad, a gyroscope, and a microphone which are commonly available on smart glasses. The usability of the proposed schemes is evaluated by user study under various test conditions which are common in users 2 ̆ 7 daily usage.

An analysis of user constraints and available technology lead us to select a 21. 5 ” multi-touch monitor as the preferred input and display device. This comfortably displays two A 4 pages of music {{side by side with}} space for a control panel. The analysis also identified single handed input as a viable choice for musicians. Finger input was chosen to avoid the need for any additional <b>input</b> <b>equipment.</b> To support layout reflow and zooming we develop a vector based music representation, based around the bar structure. This representation supports animation of transitions, {{in such a way as}} to give responsive dynamic interaction with multi-touch gesture input. In developing the prototype, particular attention was paid to the problem of drawing small, intricate annotation accurately located on the music using a fingertip. The zoomable nature of the music structure was leveraged to accomplish this, and an evaluation carried out to establish the best level of magnification. The thesis demonstrates, in the context of music, that annotation and layout management (typically treated as two distinct tasks) can be integrated into a single task yielding fluid and natural interaction...|$|E
