25|$|In October 1989, Rockwell International (Space Systems Division) began {{a year-long}} {{contracted}} effort managed by Langley Research Center {{to perform an}} in-depth study of PLS design and operations with the HL-20 concept as a baseline for the study. Using a concurrent <b>engineering</b> <b>approach,</b> Rockwell factored supportable, efficient design and operations measures into defining a detailed, cost-effective design along with a manufacturing plan and operations assessment. A key {{finding of this study}} was the realization that while design and technological factors could reduce costs of a new manned space transportation system, further significant savings would be possible only if a new operations philosophy were adopted which treated PLS {{in a manner similar to}} an operational airliner rather than a research and development space vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Also in late 2012, using systems {{metabolic}} engineering, a Korean {{research team}} at the former Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has succeeded in demonstrating an optimized process to increase butanol production by generating an engineered bacterium. Professor Sang Yup Lee at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, KAIST, Dr. Do Young Seung at GS Caltex, a large oil refining company in Korea, and Dr. Yu-Sin Jang at BioFuelChem, a startup butanol company in Korea, applied a systems metabolic <b>engineering</b> <b>approach</b> to improve the production of butanol through enhancing the performance of Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{one of the best}} known butanol-producing bacteria. In addition, the downstream process was optimized and an in situ recovery process was integrated to achieve higher butanol titer, yield, and productivity. The combination of systems metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization resulted {{in the development of a}} process capable of producing more than 585g of butanol from 1.8kg of glucose, which allows the production of this important industrial solvent and advanced biofuel to be cost competitive.|$|E

2500|$|De Grey defines aging as [...] "the set of {{accumulated}} {{side effects}} from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: [...] "a collection of cumulative {{changes to the}} molecular and cellular structure of an adult organism, which result in essential metabolic processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in pathology and death." [...] He adds: [...] "geriatrics is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional gerontology is the attempt to stop metabolism from causing damage; and the SENS (<b>engineering)</b> <b>approach</b> is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." [...] The SENS approach to biomedical gerontology is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.|$|E

However, for many industrial reactions there are no naturally occurring enzymes, and so many different <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches</b> have been used to address this problem.

Recently greater understanding of the aldolase mechanism has allowed many successes with both rational <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches</b> and computational design of aldolases.

2500|$|Donohue chronicled {{his entire}} racing {{career in the}} book, The Unfair Advantage (co-written with noted {{motorsports}} and engineering journalist Paul Van Valkenburgh). The book documents his career from his first races to his final full season of racing the year before he was killed. This was not merely a celebrity autobiography, but a detailed, step-by-step record of the <b>engineering</b> <b>approach</b> he took to getting the absolutely highest performance from every car he drove, always looking for that elusive [...] "unfair advantage". Donohue (along with Penske) were pioneers in many rights, some as notable {{as the use of}} a skidpad as a tool for developing and perfecting race car suspension designs and setups. The book told how Donohue learned to exploit the antilock braking system and the powerful turbocharged engine of several prototype Porsches, as well as how he learned from various mishaps, including a near-fatal crash. The book was published shortly before Donohue's death.|$|E

40|$|In {{large-scale}} civil structures, {{a limited}} number of sensors are placed to monitor the health of civil structures to reduce maintenance, communication and energy costs. In this thesis, the problem of optimal sensor location placement to infer the health of civil structures is explored. First, a comparative study of approaches from the fields of control engineering and civil engineering is conducted. The widely used civil <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches</b> such as effective independence (EI) and modal assurance criterion (MAC) have limitations because of the negligence of modes and damping parameters. On the other hand, control <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches</b> consider the entire system dynamics using impulse response-type sensor measurement data. Such inference can be formulated as an estimation problem, with the dynamics formulated as a second-order differential equation. The comparative study suggests that damping dynamics play significant impact to the selection of best sensor location [...] -the civil <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches</b> that neglect the damping dynamics lead to very different sensor locations from those of the control <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches.</b> In {{the second part of the}} thesis, an initial attempt to directly connect the topological graph of the structure (that defines the damping and stiffness matrices) and the second-order dynamics is conducted...|$|R
40|$|Requirements {{engineering}} {{techniques that}} explicitly {{recognize the importance}} of clearly identifying and treating crosscutting concerns are called Aspect-oriented Requirements <b>Engineering</b> <b>Approaches</b> (AORE approaches). The emergence of aspect-oriented programming languages has raised the explicit need to identify crosscutting concerns already during the analysis phase. Besides this observation, the modular representation of crosscutting requirements is a first step to ensure traceability of crosscutting concerns through all other artifacts of the software lifecycle (architecture, design and implementation). Aspect-oriented requirements <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches</b> improve existing requirements <b>engineering</b> <b>approaches</b> through an explicit representation (and modularization) of concerns that were otherwise spread throughout other requirements artifacts (such as use cases, goal models, viewpoints, etc.). AORE approaches adopt the principle of separation of concerns at the analysis phase (the early separation of concerns). In other words, AORE approaches provide a representation of crosscutting concerns in requirements artifacts. </p...|$|R
