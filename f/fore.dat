5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small <b>fore</b> wings and no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind wings and have {{shortened}} <b>fore</b> wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the <b>fore</b> wings. In Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings longer than <b>fore</b> wings engage in flight.|$|E

5000|$|Samuel William <b>Fores,</b> often {{credited}} as S. W. <b>Fores</b> (1761 - 3 February 1838) was an English illustrator and publisher/printer {{based in}} Piccadilly, London. <b>Fores,</b> {{the son of}} a cloth merchant, began his career publishing his illustrations in 1783. He specialised in caricature, typically hand-coloured, singly issued prints. He became successful at marketing his works, which he often sold wholesale. <b>Fores</b> acquired a particularly large collection of caricatures, and at one time was said to have [...] "the completest collection in the kingdom" [...] in his Caricature Museum. He died in February 1838 at the age of 77 and was buried in his family vault at St. James Church in Jermyn Street.|$|R

5|$|The wings lie flat on {{the body}} and are very {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The <b>fore</b> wings are elytra made of tough chitin, acting as a protective shield for the soft {{parts of the body}} and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the <b>fore</b> wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.|$|E

5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute.

5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} end or after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At {{the end of the}} war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK <b>fore</b> and a SR aft, a SG both <b>fore</b> and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E

5|$|Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{directors}} were fitted {{to control the}} Type 89 guns.

5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures {{like its}} leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from the}} working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. He argued that the Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under.

5|$|Moltke and Goeben {{were also}} armed with four 50cm (20in) torpedo tubes; one <b>fore,</b> one aft, and {{two on the}} broadside, with 11 torpedoes stored. The torpedoes were of the G/7 model, which weighed 1,365kg (3,010lb) and carried a warhead {{weighing}} 195kg (430lb). The torpedoes had a maximum range of 9,300m (10,200yd) at 27knots (50km/h), and 4,000m (4,400yd) when set at 37knots (69km/h).|$|E
5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the <b>fore</b> funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The <b>fore</b> funnel was moved aft, the original <b>fore</b> and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{partially}} filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling <b>fore</b> or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E
