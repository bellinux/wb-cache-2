40|$|This {{research}} {{brings together}} studies of non-state actors (NSAs) in environmental negotiations, transnational networks, and institutional fragmentation, {{to shed light}} on the influence of NSAs on policy-making in regime complexes. It presents a new analytical framework with a series of deductive assumptions about the influence of “multi-forum” NSAs, as compared with “single forum” NSAs. Multi-forum NSAs cover several elements of a regime complex, and are thereby able to follow and potentially influence fragmented institutional processes. Focusing on two cases of fragmented environmental governance—forestry and access to genetic resources—the analysis provides a quantitative (statistics, network analysis) and qualitative (interviews) testing ground for the proposed framework. Because of their considerable material, organizational and ideational resources, and long-term engagement, multi-forum NSAs have greater access to the negotiations and may become central players. The strategies such NSAs adopt can further the integration of regime complexes when they undertake forum linking, or push towards further fragmentation when they undertake forum shopping or <b>forum</b> <b>shifting...</b>|$|E
40|$|Part I of this Article {{describes}} global lawmaking and {{the legitimacy}} challenge. It provides a typology of IOs that develop norms. It explains that legitimacy is a subjective belief, but it provides objective paradigms for assessing legitimacy claims. It demonstrates how pursuing legitimacy {{according to one}} set of criteria can sacrifice legitimacy claims under another. It also examines the competition among IOs, the push for democratic norms, and the resulting need for stronger legitimacy claims. Part II explains linkage and accommodation and gives specific examples of where these phenomena work to garner more legitimacy for specific organizations and the soft and hard law that they develop. Part III outlines some of {{the positive and negative}} consequences of derivative legitimacy, including stronger legitimacy claims, marginalization of interests, entrenchment, new regime and <b>forum</b> <b>shifting</b> opportunities, and unique opportunities for abuse that these alliances create. Finally, Part IV argues that a derivative legitimacy analysis must focus on the relationship among the constituent IOs, and that the best paradigm to do so is a process-based paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Mary Ann Glendon {{maintains}} that the United States has created too many legal rights {{in the last two}} generations. She argues, to an increasingly receptive audience, that this multiplication of rights threatens both national values and efficiency. The critique of rights can be seen as containing both normative and positive aspects. The expansion of rights-oriented discourse is said by some to impoverish political debate by posing public issues in rigid and inflexible terms that limit our capacity to find solutions. The creation of new rights is also thought to diminish our commitment to older and perhaps more fundamental rights. Moreover, the shift to a rights-based politics is marked by a <b>shift</b> of institutional <b>forum</b> away from legislatures and into courts. Insofar as courts lack the capacity to make complex and well-informed public policy decisions, this <b>forum</b> <b>shift</b> is likely to lead to worse policies...|$|R
40|$|The {{passage of}} the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 has engendered a {{significant}} <b>forum</b> <b>shift</b> in class action securities fraud litigation, from federal to state court. This unintended by-product of the Act has reignited debate over our dual federal-state system of securities regulation and in turn has inspired a discussion as to whether Congress should now preempt state securities fraud causes of action. This article argues that preemption is an appropriate, but not the only, solution to these concerns. To support this argument, this article first traces the history of dual state-federal securities regulation {{within the context of}} private rights of action. The article then analyzes the new incentives to file state court litigation and extends current empirical analyses by examining more closely {{the nature and extent of}} post-Reform Act state litigation. The compiled data demonstrate significant differences between state and federal litigation that suggest that plaintiffs are using state courts to avoid some of the Reform Act 2 ̆ 7 s procedural hurdles, a strategy that threatens to undermine the policy choices Congress made in the Act. The article then analyzes the traditional theoretical bases for allocating governmental authority to the states in our federal system, in particular the benefits associated with interstate competition. Such competition cannot occur in the system as currently structured but the article suggests a choice of law regime that may permit competition. Recognizing that such a structural change is unlikely to be adopted, the article concludes by critiquing current preemption proposals...|$|R

40|$|English Department Honors Thesis. Twitter fiction, {{an example}} of twenty-first century digital narrative, allows authors to {{experiment}} with literary form, production, and dissemination as they engage readers through a communal network. Twitter offers creative space for both professionals and amateurs to publish fiction digitally, enabling greater collaboration among authors and readers. Examining Jennifer Egan's "Black Box" and selected Twitter stories from Junot Diaz, Teju Cole, and Elliott Holt, this thesis establishes two distinct types of Twitter fiction - one produced for the medium and one produced through it - to consider how Twitter's present feed and character limit fosters a uniquely interactive reading experience. As the conversational medium calls for present engagement with the text and with the author, Twitter promotes newly elastic relationships between author and reader that renegotiate the former boundaries between professionals and amateurs. This thesis thus considers how works of Twitter fiction transform the traditional author function and pose new questions regarding digital narrative's modes of existence, circulation, and appropriation. As digital narrative makes its way onto democratic <b>forums,</b> a <b>shifted</b> author function leaves us wondering {{what it means to}} be an author in the digital age.

40|$|By {{looking at}} teacher {{collaborative}} structures {{in an urban}} public elementary school, this article demonstrates how, {{in the face of}} top-down school decisions under the pressures of high-stakes test-ing and assessment-driven curriculum, teachers can find the power and freedom for creative and effective pedagogy to flourish. We describe how teachers at PS 165 created the spaces for working together and how these spaces brought new opportunities for (a) problematizing and prioritizing the issues they faced in class-rooms, (b) reinventing and expanding their sense of self as indi-viduals in the collaboration, (c) growing beyond their personal space and engaging intellectually in public <b>forums,</b> (d) <b>shifting</b> their ways of seeing teaching, and (e) ensuring sustainability of the ways of engaging in professional development through mentor-ing and taking ownership of the structures for collaboration. We include personal stories and/or reflections of six teachers and their experiences with study groups and theorize on the potential ele-ments of a professional development model for other schools to build on and for the teaching profession to reflect upon. No Child Left Behind (2002) and the National Standards Movement (Ravich, 1995) have created a climate of conformity, uniformity, and alignment, not just for students but for teachers as well.

40|$|AbstractThere {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that providing increased voice to vulnerable or disenfranchised populations {{is important to}} improving health equity. In this paper we will examine the engagement of Aboriginal community members and community controlled organisations in local governance reforms associated with the Aboriginal Health National Partnership Agreements (AHNPA) in Australia {{and its impact on}} the uptake of health assessments. The sample included qualitative and quantitative responses from 188 people involved in regional governance in Aboriginal health. The study included data on the uptake of Aboriginal health assessments from July 2008 to December 2012. The study population was 83190 in 2008 / 9, 856986 in 2009 / 10, 88256 in 2010 / 11 and 90903 in 2011 / 12. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between organisations within forums and the regional uptake of Aboriginal health assessments. The independent variables included before and after the AHNPA, state, remoteness, level of representation from Aboriginal organisations and links between Aboriginal and mainstream organisations. The introduction of the AHNPA was associated with a shift in power from central government to regional <b>forums.</b> This <b>shift</b> has enabled Aboriginal people a much greater voice in governance. The results of the analyses show that improvements in the uptake of health assessments were associated with stronger links between Aboriginal organisations and between mainstream organisations working with Aboriginal organisations. Higher levels of community representation were also associated with improved uptake of health assessments in the AHNPA. The findings suggest that the incorporation of Aboriginal community and community controlled organisations in regional planning plays an important role in improving health equity. This study makes an important contribution to understanding the processes through which the incorporation of disadvantaged groups into governance might contribute to health equity...|$|R
30|$|In summary, Switzerland and Germany {{identify}} resilience strategically {{in specific}} sectors such as critical infrastructure, {{but not as}} part of the overall goal for civil protection. With respect to legislation, both countries adopt risk analysis on the federal level with a history of additional activities in the Swiss cantons. Vulnerability analysis is not explicitly detailed in the corresponding methodological guidelines. Resilience is not included in the Swiss or German legislation. The latter may address resilience by including “self-help” in the German law (ZSKG). However, this association is questionable because it may narrow the conceptual depth of resilience that we find in psychology or social-ecological research. Compared to Switzerland and Germany, the UK incorporates resilience much more prominently on a strategic level, comparable with the UN’s HFA, and the EU’s strategy on adaptation to climate change. The implementation of Local Resilience <b>Forums</b> illustrates a <b>shift</b> from the national to the local scale, focusing on communities and individual residents. This shift is also described as “third/fourth wave” within the development of the UK’s security (Omand 2013). Risk analysis and risk assessment are the methodological cornerstones of the UK’s approach to resilience. But compared to Switzerland and Germany, the national and local levels are required by law to conduct risk analysis, and to maintain and publish CRR (Table  1).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the workshops, women {{were invited to participate}} in a number of cultural events like the Nairobi Film Forum which showed films and videos by and about women and gave workshops; exhibitions of art and photography; folklore workshops; concerts; martial arts classes; field trips to local villages. Because of the favorable climate conditions, women were able to gather in the open-air for a variety of both scheduled and unscheduled functions to build networks with other participants. The <b>Forum</b> after 1985 <b>shifted</b> in a way that reflected the divide between progressivism versus conservatism, as opposed to the polarized capitalist-socialist divide which had split prior conferences. It was recognized by the participants that global problems were women's issues, but that within their governmental systems, there was either a desire to promote or curtail change. A fundamental shift occurred which recognized that no matter the system, women were subordinate and that promoting a world view from women's perspectives allowed them to transcend their differences and focus on the commonalities they shared. For example, aboriginal women recognized that where ever they were from, they battled for indigenous land rights; Arab and Israeli women discussed the need for peace; women lawyers whether from Islamic countries in South Asia or Catholic countries in Latin America recognized the struggle for women's rights under patriarchal religious systems.|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} value of art {{rests in the}} response it conjures in its audience and the information this response can convey about the culture in which it resides. The paintings of the 17 th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer are proving particularly relevant to our contemporary culture. The scholarly discourse on Vermeer and his paintings, the exhibition of his works, their reproduction in diverse media, and their appropriation by artists, novelists, and filmmakers have created dialogues on Vermeer that promote understanding of his meaning today. Surrounding Vermeer with the various dialogues that have surfaced in culture provides a way of understanding how meaning has been ascribed to this artist and just what this meaning is. The degree of attention afforded to Vermeer through the exhibition <b>forum</b> has <b>shifted</b> his paintings into the full view of a broad international audience, made the artist and his paintings celebrities, and established Vermeer's aesthetic as a cultural emblem of beauty open to public response and interpretation. This thesis is argued {{within the context of}} five museum exhibitions related to Vermeer that took place between 1995 - 2003 and through an in-depth discussion of the appropriation of his paintings by other artists, writers, filmmakers and their critics. Critical methods from art history, visual culture studies, film studies, consumer culture studies, anthropology, and ethnography are employed to support this thesis Appropriation is an important theme in our contemporary culture; yet, there is also an historical context through which it has evolved. Artists have engaged in appropriation throughout art history and many traditional motivations for appropriation remain presently relevant. Methods of reproduction have tremendously affected the evolution of painting since the development of the print in the 15 th century and this has had impact on art appropriation. Technological developments in reproduction methods since the 19 th century have accelerated the appropriation of paintings in diverse media. The reproduction of Vermeer's paintings since the 19 th century and especially through the museum exhibition and its media response in recent history have made his images well-known and encouraged their use as a way of conceptualizing and contextualizing ideas of refinement, perfection, and beauty...|$|R

40|$|Impact {{investing}} {{has been}} revolutionary {{in the history}} of capital markets. The concept refers to investments with the intention of generating positive social impact over and above financial returns. Over the last six years, impact investing has moved from the margins to the mainstream with an estimated market size of $ 46 billion in 2014 (World Economic <b>Forum,</b> 2014), <b>shifting</b> the paradigm on how the world blends impact with financial returns. But there is more to be achieved. A 55 % annual growth rate would be required to reach the target market size of $ 1 trillion by 2020 (J. P. Morgan, 2010). This exponential growth can be achieved only by unlocking mission-oriented capital at scale, by bringing in new actors from the private sector to support sustainable development and by developing innovative financial products that can channelize resources to high impact entities - which in turn can deliver scalable and sustainable market-based solutions. Leveraging its expertise in innovative finance, Impact Investment Exchange Asia (IIX) sets out to achieve this by developing a new financial product that seeks to bridge the current gap between development and finance: the IIX Sustainability Bond (ISB). ISBs are debt securities that pool together in a single portfolio, a group of high-impact entities that have undergone a rigorous due diligence process based on both social and financial criteria. This unique pooled structure allows underlying borrowers to access large amounts of capital that they would not otherwise have been able to raise individually. ISBs are designed to be sustainable instruments, offering attractive rates of risk-adjusted returns to impact investors who are interested in a double bottom line. ISBs will be listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius, adding an additional layer of secondary liquidity, mission protection and transparency. IIX's commitment-to action to the Clinton Global initiative, the first ISB, is the Women's Livelihood Bond (WLB), a $ 20 million debt security designed to unlock capital for Impact Enterprises (IEs) and Microfinance Institute (MFIs) {{that are part of the}} sustainable livelihoods spectrum for women in South-East Asia. The WLB is projected to empower over half a million women with access to credit, to market linkages, to natural resources and to affordable goods and services. This will, in turn, help them transition from subsistence to sustainable livelihoods and redefine the dominant narrative from viewing women as victims to recognizing them as solutions to development, change and progress. This Blueprint Paper, developed by IIX's sister non-profit entity Shujog, aims to provide an overview of the bond mechanics by outlining the key steps involved in the bond structuring process. Supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, a visionary catalyst in the impact investing space, this preliminary paper will capture the progress made to date by IIX on product, pipeline and partnership development. A subsequent paper will be published post bond issuance which will capture the key steps involved in selling the bond to investors and listing it on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Shujog hopes this paper will act as a roadmap for other stakeholders in the space to create similar instruments that are designed to change finance and finance change...|$|R
