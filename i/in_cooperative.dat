5|$|John von Neumann, {{working with}} Oskar Morgenstern {{on the theory}} of games, broke new {{mathematical}} ground in 1944 by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed-point theory to economic analysis. Their work thereby avoided the traditional differential calculus, for which the maximum–operator {{did not apply to}} non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work <b>in</b> <b>cooperative</b> game theory, game theorists Lloyd S. Shapley, Martin Shubik, Hervé Moulin, Nimrod Megiddo, Bezalel Peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the fair prices <b>in</b> <b>cooperative</b> games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.|$|E

Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The Last of Us is an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{video game}} developed by Naughty Dog {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 3 worldwide on June 14, 2013. Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl named Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective; players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} manager compensation in ameliorating the influence costs problem <b>in</b> agribusiness <b>cooperatives.</b> We argue that influence costs are higher <b>in</b> <b>cooperatives</b> than <b>in</b> investor-oriented firms and introduce a formal game of influence activities <b>in</b> <b>cooperatives</b> <b>in</b> which we incorporate the rent-seeking behavior of managers, board members and farmer-owners. The issue examined is decision making over a policy that creates a rent for the distribution of which members compete. Accordingly, each member tries to influence decision-making by expending resources to increase the probability of capturing the rent. The findings suggest that {{an increase in the}} manager’s salary leads to a decrease in the influence costs incurred by the cooperative. The same effect is produced by an active cooperative membership...|$|R
5|$|The game is set {{twenty years}} after an {{outbreak}} of the mutated strain of Cordyceps fungus that destroyed much of civilization. The single-player story follows Joel, tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States, {{in an attempt to}} create a potential cure against the infection to which Ellie is immune. Players make their way through various locations, fighting against the Infected and hostile human survivors. The multiplayer lets up to eight players engage <b>in</b> <b>cooperative</b> or competitive game matches. To accommodate Remastereds technical enhancements, Naughty Dog spent months developing the game, beginning upon the release of The Last of Us.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the pied butcherbird is {{generally}} sedentary. Common in woodlands and in urban environments, it is carnivorous, eating small vertebrates and insects. A tame and inquisitive bird, the pied butcherbird {{has been known}} to accept food from humans. It nests in trees, constructing a cup-shaped structure out of sticks and laying two to five eggs. The pied butcherbird engages <b>in</b> <b>cooperative</b> breeding, with a mated pair sometimes assisted by several helper birds. The troop is territorial, defending the nesting site from intruders. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pied butcherbird as being of least concern on account of its large range and apparently stable population.|$|E
5|$|Development on Immortal Throne {{began in}} early June 2006, {{a few weeks}} after the {{original}} Titan Quest went gold. Preparatory work was in progress during the late development stages of Titan Quest, with staff drawing up feature lists and choosing what features to improve and what additions to make. According to producer Michael Verrette, Immortal Throne was considered an extension of Titan Quest, as many of the elements it included were features that could not be included in the original game due to time constraints. Multiple staff from Titan Quest returned, either in their original roles or different roles: Verrette became producer after being a sound designer for the original game, Arthur Bruno became lead gameplay designer, and Michael Sheidow and Scott Morton returned as art director and composer respectively. The original graphics engine was carried over from the original game with some accompanying refinements. The level design was based around the increased vertical elements in environments, giving a wider variety of gameplay spaces and vistas. A big addition to the game was the Dream Mastery character class, which was both designed to fit in among the existing character classes and to be a useful skill <b>in</b> <b>cooperative</b> multiplayer. The level editor, a feature present in the original game, was left mostly intact, although additional development features were added such as lockable day and night cycle and preview features for new elements. Visually, the game was themed around a descent into the Underworld: the deeper the player went on their journey, the darker the environments became. Immortal Throne would be the last original property worked on by Iron Lore Entertainment: after completing work on , an expansion to , the studio was forced to close in February 2008 due to difficulties in securing any funding for future projects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the distinction between}} core members and common members <b>in</b> farmer <b>cooperatives</b> <b>in</b> China {{in terms of the}} allocation of ownership rights, decision rights, and income rights. Empirical results from a multiple case study indicate that the life cycle and the governance characteristics of farmer <b>cooperatives</b> <b>in</b> China differ from <b>cooperatives</b> <b>in</b> the West world. The genesis of <b>cooperatives</b> <b>in</b> China is due to entrepreneurial farmers and the government, rather than the bottom-up, collective action process of many small farmers. The distribution of equity capital, decision rights, and income rights is quite skewed towards core members. We conclude that the development of <b>cooperatives</b> <b>in</b> China adapts to the local economic and cultural environment and goes via an alternative way to <b>cooperatives</b> <b>in</b> the Western world...|$|R
