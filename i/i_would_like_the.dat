Here is {{a class of}} women sent to be cured. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see {{how long it will}} take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach a lesson that if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. But I do not think the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too late for that kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E

Reagan's body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California later in the day, where well-wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American flags in the grass. On June 7, his body was removed and taken to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where a brief family funeral was held conducted by Pastor Michael Wenning. His body lay in repose in the Library lobby until June 9; over 100,000 people viewed the coffin.|$|E

2500|$|On November 7, 1939, Henry Standing Bear {{wrote to}} the Polish-American {{sculptor}} Korczak Ziolkowski, who worked on Mount Rushmore under Gutzon Borglum. He informed the sculptor, [...] "My fellow chiefs and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> white man {{to know that the}} red man has great heroes, too." [...] Standing Bear also wrote a letter to Undersecretary Oscar Chapman of the Department of the Interior, offering all his own fertile 900 acres (365 ha) in exchange for the barren mountain for the purpose of paying honor to Crazy Horse. The government responded positively, and the National Forest Service, responsible for the land, agreed to grant a permit {{for the use of the}} land, with a commission to oversee the project. Standing Bear chose not to seek government funds and relied instead upon influential Americans interested in the welfare of the American Indian to privately fund the project.|$|E

This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, Schoolboy Q {{called the}} album his [...] "best work yet." [...] He also {{called it a}} classic, but hoped his fans will have the final say: [...] "It's a classic album I would like to say, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> people to say it's a classic. But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really proud of myself for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like I drop mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{commutative}} justice {{has been widely}} analysed by the contemporary doctrine of civil law.
