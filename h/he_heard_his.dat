25|$|Jonathan Blanchard {{was born}} in Rockingham, Vermont on January 19, 1811. He was the {{eleventh}} of fifteen children born to Polly (Lovell) and Jonathan Blanchard, Sr. When he was three years old, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> brother discuss the recent Battle of Plattsburgh, an engagement of the War of 1812. Blanchard later credited this encounter as an influential moment {{in the development of}} his pacifist views. As a child, Blanchard attended public schools and helped on the family farm. When he was fourteen, he took his first job teaching a school. Like his brothers, Blanchard opposed the consumption of alcohol. He published his first article advocating temperance in 1825.|$|E
25|$|Gillespie {{was born}} in Cheraw, South Carolina, the {{youngest}} of nine children of James and Lottie Gillespie. James was a local bandleader, so instruments were {{made available to the}} children. Gillespie started to play the piano at the age of four. Gillespie's father died when he was only ten years old. Gillespie taught himself how to play the trombone as well as the trumpet by the age of twelve. From the night <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> idol, Roy Eldridge, play on the radio, he dreamed of becoming a jazz musician.

[...] He (Ali al-Ridha) while sitting in palanquin let his out head and said: [...] "I heard from my father Musa ibn Jafar who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>his</b> father Jafar ibn Mohammad who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>his</b> father Mohammad ibn Ali who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from Ali ibn Husayn who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>his</b> father Husayn ibn Ali who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>his</b> father, the commander of the faithful, [...] Ali ibn abi Talib who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from Allah's apostle, peace be upon him and his household, who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from Gabriel who said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> that Allah said: [...] "There is no god but Allah is my fortress whoever enters my fortress shall be safe from my punishment" [...] and when the convoy moved he (Ali al-Ridha) shouted: [...] "There are few conditions and I am one of its conditions".|$|R
25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E
500|$|In September 1954, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> minutes {{would be}} slashed, {{and after the}} second {{exhibition}} game, Pollard retired from the Eagles. As he was under contract, Pollard was threatened with legal action from General Manager Vince McNally. He avoided the legal tangle by never officially signing with another team again, thus voiding the reserve clause on his contract. Pollard explained his rationale in a 1954 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "I just got fed up... I knew they wouldn't give me {{much of a chance}} to play... I carried the ball only 23 times in 12 games last year, so something had to be wrong." ...|$|E

According to Gómez, Diplo {{subsequently}} called Delgado {{and told him that}} he was unaware [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] sampled his voice when it was released as a single.

500|$|Haley {{said the}} first time <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> name {{mentioned}} {{in conjunction with the}} character was from people suggesting his casting on the internet, which he appreciated, and then later learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller. Haley stated that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past—that of a child murderer—for about a [...] "minute and a half". Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker, Haley came to the realization quickly {{that at the end of}} the day he is doing a horror film, and this is just a fictional character. Haley said that once he embraced the idea of Freddy just being a [...] "mythical boogeyman", it became [...] "very freeing" [...] for him as an actor.|$|E
500|$|Born in Nagasaki, Japan, Eguchi became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} six when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> neighbor playing the piano. While his father, a judo athlete, initially tried to push him into pursuing sports, he eventually agreed to let him take piano lessons, as long as he agreed to study with his sister. Eguchi enrolled at the Tokyo Conservatoire Shobi, where he met long-term composing partner Noriko Matsueda. After graduating from the conservatoire, he produced numerous compositions, joined a band as a keyboardist, and worked as a software designer. He also gave Matsueda advice on music manipulation during her first game project, Front Mission, in 1995. At her request, he also arranged and orchestrated [...] "Theme of Bahamut Lagoon ~ Opening" [...] for the bonus disc of the original soundtrack to Bahamut Lagoon (1996).|$|E
500|$|Newell was {{the person}} to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> playing career was {{probably}} over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas {{and told him that}} if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of Sports Illustrated (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills. The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, [...] "Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates." ...|$|E

500|$|Before Touraj Moghaddam founded Roksan, he {{had become}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the state of}} the audio arts when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> little television set reproduce Thelonious Monk in a more musically satisfying way than his high-end Linn/Naim tri-amped audio system. Through experimentation, he deduced that the existing turntable design failed because the cartridge was not being held still wherever the groove went. He believed that the mean line traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant. His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub-chassis as part of the speed-controlling system. Needing a top plinth roughly an inch (25mm) thick made from wood with a density of about 700 to 800kg/m3, Moghaddam found suitable material in a fire door with which he built a prototype. His friend Tufan Hashemi – then an investment analyst – heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one. They agreed to team up to start production; Roksan Audio was formed. The Xerxes, introduced in 1985, secured the advocacy of Roger Macer, a successful independent hi-fi retailer in London who sold the then market leader, the Linn Sondek. Hashemi credits Macer with urging him to start satisfying the demand of [...] "dozens or more a week" [...] from his customers. The product, named after the Persian king Xerxes I, was launched at a hi-fi show in 1985 where the Roksan Darius loudspeaker concept was also unveiled.|$|E
2500|$|Huxley {{was born}} on 22 June 1887, at the London house of his aunt, the novelist Mary Augusta Ward, while his father was {{attending}} the jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria. Huxley grew up at the family home in Surrey, England, where he showed an early interest in nature, as he was given lessons by his grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley. When <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> grandfather talking at dinner {{about the lack of}} parental care in fish, Julian piped up with [...] "What about the stickleback, Gran'pater?" [...] Also, according to Julian himself, his grandfather took him to visit J. D. Hooker at Kew.|$|E

[...] "It's difficult to tell your children, 'Daddy's going to be murdered'," [...] he said. The police wired his home up directly to Special Branch, he was advised to take different routes each day to work, and he had to speak to his children's schools about the possibility of abduction.|$|E

He learned [...] that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after they}} were sent to Auschwitz, {{his mother and his}} younger sister were murdered. Wiesel and his father were {{selected}} to perform labor so long as they remained able-bodied, after which they were to be killed in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were later deported to the concentration camp at Buchenwald. Until that transfer, he admitted to Oprah Winfrey, his primary motivation for trying to survive Auschwitz was knowing that his father was still alive: [...] "I knew that if I died, he would die." [...] After they were taken to Buchenwald, his father died before the camp was liberated. In Night, Wiesel recalled the shame he felt when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> father being beaten and was unable to help.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the style}} of the Hampton band was {{outdated}} and overly commercialized in Gryce's eyes, the opportunities and connections made on the European tour were largely what propelled Gryce into success as an artist. In Hampton's band, Gryce played with Anthony Ortega, Clifford Solomon (tenor saxophone), Clifford Scott, Oscar Estelle (baritone saxophone), Walter Williams (trumpet), Art Farmer, Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones, Al Hayse, Jimmy Cleveland, George [...] "Buster" [...] Cooper, William [...] "Monk" [...] Montgomery, and Alan Dawson. Gryce became particularly close friends with Clifford Brown, with whom he found much in common. The Hampton tour did not pay well, and Gryce and others frequently sought recording opportunities on the side, particularly in Stockholm and Paris, where Europeans were eager to record touring Americans. There was already some tension in the band between young bebop-influenced musicians and the more established swing musicians (including Hampton himself), and Hampton did not react well when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> musicians were recording on the side.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} meeting with Bukharin, the {{telephone}} rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from The Kremlin said, [...] "Comrade Stalin wishes to speak with you." [...] According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. [...] "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar thou form: 'Tell me, {{what are they saying}} in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'" [...] Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an [...] "eager fumbling manner" [...] Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: [...] "I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade," [...] and put down the receiver.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant blessed God for steadfast {{faithfulness}} to Abraham. Rebekah ran and told everything to her mother's household. Rebekah's brother Laban {{ran out to}} the servant at the spring, {{and when he saw}} the nose-ring and the bands on Rebekah's arms, and when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> sister tell the story, Laban invited the servant to their house, had the camels unloaded and fed, and had water brought to bathe the feet of the servant and his party. But the servant would not eat before he had told his tale. The servant told how God had greatly blessed Abraham with sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and asses, and a son and sole heir. The servant told how Abraham made him swear to go to Abraham's kindred to get Isaac a wife, and that God would send an angel to make his errand successful. And the servant told how he met Rebekah at the well. The servant then asked whether or not they meant to treat Abraham with true kindness, and Laban and Bethuel answered that the matter had been decreed by God and Rebekah could go and be Isaac's wife. The servant bowed low to God. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Conoscenti {{grew up in}} the Chicago {{area and}} first played drums in garage bands and flute in his high school symphony band. [...] His musical {{influences}} were diverse while at home <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> mother's big band music while his father listened to the music of Frank Sinatra, Vic Damone, and Tony Bennett. [...] Conoscenti also listened to Chicago radio station WLS-FM which played a lot of Detroit [...] "Motown" [...] music. He bought his first acoustic guitar for $50 in 1974 in Boulder, Colorado at a yard sale, and began writing songs and performing in public. A self-taught musician, Conoscenti said he learned to play guitar by watching and listening to other musicians. Conoscenti began to experiment with psychedelics, and spent many hours in the meditation hall of the Naropa Institute in Boulder during the summer that Ram Dass was doing a residency there. [...] This was on the heels of Dass's seminal book Be Here Now, published in 1971. That summer culminated in a spiritual awakening that set Conoscenti on his lifelong spiritual path. [...] In late 1971 Conoscenti hitchhiked to California where he continued to write songs and play guitar. [...] Don’s spiritual training continued in a San Jose barrio where he fasted, meditated, and widened his cultural horizons.|$|E
