They are made as laminates and consist of a polymeric film (substrate), an inorganic layer, mostly aluminum (Al), and a top layer, laminated to the inorganic layer using a suitable adhesive. One major quality indicator in such flexible packaging materials is the adhesion strength between the inorganic layer and the substrate. In order to measure the adhesion strength of thin Al layers deposited on a substrate, the following procedure is often used: Ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) -films are thermally sealed to the Al layers. In a subsequent peel test, the EAA-film is peeled-off at 180 degrees peel angle, delaminating the Al layer from the substrate. This method shows weaknesses in cases of high bond strength: The sealed EAA-film is elongated or even torn during the measurements, whereby it is difficult to obtain reproducible and repeatable results. In this study two alternative approaches have been tested to overcome the weaknesses of EAA-peel test. One of them is to use thermally sealable polymeric films, such as amorphous poly(ethylene terephthalate) and amorphous polyamide (both having a high mechanical strength), instead of the EAA film. Although the adhesion forces might have been weakened during the <b>heat</b> <b>lamination</b> of these selected films onto the Al surface, a quantitative comparison between the three different types of metallized films (with low, medium and high adhesion strength) is found to be promising by this approach. The other approach is to perform the peel tests with the laminates of the metallized films. The laminates are produced by laminating a low density polyethylene film (PE-LD) on top of the metallized film using an adhesive via a bench lamination process. The laminated PE-LD film in this case replaces the EAA-film. In this approach, the laminate structure is similar to the final product in the end-use. The metal adhesion strength is found to be in good agreement with the strength measured for similar structures produced at pilot scale...|$|E

There {{is a need to}} develop these sensitive items indigenously. The pumps work on the principle of electro magnetic induction. During operation heat generation takes place in the coil windings and <b>laminations.</b> <b>Heat</b> is also transferred to the coils from the hot sodium. The coils are covered with varnish insulation whose temperature should not cross 1800 C. To limit this temperature, forced air is blown over the coils. Thermal analysis has been done using the HEATING 5 code. The paper highlights the modeling and results where all the three modes of heat transfer and materials with anisotropic properties are considered...|$|R

The work is jointly performed by a consortium of partners from industry and research within the frame of the European research project "HIDING DIES". In specific, Resin-Coated-Copper (RCC) films can be laminated on assembled chips and components providing the polymer dielectric matrix for further 3 D-SiP package processing. Lamination of RCC films can superbly replace the spin-coating processes. Filled and no-filled epoxy RCC's have been successfully used to laminate very thin (50 m) as well as relatively thick chips up to 200 m. Pressures from 5 up to 20 bars and heating rates of 3 °C/min and 8 °C/min have been used to study the integrity of the resultant interfaces. Lamination at the highest heating rate and pressures of 5 and 10 bar yields interfaces with many voids and a thick epoxy thickness above chip compared to other lamination conditions. Based on shear test results with a shear speed of 100 m/sec and shear height of 40 m, the low pressures of 5 bar and 10 bar and the highest heating rate result in lower shear strength values than the slowest heating rate of 3 °C/min. Lamination at a pressure of 20 bar yields embedded structures with the highest strength regardless the <b>lamination</b> <b>heating</b> rate chosen. <b>Lamination</b> of a combination of 2 -prepreg layers and RCCs with 25 m epoxy thickness can achieve embedding of chips with even 200 m thickness.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{lamination}} technology employed {{for the development of}} a production-capable technology for embedding active components and chips into printed circuit boards (PCBs). The work is jointly performed by a consortium of partners from industry and research within the frame of the European research project "Hiding Dies". It turns out that if lamination principles from the conventional PCB manufacturing can be well tuned and controlled then chip embedding can be achieved by economic means. In specific, Resin-Coated-Copper (RCC) films can be laminated on assembled chips and components providing the polymer dielectric matrix for further 3 D package processing. Lamination of RCC films can superbly replace the spin-coating processes. The chips are attached using adhesive pastes or adhesive films on multilayer FR 4 boards. Precise thickness control of the adhesive is essential for maintaining uniform thicknesses of the build-up dielectric on top of the chip. Filled and no-filled epoxy RCC's have been successfully used to laminate very thin (~ 50 mum) as well as relatively thick chips up to 200 mum. The lamination pressure profile should be very carefully adjusted to avoid chip breakage upon lamination especially for the very thin chips. Pressures from 5 up to 20 bars and heating rates of 3 degC/min and 8 degC/min have been used to study the integrity of the resultant interfaces. Laminated samples were exposed to Thermal Cycling from - 55 degC to 125 degC for 1000 cycles and to Jedec level 1 and 3 tests. Shear testing was also employed as evaluation tool for interface strength. From interface morphology and flatness standpoint, RCC's and the die attach materials provide flatness, parallelism and a desirable 20 - 30 mum epoxy thickness above the chip for optimum via laser drilling to chip pads in chip-in-polymer process. After 1000 thermal cycles, there are no signs of interface delaminations. However, after JEDEC level 1, interface delamination occurs at the interfac- es of RCC-Cu/epoxy, epoxy/chip and chip/die attach material. Lamination at the highest heating rate and pressures of 5 and 10 bar yields interfaces with many voids and a thick epoxy thickness above chip compared to other lamination conditions. Based on shear test results with a shear speed of 100 mum/sec and shear height of 40 mum, the low pressures of 5 bar and 10 bar and the highest heating rate result in lower shear strength values than the slowest heating rate of 3 degC/min. Lamination at a pressure of 20 bar yields embedded structures with the highest strength regardless the <b>lamination</b> <b>heating</b> rate chosen. These results strongly indicate significance of lamination pressure for good adhesion at epoxy/chip and epoxy/substrate interfaces. Lamination of a combination of 2 -prepreg layers and RCCs with 25 mum epoxy thickness can achieve embedding of chips with even 200 mum thickness. Reliability testing of the laminated embedded chips have shown very promising results.
