25|$|Because, {{prior to}} 1872, {{there was no}} {{provision}} in Massachusetts state law for chartering railroads, all had to be chartered by special acts of legislature. This made <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> and inefficient to charter a railroad because the politicians had to agree; the issue would become partisan. This also meant that the legislature would not let the investors build the line unless they could show it was completely necessary.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} SPI flash types. The first type is {{characterized}} by small pages and one or more internal SRAM page buffers allowing a complete page to be read to the buffer, partially modified, and then written back (for example, the Atmel AT45 DataFlash or the Micron Technology Page Erase NORFlash). The second type has larger sectors. The smallest sectors typically found in an SPI flash are 4kB, {{but they can be}} as large as 64kB. Since the SPI flash lacks an internal SRAM buffer, the complete page must be read out and modified before being written back, making <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> to manage. SPI flash is cheaper than DataFlash and is therefore a good choice when the application is code shadowing.|$|E
25|$|The Nationalist {{offensive}} {{started on}} 25 April, with General José Enrique Varela's Army Corps of Castille, Antonio Aranda's Galician corps, and Garcia Valiño's formation, but the advance was halted on 27 April. On 1 May, the Nationalists continued their offensive, advancing on three fronts from Teruel (Varela), the Mediterranean sea coast (Aranda), and a central column moving between {{them through the}} mountains (Garcia Valiño). The Nationalists found <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> going due to rainy weather in March and April that slowed the offensive, the difficult terrain that aided the defense of Republican forces being driven back before them, and the dogged determination of the Republican troops, reinforced with new weapons brought in from France: Soviet Supermosca (I-16 Type 10) fighters with four machine-guns, 40 Grumman FF fighters and anti-aircraft guns. On June 13, Castellón fell to Garcia Valiño's corps after several days of fighting but they were halted short of Sagunto where the mountains of the Sierra de Espadán came close to the sea. With the fall of Castellón, the Nationalists had a Mediterranean harbor into which munitions and food could {{be brought to the}} Nationalists troops in this front.|$|E

Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but desired something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game is because he ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its movement but found <b>it</b> <b>slow.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates the {{difficulties}} of finding and maintaining love. Cristin Maher of Taste of Country contended that the song exemplifies the desire some people have {{when they want to}} make the move from a physical relationship to an emotional relationship, which is represented by the song lyrics [...] "Let’s take <b>it</b> <b>slow,</b> I don’t want to move too fast / I don’t wanna just make love, I wanna make love last." [...] Gibson, one of the writers of the song, stated that the song does not contain a lot of flowery lyrics or sentiment. He added, [...] "It’s just straight up what somebody would say to somebody they’d want to be with." ...|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping <b>it</b> <b>slow,</b> funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E

[...] Brown inked the pre-Vortex stories with a brush; when he committed himself to a regular schedule, he felt inking with a brush would be too slow, and switched to cheap markers or pencils to increase his productivity. [...] He continued to use a brush to fill in blacks and to letter his dialogue balloons.

2500|$|Light water (the {{ordinary}} H2O) is both {{a neutron}} moderator and a neutron absorber. This means that not only can <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> down neutrons to velocities in equilibrium with surrounding molecules ("thermalize" [...] them {{and turn them into}} low-energy neutrons that {{are far more likely to}} interact with the uranium-235 nuclei than the fast neutrons produced by fission initially), but it can also absorb some of them outright. Heavy water is also a good neutron moderator, but is expensive to produce and does not absorb neutrons as easily, so the use of enriched fuel is not required to produce a meaningful power output.|$|E

2500|$|Courtney's first {{professional}} race was the makeup race with Riley on August 28, 1877. Courtney and Riley {{agreed to a}} single scull race over a three-mile (5km) course with a turn (stake race) on Saratoga Lake, and a purse of $800 to the winner. Also included in the race was noted professional rower Frederick Plaisted. Fred Plaisted had been at Greenwood Lake when Courtney was poisoned {{and was unable to}} race Riley. He had planned to challenge the winner of that race. To make the race even, all three competitors had to row in identical racing sculls. Both of Courtney’s rivals did have an advantage over him. Courtney had not fully recovered from the after-effects of the poisoning and planned to take <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> {{at the beginning of the}} race so he would be able to have a strong finish. [...] Courtney was also using shorter oars than he usually used.|$|E
2500|$|The Williams {{family moved}} from Compton, California, to West Palm Beach, Florida, {{when she was}} ten, so that Venus and Serena could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who took notice of the sisters and who would provide {{additional}} coaching. He did not always agree with Williams's father but respected that [...] "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was eleven, since {{he wanted them to}} take <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> and focus on schoolwork. Another motivation was racial, as he had allegedly heard parents of other players disparage the Williams sisters during tournaments. At that time, Venus Williams held a 63–0 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1among the under-12 players in Southern California. In 1995, Richard pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy, and from then on took over all coaching at their home.|$|E

Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also drove this experience, as Richard Williams had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: [...] "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Discontent with Diệm and Nhu {{exploded}} into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists {{died at the}} hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. In response, the US government {{was concerned about the}} possibility [...] "for the Dim/Nhu government to succeed and for us [...] to continue to support them." [...] The response by Ambassador Nolting was, [...] "We should take <b>it</b> <b>slow</b> and easy {{and see if we can}} live with the Diem government." [...] As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need [...] "political liquidation" [...] we should also [...] "urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary." [...] In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.|$|E
