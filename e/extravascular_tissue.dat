Second, we examined the effects of histamine, which is thought to affect endothelial permeability, on IgE passage through the RAEC in comparison with the effects of albumin and IgG 2 a. Methods: The permeability constant (PC) was used to evaluate the degree of IgE passage through the RAEC. Results: The value of the PC for rat IgE (0. 58 ± 0. 11 x 10 − 5 cm/s) was lower than that for IgG 2 a and albumin (0. 88 ± 0. 28 x 10 − 5 and 0. 93 ± 0. 26 x 10 − 5 cm/s, respectively) under conditions of non-exposure to histamine. In contrast, the PC of rat IgE was significantly increased by exposure to histamine (10 − 10 mol/L) at 12 h after exposure. However, the PC for IgG 2 a and albumin were not significantly increased following exposure to histamine. The enhancement by histamine of IgE passage through the RAEC was not inhibited by diphenhydramine, a histamine H receptor antagonist, but were inhibited by cimetidine, a histamine H 2 receptor antagonist. Conclusions: On the basis of results from the present study, histamine, acting via H 2 receptors, enhances the permeability of rat IgE across the RAEC monolayer.

The histology of the tumours was squamous cell carcinoma in two cases, adenocarcinoma in one, carcinoid tumour in one, and large cell carcinoma in one. The regional blood volume and <b>extravascular</b> <b>tissue</b> density were also measured using PET. Regions of interest were drawn for both non-tumour and tumour lung tissue.

Objective, The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of FVIIa interaction with EPCR on the endothelium in mediating FVIIa transport from the circulation to <b>extravascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> Methods: Wild-type, EPCR-deficient or ECPR-over expressing mice were injected with human rFVIIa (120 μg/kg b. w.) via tail vein. At varying time intervals following rFVIIa administration, blood and various tissues were collected to measure FVIIa antigen and activity levels. Tissue sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for FVIIa and EPCR. Results: The data reveal that, following intravenous injection, rFVIIa rapidly disappears from blood and associates with the endothelium in an EPCR-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that association of FVIIa with the endothelium was maximal at 30 min and thereafter progressively declined. FVIIa association with the endothelium was undetectable at time points exceeding 24 h post FVIIa administration. The levels of rFVIIa accumulated in tissue correlates with expression levels of EPCR in mice and FVIIa associated with tissues remained functionally active for periods of at least 7 days. Conclusions: The observation that EPCR-dependent association of FVIIa with the endothelium is most pronounced soon after rFVIIa administration and subsequently declines temporally, combined with the retention of functionally-active FVIIa in tissue homogenates for extended periods, indicates that FVIIa binding to EPCR on the endothelium facilitates the transport of FVIIa from circulation to <b>extravascular</b> <b>tissues</b> where TF resides. © 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis...|$|R

MNL and lung membrane beta-adrenergic receptor densities were correlated highly (r = 0. 845, P less than 0. 001). Platelet alpha 2 -adrenergic receptor and lung alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor densities were not. Lung alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor densities were positively related to plasma norepinephrine (r = 0. 840, P less than 0. 01) and epinephrine (r = 0. 860, P less than 0. 01) concentrations; in contrast, lung beta-adrenergic receptor densities were not positively related to plasma catecholamine concentrations (they tended to be inversely related to plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine [r = - 0. 698, P less than 0. 05] levels). This apparent reciprocal regulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors by the sympathochromaffin system was only demonstrable with adrenergic receptor measurements in the <b>extravascular</b> catecholamine target <b>tissue.</b> Neither MNL beta-adrenergic receptor nor platelet alpha-adrenergic receptor densities were correlated with plasma catecholamine levels.

Two subpopulations of cells were isolated from a methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma.

An injection of 2. 0 x 10 (5) cells into the footpad of syngeneic mice {{led to the development of}} primary tumors in 87 % of the animals and lung metastases in 61 % of the animals with primary tumors.

In contrast, an injection of the same number of cells from the second subpopulation of fibrosarcoma cells led to the development of primary tumors in only 12 % of syngeneic mice, and lung metastases did not occur. Neither this subpopulation nor normal embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated chemotactic responsiveness.

The {{innate immune system}} {{is responsible for the}} primary response and one type of granular cells, mast cells (MCs), has been reported to play a critical role as part of the defence function against pathogens and evidence for its involvement in the immune system of fish is growing. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely distributed in nature and are considered to be ancestral components in the evolution on innate immunity. Several types of AMPs have been isolated from fish and they are present in mucosal surfaces and in immune cells such as MCs. One type of AMPs expressed by fish MCs is piscidins, which are 22 - 44 residue, α-helical AMPs that were originally isolated from MCs of hybrid striped bass. In this study on gills of 45 Dicentrarchus labrax, the MCs positive to piscidin 3 and 4 synthesized greater amounts of these peptides in the presence of metazoans, irrespective of the number of parasites or of the proximity to them.

However, the effects of IL- 15 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) during HIV infection are still unclear. In this study, we evaluated whether IL- 15 regulates the macrophage stimulatory pathways governing inflammatory events that take place in the lung of patients with HIV infection. As a first step we evaluated the in vitro effects of IL- 15 on lung macrophages retrieved from the respiratory tract of eight normal subjects. Although macrophages from uninfected individuals expressed the IL- 15 binding proteins (IL- 15 Ralpha and the common gammac) at resting conditions, they did not express IL- 15 messenger RNA (mRNA). However, a 24 -hour stimulation with IL- 15 induced the expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL- 15 itself, suggesting a role for this cytokine in the activation of the pulmonary macrophage pool during inflammation. As a confirmation of the role of IL- 15 in this setting, at resting conditions, alveolar macrophages of patients with HIV infection and T-cell alveolitis expressed IL- 15, IFN-gamma, and IL- 15 binding proteins; showed an upmodulation of costimulatory molecules, B 7 and CD 72, which are involved in the APC of macrophages; and behaved as effective accessory cells because they elicited a strong proliferation of T cells. The accessory effect was inhibited by pretreatment with anti-CD 72, anti-B 7 (CD 80 and CD 86), and anti-IL- 15 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb). We then investigated the relationship between IL- 15 and the expression of costimulatory molecules by macrophages. A 24 -hour stimulation of IL- 15 Ralpha+/gammac+ macrophages with IL- 15 upregulated the expression of CD 80 and CD 86. The evidence that IL- 15 upregulates the expression of coligands that favor the contact between T cells and APC, per se, triggers T-cell activation and proliferation and acts as a chemoattractant for T cells, suggests that IL- 15 {{plays a key role in}} Tc 1 -mediated defense mechanisms taking place in <b>extravascular</b> <b>tissues</b> of patients with HIV disease...|$|R
