40|$|AbstractBased on {{comprehensive}} {{analyses of}} seismic and log data, this {{study indicates that}} mainly four widespread angular to minor angular unconformities (Tg 8, Tg 51, Tg 5 and Tg 3) were formed during the Paleozoic. Through the interpretation of structural unconformities, calculation of eroded thickness, correction of palaeo-water depth and compaction and compilation of the Early Paleozoic structural maps, the Early Paleozoic slope break belt (<b>geomorphologic</b> <b>unit)</b> of the Tarim Basin is subdivided into uplift area, subaqueous uplift area, rift slope break belt, flexure slope break belt (slope belt), depression area and deep basin area. Palaeogeomorphology of the Cambrian-Early Ordovician was approximately in EW trend within which three tectonic units including the Tabei Palaeo-uplift, the northern Depressional Belt and the southern Palaeo-uplift developed respectively and are grouped into two slope break systems namely as the Tabei Palaeo-uplift and the southern Palaeo-uplift. These tectonic units obviously control the deposition of isolated platform, open platform, restricted platform and deep basin. Influenced by extrusion in the Mid-Late Ordovician, the southern and northern subaqueous uplifts gradually elevated and then were eroded. Resultantly two slope break systems developed, namely as the northern and central Palaeo-uplifts which obviously controlled the deposition of provenance area, isolated platform, mixed continental shelf, slope and basin facies. The intensive extrusion of the Mid-Late Ordovician leads to significant tectonic deformation of the Tarim Basin: large area of uplifting and erosion and development of EW trending anticline and syncline. Deposition of shore, tidal flat, delta, shallow marine clastics and deep marine facies is obviously controlled by the Tabei, the southern and the Tadong Palaeo-uplifts. Slope break systems control development of stratigraphic unconformity and thus truncation and onlap unconformity zones become favorable areas in a palaeo-uplift and at a palaeo-slope belt for forming important unconformity traps; Whereas slope (slope break) belt along a palaeo-uplift margin is a <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>unit</b> where high-energy sedimentary facies widely develops, such as reef, oolitic sandy clastics or bioclastic limestone beach bar facies, thus litho-structural composite hydrocarbon accumulations usually develop when tectonic condition is suitable.

The {{northwest}} corner of the MoonÕs South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin contains a high abundance of thorium and a unique Imbrian aged <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>unit</b> that consists of Ògrooves and moundsÓ (referred to here as the Imbrian grooves). Because the location of these features are almost antipodal to the Imbrium basin, where high-thorium ejecta and seismic energy {{are expected to have}} converged, an Imbrium origin for these units has long seemed certain. By modeling the deposition of impact ejecta on the Moon, we have investigated whether the convergence of ImbriumÕs ejecta at its antipode could be the origin of both the Imbrian grooves and SPA thorium anomaly. As a result of the MoonÕs rotation, our results show that ejecta from this basin should converge more than 12 ° west of its antipode. Both the Imbrian grooves and thorium anomaly within SPA, however, reside slightly to the east of ImbriumÕs antipode. In an attempt to reconcile this disparity, the effects of a putative oblique Imbrium impact have been qualitatively investigated. While this model can distribute ejecta in the general vicinity of the Imbrian grooves, the planform of our modeled antipodal ejecta is distinctly different from that which is observed. As an alternative explanation for the origin of these features, we find that the modeled distribution of ejecta from an oblique Serenitatis impact is surprisingly similar to the planform of the Imbrian grooves, with the exception that it is offset directly to the east.

The AVS 30 is computed for approximately 2, 000 sites where shear-wave velocity has been measured in all over Japan. Geomorphologic units for all boreholes logging data are interpreted using land-classification maps at a scale of 1 : 50, 000 that are the base paper maps for the JEGM. The average value and variance of AVS 30 for each <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>unit</b> are then calculated. The mean AVS 30 s among geomorphologic units are found to correlate with the geomorphologic classification. Next, we examine the correlation between not only geomorphologic units but also geographic information derived from the JEGM and the AVS 30 values. The AVS 30 s also show some dependency with elevations, slope gradients, and distances from mountains or hills. In order to develop the estimating model of the AVS 30, multiple linear regression analysis is conducted using these geomorphologic indices. The standard error of the AVS 30 estimation by using this model is 35 %. Therefore, we can achieve to create an AVS 30 map with relatively high accuracy for all of Japan using the JEGM. Thus, developed JEGM can be allowed detailed estimation of the site amplification factor of strong ground motion nationwide. ...|$|E

In order to identify different geomorphologic features (scarps, terraces and trenches) of the landslide and their development, the analytical and digital photo interpretation was performed at the maximum scale of 1 : 5000.

This study is conducted to develop a digital <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>unit</b> hydrograph (DGUH), which was derived, based on the theory of one dimensional hillside-rampant-flow, firstly with the geomorphologic and hydrological characteristics considered separately and then the in-site terrain and rainfall data were integrated to become a model of more theoretical and physical soundness. To verify the model, firstly the influence of the size of computational grid on the rainfall-runoff relationship was studied. Secondly the meaningfulness of physiographic and hydrological parameters in the DGUH model was analyzed. In this study, the data of Lien-Hua-Chi (LHC) # 3 watershed and Pi-Lu-Chi (PLC) # 11 watershed of the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute in central Taiwan were retrieved and fed into the model. It was found that the DGUH model was sound, rational, and consistent through a series of theoretical deduction, model establishment, characteristic analysis and verification tests. In the geomorphologic analysis, the concentration time in the DGUH model under a given rainfall intensity is the same for a selected time interval with different rainfall durations. However, the peak discharge is linearly proportional to the grid size. It was also found that the longer the rainfall duration is, the larger the peak discharge and vice versa. On an uniform slope under a given rainfall intensity, it had found that the steeper the slope is, the shorter the concentration time, and the larger the peak discharge. However, the total runoff was the same if the area of watershed kept the same no matter whether the slope was steep or gentle. In the hydrological analysis, the DGUH model became trapezoid in shape under a linear watershed condition if the value of rainfall duration is less than that of the watershed area. However, the model became triangular if the value of rainfall duration is {{the same as that of}} the watershed area. If the value of rainfall duration was far more than that of the watershed area, then the DGUH hydrograph was S-like in shape. Therefore, both the linear grid watershed with unit rainfall duration and the linear rainfall duration with unit watershed area would result in the same runoff features. Under certain conditions the time distribution of rainfall and space distribution of watershed would compensate each other. In addition, the system output function would theoretically be the multiplication of rainfall and geological transit function. The discharge is considered as the start of watershed base-flow when the time interval is greater than rainfall duration plus duration of geological transit minus one, i. e., (). The results of data analysis of LHC # 3 and PLC # 11, indicated that the smaller the n (roughness coefficient) value is, the shorter the concentration time, and the larger the peak discharge, and vice versa. The n values would affect peak time, peak discharge, concentration time and others if the formulas of grid output time, duration and area were applied. In addition, the concentration time is directly proportional to n value, while the peak discharge is inversely proportional to it. If the hydrographs were estimated from the DGUH models with rainfalls of the two study watersheds, it was found that the DGUH models fitted the real data reasonably well. In conclusion, the DGUH model developed in this paper serves as good as the models developed by other researchers. However, the advantage of DGUH model is that the parameters needed for calculation are easy to obtain. For example, the calculation of runoff of DGUH could be achieved by obtaining geological factors such as watershed area (A), roughness coefficient (n), infiltration rate (f), slopes (s), etc, or hydrological factors such as rainfall intensity (i), average depth (h), etc. For estimating stream flow hydrographs in a watershed without discharge records, it is straightforward to using DGUH model. If combined with frequency analysis, storm hyetographs, rainfall duration, the applications of DGUH model would be even more powerful and wider. Therefore, it is suggested that further studies focus on the revision of the model to expand its application. 數值地形單位歷線模式之推導與應用 摘 要 台灣地區之河川因坡陡流急，加上降雨時空不均，以致在水資源之開發、利用、保育及管理工作上極難全然掌握，為使水資源及相關工程之規劃及設計能更迅速精確，實有必要建立一水文分析工具以資應用。而在水文分析上，對於發生在集水區降雨與逕流間關係之探討十分重要，但由降雨到逕流之水文歷程係一複雜多變之過程，實難於掌握。自 1932 年Sherman創擬單位歷線以來，其後繼學者又發展了各種線性及非線性之降雨逕流模式，惟其理論複雜、具有過多假設或物理意義不甚嚴謹，致應用困難。本研究爰以一維坡地漫地流理論為基礎，推導一將地文及水文特性分離，並將現地數值地形資料及降雨分別處理後，再整合成一具有理論基礎及物理意義之數值地形單位歷線模式(Digital <b>Geomorphologic</b> <b>Unit</b> Hydrograph，簡寫 DGUH) 。 為評估所建立之理論、模式之妥適性，在應用之前並先探討集水區之數值地形網格劃分對降雨逕流之影響，及分析地文及水文參數在數值地形單位歷線之特性，同時並利用農委會林試所蓮花池 3 號及畢祿溪 11 號集水區進行降雨逕流之模擬、分析、比較。由DGUH理論之推導、模式之建立、特性之分析以及實例之模擬，業已獲致若干具體成果。 在地文特性分析中，當集水區於相同降雨強度條件下，若因降雨延時之不同，則配合相同時距網格所產生之DGUH，其集流時間相同，但洪峰流量則與網格長度成線性關係，降雨延時長則洪峰流量大，短則洪峰流量小。而均勻單坡集水區於相同降雨強度條件下，坡度越陡集流時間越短、洪峰流量越大，且當陡坡及緩坡集水區具有相同面積及相同降雨強度條件，將產生相等之逕流總量。 在水文特性分析中，（ 1 ）當集水區成為線形條件下，且其降雨延時小於線形集水區面積數時，則產生梯形DGUH歷線；（ 2 ）當降雨延時等於線形集水區面積數時，則產生三角形DGUH歷線；（ 3 ）在降雨延時遠大於線形集水區面積數之條件下，則產生DGUH之類S歷線。由研究獲知：線形網格集水區於單位降雨延時條件下，與單位面積集水區於線性降雨延時條件下，獲得相同之逕流行為。是以降雨之時間分布與集水區之空間分布，在部分情形下，具有互補之作用。另由理論之推導知系統之輸出函數，為該場降雨與地文轉移函數之乘積，而當時間超過降雨延時與地文轉移函數延時之和減 1 時（ ）之流出量，即可視為集水區基流之開始。 而蓮花池 3 號集水區及畢祿溪 11 號集水區等，於不同糙度係數（n）所推估之數值地形單位歷線，當n值越小，則其集流時間越短、洪峰流量越大；而當n值越大，則集流時間越長、洪峰流量越小。另由網格流出時間及時間、面積等公式知，n值對於峰時、峰量、集流時間等均有影響，且集流時間與n值成正比，而峰量則與n值成反比。經利用DGUH推算兩研究集水區多場降雨之歷線與實測值很接近。 綜上可知，有關數值地形單位歷線之特性，與其他理論所推導之結果相近，而所獲得之DGUH因具有各種物理參數，因此可由不同地文因子如集水區面積(A) 、糙度係數(n) 、入滲率(f) 、坡度(s) 值等；或水文因子如降雨強度(i) 、漫地流平均水深(h) 等為參數，計算集水區之降雨逕流。對於無流量紀錄集水區之水文推估，運用極為方便，未來如再結合頻率分析、雨型分布、降雨延時等方法，其運用性將更寬更廣，因此後續之工作可將此一模式再予精緻化，俾利其應用領域之拓展。封面 目錄 謝誌 中文摘要 英文摘要 圖目錄 表目錄 附圖目錄 附表目錄 符號說明 第一章 前言 1. 1 研究目的 1. 2 研究構想 第二章 文獻回顧 2. 1 降雨逕流水文模式 2. 2 運動波理論 2. 3 數值高程與地理資訊系統應用 2. 4 時間面積與瞬時單位歷線 第三章 理論推導及模式建立 3. 1 漫地流模式 3. 2 理論推導 3. 3 模式建立 3. 3. 1 數值地形模型之建立 3. 3. 2 集水區流路樹之建立 3. 3. 3 集水區流路樹流量、時間之推估 3. 3. 4 數值地形單位歷線模式之建立 第四章 數值地形單位歷線模式之特性 4. 1 不同型態集水區之DGUH 4. 2 不同流況集水區之DGUH 4. 3 不同降雨延時之DGUH 4. 4 不同降雨時間之DGUH 4. 5 極值(極小或極大) 降雨延時之探討 第五章 模式之應用 5. 1 蓮花池及畢祿溪集水區概況 5. 2 蓮花池及畢祿溪集水區地文資料之處理 5. 3 蓮花池及畢祿溪集水區水文資料之處理 5. 4 蓮花池及畢祿溪集水區降雨逕流之模擬 5. 5 蓮花池及畢祿溪集水區模擬與實測之比較 5. 6 結果之討論 第六章 討論與未來發展 6. 1 結論 6. 2 未來發展 參考文獻 附錄一 漫地流方程式之推導 附錄二 狀態轉移函數後退逐項求解法 附錄三 流路樹流出時間演算程式 附錄四 由流出時間推求DGUH演算程式 附錄五 由降雨及DGUH推求直接逕流演算程式 附錄六 蓮花池及畢祿溪集水區雨量與劉量之原始資料 附錄七 蓮花池及畢祿溪集水區降雨逕流之模擬附圖 簡...|$|E

O objetivo deste trabalho foi {{discutir}} como a dinâmica fluvial atua nos processos de sucessão vegetacional, considerando os processos de erosão e deposição, dentro de um curto intervalo temporal, e a dinâmica de cheias. O processamento de informações dos mapas das unidades morfossedimentares da planície e das unidades vegetacionais resultou no mapa de unidades morfovegetacionais. Verificou-se que as unidades vegetacionais se distribuem e compõem, de modo diversificado, um mosaico vegetacional pela planície. Entre 1965 e 1997, a ação dos processos erosivos, nas margens do canal que consomem a planície aluvial, tem removido principalmente vegetações arbóreas de grande porte, e as altas taxas de sedimentação contribuem para a formação da unidade geomorfológica mais jovem da planície, que é colonizada, sobretudo, por espécies herbáceas. The {{existence of}} different vegetable typologies in the alluvial plains {{of the middle}} Araguaia presents a pattern of distribution determined by the fluvial dynamic of the channel {{and the type of}} sediments that form different units of the alluvial plain. The {{purpose of this study was}} to discuss how the fluvial processes acts in vegetation succession, considering the erosive and sedimentary activities within a short period of time, as well as the flood dynamic. The combined information from morphosedimentary unit maps of the alluvial plain and the vegetation units allows the elaboration of the map of morphosedimentary units. It was possible to verify that the vegetation units were distributed in a diversified way along the alluvial plain, composing a vegetation mosaic. Between 1965 and 1997, the action of the erosive processes in the banks of the channel that consume the alluvial plain removed in particular large arboreal vegetation types, and the high rates of sedimentation contribute to the formation of the most recent <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>unit</b> of the plain, which is being colonized especially by herbaceous species...|$|E
