40|$|Recent {{preclinical}} {{studies have}} associated beta-adrenergic receptor (Î²-AR) signaling {{with breast cancer}} pathways such as progression and metastasis. These findings have been supported by clinical and epidemiological studies which examined the effect of beta-blocker therapy on breast cancer metastasis, recurrence and mortality. Results from these studies have provided initial evidence for the inhibition of cell migration in breast cancer by beta-blockers and have introduced the beta-adrenergic receptor pathways as a target for therapy. This paper analyses gene expression profiles in breast cancer patients, utilising Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify molecular signatures corresponding to possible <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> <b>pathways</b> and biomarker treatment strategies associated with beta- 2 -adrenergic receptor (ADRB 2) cell signaling. The adrenergic receptor relationship to cancer is investigated in order to validate the results of recent studies that suggest the use of beta-blockers for breast cancer therapy.

40|$|Purpose: The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) has {{produced}} Guidelines on Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT). We sought {{to gauge the}} preparedness of primary care {{to participate in the}} delivery of AIT in Europe. Methods: We undertook a mixed-methods, situational analysis. This involved a purposeful literature search, and two surveys: one to primary care clinicians and the other to a wider group of stakeholders across Europe. Results: The 10 papers identified all pointed out gaps or deficiencies in allergy care provision in primary care. The surveys also highlighted similar concerns, particularly in relation to concerns about lack of knowledge, skills, infrastructural weaknesses, reimbursement policies and communication with specialists as barriers to evidence-based care. Almost all countries (92 %) reported the availability of AIT. In spite of that, only 28 % and 44 % of the countries reported the availability of guidelines for primary care physicians and specialists, respectively. Agreed pathways between specialists and primary care physicians were reported as existing in 32 - 48 % of countries. Reimbursement appeared to be an important barrier as AIT was only fully reimbursed in 32 % of countries. Additionally, 44 % of respondents considered accessibility to AIT and 36 % stating patient costs were barriers. Conclusions: Successful working with primary care providers is essential to scaling-up AIT provision in Europe, but to achieve this the identified barriers must be overcome.

40|$|Introduction: Given {{the rise}} in {{dementia}} prevalence, primary care dementia workload is inevitably increasing. Caring for people with dementia is demanding and it requires ongoing specialist training (1), yet many health and social care staff in contact with people with dementia in Ireland lack specialist dementia knowledge and {{are less likely to}} have received specialist training in comparison to health professionals based in nursing homes (2, 3). The Irish National Dementia Strategy (4) prioritizes the need for dementia specific training to broaden the skills base of primary care health professionals. The overall aim of the Primary Care Education, Pathways and Research of Dementia (PREPARED) program is to deliver and evaluate training, education and support interventions for general practitioners (GPs) and Primary Care Teams (PCTs) that will contribute to patients receiving an integrated, collaborative dementia care response from a prepared, proactive local primary care network. Practice Change: The specific aims of the PCT component of PREPARED are to develop, test and implement a dementia educational workshop for PCTs around collaborative and integrated dementia care. The workshop content is suitable for all primary care clinicians and health professionals who provide care and support to people with dementia and their families in the community. The workshop has been peer reviewed and will be piloted in 2 sites in December and early January 2017, following which it will be rolled out nationally. The training reflects the priorities within the NDS, draws on the principles of the widely used Chronic Care Model (5) and is grounded in the day-to-day needs of patients and PCT members. Successful implementation depends on behaviour change underpinned by increased understanding of dementia and improved outcomes for people with dementia and their families through integrated care practice. The PCT workshop has been developed to achieve change on the basis of an evaluation of current education and support needs among health professionals delivering dementia care within primary care settings. Program Highlights: The impact of the PCT workshop will be evaluated against the following outcomes: (a) increased knowledge of the characteristics of dementia, (b) increased knowledge of how best to support those living with dementia, (c) increased understanding of PCT roles and responsibilities involved in providing integrated dementia care, and (d) increased skill regarding PCT collaboration and inter-professional communication. Researchers from Dublin City University will carry out a comprehensive outcomes and process evaluation of the program guided by the Medical Research Council UK framework for the evaluation of complex interventions (6, 7). Conclusions: The evaluation results will be used to determine level of programme success, why it works and how it can be optimised, and why less successful or unexpected outcomes occurred. Findings will also be used to make recommendations for the subsequent operation and national rollout of the program. The PREPARED PCT Training has the potential to contribute to the impact assessment of collaborative educational interventions on dementia care in Ireland, making it an exemplar for other chronic <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> <b>pathways.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Varicose veins are {{a common}} problem with 25 - 50 % of the {{population}} symptomatically affected, and chronic venous disease leads to significant impairments in quality of life with substantial health system cost implications. Significant variability exists in the symptoms suffered by patients, the treatment offered and the outcomes achieved. Identification of the optimal treatment pathways for patients remains difficult. Aims i. To ascertain primary care disease knowledge. ii. To assess what affects treatment and identify which patients benefit most. iii. To generate a predictive model of varicose vein outcomes. iv. To {{assess the impact of}} altering treatment of varicosities in the context of endovenous truncal vein ablation v. Toinvestigatetheearlyimpactofnewtechnologies Methods i. Two survey studies were completed: â 21 questions assessing venous <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> <b>pathways</b> was disseminated to General Practitioners. â 19 questions assessing the management of superficial venous thrombosis and was distributed to General Practitioners and Vascular Surgeons. ii. A cohort of consecutive patients with symptomatic chronic venous disease were assessed and completed quality of life questionnaires pre and post- intervention. iii. Uni-variable and multi-variable analysis of patient cohort data to facilitate the creation of generalised model of venous treatment outcomes iv. A randomised clinical trial assessing the timing of varicosity avulsion in the context of local anaesthetic endovenous truncal ablation. â Ambulatory Varicosity avUlsion Later or Synchronised (AVULS) trial. v. Assessmentofnewtechnologies â The European Sapheon Closure system Observed ProspectivE (eSCOPE) study a multi-site cohort observational study of cyanoacrylate glue occlusion of truncal vein incompetence â The VNUS Versus Clarivein for Varicose Veins (VVCVV) multi-centre randomised clinical trial comparing the procedural pain profile of radiofrequency and mechanochemical ablation. Results i. Education outcomes â 138 responses were received. The management of chronic venous disease in the primary care setting is disparate and knowledge of current techniques is poor, despite extensive guidance. â 369 responses were received, from 197 vascular specialists and 172 primary care physicians. Superficial thrombophlebitis management is shown to be diverse and does not adhere to recent evidence. ii. 461 patients were recruited. Patients suffering from chronic venous disease suffer from substantial quality of life impairment, including previously under-recognised depressive symptoms. Treatment of the underlying venous condition provides relief from venous symptoms and improves quality of life. â Patient symptoms and quality of life do not correlate with anatomical vein diameter, however clinical severity scores do. iii. Predictive modelling produces models that account for 30 - 41 % of the variability in post-operative scores for disease specific quality of life tools, generic quality of life tools, and clinical severity scores. iv. The AVULS trial recruited 101 patients. Simultaneous treatment leads to improved clinical outcomes at up to 1 year and early quality of life improvement. Delayed treatment has a significantly increased risk of requiring further treatment (Odds Ratio 27. 78, Relative Risk 18. 36, p< 0. 0001). 95 % of patients declining randomisation opted for simultaneous treatment. v. NewTechnologyOutcomes â The eSCOPE study recruited 70 patients in Europe with good technical outcomes. â The VVCVV trial (ongoing) has recruited 85 patients, with significantly reduced procedural pain found with mechanochemical ablation. Conclusions Varicose veins are a widespread problem with effective treatment that leads to a significant improvement in quality of life. Education and communication between community and hospital-based medicine is lacking. Predictive modelling of varicose vein symptoms remains difficult due to the multifactorial nature of the disease. Simultaneous treatment of varicosities during endovenous truncal ablation produces improved outcomes and is the option of choice for most patients.

40|$|Achieving {{the support}} of {{physicians}} {{is perhaps the most}} difficult challenge to successfully implementing a <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programme. Most physicians are sceptical of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> initiatives. Many perceive these programmes to be a threat to their professional autonomy or an unreasonable demand on their limited time with patients. Nonetheless, failure to achieve high levels of physician support results in suboptimal levels of patient identification, enrolment and effectiveness of interventions. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve good outcomes across a large population without achieving physician buy-in. Leaders of organisations implementing <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programmes can use 5 core strategies to achieve physician buy-in for <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programmes. These are: education, enlisting champions, `creating a box', building on success, and sharing the gains. Providing education corrects misconceptions many physicians have about <b>disease</b> <b>management.</b> Champions are respected clinicians who are willing to share their positive views of a <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programme. `Creating a box' sets clear goals and expectations for physicians who consider building a <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programme.

40|$|<b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> is a {{new method}} of {{managing}} healthcare which has arisen in response to rising healthcare costs and the integration of healthcare providers. <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> is defined as an integrated, systems approach to healthcare designed to influence the progression of disease within selected patient populations. In <b>disease</b> <b>management,</b> {{a detailed analysis of}} a patient population's medical needs and the resources it consumes is performed in order to design, implement and control the delivery of care. Selection of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> strategies is based on application of the best scientific evidence currently available. Ideally, <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> crosses organisational and professional boundaries resulting in seamless care for patients. Originating in the managed care literature, <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> has five primary characteristics. The first is a disease focus in which interventions target patient populations which are at risk of or have defined diseases. The second characteristic is the use of a population-based strategy, i. e. one that emphasises the overall care of patient populations rather than of individual patients. The third characteristic of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> is a systems approach in which the various components of the healthcare system are integrated into a seamless process of care. Fourth, <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> is evidence-based in that it uses information from the medical literature and clinical experience to develop clinical guidelines and protocols for application to clinical practice. Finally, <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> focuses on outcomes rather than processes of care. Pharmacists can fulfil numerous roles in <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> because effective drug therapy is the key to managing most diseases. Pharmacist participation in <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> is often directed toward meeting the needs of managed care organisations (MCOs). Pharmacists will be better able {{to meet the needs of}} MCOs if the services they provide are consistent with a population-based, integrated systems approach to healthcare. Pharmacists can accomplish this by working with other pharmacists to provide <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> services for large managed care populations over wide geographical areas and by integrating their services with other healthcare providers. Pharmacists can provide <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> outside of a managed care model by individually submitting claims for <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> services to insurers, by having patients pay for services out-of-pocket and by using <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> as a way of differentiating themselves from competitors. Obstacles to pharmacist participation in <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> include the continued short term, component focus of healthcare insurers, the need for more detailed patient information and outcomes data for pharmacists and the need for more training in <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> for pharmacists.

40|$|BackgroundâDisease {{management}} has shown great promise {{as a means}} of reorganizing chronic care and optimizing patient outcomes. Nevertheless, <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs are widely heterogeneous and lack a shared definition of <b>disease</b> <b>management,</b> which limits our ability to compare and evaluate different programs. To address this problem, the American Heart Associationâs <b>Disease</b> <b>Management</b> Taxonomy Writing Group developed a system of classification that can be used both to categorize and compare <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs and to inform efforts to identify specific factors associated with effectiveness. MethodsâThe AHA Writing Group began with a conceptual model of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> and its components and subsequently validated this model over a wide range of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs. A systematic MEDLINE search was performed on the terms heart failure, diabetes, and depression, together with <b>disease</b> <b>management,</b> case management, and care management. The search encompassed articles published in English between 1987 and 2005.

40|$|<b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> is a {{strategy}} for patient care across the entire healthcare delivery system and throughout the life-cycle of a <b>disease.</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> is a new paradigm for managed care. It focuses on an alignment of interests between patient, payor and provider. But what is a carve-out, and what is its role in <b>disease</b> <b>management?</b> Is it an interim step to a <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programme? Is it a subset of a <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programme? Does a carve-out have benefits as a stand alone programme? This article addresses these questions by looking at both heart and cancer carve-outs versus <b>disease</b> <b>management.</b> Through these 2 examples, the parameters for <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> and carve-outs are compared. Carve-outs treat the episodic events of a disease and are effective when the disease is independent of other patient conditions, when the disease has a defined beginning and end, and when treatment for the disease is predictable and definable. When a disease has many interdependencies or cause-effect relationships with other conditions, <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> offers the best method of providing treatment for the complete life-cycle of the disease. `Managed care' began by managing access to goods and services, has matured to managing episodes of acute/costly care needs and is gradually migrating to managing the continuum of care needs for optimised outcomes.

Recent findings: The methodological quality of health technology assessment of asthma <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs remains moderate. Asthma <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs are predominantly educational and organizational in nature and focus either on children or on adults. Paediatric <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs make more effort to outreach into patients' living environments and show higher participation rates than those targeting adults.

40|$|Objective: To {{discuss and}} compare kernel-based {{matching}} with one-to-one propensity score matching applied to <b>disease</b> <b>management.</b> Data sources: Administrative claims {{data from a}} US Medicaid fee for service plan. Study design: Matched two group analyses using both kernel-based matching and one-to-one propensity score matching. This comparison {{is applied to the}} estimation of diabetes <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> treatment effects. Principle findings: Kernel-based matching is found to be better than one-to-one propensity score matching when there is no sufficient number of potential controls from which to draw a matched cohort but similar when there is a sufficient number of potential controls. Matching was applied {{in the context of a}} diabetes <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> program that showed an increase in management of each person's medical care through the <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> program. Conclusions: The approach provides a methodology for researchers to evaluate healthcare service innovations without a randomized trial design and delineates the requirements for a matched analysis. Matching was applied in the context of a <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> program showing better patient <b>management</b> through the <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> program. ...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{knowledge}} {{and information technology}} {{play a major role}} in the success of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs in achieving improvements in financial and clinical outcomes. The multi-dimensionality and complexity of data needed to run these programs efficiently make information management an important aspect to consider. <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> clinicians, case managers, nurses, other providers, analysts, managers, and medical directors are constantly using financial, clinical, operational and other data, increasing significantly the demand for information in organizations. Also, with the Internet disseminating critical information among healthcare providers and patients in a more efficient way, careful adoption of new technologies and ideas is required. Consequently, <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs are constantly presenting new technical challenges for healthcare companies. Lacking the proper information systems structure to meet these demands can result in business productivity losses reflected in <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs not achieving their goals of cost savings and patient health quality improvements.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{beginning}} of an industrial revolution in healthcare delivery. Healthcare is being transformed from a cottage industry, in which each provider sets individual standards, to a quality-controlled enterprise with common, evidence-based standards of care. <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> is fundamental to this transformation; {{it is based on the}} application of the industrial engineering principle of `total quality management' to healthcare as `continuous quality improvement'. As little evidence has been published in the peer-reviewed literature regarding the cost effectiveness of <b>disease</b> <b>management,</b> specific <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programmes should be judged by the extent to which its design adheres to the principles of continuous quality improvement. <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> should, furthermore, be integrated into the overall activities of the healthcare system rather than being a carve-out offering. The true value of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> is as a paradigm by which the healthcare system can re-engineer how it goes about its business - with clear goals, recognised standards and ongoing monitoring. The adoption of evidence-based best practice guidelines and the attendant reduction in practice variation will inevitably benefit millions of patients. <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> programmes, Health economics, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R

Asthma <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs are predominantly educational and organizational in nature and focus either on children or on adults.

This paper discusses the potential benefits and disadvantages of <b>disease</b> <b>management,</b> {{on the basis of}} an extensive literature review. <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> is an innovative technology in health care management, which is diffusing throughout the health care system without critical evaluation. Evidence on its effectiveness and costs is still very scarce, while the legal, ethical, organizational, and social implications of this practice have not been analyzed seriously.

40|$|Success {{stories of}} <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> {{programs}} have heightened {{the interest of}} healthcare payors and providers in the adoption of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> principles for their aging members. However, caution is needed for rapid adoption, as several crucial characteristics within the aging population may clash with <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> principles. When developing <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs, {{the characteristics of the}} frail elderly must be considered, otherwise there may be a potential for misapplication of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> principles. For example: (i) frailty is a state rather than a condition; (ii) the complex needs of frail elders are less straightforward and therefore {{make it more difficult to}} apply a formalized set of treatment guidelines; (iii) the mental health and cognitive issues may challenge the reliance on self-management; and (iv) the involvement of caregivers may broaden the scope well beyond clinical care. This article summarizes several successes of <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs and examines the critical components leading to their success, including patient self-management and education, better provider coordination, risk stratifying tools, and the use of evidence-based guidelines. In considering the possibility of using <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> principles to care for the frail elderly population, this article demonstrates that more research, discussions, and practical applications are needed prior to widespread program implementation. The frail condition experienced by many older adults is not just the sum of several disease conditions; therefore, merely combining several <b>disease</b> <b>management</b> programs to serve this population may prove to be less effective than is hoped. Hence the pursuit of more effective approaches to providing care for an aging population continues. <b>Disease</b> <b>management</b> for the frail is most effective when the treatment integrates both the social and medical needs of the patient and caregivers. It is also essential to manage the patient's multiple diseases even though the patient selection and primary focus may be on the primary disease. Disease-management-programmes, Elderly...|$|R
