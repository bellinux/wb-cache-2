5|$|The breed is {{accessible}} {{to the public at}} l'Asinerie nationale de la Tillauderie, an experimental farm in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in Charente-Maritime, and at the Saintes National Stud. Members of the breed are exhibited at the annual Paris International Agricultural Show. Approximately a dozen horses are exported each year, mainly to Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. A few breeding stallions have been exported to the United States. Breeders in the US have become interested in the conservation of the breed as a <b>draft</b> <b>animal,</b> as opposed to many Europeans, who are looking for a leisure animal. A stud farm also exists in Sweden, and one in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable <b>draft</b> <b>animal,</b> and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} {{of the history of}} wheel, chart and <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> in prehistoric times is primarily based on direct finds like wheels, parts of charts or jokes. Other possibilities are osteological evidences for <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> But it is also very important to try to reconstruct the history of the landscape and the settlement patterns. This is the prerequisite for understanding since when the bringing into action of <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> wheels and charts made sense. The archaeobiological investigations from the Neolithic lake shore settlements at the Lake Zürich (town of Zürich) gave sensible indications that this was the case at the transition from the early to the late Late Neolithic period (Jung- / Spätneolithikum), from the Pfyn to the Horgen culture. From the Horgen culture onwards, there is an augmentation of settlements and there are also signs for a sensible opening of the landscape. In addition, we can suppose a diversification of the economy. Therefore, from the Horgen culture onwards a use of <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and charts makes sense...|$|R

25|$|The Plains Indians are an {{archetype}} in art {{and literature}} for all Native Americans. Initially, some Plains Indian tribes were agrarian and others were hunter-gatherers. Some tribes used the dog as a <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> to pull small travois (or sleighs) to help move from place to place. However, in the 18th century most plains tribes adopted the horse culture and became nomadic. The tipi (also tepee and teepee, {{and not to be}} confused with the wigwam of the tribes of the Northeast and the West) was used by Plains Indians as a dwelling because they were portable and could be reconstructed quickly when the tribe settled in a new area for hunting or a pow wow (a periodic gathering of medicine men and/or spiritual leaders).|$|E

500|$|On Han tomb brick reliefs of Sichuan province, {{scenes of}} {{borehole}} drilling for mining projects are shown. They show towering derricks lifting liquid brine through bamboo pipes {{to the surface}} so that the brine could be distilled in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce salt. The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by bamboo pipes, yet gas brought up from [...] below the surface could cause an explosion {{if it was not}} properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han-era Chinese built underground carburetor chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with exhaust pipes. The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the boring tool was rotated by a <b>draft</b> <b>animal,</b> usually oxen or water buffaloes. Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface. Mining shafts dating to the Han dynasty have been found which reach depths of hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the earth, complete with spacious underground rooms structured by timber frames along with ladders and iron tools left behind.|$|E
500|$|The {{first state}} {{constitution}} encouraged state involvement in internal improvements like roads. The Panic of 1837 devastated the new state's efforts, {{and the government}} defaulted on bond payments. Private construction companies built roads starting in 1844 {{to fill the void}} in long-distance road construction left by the departure of the federal government. The first roads were corduroy roads; to build these, logs of all sizes were placed across the road. The gaps between the logs were filled in with smaller logs or earth. In swampy or marshy areas, brush was laid down first for drainage. In time, the logs would rot, leaving large gaps to the roadway that would catch wagon wheels or <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> feet. Later, roads were built with oak planks. The plank road companies had to be chartered by the state after passage of legislation in 1848. According to the plank road law, these companies had to build their roads to a set of minimum specifications. These specifications included [...] in total width, a road surface [...] wide with at least [...] made of [...] planks. Later amendments to the law allowed the companies to substitute gravel for the planks. Starting with the enactment of a new state constitution in 1850, the state was prohibited from being [...] "a part to, or interested in, any work of internal improvement"; this provision ended the state government's involvement in Michigan's roads.|$|E
500|$|The typical carters were [...] {{descended from}} French [...] of the fur trade and their Ojibway spouses. Their {{conveyance}} was the Red River ox cart, a simple vehicle derived {{either from the}} two-wheeled [...] used in French Canada, or from Scottish carts. From 1801 on, this cart was modified {{so that it was}} made solely from local materials. [...] It contained no iron at all. Instead it was constructed entirely of wood and animal hide. Two twelve-foot-long parallel oak shafts or [...] "trams" [...] bracketed the <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> in front and formed the frame of the cart to the rear. Cross-pieces held the floorboards, while front, side and rear boards or rails enclosed the box. These wooden pieces were joined by mortices and tenons. The axle was also made of seasoned oak. It was lashed to the cart by strips of wet bison hide known by its Cree name of shaganappi, which shrank and tightened as they dried. The axles connected two spoked wheels, five or six feet in diameter, which were [...] "dished" [...] or {{in the form of a}} shallow cone, the apex of which was at the hubs, which were inboard of the rims. [...] The carts were originally drawn by small horses obtained from the First Nations. After cattle were brought to the colony in the 1820s, oxen were used to haul the carts. They were preferred because of their strength, endurance, and cloven hooves which spread their weight in swampy areas.|$|E
50|$|A {{working animal}} is an animal, usually domesticated, that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks. They may be close {{members of the}} family, such as guide dogs or other {{assistance}} dogs, {{or they may be}} animals trained to provide tractive force, such as draft horses or logging elephants. The latter types of <b>animals</b> are called <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> (draught animals) or beasts of burden. Most working animals are either service <b>animals</b> or <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> They may also be used for milking or herding, jobs that require human training to encourage the animal to cooperate. Some, {{at the end of their}} working lives, may also be used for meat or other products such as leather.|$|R

2500|$|According to the 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) report Livestock's Long Shadow, animal {{agriculture}} contributes on a [...] "massive scale" [...] {{to global}} warming, air pollution, land degradation, energy use, deforestation, and biodiversity decline. The FAO report {{estimates that the}} livestock (including poultry) sector (which provides <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> power, leather, wool, milk, eggs, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, etc., in addition to meat) contributes about 18 percent of global GHG emissions expressed as 100-year CO2 equivalents. This estimate was based on life-cycle analysis, including feed production, land use changes, etc., and used GWP (global warming potential) of [...] 23 for methane and 296 for nitrous oxide, to convert emissions of these gases to 100-year CO2 equivalents. The FAO report concluded that [...] "the livestock sector emerges {{as one of the}} top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global".|$|E

50|$|The village {{economy is}} driven by sales of {{agricultural}} products {{and the use of}} natural resources. Subsistence fishing is also common. Richer families often possess agricultural land, tools, and <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> to use in agriculture. They also sometimes transport resources such as timber and bamboo from nearby forests. Poorer families generally rely on selling labor for income because they lack the tools and <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> necessary to exploit agricultural land. Daily wages as of 2002 averaged approximately 2,500-3,000 riel. These families may also hunt or gather resources such as vines or resin from the forest. Poorer families often face food shortages.|$|R

50|$|Until the mid-20th century, {{the mule}} {{was a common}} sight on American farms.

The application of {{the internal combustion engine}} to farm machinery, starting in the early 1900s, led to the end of use for the mule. Unlike domesticated animals that are fertile, the mule cannot parent its own kind and could not transition from <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> to rural pet animal.

Tallow for candles used in churches and residences and leather used {{in a variety of}} ways (saddles, other tack, boots, furniture, machinery) were significant items in the larger colonial economy, finding markets well beyond Tehuantepec. Since the Marquesado operated as an integrated enterprise, <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> were used in other holdings for transport, agriculture, and mining in Oaxaca, Morelos, Toluca, and Mexico City as well as sold. Raised in Tehuantepec, the animals were driven to other Marquesado holdings for use and distribution.|$|R
