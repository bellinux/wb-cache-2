All valuations (<b>discounted</b> cash flow, <b>instrument</b> pricing, option pricing) {{and other}} {{financial}} calculations require {{an estimate of the}} evolution of the risk-free rates as implied by the term structure. This presumes that one has, if not complete knowledge, at least a very good estimate of the term structure, for the so-called zero-curves (spot and forward rate curves, discount factor curve, etc.). This paper is concerned with the methodology of deriving these zero-curves. It reviews the methodology and the limitations of standard BootStrapping and proposes a quite different approach based on Approximation Theory that has been implemented at EpiSolutions Inc...|$|R

Whether interest is adequate is determined {{with reference to}} the applicable federal rate (AFR). Under the Internal Revenue Code, original issue <b>discounts</b> on debt <b>instruments</b> are taxed each year, even though the debt may not be repaid until a later date.

5000|$|A main {{component}} of Rosse's nebular research was {{his attempt to}} resolve the nebular hypothesis, which posited that planets and stars were formed by gravity acting on gaseous nebulae. Rosse himself {{did not believe that}} nebulas were truly gaseous, arguing rather that they were made of such an amount of fine stars that most telescopes could not resolve them individually (that is, he considered nebulas to be stellar in nature). In 1845 Rosse and his technicians claimed to have resolved the Orion nebula into its individual stars using the Leviathan, a claim which had considerable cosmological and even philosophical implications, as at the time there was considerable debate over whether or not the universe was [...] "evolved" [...] (in a pre-Darwinian sense), a concept which the nebular hypothesis supported and with which Rosse disagreed strongly. Rosse's primary opponent in this was John Herschel, who used his own instruments to claim that the Orion nebula was a [...] "true" [...] nebula (i.e. gaseous, not stellar), and <b>discounted</b> Rosse's <b>instruments</b> as flawed (a criticism Rosse returned about Herschel's own). Eventually, neither man (nor telescope) could establish sufficiently scientific results to resolve the question (the convincing evidence for the gaseous nature of the nebula would be developed later from William Huggins's spectroscopic evidence, though it would not immediately resolve the philosophical issues).|$|R
40|$|Economic {{analyses}} of emission permit trading have mainly {{looked into the}} cost effectiveness and cost saving potential of international permit trading compared to a pure national trading system. Little attention has been drawn to the environmental effectiveness of international trade in greenhouse gas emission permits. Less environmental ambitiousness caused by relatively low emission reduction targets in some countries might lower the permit price on the international market, but might also reduce environmental effectiveness. This paper considers the question under what conditions domestic markets of emission permits would and should merge to become an international market when environmental integrity has to be preserved and how environmental and cost effectiveness could be combined. In a two-country model three different policy instruments of the importing country are examined, namely a price instrument (tariff) and two quantity <b>instruments</b> (<b>discount</b> and import quota). All instruments restrict trade. The importing country (and regulator) prefers an import tariff and an import quota to a carbon discount.

40|$|Under present {{economical}} {{environment of}} globalization, of {{the interdependence of}} the financial markets and instability of the capital flows, a central bank takes a great dare and responsibility in as-suming the final objective of the monetary policy, naming the price stability. The decision to use certain monetary policy instruments have {{to be based on}} their capacity to an efficient and adequate contribution to the correction of the monetary market and real economy development. Under these circumstances, although the frequent use of the open market operations seems justified, some central banks, from developed counties like Japan and USA, decided to maintain the discount rate as a mone-tary policy instrument. The present study disclose the comparative effect of the decision to currently use the official dis-count rate as a monetary policy instrument made by three important central banks (FED, ECB, The Bank of Japon).

40|$|This paper surveys concepts, {{practices}} and analytical literature to assess benefits and risks for monetary stability of cross-border currency and interest rate derivative operations in calm and turbulent periods, {{with a view}} of extracting implications for emerging economies. Monetary authorities must prevent one-sided positions in the currency, favor asset substitutability, and incorporate the enriched information set provided by derivative-based transactions into monetary policy design. In some circumstances, the use of derivatives by monetary authorities may help fulfill this role. By contrast, surcharges to compensate for a downward impact of derivatives on the cost of capital appear neither advisable nor necessary.
