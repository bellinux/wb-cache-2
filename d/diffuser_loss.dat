40|$|An {{assessment}} of a turbine system operating under highly pulsating flow environment typically found in vehicular turbochargers is made to: identify the key operating parameters, enable the formulation of a reduced order model, delineate the sources of loss and suggest strategies for performance improvement. The turbine system consists of a scroll-volute followed by a turbine wheel and then a diffuser. The assessment includes calculating unsteady three-dimensional flow in the turbine system followed by in-depth interrogation complemented with flow modeling. The key findings are (1) The flow mechanisms behind the turbine wheel performance, the <b>diffuser</b> <b>loss</b> and the wastegate port loss appear locally quasi-steady such that we can characterize {{the performance of the}} components based on a series of steady calculations subjected to varying inlet conditions reflecting the inlet flow pulsation; (2) the operation of scroll-volute and the diffuser pressure recovery can be adequately determined using a quasi-one-dimensional unsteady flow model; (3) A significant fraction of the loss that is not from skin frictions occurs downstream of turbine wheel exit (18 %pts out of 34 %pts in Peak Torque and 20 %pts out of 56 %pts in Turbo Initial Transient based on cycle loss debit); (4) The condition of maximum power extraction on unsteady pulsating environment can be approximated with a simple modeling of volute storage effect. A physically consistent definition of ideal power that elucidates the role of unsteadiness in an unsteady turbine system is derived; it informs one on what the extractable power is compared to what it could be for an ideal system.

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed for predicting design point specific speed-efficiency characteristics of centrifugal compressors. Compressor efficiency {{has been shown to}} be a function of specific speed. Specific speed is a characteristic that relates compressor inlet volume flow rate, rotation speed, and ideal enthalpy rise. Generally, high efficiencies are associated with high specific speeds, and low efficiencies are associated with low specific speeds. Compressor design point geometries that produce maximum attainable efficiency are also functions of specific speed. Knowing the variation in optimum design point geometric variables with specific speed permits rapid selection of high efficiency configurations. This {{computer program}} uses a one-dimensional mean streamline analysis conducted at fixed stagnation conditions. Seven specific losses are calculated for each set of compressor geometric variables and inlet velocity diagram characteristics studied. These are inlet guide vane, blade loading, skin friction, disk friction, recirculation, vaneless diffuser, and vaned <b>diffuser</b> <b>losses.</b> Each of these individual losses is expressed as a decrement in compressor total efficiency. The effect of these losses is then related to overall compressor performance and specific speed. By examining the program output, the user can select values of inducer hub-tip diameter ratio, inducer tip-exit diameter ratio, impeller blade exit backsweep, impeller exit blade height-diameter ratio, and impeller exit absolute flow angle that will result in maximum total efficiency for the chosen application. For given inlet stagnation conditions, the user can generate efficiency, pressure ratio, specific speed, and relative loss distribution data corresponding to various combinations of impeller inlet velocity diagram characteristics and impeller overall geometries. By examining the output data, a compressor geometry can be chosen which will yield maximum efficiency under the constraints imposed. The following categories are used as input information: (1) compressor geometry, (2) thermodynamic properties of the working fluid, (3) velocity diagram characteristics, and (4) iteration limits. The prewhirl used in this analysis is solid-body vortex. For iterations on inducer tip absolute critical velocity ratio, the inducer tip speed is adjusted to preserve inlet velocity triangle similarity with that determined by the first pair of input inducer tip speed and inducer tip absolute critical velocity ratio. That is, the absolute and relative flow angles are held constant for successive iterations. For each iteration, the following output information is tabulated: compressor geometry, velocity diagram characteristics, and compressor performance characteristics. The program can be used for working fluids other than air (which approximates ideal gas behavior) since the thermodynamic properties needed for the equations solved in the program are specified inputs. If a working fluid other than air is used in the analysis, an empirical equation expressing the dynamic viscosity as a function of temperature must be substituted.

40|$|One-dimensional models {{predict the}} {{performance}} of centrifugal compressor in short time, being a helpful design tool in the early design stages. They assume uniform flow through the compressor. Conservation of mass, momentum and energy and some empirical loss correlations are applied to estimate the real outputs. In this thesis, this one-dimensional approach is applied to model a turbocharger compressor. Two different models are implemented. They consist of an impeller, a vaneless diffuser and a volute. The model stage outputs, pressure ratio and efficiency, are compared with experimental data. Then, both models are further investigated by comparing their losses prediction with validated Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) data. The implemented models are taken from literature. They use the same vaneless diffuser and volute approach, but different impeller loss sets. The next impeller losses are studied: incidence, skin friction, choking, jet-wake mixing, blade loading, hub to shroud, tip clearance, shock and distortion <b>losses.</b> The vaneless <b>diffuser</b> outlet is calculated using a one-dimensional numerical solution to the underlying differential equations. For the volute, a set of empirical losses is used. The losses from the CFD are also measured by entropy rise calculations.

40|$|To {{address the}} {{shortcomings}} of the commonly used channel diffuser and cascade design perspectives, a streamtube perspective is adopted by carefully scheduling the streamtube area with {{special attention to the}} diffuser entry region. A design framework for radial diffusion systems is developed based on area scheduling the vaned diffuser. The vaned diffuser and volute designs are assessed numerically through RANS calculations and validated by full-scale compressor experiments. The investigations revel that it is mainly the diffuser area ratio and effective non-dimensional diffusion length that set diffuser performance. A careful balance between these two parameters is shown to enable high diffuser pressure recovery. The diffusion in the semi-vaneless-space, controlled chiefly by the vane suction side geometry, {{plays a key role in}} improving diffuser performance. Removing excess thickness from the suction side eliminates flow overspeed, increases effective diffusion length, and leads to higher pressure recovery at reduced stagnation pressure loss. The pressure side thickness distribution controls the channel area schedule. Thin leading edges ensure smooth flow area transition into the channel, and reduce the vane upstream influence and therefore pressure fluctuations as perceived by the impeller. A diffuser design based on the area schedule approach is tested experimentally. A 1. 8 fold improvement in diffuser performance parameter CP/Cp,t, where Cp and Cp,t are the diffuser static pressure recovery and the <b>diffuser</b> stagnation pressure <b>loss</b> coefficients respectively, is achieved. In addition, a 0. 8 % point increase in impeller isentropic efficiency due to reduced vane upstream influence and a 0. 74 % point increase in impeller-diffuser efficiency are demonstrated. The impact of the volute on diffuser and overall diffusion system performance is also assessed. High diffuser exit Mach numbers and a low volute inlet swirl parameter are shown to reduce volute performance. by Ruhou Gao. Thesis: S.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The increasing demand for improved performance in diesel and petrol engines - particularly in the motor-sport industry - has increased the need for performance enhancing devices such as the automotive turbocharger. The prediction of compressor performance in the early design stage of a turbocharger is critical and helps {{to ensure that the}} range and matching of the constituent components (impeller, diffuser and volute) is satisfactory. Although the fluid flow inside the compressor is three-dimensional, effective analysis can be carried out using one-dimensional prediction techniques. Many prediction techniques have been developed over the decades and improvements to these methods have primarily been due to a greater understanding of compressor operation. The major gain from establishing more accurate prediction techniques is the reduction of uncertainties in both design time and production costs as well as allowing existing designs of centrifugal compressors to be improved. This thesis presents the work carried out to develop a PC-based I -D prediction technique called CAPRICE, with focus aimed at developing new models for the vaneless diffuser and volute casing. Extensive analysis of the existing models has been undertaken relating geometric features to performance. A specially-constructed interstage test rig, designed to extract data from the components, enabled experimental data from two compressors to be gathered. The data collected was used to develop several new correlations; A new correlation for the prediction of impeller work was produced and shown to be an improvement on the Wiesner equation. Formulae for the prediction of impeller and diffuser surge were developed which enabled a more accurate prediction of surge to be made. and <b>diffuser</b> and volute <b>loss</b> and recovery coefficient correlations were produced, separating the diffusion system model in CAPRICE for the first time.

40|$|Fossil fuels are non-renewable {{resources}} {{which take}} {{millions of years}} to form, and whose reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being generated. Furthermore, fossil fuels utilization raises environmental concerns, particularly regarding the global climate change,while the increasing price trend indicates that the fossil-fuels-based energy is becoming a scarce commodity. Therefore, the current energy situation cannot be maintained indefinitely and future energy conversion systems have to be sustainable. One of the options for a more efficient and sustainable use of fossil fuels as energy sources is arguably distributed generation (DG). Among the various technologies which are currently proposed for DG, micro {{combined heat and power}} (microCHP), defined as the process of producing both electricity and usable thermal energy at high efficiency and near the point of use, could play a very relevant role, because it positively integrates technological as well as cultural and institutional components, related to the potential for reducing the ecological impact of electricity conversion. Micro gas turbines offer many potential advantages in comparison to other conversion technologies suitable for microCHP applications, such as compact size and high specific power; small number of moving parts; low vibrations and noise; low maintenance requirements, which lead to low maintenance costs; high fuel flexibility; possibly short delivery time and very low emissions; modularity; high-grade residual thermal energy. The main components of a CHP unit based on a micro turbine are the compressor, the turbine, the combustor, the recuperator, the generator, and the heat recovery unit. In the size range of micro gas turbines, radial-flow components are usually adopted for the turbomachinery, since they offer minimum surface and end-wall losses, and provide the highest efficiency. Centrifugal compressors also provide very high pressure ratio per stage, are less expensive to manufacture, and are similar in terms of design and volume flow rate to those adopted for automotive turbochargers, whose market is currently around two millions units per year, and is therefore characterized by relatively low production costs. The use of single-shaft radial turbomachinery for micro turbines allows thus for simple designs, with satisfiying aerothermodynamic and economic constraints, thanks to the evolution that automotive turbochargers have experienced in the past seventy years. Furthermore, the introduction of advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools and of innovative materials in recent years has led to a marked improvement in the current state-of-the-art technology of small turbochargers. However, according to some authors, the efficiency levels of centrifugal compressors have almost "stalled" after years of development, while further improvements by means of CFD methodologies would likely to be only incremental. Nevertheless, improvements in micro turbines performance through suitable modifications of turbocharger technology are to be expected, especially considering that turbochargers usually employ centrifugal compressors with vaneless diffusers in order to maximize the flow range and minimize production costs, wherelse gas turbines require higher efficiency and pressure ratio for a much narrower operating range. Moreover, further engineering challenges are related to the so-called small-scale effects. These are due to i) relatively high viscous losses because of low Reynolds numbers; ii) high relative tip clearance (i. e., the ratio of the tip clearance to the blade height at the impeller outlet) due to manufacturing tolerances; iii) high heat losses, because of large area-to-volume ratios; iv) relative large size-independent losses, such as those from bearings and auxiliaries, given the low power output. As a consequence, the main objectives of this work are 1. To develop novel methodologies which allow understanding the flow structure and loss mechanisms of very small centrifugal compressors, and identifying those aspects whose improvement can lead to higher micro compressor performance. 2. To analyze and quantify the influence of the tip clearance on the performance and flow properties of micro compressors, since the unshrouded impellers used in automotive turbochargers suffer from efficiency decrements, because of the pressure losses and secondary flows caused by very large clearance gaps. 3. To design and build a test-rig for the automatic acquisition of the performance maps of very small centrifugal compressors, and for testing either future, new configurations which aim to improve the performance of an exemplary micro turbine compressor, or other very small centrifugal compressors. 4. To develop an original optimization methodology for turbomachinery components, to be further utilized for the improvement of the performance of an exemplary micro turbine compressor, through the investigation of vaned diffusers, which are claimed to exhibit higher static pressure recovery and efficiency than vaneless diffusers, at the expenses of a narrower operating range. In this study, the recuperated micro gas turbine developed by the Dutch company Micro Turbine Technology B. V. (MTT) has been utilized as an illustrative example. The MTT micro turbine delivers electrical and thermal power output up to 3 and 14 kW, respectively, and will be primarily applied in microCHP units for domestic dwellings. The turbomachinery consists of a commercial off-the-shelf automotive turbocharger, made of a centrifugal compressor, a radial turbine, and oil-lubricated bearings. A cycle study of the MTT recuperated micro gas turbine has been carried out in order {{to assess the impact of}} the centrifugal compressor performance on the system performance. The analysis proved that increasing the performance of the centrifugal compressor adopted for the MTT micro turbine is pivotal in order to achieve higher performance levels of the microCHP system. The main conclusions of the work presented here are summarized as follows: 1. A fully automated optimization methodology has been developed by integrating an optimization algorithm, a geometry generator, a grid generator, a CFD solver, and a post processor. This methodology can be used for the optimization of turbomachinery components, but has been applied here to the design and optimization of vaned diffusers for the exemplarymicro compressor. The optimized vaned diffusers led to increased static pressure recovery, but the compressor efficiency was lower than that of the vaneless configuration, because of larger total pressure losses. 2. The test-rig, which has been designed and built for the automatic acquisition of the performancemaps of very small, high-speed centrifugal compressors, proved to be robust, reliable, and versatile. An experimental campaign has been carried out in order to quantify the aerodynamic performance of the exemplary compressor, and the test data, summarized in the form of performance maps and tables, have been used to validate the results of the numerical analyses shown in this dissertation. Furthermore, the test-rig will be a useful tool in the development of future, new designs which aim at improving the performance of the exemplary micro turbine compressor, and will be utilized to test other very small centrifugal compressors for a variety of different applications. 3. A new one-dimensional (1 D) method for the assessment of the performance (i. e., stage total-to-total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency; impeller inlet and outlet velocity triangles; impeller internal, external, and mixing losses; vaneless <b>diffuser</b> losses; volute <b>losses)</b> of very small centrifugal compressors has been developed on the basis of two very well-known design methodologies, namely the single- and two-zone model. This novel tool combines the advantages of the two, since it distinguishes between high- and low-momentum flows within the impeller bladed passages as possible with the two-zone model, and allows evaluating the impeller loss mechanisms, as possible with the single-zone model. This dissertation is structured as follows. Chapter 1 illustrates the concept, potential, and technology of microCHP within the framework of different energy scenarios. The motivation and scope of this work, and the outline of the dissertation are also given here. Chapter 2 presents the new 1 D method for the assessment of the performance and loss mechanisms of very small centrifugal compressors. The novel methodology has been applied here to the exemplary micro centrifugal compressor. The numerical results computed by this tool have been validated against the experimental results obtained with the test-rig. The comparison has been performed at 190 and 220 krpm, and varying mass flow rate, respectively, and shows a good agreement, since the model is able to capture the pressure ratio and efficiency trends. However, in proximity of the choking condition the difference between the numerical and test data is higher. Furthermore, at the micro turbine design point (i. e., mass flow rate equal to 50 g/s and rotational speed equal to 240 krpm), the model overpredicts the pressure ratio, but underpredicts the efficiency. At the micro turbine design point, it has been calculated that the skin friction losses contribute to the largest efficiency decrease, followed by the mixing losses, and the vaneless <b>diffuser</b> <b>losses.</b> Chapter 3 describes the experimental set-up which has been designed and built for the acquisition of the performance maps of very small, high-speed centrifugal compressors. The compressor impeller is driven by a turbine powered by pressurized air coming from a buffer tank, pressurized in turn by two screw compressors. The shaft speed is varied by a turbine control valve, while further equipment necessary to operate the test-rig was also integrated into the set-up, as well as the instrumentation and data|$|R
