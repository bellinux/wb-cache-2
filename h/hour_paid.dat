40|$|To {{what extent}} do workers work more hours than they are paid for? The {{relationship}} between hours worked and <b>hours</b> <b>paid,</b> and {{the conditions under which}} employers can demand more hours “off the clock,” is not well understood. The answer to this question impacts worker welfare, as well as wage and hour regulation. In addition, work off the clock has important implications for the measurement and cyclical movement of productivity and wages. In this paper, I construct a unique administrative dataset of <b>hours</b> <b>paid</b> by employers linked to a survey of workers on their reported hours worked to measure work off the clock. Using cross-sectional variation in local labor markets, I find only a small cyclical component to work off the clock. The results point to labor hoarding rather than efficiency wage theory, indicating work off the clock cannot explain the counter-cyclical movement of productivity. I find workers employed by small firms, and in industries with a high rate of wage and hour violations are associated with larger differences in hours worked than <b>hours</b> <b>paid.</b> These findings suggest the importance of tracking hours of work for enforcement of labor regulations. ...|$|R

40|$|Opponents {{of trade}} {{liberalization}} {{have sought to}} indict free trade and trade agreements by painting a grim picture of the economic state of American workers and households. They claim that real wages have been stagnant or declining as millions of higher-paying middle-class jobs are lost to imports. But the reality for a broad swath of American workers and households is far different and more benign. Contrary to public perceptions: Trade has had no discernible, {{negative effect on the}} number of jobs in the U. S. economy. Our economy today is at full employment, with 16. 5 million more people working than a decade ago. Trade accounts for only about 3 percent of dislocated workers. Technology and other domestic factors displace far more workers than does trade. Average real compensation per <b>hour</b> <b>paid</b> to American workers, which includes benefits as well as wages, has increased by 22 percent in the past decade. Median household income in the United States is 6 percent higher in real dollars than it was a decade ago at a comparable point in the previous business cycle. Middle-class households have been moving up the income ladder, not down. The net loss of 3. 3 million manufacturing jobs in the past decade has been overwhelmed by a net gain of 11. 6 million jobs in sectors where the average wage is higher than in manufacturing. Two-thirds of the net new jobs created since 1997 are in sectors where workers earn more than in manufacturing. The median net worth of U.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{methods to}} measure or attribute resource use and costing for economic evaluations in health care. The literature review found minimal evidence comparing top-down and bottom-up (micro) costing. To cost nursing inputs for patients, studies rarely measured staff time and poorly reported methods. In chronic haemodialysis (HD), 'case mix' variations in nursing between patients were ignored. The empirical work evaluated nurses' self-recording using barcode scanners and observer work sampling {{to measure the}} nursing time per patient. Initial piloting eliminated patient-level work sampling due to problems linking data to patients. Barcode scanning captured 80 % of nurses' hours; data quality was acceptable. It covered 4 weeks for 169 patients. Costs, in 2006, included employers' National Insurance and superannuation. Relative to the 'top-down' nursing expenditure per HD session (£ 44. 56 to £ 50. 79), the bottom-up cost was underestimated by up to 10 %: 4 % due to the unit cost using expected rather than actual working hours, and 6 % due to missing patient-level resource use data. Multiple linear regression clustered by patient found those ineligible for care at satellite units needed extra nursing input (mean 8 minutes, 95 % Cl 4 - 11, or £ 2. 30 to £ 7. 22 per session) compared with those eligible. Conclusions were that top-down (expenditure based) and bottom-up estimates of staff costs cannot reconcile due to averaging at different points, their attribution of resource use or costs to patients, and valuation of unit costs. More guidance is required on which unit cost of staff time (per <b>hour</b> <b>paid,</b> worked or patient-related) best reflects the opportunity cost of staff time. Barcode scanning successfully captured data, but required considerable research effort, making it impractical for most multicentre studies. Cost differences between patients were 5 - 14 % of the nursing cost per session or 1 - 5 % of the overall cost per session. Hence, they had minimal effect on results of economic evaluations...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was {{to examine}} Non Governmental Organizations' (NGOs) {{programmes}} for integration of refugees as a necessary supplement to the governmental programme. A relatively recent law made it compulsory for newly arrived refugees to attend classes in Norwegian language and Norwegian culture and society. This governmental programme also offers other courses and work experience over a 37. 5 <b>hour</b> <b>paid</b> week. In addition, several NGOs {{offer a variety of}} programmes. In Bergen, Norway, 35 refugees each year join a Red Cross programme called The Refugee Guide", as a part of this 37. 5 hour work-week. This programme offers refugees a new friend and a guide to the Norwegian society. The refugee guides are volunteers who are interested to get to know their new fellow citizens. This thesis focused on this Red Cross programme and the programme Ada" of another well known Norwegian NGO. Ada encompasses kindergartens where parents join their children, an international programme called Home-start which gives families who struggle a qualified volunteer to lean on, and a group for immigrant women. These two, and other NGOs, attempt to offer solutions to the problem of lack of contact between the majority and minority groups. Several qualitative methods were used to assess the programmes of these NGOs. Semi- structured interviews were used to interview employees of the NGOs and of the governmental programme. Focus groups were used to gather information from refugees using The Refugee Guide". In addition, two published studies with quantitative data were used as a supplement to the qualitative data. The results of this study showed that users of The Refugee Guide and Ada were satisfied with the programmes. Public servants also approved of these programmes and were pleased that these NGOs were covering areas they could not. They teached the language, helped with housing and prepare the refugees for working life. However, there was a great need of social contact, a larger network and friends and the NGOs were doing a good job bringing Norwegians, refugees and other immigrants together. This contact was important for the integration of refugees for three reasons: many refugees were lonely, and in need of new friends, thus having Norwegian friends could raise the refugees' self-esteem; refugees needed Norwegian friends to learn more about Norwegian customs and norms; and refugees needed Norwegian friends to practice the language. These areas were lacking in the public programme, and could not be provided by the public servants. In conclusion, The Refugee Guide" and Ada" provide a necessary supplement to the governmental programme. Indeed, the quality of some people's lives had improved by participating in these programmes. Public servants should receive more information about what these NGOs can offer to improve integration to help them provide a better service to the refugees they work for...|$|E
