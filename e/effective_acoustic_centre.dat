50|$|The woofer is {{the larger}} of the two, located below the tweeter. This is the most {{commonly}} used 2-way configuration. As can be seen the tweeter is much thinner and its <b>acoustic</b> <b>centre</b> is ahead of the woofer's <b>acoustic</b> <b>centre.</b> Due to this, at the crossover frequency since both drivers are producing the same frequency, the sound waves from the tweeter arrive at the listening position P earlier than those from the woofer. Due to this, at P there is non-ideal summing of the waves (they might reinforce or cancel out). Thus the main lobe points away from P towards a position P' (which for this particular speaker is lower than P).|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{cylindrical}} shells are {{fitted with}} an internal mechanism which is optimized so that, in the quasi-static regime, the combined system exhibits prescribed <b>effective</b> <b>acoustic</b> properties. The mechanism {{consists of a}} central mass supported by an axisymmetric distribution of elastic stiffeners.

Subsonic flexural waves excited in the shell by the attachment of stiffeners are suppressed by including a sufficiently large number of such stiffeners. Effectiveness of the proposed metamaterial is demonstrated by matching the properties of a thin aluminum shell with a polymer insert to those of water. The scattering cross section in water is nearly zero over {{a broad range of}} frequencies {{at the lower end of}} the spectrum. By arranging the tuned shells in an array the resulting acoustic metamaterial is capable of steering waves.

40|$|The {{polytropic}} hydrodynamic vortex {{describes an}} effective (2 + 1) -dimensional acoustic spacetime with an inner reflecting boundary at r=r_c. This physical system, like the spinning Kerr black hole, possesses an ergoregion of radius r_e and an inner non-pointlike curvature singularity of radius r_s. Interestingly, the fundamental ratio r_e/r_s which characterizes the effective geometry is determined solely by the dimensionless polytropic index N_p of the circulating fluid. It {{has recently been}} proved that, in the N_p= 0 case, the <b>effective</b> <b>acoustic</b> spacetime {{is characterized by a}}n infinite countable set of reflecting surface radii, {r_c(N_p;n) }^n=∞_n= 1, that can support static (marginally-stable) sound modes. In the present paper we use analytical techniques in order to explore the physical properties of the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex in the N_p> 0 regime. In particular, we prove that in this physical regime, the <b>effective</b> <b>acoustic</b> spacetime is characterized by a finite discrete set of reflecting surface radii, {r_c(N_p,m;n) }^n=N_max_n= 1, that can support the marginally-stable static sound modes (here m is the azimuthal harmonic index of the acoustic perturbation field). Interestingly, it is proved analytically that the dimensionless outermost supporting radius r^max_c/r_e, which marks the onset of superradiant instabilities in the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex, increases monotonically with increasing values of the integer harmonic index m and decreasing values of the dimensionless polytropic index N_p.

40|$|Acoustic {{impedance}} spectrometry {{using the}} three-microphone, three-calibration technique {{has recently been}} applied to the vocal tract during phonation (Hanna et al., 2016. JASA, 139, 2924 – 2936). The qualitative and quantitative similarity of the impedance spectrum of the vocal tract with a simple cylindrical duct prompts the question: How well do geometric parameters derived from the measured impedance correspond to the vocal tract morphology? The main {{aim of this study}} is to compare, in one male subject (age 34, height 184 cm), the <b>effective</b> <b>acoustic</b> length of the vocal tract derived from impedance spectrometry with the anatomical length measured from a separate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Three conditions were studied: 1) acoustic impedance measurements while the subject performed a neutral /ɜ/ vowel gesture with the lips sealed around the impedance measurement head, 2) MRI scan acquired while the subject performed the same gesture with a section of pipe between his lips of the same dimensions as the impedance head, and 3) MRI scan during closed- mouth nasal breathing. Even for the neutral vowel, the <b>effective</b> <b>acoustic</b> length is a (weak) function of frequency. Consequently, each of the acoustic tract resonances gives a slightly different effective length, with a range from 155 to 195 mm with glottis closed. Compared with the 1 : 3 : 5 : 7 ratios expected for cylindrical geometry, the higher resonances have slightly lower frequencies. This is perhaps because the cross-section in the region of the tract closer to the lips is on average greater than that of the region from the palate to glottis. However there is agreement between the length derived from the first acoustic resonance and the smoothed airway centroid length in the MRI of the mid-sagittal plane...|$|R
