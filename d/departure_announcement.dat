40|$|CEO departures {{without a}} named {{successor}} create a leadership vacuum {{giving rise to}} operational disruption and strategic uncertainty, {{as well as a}} potential turnaround benefit from the early exit of a poorly performing CEO. In contrast, CEO departures accompanied by a successor appointment indicate a planned, smooth leadership transition. This paper investigates how market reactions to CEO <b>departure</b> <b>announcements</b> without successor appointment reflect {{the costs and benefits of}} a leadership vacuum. After controlling for a positive self-selection effect capturing the turnaround benefits that may motivate board selection of a leadership vacuum, we find a significant mean difference between stock market reactions to CEO <b>departure</b> <b>announcements</b> with and without successor appointment, suggesting that a leadership vacuum causes incrementally significant switching costs relative to those caused by a smooth leadership transition. This finding implies that effective succession planning can prevent such costs by ensuring the availability of a qualified successor at CEO departure...|$|R

40|$|CEO {{succession}} {{decisions are}} an important part of boards of directors? responsibilities to shareholders. I study two aspects of these decisions. First, I examine whether or not forced CEO departure decisions are based on information that the board of directors has, but external investors do not. I find that the proxy for private information in the forced CEO departure decision is positively related to abnormal returns at the forced CEO <b>departure</b> <b>announcement.</b> This is consistent with the hypotheses that prior to the <b>departure</b> <b>announcement,</b> investors underestimate the probability of forced CEO departure, and that private information revealed in forced CEO departure announcements has positive implications for firm value. A second question related to boards of directors? CEO succession decisions concerns their decisions to participate in the external market for CEO talent. I find evidence suggesting that board decisions to participate in the external market for CEO talent are influenced by the costs and benefits of doing so. Specifically, cross sectional analyses of a proxy for industry homogeneity shows that this variable is positively related to external labor market participation, more standardized search processes, and a higher likelihood that a newly appointed CEO will survive three years or more. These findings are generally consistent with prediction that when industries are more homogenous, external search costs are lower, and higher quality matches may be obtained. I also test hypotheses related to benefits of matching to individuals with industry specific skills versus general management skills. I find that for several alternative proxies for industry specific skill demand, there is a negative relation between demand for industry specific skills and the decision to hire externally outside the industry. This can be interpreted as support for hypotheses that cross sectional variation in benefits associated with industry specific skills leads to fewer CEO appointments outside the industry, while benefits of general management skills are associated with a higher likelihood of inter-industry CEO appointment...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the share price}} reactions to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) departure announcements of firms listed on share markets in the United States. Most announcements include additional new information about the firm, which represents a contamination {{that needs to be}} accounted for. Share price reactions to CEO departures are moderate. Non-contaminated announcements have no significant (- 0. 40 %) market reactions. Investors show stronger reactions to new information related to the firm compared to new information related to the CEO. Announcements that include criticism of the departing CEO have average abnormal returns of + 3. 33 %. A temporary arrangement for the CEO position following the departure has negative average abnormal returns of - 3. 57 %. Statements that express that a CEO leaves for personal reasons are acknowledged with - 3. 90 % average abnormal returns. New information about firms that represents bad news causes average abnormal returns of - 7. 91 %. Earnings related information in announcements is appreciated with - 7. 76 % average abnormal returns. The 177 observations are divided into numerous subgroups to test 17 hypotheses related to the CEO, the firm, and circumstantial factors. The entire content of the announcements is examined for share price reaction in order to achieve a complete, reliable and meaningful interpretation of share price movements on the event day. The results support the main hypothesis that CEO departure announcements have neutral market reactions. Investors pay most attention to firm related information included in a CEO <b>departure</b> <b>announcement...</b>|$|E

He sate ever so long in the old window-seat looking into the Dean's garden: whence he and Emily had so often looked out together. He walked, with a sort of terror, into her little empty bedroom. It was swept out and prepared for new-comers. The glass which had reflected her fair face was shining ready for her successor. The curtains lay square folded on the little bed: he flung himself down and buried his head on the vacant pillow.|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSThere {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies investigating the problem of CEO departure and concomitant market reaction around the world. In some instances the market reaction is favourable; in others not. Throughout the various business cycles and economic conditions the quality of management is usually maintained by internal or external mechanisms of governance. A variety of factors, such as the board of directors, the shareholders, and the discipline of the debt markets, put constant pressure on the behaviour of management and the decisions they make (Puffer & Weintrop, 1991 : 38). In situations where {{the performance of the}} management has significantly deviated from the expectations of the market and the shareholders, the departure of the CEO has had a positive effect on the share price. In other instances the voluntary departure, or the unexpected death of a CEO, causes a negative price reaction. The purpose of the research is to assess the relationship between the departure of a company’s CEO and the share price reaction of the South African companies listed on the JSE (JSE Securities Exchange). In this study, {{in the form of an}} events study, the researcher calculated the cumulative average abnormal returns in an event window of - 7 to + 7 days. The population sample comprised 46 CEO <b>departure</b> <b>announcements</b> made by the media, over the past six years (2003 - 2008). The research aimed at establishing if there was any significant difference in the returns (stock reaction) before and after the announcement. The outcomes of event studies conducted regarding management changes are controversial. For example, Borstadt (1985) finds a negative market reaction to announcements made for managerial departures. Furtado and Rozeff (1987) find the opposite - a positive reaction when there is a new top managerial appointment. Weisbach (1988) finds a positive reaction to the news of the departure of the CEO (excluding those who retire), while Furtado (1986) finds that there is a negative effect on stock prices due to resignation announcements. All these findings can be related to the various hypotheses posited in this study. The findings of this study are as follows:  There is a statistically significant move in the cumulative abnormal returns on the day of the <b>announcement</b> of the <b>departure.</b>  There is a statistically significant move in the cumulative abnormal returns when there is a sudden departure of a CEO of a company.  There is a statistically significant negative abnormal return when there is an insider replacement. At the same time, the research showed that an outside replacement has no effect on the cumulative abnormal returns in a South African company.  There is a statistically significant difference in the cumulative abnormal returns when there is no immediate replacement of the ousted CEO in a South African company.  There is a statistically significant negative return in the event of the retirement of a CEO. Given the evidence, one can see that with the exception of the outsider replacement scenario, in all other cases there are statistically significant abnormal returns with CEO turnover in South African companies...|$|R
