50|$|It {{is a kind}} {{of dairy}} product which is {{condensed}} from <b>fresh</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>milk.</b> Compared with the <b>fresh</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>milk,</b> condensed milk can be stored for a longer time. In the process of isolation from the majority of water, a bottle of milk can be condensed into a quarter even up to 40% of the original one. Then, with the concentration of 40% cane sugar, a bottle of condensed comes into being. Through selling the condensed milk, Fengxing becomes a well-known brand among customers particularly the Cantonese. In 1990’s, owning to the expensive price of the fresh milk and the limited storage technology, condensed milk was regarded as a best choice. It reminds the daughter of the company founder of an interesting anecdote. At that time, it was popular for people to carry two bottles of Fengxing Milk to visit patients instead of a basket of flowers. When drinking it, the odor of milk was transmitted throughout the ward.|$|E

It describes past trends in dairy production, imports and consumption and examines the evidence on factors influencing dairy consumption patterns in West Africa. On this basis, it provides projected 1988 estimates of dairy consumption by product type and origin, by ecological zone and rural/urban category. It then compares these projections with actual figures for 1985 / 87 and draws policy implications for increased dairy consumption and domestic milk production in West Africa...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{method of}} {{estimating}} Al leaching from Al cook ware in some meat extracts and <b>liquid</b> <b>milk</b> was investigated. In the present work four kinds of Al cook wares from four countries were chosen from the local market. Extracts of boiled meat (lamb, chicken, and fish) were used to make 10 – 50 % (w/v) concentrations. In addition <b>liquid</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>milk</b> and long life milk were diluted to make 10 – 50 % (v/v) concentrations. Weight loss (WL) method, atomic absorption, polarization method, and surface study were applied. The “estimated” Al intake per person from WL in 30 % meat extract and milk range from 8. 16 to 12. 75 mg/h with fish extract having the highest leaching and chicken extract having the lowest leaching. Atomic absorption gave comparable results to that of WL. Comparing the present results with the Provisional Tolerance Weekly Intake of Al approved by the FDA/WHO shows that Al leaching from Al cook wares may add high doses of Al into the diet...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{solid-phase}} extraction–capillary electrophoresis (SPE–CE) {{method was}} developed for the determination of melamine residue in <b>liquid</b> <b>milk.</b> The conditions of SPE and CE were investigated and optimized. A 1 % trichloroacetic acid plus 2. 2 % lead acetate solution {{were used for the}} extraction of analyte and the removal of protein. A Cleanert PCX SPE cartridges column was used for clean up. The 50 mM sodium dihydrogenphosphate running buffer (pH adjusted to 3. 2 with citric acid) was used as a running buffer. The linearity is satisfactory in the range of 0. 8 – 100 µg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9998. Under the optimal conditions, the method limit of detection (LOD) and method limit of quantification were 0. 12 mg/kg and 0. 37 mg/kg, respectively. The recovery of melamine from different <b>liquid</b> <b>milk</b> samples was in the range of 89. 5 – 98. 5 % with a relative standard deviation of 1. 8 – 3. 5 %.

Looks into the smallholder milk processing techniques in the highlands of Ethiopia.

For butter making, milk is collected over a period of three or four days in a clay pot. When the milk has soured and sufficient milk has been collected, the pot is shaken back and forth until butter granules are formed. The buttermilk remaining after the butter is separated from the whole milk is used to produce a cottage type cheese by heating the buttermilk and separating the coagulated fat and protein from the whey.
