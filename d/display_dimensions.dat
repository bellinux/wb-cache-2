Participants' performance and coordination strategies were characterized using both Fitts' law and acquisition patterns of the 3 viewer-centered target <b>display</b> <b>dimensions</b> (azimuth, elevation, and range). Participants' movement trajectories were recorded and used to determine movement times for acquisitions of the entire target and of each of its <b>display</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The goodness of fit of the data to a modified Fitts function varied widely among participants, {{and the presence of}} droplines did not have observable impacts on the goodness of fit. However, droplines helped participants navigate via straighter paths and particularly benefited range dimension acquisition. A general preference for visually overlapping the target with the cursor prior to capturing the target was found.

Design of an {{effective}} auditory display depends upon understanding {{the requirements of the}} task as well as understanding limitations imposed by available display technology. However, {{an effective}} display also must consider limitations that are imposed by the human. The current chapter examines the use of spatial cues in an auditory display. First, normal perceptual limitations on spatial perception are discussed, with emphasis on some nonobvious ways in which perceptual limitations can affect the amount of information received by a human operator. An approach to overcoming such perceptual limitations is then introduced and its effectiveness examined. Although the focus of the chapter is on limitations in the perception of spatial auditory cues, the approach outlined here can be utilized in other <b>display</b> <b>dimensions...</b>|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to gauge the {{effectiveness}} of various image resizing methods when used on devices with small displays. Since {{the problem here is}} not only small size but also varying <b>display</b> <b>dimensions</b> the method chosen was seam carving, where the image is resized by removing horizontal and verticalseamsof connected pixels until the image fits. The aim of the method is to resize the image with minimal visual impact. The end results greatly depended on the image itself. Both with images where we needed to remove too many pixels and those with visually complex content were visibly altered, whereas images with a strong central focus and subdued backgrounds gave us better results). The method turned out to be useful for devices with displays of medium sizes, such as smart phones, whereas on older mobile phones with smaller displays the results were only practical for smaller images, both due to the number of pixels removed and because of the (lack of) speed of the device itself. ...|$|E
40|$|Large, high {{resolution}} displays do not only provide new possibilities for information visualization and exploration in several application fields but also challenge the user {{in new and}} uncommon ways. Due to <b>display</b> <b>dimensions</b> of several meters and enormous information density, the user is only able to perceive {{a subset of the}} visualized data at once. The mapping of conventional interaction techniques like WIMP and the use of classical input devices appears to be not sufficient in respect to usability and ergonomics.

The remarkable distances which come with direct manipulative interfaces on large displays enforce efficient and exact control mechanisms. Therefore, one topic of the seminar will be the analysis of miscellaneous input devices (tracking systems, PDA, Revolution-Controller…) for {{high resolution}} displays in respect to their advantages and disadvantages in combination with several interaction techniques, especially Zoomable User Interfaces.

A basic factor in effectively using shape for quantitative visualization is determining how many (and which) superellipse shapes people can distinguish. Since the superquadric shape's parameter set is not perceptually linear, we conducted a user study to which shapes people can generally distinguish.

30|$|Another {{challenging}} {{topic in}} the research of 3 D key-frame summarisation is the design of an efficient and intuitive visualisation interface that allows easy navigation and visualisation of the key-frame summaries.

In addition, the visualisation interface should be independent from the key-frame summarisation method, to allow the visualisation of different formats of 3 D key-frames video summaries, such as stereoscopic video or video-plus-depth and also 2 D video in the same framework. The interface should be capable of dealing with the most common key-frame visualisation methods such as, static storyboard, dynamic slideshow and hierarchically arranged viewing.

40|$|Visualizing {{information}} in user interfaces to complex, large-scale systems is difficult {{due to an}} enormous amount of dynamic data distributed across multiple displays. While graphical representation techniques can reduce some of the cognitive overhead associated with comprehension, current interfaces suffer from the over-use of such representation techniques and exceed the human’s perceptual capacity to efficiently interpret them. New <b>display</b> <b>dimensions</b> are required to support the user in information visualization. Three major issues which are problematic in complex system UI design are identified: representing the nature of change, supporting the cognitive integration of data across disparate displays, and conveying the nature of relationships between data and/ or events. Advances in technology have made animation a viable alternative to static representations. Motion holds promise as a perceptually rich and efficient display dimension but little is known about its attributes for information display. This paper proposes that motion may prove useful in visualizing complex information because of its preattentive and interpretative perceptual properties. A review of animation in current user interface and visualization design and research indicates that, while there is strong intuition about the “usefulness ” of motion to communicate, ther...|$|E

But, to our surprise, there is dearth of empirical researches in grocery visual merchandising.

It is at the store’s capacity to recognize the preferences of consumers’, to concede with their expectations for a grocery store. The paper reveals major visual display determinants with their relative impacts on consumers ’ shopping behavioral intentions, to help the stores in deciding which dimensions are significant and required to be looked into.

40|$|Visualizing {{information}} in user interfaces to complex, large-scale systems is difficult due to visual fragmentation {{caused by an}} enormous amount of inter-related data distributed across multiple views. New <b>display</b> <b>dimensions</b> are required to help the user perceptually integrate and filter such spatially distributed and heterogeneous information. Motion holds promise in this regard as a perceptually efficient display dimension. It has long been known to have a strong grouping effect which suggest that it has potential for filtering and brushing techniques. However, there is little known about which properties of motion are most effective. We review the prior literature relating to the use of motion for display and discuss the requirements for how motion can be usefully applied to these problems, especially for visualizations incorporating multiple groups of data objects. We compared three shapes of motions in pairwise combinations: linear, circular and expansion/contraction. Combinations of linear directions were also compared to evaluate how great angular separation needs to be to enforce perceptual distinction. Our results showed that shape differentiation is more effective than directional differences (except for 90). Of the three shapes studied, circular demands the most attention. Angular separation must be 90 to be equally effective. These results suggest that motion can be usefully applied to both filtering and brushing. They also provide the beginnings of a vocabulary of simple motions that can be applied to information visualization...|$|E

The fibers were prepared by alkalinization with 10 % sodium hydroxide (NaOH), oxidation with 3 - 6 % sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and hydrolysis with 20 % sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4), respectively. The alkalinization removes the fiber surface components such as lignin and wax so the pore {{on the surface}} clearly appeared. Addition of NaClO leads an oxidative fragmentation from remaining lignin and then the lignin dissolve out from the fiber. Furthermore, hydrolysis fibrilates fiber into MFC and annihillates the amorphous parts in MFC by keeping the crystalline parts.

40|$|Spatialized views use visuo-spatial metaphors to {{facilitate}} sense-making from complex non-spatial databases. Spatialization typically includes {{the projection of}} a high-dimensional (non-spatial) data space onto a lower dimensional display space for visual data exploration. In comparison to 2 D spatialized displays, 3 D displays could potentially convey more information, as they employ all three available spatial <b>display</b> <b>dimensions.</b> In this study, we evaluate if this advantage exists and whether it outweighs the added cognitive, perceptual, and technological costs of 3 D displays. In a controlled human-subjects experiment, we investigated how viewers identify document similarity in 3 D network spatializations that depict news articles as points connected by links. Our quantitative findings suggest that similarity ratings for 3 D network displays {{are similar to those}} obtained in a prior 2 D study we conducted. With both types of displays, viewers mostly judged document similarity on the basis of metric distances along network links, as opposed to node counts or distance across the network links. However, node counts do affect similarity assessments with 3 D displays more than with 2 D displays. We also find no significant differences in similarity judgments whether 3 D displays are presented monoscopically or stereoscopically. We conclude that any advantage of 3 D displays in conveying more information than 2 D displays does not necessarily outweigh their additional demands on cognitive, perceptual, and technological resources...|$|E
40|$|Today’s digital photos can be tagged with {{information}} about when and where they were taken. On stationary computers, this information {{is often used to}} drive photo browsing. This is not the case for mobile devices. We describe first results of our current research on a novel photo browsing technique called TiDi Browser. TiDi Browser exploits time and location information available in digital photos to facilitate the identification of personal events and the detection of patterns of specific occurrences in time and space. Along with a main view and thumbnail previews, our browser application provides two time lines. One time line visualizes the number of photos taken per temporal unit (e. g., day, week, etc.). This allows users to easily detect personal events in time. The second time line visualizes location information. Since two- or three-dimensional locations are difficult to represent on small displays, we reduce the location information to one-dimensional distance information. The distance is shown in the second time line. Both time lines serve a second purpose as graphical user interface, meaning that they can be used to browse in time. Even larger photo collections can be browsed on very small displays intuitively and efficiently. We implemented our ideas in an interactive prototype that uses a client-server-architecture. To save bandwidth, we transmit appropriately scaled photos that fit the <b>display</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the client (mobile device).

Two criteria are the number of <b>displayed</b> <b>dimensions</b> along which comparisons can be made and the number of dimensions that are viewable at once¿visual comparison depth and width.

Pivot tables and Polaris are examples of the former. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} introduce a new scalable interface that uses parallel dimension axis which supports the latter, greater visual comparison width.

Recently the visualization community has risen to the challenge of incorporating an indication of uncertainty into visual representations, and in this article we review their work.

This allows us to distinguish the visualization of uncertainty - which considers how we depict uncertainty specified with the data - and the uncertainty of visualization - which considers how much inaccuracy occurs as we process data through the pipeline. It has taken some time for uncertain visualization methods to be developed, and we explore why uncertainty visualization is hard - one explanation is that we typically need to find another <b>display</b> <b>dimension</b> and we may have used these up already! To organise the material we return to a typology developed by one of us in the early days of visualization, and make use of this to present a catalogue of visualization techniques describing the research that has been done to extend each method to handle uncertainty.
