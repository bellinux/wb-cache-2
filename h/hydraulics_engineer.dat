40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} concerns of <b>hydraulics</b> <b>engineers</b> is predicting erosion at the outer banks of rivers by studying the flow pattern along the bend. Not only are the streamlines in meanders non parallel curved lines, but they are also twisted. To study the streamlines flowing a sharp bend, a 180 º sharp bend was constructed at Persian Gulf University in Iran. Three dimensional flow components at different locations of the bend were measured using Vectrino velocim. In this paper, streamlines were drawn and investigated in different longitudinal profiles, cross sections, and plans. The results indicated that the secondary flow strength and size of the vortex formed at the distance of the beginning to the bend apex would increase. The core of central vortex moved away from the inner bank towards central line of the channel by 22 %, and to the water surface by 20 %. On the contrary, the size of the secondary vortex increased by 15 %. In addition, the average of the horizontal angle of the streamlines, vector and the locus of maximum velocity were determined at different levels in the present investigation...|$|R

40|$|Each {{river in}} the world is unique. Some are gently curved, others are meander, and some others are {{relatively}} straight and skewed. The size of river geometry also changes from section to section longitudinally due to different hydraulic and surface conditions called non-prismatic channel. Much of the research work are found to be done on prismatic compound channels. There has also been a progress of work found for meandering channels. But an era which has been neglected is that of the work for non-prismatic compound channels. An effort has been made to scrutinize the research work related to non-prismatic channels in different types of flow conditions. An experimental observation has been made to investigate the velocity distribution, boundary shear stress distribution and energy loss of a compound channel with converging flood plain. The calculation of Depth average velocity, energy loss, boundary shear stress in non-prismatic compound channel flow is more complex. The prediction of the flow characteristics in compound channels with prismatic and non-prismatic floodplains is a challenging task for <b>hydraulics</b> <b>engineers</b> due to the three dimensional nature of the flow. Simple conventional approaches cannot predict the above mentioned flow characteristics with sufficient accuracy, hence in this area an easily implementable technique the Artificial Neural Network can be used for prediction, validation and analysis of the flow parameters mentioned. The model performed quite satisfactory when compared with the other conventional methods...|$|R
