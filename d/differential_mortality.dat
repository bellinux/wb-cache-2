This effect may be caused by emigration and higher male mortality as result of higher Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states.

40|$|Estimates of <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> by {{socioeconomic}} status {{play an important}} role in several domains: in public policy for assessing distributional effects of public programs; in financial markets for the design of life insurance and annuities; and in individual decision making when figuring out how much to save for retirement. Traditionally, reliable estimates of <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> require rich panel data with large sample size. This paper proposes a new, less data-intensive approach relying on just a single cross-section of data. Rather than using observations on actual mortality in panel over time, the authors propose relating individuals' subjective probabilities of survival to variables of {{socioeconomic status}} in cross-section. They formulate the method in a model of survey response and provide an empirical validation based on data from the Health and Retirement Study comparing the alternative estimates to the traditional estimates of <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> for the same sample of baseline respondents. They present two applications. First, they document an increase in <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> in the U.

40|$|In a {{good deal}} of studies {{cholesterol}} distribution, as a risk factor, demonstrates a special treatment towards age so that it shows an upward trend up to an age group and exhibits a downward trend for older age brackets thereafter. To investigate this phenomenon, two general points of view are presented. First, this issue may occur naturally for many subjects and it may be due to natural treatment of cholesterol variable with age. Second, it could be related to <b>differential</b> <b>mortality,</b> i. e. mortality changes in different age groups. In other words, {{it can be said that}} higher levels of cholesterol are relevant to younger-age mortality rate. Constructing a parametric model based on Weibull distribution, the association of this phenomenon with <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> was investigated. This study revealed that the effect of <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> on cholesterol distribution in the age groups younger than 65 were insignificant and it could partly be justifiable just in older age groups because it involves 35 % changes in the 85 - 95 age groups.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} belief that people with low lifetime labor income have higher age specific mortality and lower remaining life expectancies at age 60 or 65 than those with middle or high lifetime earnings. In this paper, we assess the implications of <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> by lifetime income for Social Security progressivity. Social Security has a highly progressive formula to determine monthly benefits in that those with low lifetime earnings get a much higher replacement rate than those with high lifetime earnings. However, recent studies on the mortality gap by lifetime income suggest {{that at least some}} of this progressivity is counterbalanced by the longer average lifetimes experienced by higher lifetime income recipients of Social Security. To reassess the progressivity of Social Security, we calculate internal rates of return and net present values for the program under assumptions of <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> and compare these measures of progressivity to the same measures calculated assuming all individuals experience average population mortality rates. Under the assumption of constant mortality across lifetime income subgroups, the Social Security system is progressive regardless of the measure shown.

Recognizing the interdependence of the various dimensions of the 'ecological complex', it is maintained that spatial variations in cardiovascular mortality by sex and the sex <b>differentials</b> in cardiovascular <b>mortality</b> are the consequences of environmental, sustenance organization, health technology, and demographic factors. The test of the model is based on U. S. county level cardiovascular mortality data for ages 25 - 65 for the period 1970 - 1980. The most distinctive feature of the results is that environment has the greatest impact on sex <b>differentials</b> in cardiovascular <b>mortality</b> followed by sustenance organization. In this regard, socioeconomic status is shown to be the single most important variable in explaining cardiovascular mortality rates for both sexes in most community types. The effect of health technology is not significant, and increased availability of health manpower and facilities are often found in conjunction with higher rates of cardiovascular mortality for both sexes. The results of this study confirm the importance of programs directed toward altering the basic environment and sustenance organization structures of communities rather than other ecological components such as health technology. cardiovascular geographic sex <b>differentials</b> <b>mortality...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of Israel sex differentials in the life expectancy at birth exhibited by Israeli Jews have been very low in comparison to other countries.

It also explores {{the similarities and differences}} between Israeli Jews and other Jewish populations in relation to sex <b>differentials</b> in <b>mortality,</b> relying on the published sources. This investigation reveals that small sex <b>differentials</b> in <b>mortality</b> of Israeli Jews, measured as a difference between female and male life expectancy at birth, are due to a stable pattern of low male and somewhat elevated female mortality at old ages, mainly 60 / 65 years and over. The differences between mortality schedules of younger males and females (25 - 64 years) are also relatively small. Selected features of Israeli Jewish sex <b>differentials</b> in <b>mortality</b> (but not all features) resemble those found in Jewish Diaspora communities. Detailed examination of levels and trends in age-specific male and female mortality in different subgroups of Israeli and Diaspora Jews provides the basis for two hypotheses regarding the origins of small sex differentials among Israeli Jews.

The results {{refer to the}} year 2001 because the census is the only source providing data about population by level of education; as to deaths the data are provided by death certificates. As often happens, in order to compute <b>differential</b> <b>mortality</b> using these period frequencies {{it was necessary to}} confront problems both in the use of unlinked records and in relation to limitations in statistical documents; that is why we classified the population in only two groups: one with a low level of education and the other with a high level. We used a logit relational method to build life tables according to the levels of education. Particular attention was given to expectation of life at the ages from 35 to 65. At 35 years of age the expectation of life for a person with a low level of education is about 7. 5 years less than for a person of a higher level in case of a male, and 6. 5 years less in case of a female. The tendency continues, and at the age of 65 the expectation for those with a lower level is one quarter less in case of males and one fifth less in case of females.

One of the main implications of the life-cycle model is that assets are decumulated in {{the last part of}} life. Most empirical studies of asset accumulation use cross-sectional data to estimate mean or median wealth-age profiles, but the use of cross sections to estimate the age profile of assets is full of pitfalls. If, for example, wealth and mortality are related, in that poorer individuals die at a younger age, one overestimates {{the last part of the}} wealth-age profile when using cross-sectional data because means (or other measures of location) are taken over a population which becomes "richer" as it ages.

There {{is a strong}} social gradient in SRH. An investigation was carried to determine whether SRH can explain the well-known socioeconomic gradient in mortality. METHODS: The effect of adjusting for SRH on the socioeconomic <b>differential</b> in <b>mortality</b> was examined in a prospective study of 20 754 men and women aged 39 - 79 years, without prevalent disease, living in the general community in Norfolk, UK, recruited using general practice age-sex registers for 1993 - 1997 and followed up {{for an average of}} 10 years. RESULTS: Mortality risk increased with decreasing social class in men and women. There was some attenuation after adjustment for covariates age, body mass index, smoking, history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, alcohol consumption, physical activity and educational level, but a gradient remained.
