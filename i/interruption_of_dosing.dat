40|$|Withdrawal of PER {{treatment}} {{was not associated}} with an increase in the frequency or severity of diverse behavioral symptoms at 8 days following drug discontinuation – The large majority of patients in DB and OLE studies rated each withdrawal symptom as “none, ” suggesting an overall lack of withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> PER <b>dosing</b> – Whether withdrawal symptoms would be reported prior to 8 days remains to be determined ● Because PER has a long half-life, blood levels are expected to fall slowly following cessation of treatment. This would tend to reduce and delay withdrawal symptoms compared to what would occur with a drug with a shorter half-life. The results of this study do not {{rule out the possibility that}} discontinuation of other AMPA receptor antagonists could result in withdrawal symptoms.

40|$|Background: Remission rates {{achieved}} {{after the}} initial treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be similar in both developed and developing countries, but relapse rates are much higher in the latter. Thus, other reasons are needed, in addition to biological characteristics of the leukemic cells themselves, to explain the unfavorable evolution of patients living in unfavorable socioeconomic and cultural conditions. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to retrospectively evaluate compliance to an acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment protocol. Methods: Main abstracted data were: total duration and reasons for <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> chemotherapy, prescribed <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 6 -mercaptopurine, and median white blood cell and neutrophil counts during the maintenance phase. <b>Interruptions</b> <b>of</b> chemotherapy were considered inappropriate if they did not follow predetermined criteria established in the protocol. Results: Fourteen of 73 patients (19. 2 %) unduly interrupted chemotherapy by determination of their physicians. The median white blood cell count was higher when compared with the protocol recommendations; the median 6 -MP dose was lower than the standard recommended dose. The estimated probability of event-free survival was higher for patients with lower median leukocyte counts and close to those predetermined by the protocol. Event-free survival was also higher fo...|$|R
40|$|Background: This Phase Ib dose-escalating study {{investigated}} safety, {{maximum tolerated dose}} (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical antitumour activity of tosedostat (CHR- 2797), an orally bioavailable aminopeptidase inhibitor, in combination with paclitaxel. Methods: A total of 22 patients received paclitaxel (135 - 175 mg m 2) intravenously, administered once every three weeks {{for up to six}} cycles, with oral tosedostat (90 - 240 mg) daily. Results: One DLT (grade 3 dyspnoea) was observed in one patient with tosedostat 180 mg combined with paclitaxel 175 mg m 2. A high number of paclitaxel infusion reactions was noted during the second administration (59 %) and this prompted <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> tosedostat <b>dosing</b> for 5 days around every second and subsequent paclitaxel infusion. No formal MTD was determined because of the high frequency of paclitaxel infusion reactions that may have been influenced by tosedostat. Most frequently observed drug-related adverse events were alopecia, fatigue (95 % each), peripheral sensory neuropathy (59 %), paclitaxel hypersensitivity (59 %) and rash (55 %). One patient died because of eosinophilic myocarditis, possibly related to study medication. There was no PK interaction between tosedostat and paclitaxel. In all, 3 patients had a partial response and 12 patients had stable disease lasting 3 months. Conclusion: The combination of tosedostat with paclitaxel was well tolerated except for the high incidence of paclitaxel-related infusion reactions. © 2010 Cancer Research UK...|$|R

40|$|Nanoparticle albumin-bound {{paclitaxel}} (nab-paclitaxel) {{is a novel}} {{formulation of}} paclitaxel that does not require solvents such as polyoxyethylated castor oil and ethanol. Use of these solvents {{has been associated with}} toxic response, including hypersensitivity reactions and prolonged sensory neuropathy, as well as a negative impact in relation to the therapeutic index of paclitaxel. nab-paclitaxel displays greater antitumor activity and less toxicity than solvent-base paclitaxel. In a phase I trial of single nab-paclitaxel, the maximum tolerated dose was 300 mg/m 2 with the dose limiting toxicities being sensory neuropathy, stomatitis, and superficial keratopathy. In the metastatic setting, a pivotal comparative randomized phase III study demonstrated that nab-paclitaxel (at 260 mg/m 2 over 30 minutes infusion without premedication every 3 weeks) mediated a superior objective response rate and prolonged time to progression compared with solvent-based paclitaxel (at 175 mg/m 2 over a 3 -hour injection with standard premedication). The nab-paclitaxel-treated group showed a higher incidence of sensory neuropathy than the solvent-based paclitaxel group. However, these adverse side effects rapidly resolved after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> treatment and <b>dose</b> reduction. Weekly administration of nabpaclitaxel was also more active and displayed less toxicity compared with 100 mg/m 2 docetaxel given triweekly. Nab-paclitaxel has already been approved in 42 countries for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracycline, based on confirmation of the efficacy and manageable toxicity in the metastatic setting. This review summarizes the most relevant knowledge on nab-paclitaxel for treating breast cancer in terms of clinical usefulness including efficacy and safety of this new agent...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} short- and long-term effects <b>of</b> <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the enterohepatic circulation (EHC) on hepatic cholesterol metabolism and biliary secretion in rats. For this purpose, we employed {{a technique that}} allows reversible <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC, during normal feeding conditions, and excludes effects of anaesthesia and surgical trauma. [3 H]Cholesteryl oleate-labelled human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was injected intravenously in rats with (1) chronically (8 days) interrupted EHC, (2) interrupted EHC {{at the time of}} LDL injection and (3) intact EHC. During the first 3 h after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC, bile flow decreased to 50 % and biliary bile acid, phospholipid and cholesterol secretion to 5 %, 11 % and 19 % of their initial values respectively. After 8 days of bile diversion, biliary cholesterol output and bile flow were at that same level, but bile acid output was increased 2 - 3 -fold and phospholipid output was about 2 times lower. The total amount of cholesterol in the liver decreased after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC, which was mainly due to a decrease in the amount of cholesteryl ester. Plasma disappearance of LDL was not affected by <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC. Biliary secretion of LDL-derived radioactivity occurred 2 - 4 times faster in chronically interrupted rats as compared with the excretion immediately after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC.
