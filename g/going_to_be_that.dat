General Etienne Eyadema, the president of neighboring Togo, thought that this [...] "serve right, for being stupid enough to give power back to the politicians. Don't think I'm ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> dumb." [...] Alley was discharged from the armed forces altogether in September, with Kouandété taking his place as Chief of Staff.|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{guest star}} Mike O'Malley {{appears in the}} episode as Kurt's father Burt, sharing a scene with Colfer and Monteith which Colfer has {{described}} as the most emotional scene of the series thus far, explaining: [...] "Reading it on paper I {{had no idea it}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> intense. Once I got into it, then I kind of realised, 'Oh, there's such a bigger meaning behind this. Oh my God, this is so dramatic'." [...] Colfer called [...] "Theatricality" [...] his favorite episode of the whole series. Other recurring characters who appear in [...] "Theatricality" [...] are glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton, who gets his first lines in this episode), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), school athletes and bullies Karofsky and Azimio, Principal Figgins, Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran and Finn's mother Carole Hudson.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> fat and go on the air talking about [...] ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E
50|$|The reason I {{slapped the}} word on the book {{proposal}} I sold three years ago without any clear idea {{of what kind of}} book it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I wanted <b>to</b> write a book that would free me in some way. And I will say this about the abstract concept of 'freedom'; it's possible you are freer if you accept what you are and just get on with being the person you are, than if you maintain this kind of uncommitted I'm free-to-be-this, free-to-be-that, faux freedom.|$|R

2500|$|In October 2011, Kian Egan {{ruled out}} {{speculation}} that Brian McFadden would reunite {{with them for}} a television show. Egan said: [...] "All the rumours about Brian re-joining Westlife are untrue. We have been a 4 piece for too long now. We love Brian but it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>That</b> includes any TV performances." [...] With a new compilation album coming out, it was speculated Westlife would be doing a new greatest hits tour. They were scheduled to headline the ChildLine Concert in Dublin on 12 November 2011 and to have another exclusive concert on O2 Blueroom, also in Dublin on 24 November.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the line's {{construction}} {{there was}} no direct line west of Denver, with rail traffic having to detour south to Pueblo or north to Cheyenne. The Denver business community wanted an [...] "Air Line" [...] west of the city, and the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Air Line", originating in Denver, and was planned to terminate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Although the line was never completed as a separate route to Salt Lake City, the finished portion was eventually connected with the D's main near Dotsero and used to shorten their route between Salt Lake City and Denver. The line initially featured an arduous grade over Rollins Pass, until the pass was bypassed by the Moffat Tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with NOLA.com in November 2013, Roy Mitchell-Cárdenas said, [...] "We {{have a lot of}} songs, and we're trying to whittle down what those main songs are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> seem to have a common thread between them all to make for this album." [...] He goes on to explain that the production of Odd Soul was a unique process since Todd Gummerman was not yet a part of the band and that all guitar parts were written by all members of the band, who are all multi-instrumentalists. [...] It is worth noting that the band has not yet released material written by Todd Gummerman, and the band has not discussed any writing processes including him, although certain posts in Darren King's Vine account show Todd present and active during the writing process.|$|E

The hour also revealed the answers to a few of the season's long-simmering unsolved mysteries—including how Elsa ended up trapped within the anti-magic urn. Could this indicate the end of the Arendelle fairybacks, considering that backstory seems to be fairly complete at this point? If it does, will you miss them—or are you looking forward to the show not spending quite so much time on the Frozen crew?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Development of Rock Band 4 {{began in}} the last quarter of 2014. This {{followed}} from several factors. Harmonix's former CEO and current creative director Alex Rigopulos explained that the studio had awaited both a [...] "critical mass" [...] of adoption for the next-generation consoles, and a [...] "clear and compelling creative vision" [...] for the game before beginning work on a successor—prompting the franchise's hiatus. Rigopulos said that internally if they were going to bring back Rock Band band, they wanted to [...] "really make the best game that we had ever made; that we had a vision for what Rock Band 4 was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>that</b> made it worth making, really". A clear vision of the goals for the game came about more than a year prior to the game's release. Harmonix's Greg LoPiccolo added that they did not want to try to introduce Rock Band 4 during the new consoles' first year where they would have to compete with major franchises. Funding for development was aided by $15 million in investments from Spark Capital and Foundry Group, not only to support Rock Band 4 but the remake of Harmonix' Amplitude and future projects involving virtual reality.|$|E
2500|$|I Love You, Man is {{the third}} {{collaboration}} between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, following the Judd Apatow projects Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, while writer/director John Hamburg previously worked with Segel on Apatow's Undeclared television series. [...] It only took one lunch to get Segel and Rudd {{to sign on to}} do the film and this set the stage for other actors to sign on. [...] On February 13, 2008 it was announced that Rashida Jones would be in the female lead opposite Rudd. [...] Later, in an interview with firstshowing.net, Jones revealed that because Segel and Rudd were already attached to the project she [...] "knew immediately that it was gonna be even funnier than I would think." [...] At the beginning of the March 31, 2008 week, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Jaime Pressly had joined the film's cast, playing the best friend of Rashida Jones' character. [...] Hamburg comically stated that he was lucky in casting J.K. Simmons because his contract states [...] "he has to be in {{one out of every four}} movies made." [...] Jon Favreau started working on the film the same week Iron Man came out, a film which he directed. He said he [...] "probably wouldn't have agreed to have done it had I known my life was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> shape", but Iron Man star Robert Downey, Jr. told him that [...] "It is the best thing you could do" [...] he said 'chop wood, carry water,' which is what they do in the Kung Fu movies to keep you humble." ...|$|E
