40|$|We study filling {{phenomena}} in 3 D wedge geometries paying {{particular attention to}} the role played by a line tension associated with the wedge bottom. Our study is based on transfer matrix analysis of an effective one dimensional model of 3 D filling which accounts for the breather-mode excitations of the interfacial height. The transition may be first-order or continuous (critical) depending on the strength of the line tension associated with the wedge bottom. Exact results are reported for the interfacial properties near filling with both short-ranged (contact) forces and also van der Waals interactions. For sufficiently short-ranged forces we show the lines of critical and first-order filling meet at a tricritical point. This contrasts with the case of dispersion forces for which the lines meet at a critical end-point. Our transfer matrix analysis is compared with generalized random-walk arguments based on a necklace model and is shown to be a thermodynamically consistent description of fluctuation effects at <b>filling.</b> <b>Connections</b> with the predictions of conformal invariance for droplet shapes in wedges is also made.

40|$|Washing {{machine and}} {{dishwasher}} appliance use accounts for approximately 10 % of electricity demand in EU households. The majority of this demand {{is due to}} the operation of electric heating elements inside appliances. This paper investigates the potential benefits that can be realised by adding a hot <b>fill</b> <b>connection</b> to washing appliances, with respect to carbon emissions, demand side management and renewable energy integration. Initial laboratory testing of new hot and cold fill appliances has resulted in modifications to optimise hot fill intake, and a novel numerical model presents a method of characterising appliance electricity use in different configurations. In order to validate model findings and test the use of new hot fill appliances in situ, a pilot study has recorded appliances’ resource consumption at one-minute resolution in fourteen households. The addition of hot fill reduced the total dishwasher and washing machine electricity consumption by 38 % and 67 % respectively. Depending on how hot water is supplied to appliances it is estimated that hot fill use results in an annual household carbon saving of up to 147 kgCO 2. Further to direct electricity reduction, hot fill appliances can offer a method of time shifting demand away from peak periods without inconveniencing occupants’ lifestyles...|$|R

An optimized Step die with a different runner and gating systems is proposed to minimize the amount of casting defects. Numerical simulations have been performed to study the filling and solidification behavior of an AM 60 B alloy to predict the turbulence of the melt and the microshrinkage formation. The results reveal how a correct design of the trap in the runners prevents the backwave of molten metal, which could eventually reverse out and enter the die cavity. The tapered runner in the optimized die configuration gently leads the molten metal to the ingate, avoiding turbulence and producing a balanced die cavity <b>filling.</b> The <b>connection</b> between the runner system and the die cavity by means of a fan ingate produces a laminar filling in contrast with a finger-type ingate.

To solve the problem of thin coal seam mining under villages, a new thin seam backfill mining technology was proposed. This paper investigated a reasonable proportion of filling materials by experiments, designed the filling system and introduced key technologies for thin seam working face filling. Finally, an industrial test of thin seam backfill mining technology was carried out in the C 1661 working face, Beixu Coal Mine. The results show that the developed filling material meets both the pumping liquidity and strength requirements of the filling body during the early and late stages.

40|$|International audienceBoth CO 2 {{storage and}} {{disposal}} of waste fluid (e. g., co-produced brine) in deep saline aquifers of sedimentary basins create large scale over-pressurization and tend to displace brine upwards if a vertical connection (e. g., an abandoned well) is present. This raises groundwater pollution issues of brine intrusion into shallower potable water aquifers. When saline brine from the deep aquifer is displaced upwards it lifts and replaces the a priori less saline, less dense water initially <b>filling</b> the <b>connection,</b> resulting in a weight increase that counters leakage. This article presents and explains an innovative semi-analytical {{solution to this problem}} of leakage between two aquifers connected by a passive well (represented by a porous column and/or an open wellbore) taking account of the effect of the density difference between lifting and lifted brines during both upward and downward flow. It is based on the linearization of brine density profiles against depth and on two improvements made to the approximate evaluation of convolution products introduced in Nordbotten et al. (2004) for calculation of the pressurization induced by transient flows in open aquifers. The comparison with numerical simulations shows good agreement of results. Since the solution uses time discretization but no spatial grid, computation time is reduced by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude compared to numerical resolution. It does, however, require considering homogeneous aquifers of constant thickness and brine properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{analytical model}} of meridional overturning in a basin with a southern-hemisphere circumpolar connection is presented. The overturning circulation {{can be understood}} as a “pump and valve ” system, in which the wind forcing at the latitudes of the circumpolar connection plays the role of the pump, and the surface thermodynamic exchange north of the connection plays the role of the valve. When the surface fluxes support deep-water formation, the valve is on, and the overturning circulation extends to the extreme northern latitudes of the basin. When the surface fluxes do not support deep-water formation, the valve is off; in that case, the basin north of the circumpolar <b>connection</b> <b>fills</b> to the sill depth with warm fluid, and the overturning circulation still exists, but is short-circuited and confined near the circumpolar connection. An intriguing implication of the model is that northern hemisphere wind and surface buoyancy forcing may influence the strength and structure of the circumpolar current in the southern hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|Runoff generation, which {{involves}} the gradual depression <b>filling</b> and <b>connection</b> of overflowing depressions, {{is affected by}} surface roughness and slope. Therefore, quantifying and understanding the effects of surface roughness and slope on overland flow connectivity at the sub-grid scale can potentially improve current hydrological modeling and runoff prediction. However, little work has been conducted on quantifying these effects. This study examines the role of surface roughness on overland flow connectivity at the plot scale at different slopes. For this purpose, standard multi-Gaussian synthetic fields (6 × 6 m) with contrasting surface roughnesses, {{as defined by the}} parameters of the variogram (sill and range) of surface elevation, were used. In order to quantify the effects of soil roughness and slope on overland flow connectivity a functional connectivity indicator, so-called the Relative Surface Connection function (Antoine et al., 2009), was applied. This indicator, that represents the ratio of area connected to the outflow boundary (C) in function of the depression storage (DS), is able to capture runoff-relevant connectivity properties. Three parameters characterizing the connectivity function were used to quantify the effects of roughness and slope. These parameters are: C at DS = 0 (CDS= 0), connectivity threshold (CT) and maximum depression storage (MDS). Results showed that variations on soil roughness and slope greatly affect the three parameters showing in some cases a clear relationship between structural connectivity and functional connectivity, such as between the ratio sill/range and MDS and between CDS= 0 and range. This relationship, described by mathematical expressions, not only allows the quantification and comparison of the effects of soil roughness and slope in overland flow connectivity but also the prediction of these effects by the study of the variogram...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To test {{short-term}} and long-term elastomeric infusion pumps for applicability in hospital practice and for ambulant patients at home. DESIGN AND METHODS: Four short-term elastomeric infusion pumps (Accufuser C 1000 M, Easypump ST 100 - 1, Infusor Intermate SV- 100, Surefuser Plus 100 ml) and four long-term pumps (Accufuser C 0100 L, Easypump LT 270 - 24, Infusor Folfusor LV- 10, Surefuser Plus 18102 - 01) {{were included in}} the study. Each was exploratively tested for accuracy and uniformity of the flow rate and sensitivity to external factors (temperature, fluid viscosity, height difference between pump and patient <b>connection,</b> <b>filling</b> degree), residual volume, evaporation upon storage, warming-up time and sterility. RESULTS: Flow rate of short-term pumps was less constant than of long-term pumps and displayed more deviations. For most pumps tested, the flow rate decreased in time. Flow rate increased at temperatures higher than the calibration temperature and decreased at lower temperatures. Higher fluid viscosity reduced flow rate. Differences in height between pump and patient connection up to 10 cm slightly influenced flow rate. Filling degree less than the nominal value reduced flow rate. Evaporation upon storage in the refrigerator was limited. Warming up from refrigerator to room temperature maximally required six hours. Sterility was maintained upon four weeks storage at 35 °C. CONCLUSION: Flow rate of elastomeric infusion pumps was not constant and was significantly influenced by external factors. There was little difference in outcome between the pumps tested. Other factors (beyond the scope of this study), such as ease to prepare, patient-friendliness and price are also important determinants for making a choice. Principally because of the limited accuracy of the flow rate, we consider elastomeric infusion pumps less suitable for administration of cytostatic agents and pain treatment than for antibiotics...|$|R

This yields, for planar and spherical geometries, a quasi-electron representation of the incompressible FLL state of filling p/(2 p + 1) in a magnetic field of strength B that is algebraically identical to the IQHE state of filling p in a magnetic field of strength B/(2 p+ 1). The construction provides a precise definition of the quasi-electron/composite fermion that differs in some respects from common descriptions: they are eigenstates of L,Lz; they and the FLL subshells they occupy carry a third index I {{that is associated with}} breaking of scalar pairs; they absorb in their internal wave functions one, not two, units of magnetic flux; and they share a common, simple structure as vector products of a spinor creating an electron and one creating magnetic flux. We argue that these properties are a consequence of the breaking of the degeneracy of noninteracting electrons within the FLL by the scale-invariant Coulomb potential. We discuss the sense in which the wave function construction supports basic ideas of both composite fermion and hierarchical descriptions of the FQHE. We describe symmetries of the quasi-electrons at half filling, where a deep Fermi sea of quasi-electrons forms, and the quasi-electrons take on Majorana and pseudo-Dirac characters.
