5|$|Raymond died {{in early}} 1197. His widow, Alice, was Leo of Cilicia's niece and <b>heir.</b> Bohemond III sent Alice and her posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen, to Leo, {{implying}} {{that he wanted}} to disinherit his grandson. Leo of Cilicia persuaded the papal legate, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, to visit Antioch. On the archbishop's demand, Bohemond III declared Raymond-Roupen his <b>heir</b> and ordered the Antiochene noblemen to swear fealty to the boy. Raymond-Roupen was the only son of the first-born son of Bohemond III and thus <b>heir</b> by primogeniture, but Bohemond was Bohemond III's closest male relative and so <b>heir</b> by proximity of blood.|$|E
5|$|When Philip {{returned}} to Pella, {{he fell in}} love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice, the niece of his general Attalus. The marriage made Alexander's position as <b>heir</b> less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian <b>heir,</b> while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate <b>heir.</b>|$|E
5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his <b>heir</b> apparent, he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the <b>heir</b> apparent, known as the Grand Tutor of the <b>Heir</b> Apparent (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior Tutor of the <b>Heir</b> Apparent (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of the <b>Heir</b> Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of the <b>heir</b> apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of the <b>Heir</b> Apparent. If he reached adulthood, the <b>heir</b> apparent could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|E

5|$|Before Tiberius, {{the heirs}} of Augustus were {{the sons of}} Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made <b>heir.</b> They {{advanced}} through their careers at the same pace {{and were going to}} rule together; however, they died young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the <b>heir</b> of Augustus, and Germanicus the <b>heir</b> of Tiberius. Like the sons of Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus would rule together.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{was born}} at Greenwich Palace and was named after both her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Elizabeth Howard. She was the second child of Henry VIII of England born in wedlock to survive infancy. Her mother was Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. At birth, Elizabeth was the <b>heir</b> {{presumptive}} to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, Mary, had lost her position as a legitimate <b>heir</b> when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne, {{with the intent to}} sire a male <b>heir</b> and ensure the Tudor succession. She was baptised on 10 September; Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, the Marquess of Exeter, the Duchess of Norfolk and the Dowager Marchioness of Dorset stood as her godparents.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male <b>heir,</b> she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate <b>heir</b> she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential <b>heir</b> in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E

Charles IV Theodore, a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, held the closest claim of kinship, but he also had no {{legitimate}} children to succeed him. His cousin, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore's <b>heir</b> presumptive. Across Bavaria's southern border, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph's sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend.
