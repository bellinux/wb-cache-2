5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it {{after the end of}} the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India-USA {{relations}} have improved dramatically. This has largely been fostered by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and India are both democracies and have a large and growing trade relationship. During the Gulf War, the economy of India went through an extremely difficult phase. The Government of India adopted liberalised economic systems. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, India improved diplomatic relations with the members of the NATO particularly Canada, France and Germany. In 1992, India established formal diplomatic relations with Israel.|$|E

25|$|However, in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), the Supreme Court {{held that}} when a {{contractor}} was merely the federal government's purchasing agent, the legal incidence of the tax fell on the United States and hence the tax was invalid. Further rulings by the Supreme Court, however, indicated that Kern-Limerick has extremely limited implications for Supremacy Clause jurisprudence and the ruling {{is limited to the}} facts in that case. States countered by imposing use taxes on corporations instead, and the Supreme Court upheld such taxes in United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964.) The Court also held in United States v.

500|$|Operation Deny Flight, {{and other}} NATO {{operations}} during the Bosnian War, resulted in significant tension within NATO and the Atlantic relationship. [...] Deny Flight and other early operations [...] "forced the Allies {{to consider the}} question of NATO's military responsibility for territory outside of its traditional defense perimeter, {{and it was one}} over which they were deeply divided". [...] Disagreements between the United States and its European allies over when and how to use air power [...] "made intra-alliance diplomacy more problematic" [...] during the period. [...] Many of these problems in the relationship were the result of concerns from European nations who had forces on the ground in UNPROFOR that might be taken hostage.

50|$|Assortative mating {{based on}} {{socio-economic}} status {{is the most}} broad of these general categories. It includes the tendency of humans to mate within their socio-economic peers, that is, those with similar social standing, job prestige, educational attainment and economic background as themselves. This type of assortative mating includes the growing tendency in recent years for humans to marry people more like them in educational attainment or earned income. This applies across all socio-economic statuses, both rich and poor, in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rich and well educated tend to marry among themselves, as do the poor and under educated.
