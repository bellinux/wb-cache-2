5000|$|If an {{obstruction}} {{is found}} downhole, a lead <b>impression</b> <b>block</b> can be run {{to help determine}} its nature. The LIB has a malleable lead base in which the obstruction can leave an impression when they meet. The LIB is called Wireline Camera because of its function to mark any object downhole.They are also sometimes called [...] "confusion" [...] blocks because they only give a two-dimensional view of the down-hole object, making it hard for an inexperienced person to determine what three-dimensional object is in the hole ...|$|E
40|$|The paper reports an {{experimental}} study of die-casting dies with conformal cooling fabricated by direct-metal additive techniques. The main objective is to compare the benefits and limitations of the application {{to what has been}} widely discussed in literature in the context of plastics injection molding. Selective laser melting was used to fabricate an <b>impression</b> <b>block</b> with conformal cooling channels designed according to part geometry with the aid of process simulation. The tool was used in the manufacture of sample batches of zinc alloy castings after being fitted on an existing die in place of a machined <b>impression</b> <b>block</b> with conventional straight-line cooling channels. Different combinations of process parameters were tested to exploit the improved performance of the cooling system. Test results show that conformal cooling improves the surface finish of castings due to a reduced need of spray cooling, which is allowed by a higher and more uniform cooling rate. Secondary benefits include reduction of cycle time and shrinkage porosity...|$|E

On July 10, 2006, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit on behalf of Nickolas challenging the constitutionality of the state government's blocking actions.|$|R

Maurice Gorham, BBC executive and journalist who had [...] "seen a lot of Block" [...] during his BBC days, gave his <b>impressions</b> of <b>Block</b> as [...] "a real Broadway type who reminded me of a Damon Runyon character suddenly set down in a Broadcasting House." [...] His contribution to the BBC was once singled out by the North American Representative of the BBC, Lindsay Wellington, to dispute Associated Press accusations of excessive British censorship. In a December 6, 1943 letter to the New York Times he wrote, [...] "Nor would it have been possible for Hal Block, American scriptwriter, to write the highly popular London-produced program for combined U.S. and British soldier audiences Yankee Doodle Doo." ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} type of viscosity and groove on surface detail reproduction of elastomeric impression materials. Methods: Two polyvinylsiloxane and polyether elastomeric impression materials were investigated. An aluminium cylindrical reference block with V- and U-shaped grooves of 1 mm and 2 mm in depth was machined using CAD-CAM system. <b>Impressions</b> of the <b>block</b> were taken to produce 35 master dies. Each die was immersed in distilled water for 5 minutes prior to impression making. Surface topography of the dies and impressions were captured using Alicona Imaging System. Mean difference in depth between the master dies and corresponding impressions' grooves were analyzed. Results: Type of viscosities and groove showed significant main effects on surface detail (p. 01). Express™ putty/light exhibited the lowest mean difference in depth for all grooves. The highest mean difference for U₁ (38. 3 |jm ± 21. 55), U₂ (52. 96 pm ± 30. 39) ^ (45. 02 pm ± 34. 82) and V₂ (58. 44 pm ± 44. 19) was obtained from Impregum medium, Aquasil medium, Impregum™ heavy/light and Impregum™ heavy/light groups respectively. Conclusion: Express putty/light-bodied material produced the best surface detail, and Ushaped groove showed superior detail reproduction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 41 -year-old female with {{a history}} of {{migraine}} had no previous ocular problems except myopia with spherical refraction of − 2. 25 D OD and − 1. 75 D OS. She experienced sudden onset of bilateral blurred vision, ocular fullness sensation, and headache after undergoing topiramate therapy for 7 days (50  mg/day). Her visual acuities with the presenting glasses were 20 / 200 OD and 20 / 50 OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 44  mmHg OD and 49  mmHg OS, respectively. Autorefraction measurement showed spherical refraction of − 5. 25 D OD and − 4. 75 D OS. Best-corrected visual acuities were 20 / 20 for both oculus dexter (OD) and oculus sinister (OS). Slit-lamp examination revealed bilateral conjunctival chemosis, very shallow anterior chambers, forward displacement of lens–iris diaphragm, round and sluggishly reacting pupils, and closed angles on gonioscopy. A B-scan ultrasound displayed choroidal thickening in both eyes. An ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated bilateral 360 ° ciliochoroidal effusions with forward rotation of ciliary body but no pupillary <b>block.</b> <b>Impression</b> of topiramate-induced bilateral angle-closure glaucoma and acute myopic shift was recorded. She was advised to discontinue topiramate immediately and was administered antiglaucoma medication and mydriatics. Two days later, IOP returned to normal limits and myopic shift resolved after 1 week. Her visual acuity with previous glasses improved to 20 / 20 OU. In addition, choroidal effusions also subsided gradually. The presented case highlights the possible side effects of topiramate, offers management and suggestion for such a condition, and brings awareness to sulfa drug complications...|$|R
6000|$|Among sundry {{conventional}} decorations {{after the}} old German fashion {{in the first}} edition of the [...] "Quadrupeds," [...] there are a fair number of those famous tail-pieces which, to a good many people, constitute Bewick's chief claim to immortality. That {{it is not easy to}} imitate them is plain from the failure of Branston's attempts, and from the inferior character of those by John Thompson in Yarrell's [...] "Fishes." [...] The genius of Bewick was, in fact, entirely individual and particular. He had the humour of a Hogarth in little, as well as some of his special characteristics,--notably his faculty of telling a story by suggestive detail. An instance may be taken at random from vol. I. of the [...] "Birds." [...] A man, whose wig and hat have fallen off, lies asleep with open mouth under some bushes. He is manifestly drunk, and the date [...] "4 June," [...] on a neighbouring stone, gives us the reason and occasion of his catastrophe. He has been too loyally celebrating the birthday of his majesty King George III. Another of Bewick's gifts is his wonderful skill in foreshadowing a tragedy. Take as an example, this truly appalling incident from the [...] "Quadrupeds." [...] The tottering child, whose nurse is seen in the background, has strayed into the meadow, and is pulling at the tail of a vicious-looking colt, with back-turned eye and lifted heel. Down the garden-steps the mother hurries headlong; but she can hardly be in time. And of all this--sufficient, one would say, for a fairly-sized canvas--the artist has managed to give a vivid <b>impression</b> in a <b>block</b> of three inches by two! Then, again, like Hogarth once more, he rejoices in multiplications of dilemma. What, for instance, can be more comically pathetic than the head-piece to the [...] "Contents" [...] in vol. I. of the [...] "Birds"? The old horse has been seized with an invincible fit of stubbornness. The day is both windy and rainy. The rider has broken his stick and lost his hat; but he is too much encumbered with his cackling and excited stock to dare to dismount. Nothing can help him but a Deus ex machina,--of whom there is no sign.|$|R
