The <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> <b>account</b> details how value added is distributed in the form of labour costs (compensation of employees) and taxes minus subsidies on production. The balance is gross operating surplus (plus mixed income in the household sector), which is the surplus or deficit on production activities before interest, rent and income taxes. Gross operating surplus is therefore the income which units obtain from their own use of the production facilities.|$|E
50|$|In the {{national}} accounts, {{gross operating surplus}} (GOS) is the portion of income derived from production by incorporated enterprises that is earned by the capital factor. It is calculated as a balancing item in the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> <b>account</b> of {{the national}} accounts.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{concept for}} unincorporated {{enterprises}} (e.g. small family businesses like farms and retail shops or self-employed taxi drivers, lawyers and health professionals) is gross mixed income. Since in most such cases {{it is difficult}} to distinguish between income from labour and income from capital, the balancing item in the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> <b>account</b> is [...] "mixed" [...] by including both, the remuneration of the capital and labour (of the family members and self-employed) used in production.|$|E
40|$|Implementing a Culture Satellite Account (CSA) is a {{pioneering}} feature {{to measure the}} economic impact of the cultural sector. The first countries to have one were Chile and Colombia, followed by Finland and Spain in 2009. Uruguay has completed its CSA through a research done by the University of the Republic, upon the request of the Ministry of Education and Culture. This paper shows the estimation of the Visual and Plastic Arts sector included in the CSA. The estimated variables are production and <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> <b>accounts,</b> the exports and employment, using as a main theoretical framework the Methodological Manual for the implementation of the CSA of the agreement Andrés Bello (CAB, 2009). This sector {{is one of the most}} complex ones, since the primary market (formed by the first transaction of the work) operates with a high level of informality, specially regarding sales done by the artists themselves. However, with a systematic methodology in which the results are obtained considering both offer and demand, it is possible to estimate a peculiar and interesting sector such as the Visual and Plastic Arts...|$|R

50|$|Transactions can {{be grouped}} broadly {{according}} to {{purpose in the}} following accounts;the production account displays the transactions involved in the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> by the production of goods and services. For {{each of the four}} sectors (the rest of the world does not have a production account), the balancing item, gross value added, is shown as output less intermediate consumption.Gross value added at basic prices for each sector differs from gross domestic product for the UK total economy. The difference occurs because taxes less subsidies on products are not included in the production account by sector and are instead included within resources for the UK total economy. The sum of gross value added and taxes less subsidies on products for the UK economy is equal to GDP at market prices.The distribution and use <b>of</b> <b>income</b> <b>accounts</b> exist for all the institutional sectors. These accounts describe the distribution and redistribution <b>of</b> <b>income</b> and its use in the form of final consumption. The distribution and use <b>of</b> <b>income</b> are analysed in four stages, each of which is presented as a separate account.|$|R
50|$|Operating surplus is an {{accounting}} concept used in national accounts statistics (such as United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA)) and in corporate and government accounts. It is the balancing item of the <b>Generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Account</b> in the UNSNA. It {{may be used}} in macro-economics as a proxy for total pre-tax profit income, although entrepreneurial income may provide a better measure of business profits. According to the 2008 SNA, it is the measure of the surplus accruing from production before deducting property income, e.g., land rent and interest.|$|E
40|$|Several {{economic}} data series of Liechtenstein are backwardly estimated {{in order to}} achieve consistent historic time series. The generated series consist for instance of the national income for the years 1954 to 1992 (by regressive inter- and retropolation with indicators) and 1993 to 1997 (by approximative computation after national accounting scheme). Also, the sectoral and total employment of some missing years in the 70 s, 80 s and 90 s is complemented and the gross domestic product from 1972 until 1997 is provided by an approximative computation/estimation relying on the identity of the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> <b>account</b> as part of the national accounts. These methods and the presented series are being evaluated with respect to their accuracy, which turns out to be satisfying, and can be linked with the released results from the official national accounts, which were introduced for the year 1998 and have been published until 2009 so far. Along with the provision of these figures, Liechtenstein’s economic growth pattern is being identified, the business cycles are detected and first analytical insights are obtained. ...|$|E
