25|$|Since 1982 WPI {{has offered}} a summer-program for high school science & {{engineering}} students named Frontiers. Also, beginning in 1997, WPI began offering a summer outreach program for girls entering the sixth grade, Camp REACH, to promote women in math & science. WPI participates in a collaborative effort with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the high schools of Massachusetts to support a school called the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI. Mass Academy is an 11th and 12th grade public high school for 100 academically accelerated youths. Juniors receive advanced high school classes at the academy building, with seniors taking the WPI freshman curriculum at the university. The program emphasizes math and science within a comprehensive, <b>interactive</b> <b>program</b> {{and is the only}} public school in Massachusetts whose students attend a university full-time as seniors in high school.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} state dependent <b>interactive</b> <b>programs</b> for Martin-Löf Type Theory. These programs are elements of coalgebras of certain endofunctors on the presheaf category S→Set. We prove the existence of final coalgebras for these functors. This shows as well the consistency of type theory plus rules expressing the existence of weakly final coalgebras for these functors, which represents the type of <b>interactive</b> <b>programs.</b> We define in this type theory the bisimulation relation, and give some simple examples for <b>interactive</b> <b>programs.</b> A generalised monad operation is defined by corecursion on <b>interactive</b> <b>programs</b> with return value, and a generalised version of the monad laws for this operation is proved. The correctness of the monad laws has been verified in the theorem prover Agda {{which is based on}} intensional type theory...|$|R

[...] With the growing availability of personal computers in the 1980s, he realised that an <b>interactive</b> <b>program,</b> designed for claimants themselves to use, could be helpful. He developed a prototype, which was taken up by both the then Department of Health and Social Security and Citizens Advice Bureaux, and which was the forerunner of the systems nowadays routinely used in advice centres. [...] This work also contributed to understanding the interface requirements for publicly accessible computer systems, using graphical interfaces and, later, speech dialogue interfaces ...|$|E

Robert Harrow Jr. of The Washington Post recommended the Madeline series to parents since it was [...] "educational software... cloaked in games." [...] In her book Lesson Plans for the Busy Librarian, Joyce Keeling wrote a guide for teachers explaining how to incorporate Madeline video games into school curricula, such as using Madeline Thinking Games Deluxe in math class, while Priscilla Bennett of School Library Journal suggested the games [...] "should be popular in schools, homes, and public libraries." [...] A school in Hope Meadows, Illinois, offered the program {{as a reward for}} children who had done their 15 minutes of reading, and Madeline Classroom Companion: 1st and 2nd Grade Reading Deluxe was made available as a resource at the Washington-Centerville Public Library in 1999. According to education lecturer Tom Lowrie in a paper entitled Using Technology to Enhance Children's Spatial Sense, the <b>interactive</b> <b>program</b> Madeline Thinking Games is commonly used to test [...] "for a range of visual and spatial understandings" [...] in children.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} defining an appropriate notion of non-interference (NI) for deterministic <b>interactive</b> <b>programs.</b> Previous work on the security of <b>interactive</b> <b>programs</b> by O'Neill, Clarkson and Chong (CSFW 2006) builds on earlier ideas due to Wittbold and Johnson (Symposium on Security and Privacy 1990), and argues for a notion of NI {{defined in terms of}} strategies modelling the behaviour of users. We show that, for deterministic <b>interactive</b> <b>programs,</b> {{it is not necessary to}} consider strategies and that a simple stream model of the users' behaviour is sufficient. The key technical result is that, for deterministic programs, stream-based NI implies the apparently more general strategy-based NI (in fact we consider a wider class of strategies than those of O'Neill et al). We give our results in terms of a simple notion of Input-Output Labelled Transition System, thus allowing application of the results to a large class of deterministic <b>interactive</b> <b>programming</b> languages...|$|R
