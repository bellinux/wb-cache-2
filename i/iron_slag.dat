25|$|Sandur, which {{formed the}} {{southern}} {{boundary of the}} greater metropolitan region, is still known today for iron and haematite ores. <b>Iron</b> <b>slag</b> and other metallurgical debris have been documented at more than thirty sites. Of these, five sites have been dated to the Vijayanagar period and contain iron smelting workshops.|$|E
500|$|Around 100BC, Maiden Castle's {{organised}} street {{pattern was}} replaced by more random habitation. At the same time, the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in {{the east of the}} fort. Also during the Late Iron Age, some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance, and into the areas between the banks. Excavations by archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler in this area revealed several houses, storage pits, an area used for iron working, and a cemetery. On the industrial site, more than [...] of <b>iron</b> <b>slag</b> was discovered in an area of , and it is believed the site produced around [...] of iron. The amount of ore required could not have been supplied by local sources, so most likely originated from areas of specialist iron production such as the Weald, south west England, and Wales. Maiden Castle {{is one of the most}} important iron production sites from the Late Iron Age in southern Britain.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "casthouse" [...] at {{the bottom}} half of the furnace {{contains}} the bustle pipe, water cooled copper tuyeres and the equipment for casting the liquid <b>iron</b> and <b>slag.</b> Once a [...] "taphole" [...] is drilled through the refractory clay plug, liquid <b>iron</b> and <b>slag</b> flow down a trough through a [...] "skimmer" [...] opening, separating the <b>iron</b> and <b>slag.</b> Modern, larger blast furnaces may have as many as four tapholes and two casthouses. Once the pig <b>iron</b> and <b>slag</b> has been tapped, the taphole is again plugged with refractory clay.|$|R

50|$|Iron-making {{has been}} known in Cleveland since the Romans found <b>iron</b> <b>slags</b> in North Yorkshire, with {{small-scale}} iron-making known {{to have taken place}} at Rievaulx and Whitby Abbeys and at Gisborough Priory in the 17th century.|$|R
2500|$|There is an {{information}} board about local sedimentary rock, with {{a display of}} small, loose stones for children to handle. These include ironstone, <b>iron</b> <b>slag,</b> gritstone, coal, sandstone and shale. [...] The information board has a cross-section of Baildon Moor, showing the layers of different sedimentary rock and faults. Children who later walk or picnic on the moor across the road will see the large rocks, weathered to show faults and sedimentary layers.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} inhumations found at the site including for two within pits, and other isolated human bones found in other pits. [...] Also nine complete or partial remains of newly born and young infants {{have been found in}} the bottom of the earthwork ditches. [...] Archaeological finds include for pottery sherds, flint flakes, <b>iron</b> <b>slag,</b> Celtic coins, and bronze brooches. [...] From later periods finds also include for much Roman items, such as pottery, tiles, coins and three burials in graves.|$|E
2500|$|The castle {{was built}} in the quadrangular design fashionable at the time, to a roughly square shape with {{circular}} towers linked by stone walls. The full layout of the castle is uncertain, but a gatehouse, with twin towers and a portcullis, was positioned on the east side, and at least five other towers were positioned around the walls. The walls and towers were [...] thick and built from chert stone rubble with occasional pieces of <b>iron</b> <b>slag</b> left over from the roman and medieval metalworking around the village; they would originally have been rendered and whitewashed with lime.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the re-smelting of <b>iron</b> ore <b>slag</b> {{was common}} practice, as {{improved}} smelting techniques permitted greater iron yields—in some cases exceeding {{that which was}} originally achieved. During the early 20th century, <b>iron</b> ore <b>slag</b> was also ground to a powder and used to make agate glass, also known as slag glass.|$|R
5000|$|Mudval also spelled as Mudwal ( [...] ಮುದ್ವಾಳ [...] ) is {{a village}} near Maski in the Lingasugur taluk of Raichur {{district}} in the Indian state of Karnataka. Mudwal is a pre-historic period site. There is a stone village {{in the village of}} historical importance. Gold crushers and <b>Iron</b> <b>slags</b> were found in the hill near to the Mudval village.|$|R
40|$|The lead isotopic {{composition}} of samples of <b>iron</b> <b>slags</b> recovered from two archaeological sites in Locri Epizephi-ri (Italy- Calabria) were analysed {{for the first}} time by ICP-MS. The 204 Pb, 206 Pb, 207 Pb and 208 Pb content of traces of lead present in the slags are reported. The analysis allows some preliminary conclusions on the different origins of <b>iron</b> <b>slags</b> and on the metallurgical processes that they had undergone to be made. The two archaeological sites are different by excavated extension, chronology and position in the ancient town: the first one shows that, in the 6 th cent. B. C. the activity was mostly a reduction of minerals probably not coming from a single unique source of ore or an individual mine; the latter, with slags coming from a foundry in a main sanctuary of Locri Epizephiri, indicates that, in the 5 th- 4 th cent. B. C., the metalworking used ingot or bloom, probably obtained from ores retrieved from mines sited near the city...|$|R
2500|$|The {{metalling}} was in two layers, {{a foundation}} of medium to large stones covered by a running surface, often a compacted mixture of smaller flint and gravel. About one quarter of road pavements were [...] "bottomed" [...] with large stones, mostly {{in the north and}} west where stone was more readily available. Some high-status roads in Italy were bound together by volcanic mortar, and a small minority of excavated sites in Britain have shown concrete or limestone mortar. Road surfaces in the iron-producing areas of the Weald were made from <b>iron</b> <b>slag.</b> The average depth of metalling over 213 recorded roads is about , with great variation from as little as [...] to up to [...] in places, probably built up over centuries.|$|E

50|$|Strong {{evidence}} of iron smelting {{has been found}} at the Mambo phase level, and bits of <b>iron</b> <b>slag</b> have been found at the Zhizo phase level, suggesting that iron smelting existed at Leopard's Kopje {{as early as the}} 9th century.|$|E
40|$|The rescue {{excavations}} of the Virbaliūnai ancient settlement have unearthed {{the iron}} production {{site of the}} middle of the first millennium AD. Nine slag-pit type furnace bottoms with the slaggy mass in situ, pieces of <b>iron</b> smelting <b>slag,</b> potsherds and other finds have been excavated here. An attempt of a metallurgical interpretation of both the furnace structure and iron smelting process at the site is discussed in this paper. The results of metallographic examination of crude iron clot as well as the data of chemical analyses of the smelting slags are also presented here. Key words: slag-pit furnace, iron smelting, crude <b>iron,</b> smelting <b>slag,</b> composition, microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} process {{continues}} to be the principal technique used for ironmaking in the world. The major chemical components of the <b>iron</b> blast furnace <b>slag</b> are Al 2 O 3, CaO, MgO and SiO 2. Recent years more and more high-Al 2 O 3 iron ores have been used for the ironmaking which results in high Al 2 O 3 concentration in the <b>iron</b> blast furnace <b>slag.</b> Inspection of the compositions of the <b>iron</b> blast furnace <b>slag</b> in Shougang indicated that the Al 2 O 3 concentration in the slag has increased from 7 - 8 wt% in 1980 s to 15 - 16 wt% now. Similar trend has been observed in other ironmaking companies. It has been shown during industrial practices that high Al 2 O 3 concentration in the conventionally used <b>iron</b> blast furnace <b>slag</b> significantly increases the viscosity of the slag and results in difficult operation. To confront the difficulty of high-Al 2 O 3 concentration in the slag and to assist in the optimization of the iron blast furnace operations Shougang has identified the need for a fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical properties of the <b>iron</b> blast furnace <b>slags</b> in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system...|$|R
50|$|The Konfin {{archaeological site}} {{is located on}} Konfin Saddle. <b>Iron</b> ore <b>slag</b> has been {{discovered}} here. A large smelter stood here, probably associated with the ancient fort on Gradišče Hill, {{believed to have been}} active during the Roman era.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of bronze and iron smelting: furnaces, ore roasting pits and 200kg of <b>iron</b> <b>slag</b> were found. About 600 items of worked stone, over 4,000 shards of pottery, and objects of tin, copper and iron and glass were found.|$|E
50|$|Ground-granulated {{blast-furnace}} slag (GGBS or GGBFS) {{is obtained}} by quenching molten <b>iron</b> <b>slag</b> (a by-product {{of iron and}} steel-making) from a blast furnace in water or steam, to produce a glassy, granular product that is then dried and ground into a fine powder.|$|E
50|$|Two waste pits found {{from the}} {{farmstead}} area contained <b>iron</b> <b>slag,</b> while West Slav pottery highly {{popular in the}} Viking Age was found from a third. Yet another pit contained waste from metal crafts as well as glass of Roman and Byzantine origin.|$|E
5|$|The slag melts in {{the heat}} of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and {{apertures}} in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the <b>iron</b> and the <b>slag</b> separately. The <b>iron,</b> once cooled, is called pig <b>iron,</b> while the <b>slag</b> can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of making iron, the liquid level at the blast furnace hearth is one {{important}} effect to consider in the operation. The liquid level is check {{in order to have a}} smooth running process. Many numerical methods have been done and analyzed in order to have an understanding of the liquid behavior inside the blast furnace. All numerical methods done, about the liquid level, show a strong flow phenomenon at the taphole of the blast furnace. Since many numerical methods already exist, a physical scale model is more optional in order to have a truthful visualization of the melted iron simulation. In this way, it can be proven that the strong blow phenomenon really happens. For this reason, a pressurized physical scale model has been built in order to simulate the liquid level of the molten <b>iron</b> and <b>slag</b> in the blast furnace hearth. A simulation of the liquid level was done using water to simulate the liquid in the blast furnace. This was done with a purpose, to visualize and prove the existence of the strong flow phenomenon. The results obtained of this simulation show the strong blow phenomenon quite visibly. Another simulation was done using water and vegetable oil to simulate the melted <b>iron</b> and the <b>slag.</b> Since the ratio of melted <b>iron</b> to <b>slag</b> is about 2. 6 (The respective densities for molten <b>iron</b> and <b>slag</b> are 6700 kg/m 3 and 2600 kg/m 3), and the production rate of melted <b>iron</b> to <b>slag</b> is 3. 3, a rate of 3 (water) to 1 (vegetable oil) was done in order to achieve an approximation to a ratio of 3 (The respective densities at room temperature are 1 g/cm 3 for water and 0. 922 g/cm 3 for the oil). The results obtained for this simulation, again, show the strong flow phenomenon very visibly. The geometrical similarity was satisfied as was the kinematic similarity. However, the dynamic similarity was not achieved. The equalities obtained are Rep = 5. 487 Rem, Fr m = 558. 38 Frp, and Np = 9. 879 Nm. Although, similarity was not achieved completely, the observed results illustrate a pattern where it can be said that the strong blow phenomenon really does happen. ...|$|R
