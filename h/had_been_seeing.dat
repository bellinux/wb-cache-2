5|$|Several {{days after}} the October meeting, JG50 was disbanded and its {{personnel}} absorbed into I./Jagdgeschwader 301, a Wilde Sau night-fighter unit. While operational, JG 50 had claimed 45 Allied four-engined bombers. Graf was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and on 11 November, appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG11, when Mader was transferred to JG54 in the Leningrad sector. Aside from Grislawski, who was kept on as Staka (the squadron commander) of 1./ JG1, he managed to take his soccer players and friends with him. Sunday 20 February marked the start of ”Big Week” – six consecutive days of concentrated bombing by the USAAF designed to overwhelm the German defences. JG11 was heavily involved and Graf shot down a B-24 Liberator for his 208th victory on the 24 February. His 209th aerial victory, west of Berlin on 6 March, was over another B-24 Liberator, of the 453d Bombardment Group. It was actually an Herausschuss (separation shot) – a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box and which the Luftwaffe counted as an aerial victory. On 29 March, Graf shot down two P-51 Mustangs that were making a fighter sweep ahead of their bomber stream. Chased and harried {{by the rest of}} their squadron, he tried to ram another before bailing out. Landing heavily, he broke both knees and fractured his arm. These would prove to be his final air victories. Prompt attention from the JG11 medic saved Graf from losing his arm. From April to early July he spent time recovering in a hospital in his home-town of Engen. On June 24, he married Jobst, whom he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> over the past year.|$|E

500|$|Howe {{was opposed}} in his riding by CCF {{candidate}} Doug Fisher, a {{local high school}} teacher. Fisher's campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, {{and a number of}} corporate enemies Howe had made over the years. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station—Howe initially scheduled no television appearances. The voters of Port Arthur saw Fisher on television every night, explaining why the Liberals had gone wrong in his view, and what his party proposed to do to correct matters. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher's appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn [...] "treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the nice young fellow that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> on television {{for the last couple of}} months was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him." [...] Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher's hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect's mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. [...] Howe's defeat came as the Liberals still led narrowly in the reported returns. The Tories forged ahead, and took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105. [...] St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.|$|E
500|$|After a cameo {{appearance}} in A Day at the Beach (1970), {{and a serious}} role later in 1970 as an ageing businessman who seduces Sinéad Cusack in Hoffman, Sellers starred in Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup opposite Goldie Hawn. According to The Times, the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, he [...] "was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario [...] he played in There's a Girl in My Soup". The film {{was seen as a}} small revival of his career. However, Sellers's next films, including Rodney Amateau's Where Does It Hurt? (1972) and Peter Medak's Ghost in the Noonday Sun (1974), were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons's The Optimists of Nine Elms. Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers [...] "a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion". This was echoed by Sellers's biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only There's a Girl in My Soup had been a success. In his private life, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> the twenty-three-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellers's private doubts—expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger—about his decision to re-marry.|$|E

2500|$|Still, {{with the}} {{business}} still in the black, Alexander did find time to start a romantic relationship with Eve Elder, a 33-year-old insurance claims agent, around 1995. As the relationship wore on, however, Elder would later see some odd signs of the potentially deadly violent streak in Alexander, especially when commenting about the inspectors. In what had {{started out as a}} joke, the couple concocted a series of short stories; one, titled [...] "Sausage Sniffers Found Sauced", painted a description of the inspectors drowning in vats of 'secret sauce'. Soon, the tone of Alexander's words would take on a much darker tone. [...] As another former girlfriend, Charlotte Knapp, 38, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> Alexander off and on up until the time of the murders, would later testify during the murder trial, Alexander frequently used profanities to describe the inspectors and would at times have some choice words ready for them, or for anyone else whom he deemed as [...] "trespassers" [...] that came upon his factory. [...] On occasion wielding a gun, one of the several firearms that he kept in his office desk drawer.|$|E
2500|$|Rod McKenzie, {{the editor}} of BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, {{observed}} on the BBC Editors' weblog (see Further reading) that audience reactions to Brand's and Ross's remarks had been polarised, noting that whilst his colleagues at Radio 4, Radio 5 Live, television, and the BBC World Service <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> one thing, the younger audiences of Radio 1 had been reacting quite differently, and were broadly supportive of Ross and Brand. Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that [...] "he financial markets are wrecked and all {{he can do is}} talk about a petty joke." [...] Others stated that people should [...] "calm down", [...] "get a grip", and that the subject had been [...] "blown out of all proportion". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing [...] "anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of it comes from the BBC's usual critics." [...] He stated that for the people who worked in the media [...] "profile and salary-envy and [...] may play a part in all this. But how many heard the original transmission and how many are responding to the newspapers' quotes or others' arguments?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Saint-Simon {{published}} Physiologie sociale in 1813 {{and devoted}} {{much of his}} time to the prospect that human society could be steered toward progress if scientists would form an international assembly to influence its course. He argued that scientists could distract groups from war and strife, by focusing their attention to generally improving their societies living conditions. In turn, this would bring multiple cultures and societies together and prevent conflict. Saint-Simon took the idea that everyone had encouraged from the Enlightenment, which was the belief in science, and spun it to be more practical and hands-on for the society. Saint-Simon's main idea was that industrialism would create a new launch in history. He saw that people <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> progress as an approach for science, but he wanted them to see it as an approach to all aspects of life. Society was making a crucial change at the time since it was growing out of a declining feudalism. This new path could provide the basis for solving all the old problems society had previously encountered. He was more concerned with the participation of man in the workforce instead of which workforce man choose. His slogan became [...] "All men must work ” and from this, the slogan of communism was evolved [...] "Each according to his capacity. [...] " ...|$|E
