60|$|THE {{return of}} morning had in some degree {{dissipated}} the gloom that had {{settled on the}} young Duke during the night. Sound and light made him feel less forlorn, {{and for a moment}} his soul again responded to his high purpose. But now he was to seek necessary repose. In vain. His <b>heated</b> <b>frame</b> and anxious mind were alike restless. He turned, he tossed in his bed, but he could not banish from his ear the whirling sound of his late conveyance, the snore of Mr. Macmorrogh, and the voice of Tom Rawlins. He kept dwelling on every petty incident of his journey, and repeating in his mind every petty saying. His determination to slumber made him even less sleepy. Conscious that repose was absolutely necessary to the performance of his task, and dreading that the boon was now unattainable, he became each moment more feverish and more nervous; a crowd of half-formed ideas and images flitted over his heated brain. Failure, misery, May Dacre, Tom Rawlins, boiled beef, Mrs. Burnet, the aristocracy, mountains and the marine, and the tower of St. Alban's cathedral, hurried along in infinite confusion. But there is nothing like experience. In a state of distraction, he remembered the hopeless but refreshing sleep he had gained after his fatal adventure at Brighton. He jumped out of bed, and threw himself on the floor, and in a few minutes, from the same cause, his excited senses subsided into slumber.|$|E

40|$|A set of twenty-four {{colonies of}} honeybees {{was divided into}} three groups, two of which {{received}} different intensities of artificial heat, applied by means of specially designed <b>heating</b> <b>frames</b> placed {{in the middle of}} the brood chambers, from 2 Jan. to 16 Mar. 1942. Heating the colonies reduced the area of brood present at the beginning of May without noticeably affecting the consumption of carbohydrate stores and thus had an adverse effect on the colonies. This conclusion is in agreement with that reached as a result of earlier work (Butler & Cockbill, 1942.) Colonies in hives fitted with top entrances were no stronger in the spring than colonies in hives with bottom entrances, nor did they show any significant difference in store consumption. No significant brood chamber temperature differences were found in hives fitted with top entrances as compared with control hives which had normal bottom entrances. During the period when heat was applied to the colonies by means of the <b>heating</b> <b>frames</b> the minimum brood chamber temperature was significantly higher in the heated hives than in the control, unheated, hives, this being especially marked in the case of the hives fitted with 6 W. heaters. Throughout the experiment the minimum brood chamber temperature of all the hives showed a close dependence on screen temperature. During the preliminary period before the heat was turned on a change of 1 d̀ C. screen temperature was associated with change of 0. 92 d̀ C. in the minimum brood chamber temperature in hives with top entrances, and a change of 0. 86 d̀ C. in hives with bottom entrances. After the heat was turned on the corresponding figures were 0. 84 d̀ C. for top entrance hives and 0. 67 d̀ C. for the bottom entrance hives...|$|R

The {{design of the}} hybrid {{ground source heat pump}} system involves many degrees of freedom; e. g. the size of the cooling tower interacts with the control strategy, the ground loop heat exchanger design, and other parameters. This paper presents a simulation of such a system using a direct contact evaporative cooling tower as the supplemental heat rejecter. The simulation is performed in a component-based modeling environment using component models of a vertical ground loop <b>heat</b> exchanger, plate <b>frame</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger, cooling tower, circulating pumps, and heat pumps. Seven months (March to September 2005) of five-minutely experimental data from a hybrid ground source heat pump system were used for validation purposes.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} devised {{for the production}} of saline ice sheets in a centrifuge and the determination of flexural strength and elastic modulaus of this ice through in situ cantilever beam testing. A cold box, in which dry ice acted as a heat sink, was used for this purpose. The ice beams were produced by lowering a <b>heated</b> brass <b>frame</b> through the ice cover. The load and beam deflections were recorded furing indentation. The results of this analysis showed that inertial acceleration did not affect the flexural strength of the thin ice sheets required for this type of simulation. The data obtained were consistent with previously published strength values for thicker ice. The effective modulus showed a dependency on brine volume and inertial acceleration. The values obtained are substantially lower than those from conventional 1 g tests and increase with the level of inertial acceleration. This is attributed to the confining stress.

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are {{a commonly}} used device {{in many different}} industries, with many different applications. The heat exchanger used in the brewing program here at Central Washington University is a brazed plate and <b>frame</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger, so it cannot be taken apart for cleaning. Due to this, the overall efficiency of the heat exchanger will be reduced, causing fouling, because of the buildup of brewing material. In order to effectively combat this fouling, a heat exchanger must be constructed that can be disassembled for cleaning, and then reassembled with ease, while still being able to perform {{the same amount of}} heat transfer as the brazed system. Specifically, a gasketed plate and <b>frame</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger was constructed for this purpose, which utilizes rubber gaskets to seal the system, instead of brazing. This heat exchanger was constructed using twenty stainless steel plates, with four flow holes punched for the fluid paths, and arranged with the attached gaskets in a cross flow pattern. To test the effectiveness of this system, the heat exchanger will operate using cold tap water to cool down water heated to approximately 200 °F. The output temperature of the water will be measured in order to see how well the heat exchanger is able to transfer heat between the two fluids. The results of this test will indicate the viability of this system, state the specific rate of heat transfer within this system, and compare this value to the previously utilized brazed heat exchanger...|$|R

50|$|The plate heat {{exchanger}} (PHE) is a specialized design well suited to transferring heat between medium- and low-pressure fluids. Welded, semi-welded and brazed {{heat exchanger}}s are used for heat exchange between high-pressure fluids or where a more compact product is required. In place of a pipe passing through a chamber, there are instead two alternating chambers, usually thin in depth, separated at their largest surface by a corrugated metal plate. The plates used in a plate and <b>frame</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger are obtained by one piece pressing of metal plates.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{real-time}} Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging, elevated frame rates are both desirable and relevant from a clinical perspective. However, fundamental limitations on frame rates are imposed by thermal safety concerns related to incident radiation force pulses. Abdominal ARFI imaging utilizes a curvilinear scanning geometry that results in markedly different tissue heating pat-terns than those previously studied for linear arrays or mechanically-translated concave transducers. Fi-nite Element Method (FEM) models were used to simulate these tissue heating patterns and to analyze the impact oft issue <b>heating</b> on <b>frame</b> rates available for abdominal ARFI imaging. A perfusion modcl was implemented to account for cooling effects due to blood flow and frame rate limitations were evalu-ated in the presence ofnormal, reduced and negligible tissue perfusions. Conventional ARFI acquisition techniques were also compared to ARFI imaging with parallel receive tracking in terms ofthennal effi-ciency. Additionally, thermocouple measurements of transducer face temperature increases were ac-quired to assess the frame rate limitations imposed by cumulative heating of the imaging array.

40|$|The {{heat from}} {{high-power}} microdevices for space, such as Xilinx Virtex 4 and 5 (V 4 and V 5), {{has to be}} removed mainly through conduction in the space vacuum environment. The class-Y type packages are designed to remove {{the heat from the}} top of the package, and the most effective method to remove heat from the class-Y type packages is to attach a heat transfer device on the lid of the package and to transfer the <b>heat</b> to <b>frame</b> or chassis. When a heat transfer device is attached to the package lid, the surfaces roughness of the package lid and the heat transfer device reduces the effective contact area between the two.

Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted in an individual residential building with a total area of 80 square meters. Two panels with an infrared heating element and thermoelectric temperature sensors were used. Signals from the sensors were registered by measuring instruments. The amount of the consumed energy was measured by the electric meter. Results: The article identifies the problem and researches of parameters of the combined electric heating system, mutual influence of the two heating devices which are {{made on the basis of}} the heating elements with a positive temperature coefficient of resistance.
