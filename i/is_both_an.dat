5|$|Composed by Academy Award winner Bill Conti, the Rocky Balboa film score <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> updated {{composition}} of Rocky {{music and a}} tribute to the music that has been featured in previous Rocky films. Conti, who has acted as composer on every Rocky film except Rocky IV, chose to compose the score almost entirely from musical themes used in the previous movies. Only one original theme was written specifically for Rocky Balboa and that is the theme written to represent the character of Marie.|$|E
5|$|The Oxford University Student Union, {{better known}} by its acronym OUSU, exists to {{represent}} students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.|$|E
5|$|The film <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> homage to, and a self-parody of, Disney's {{animated}} features, making numerous {{references to}} Disney's past works through {{the combination of}} live-action filmmaking, traditional animation, and computer-generated imagery. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, produced the songs of Enchanted, with Menken also composing its score.|$|E

50|$|However, this {{contention}} that {{one and the}} same proposition can <b>be</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> posteriori and necessary is considered absurd by some philosophers (as is Kripke's paired claim that the same proposition can <b>be</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> priori and contingent).|$|R

25|$|Although Weinstein is {{a fictional}} {{character}} (and never admitted as such), {{the majority of}} opinions, social-political commentary and oblique characteristics of her personality are clearly reflective of Bluestein's own. In essence, Weinstein <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> extension and distortion of Bluestein's actual personality.|$|E

In these countries, sponge aquaculture <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> easy and profitable business, which benefits the local community and environment through minimising both harvesting pressure on wild stocks and environmental damage.|$|E
25|$|Each of the 14 regions {{also has}} a Region Advisor (RA), to help the {{district}}s in that region with district success planning and marketing.

25|$|The router type is an {{attribute}} of an OSPF process. A given physical router may {{have one or}} more OSPF processes. For example, a router that is connected {{to more than one}} area, and which receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS, <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> area border router and an autonomous system boundary router.|$|E

25|$|As {{the largest}} and most {{spectacular}} forest antelope, the western/lowland bongo <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> important flagship species for protected areas such as national parks, and a major trophy species which has been taken in increasing numbers in Central Africa by sport hunters during the 1990s. Both of these factors are strong incentives to provide effective protection and management of populations.|$|E
25|$|Haskell has an open, {{published}} specification, {{and multiple}} implementations exist. Its main implementation, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> interpreter and native-code compiler {{that runs on}} most platforms. GHC is noted for its rich type system incorporating recent innovations such as generalized algebraic data types and type families. The Computer Language Benchmarks Game also highlights its high-performance implementation of concurrency and parallelism.|$|E
25|$|Equality <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> {{equivalence}} relation and a partial order. Equality {{is also the}} only relation on a set that is reflexive, symmetric and antisymmetric. In algebraic expressions, equal variables may be substituted for one another, a facility that is not available for equivalence related variables. The equivalence classes of an {{equivalence relation}} can substitute for one another, but not individuals within a class.|$|E

25|$|X# {{can work}} with three {{low-level}} data structures: the registers, the stack and the memory, on different ports. The registers are the base of all normal operations for X#. A register can be copied to another by writing DST = SRC as opposed to mov or load/store instructions. Registers can be incremented or decremented just as easily. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are written as dest op src where src is a constant, variable, or register, and dest <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> operand and the location where the result is stored.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} cathedral {{building of}} the age was the rebuilding of St Peter's Basilica in Rome, the combined work of the architects Bramante, Raphael, Sangallo, Maderno and surmounted by Michelangelo's glorious dome, taller but just one foot narrower {{than the one that}} Brunelleschi had built a hundred years earlier in Florence. The dome <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> external and an internal focus. The chancel and transept arms are identical in shape, thus recalling the Greek Cross plan of Byzantine churches. The nave was, in fact, an addition.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{membrane}} is freely permeable only to oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water. It is {{much less}} permeable to ions and small molecules than the outer membrane, creating compartments by separating the matrix from the cytosolic environment. This compartmentalization is a necessary feature for metabolism. The inner mitochondrial membrane <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> electrical insulator and chemical barrier. Sophisticated ion transporters exist to allow speciÔ¨Åc molecules to cross this barrier. There are several antiport systems embedded in the inner membrane, allowing exchange of anions between the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix.|$|E

25|$|Though {{we cannot}} perfect the {{endeavour}} we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love {{are rooted in}} this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian Brahminic philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Illiteracy <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} cause, and {{an important}} effect, of chronic global poverty. Improvements in livelihoods and access to services in rural communities depends {{on their ability to}} manage local organizations, or hold external ones accountable. The processes of development can also be undermined by educated agents of development whose 'deeply interiorized literacy' informs their decisions. In recent years this has begun to change, with methods of engagement with oral communities that have emphasized participation, voice, and other development methods like participatory rural appraisal, participatory action research and Farmer Field Schools.|$|E
25|$|Unlike stroke-based input methods, the pinyin method only {{requires}} {{the user to}} know how to speak Mandarin and be able to recognize the characters. It does not require the user to be able to construct the character from scratch as one would do in writing Chinese. This <b>is</b> <b>both</b> <b>an</b> advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage in that {{people will be able to}} type all the characters they can recognize. It is a disadvantage in that it may cause language attrition and skill loss in adults, and it may be a learning barrier for written Chinese in children.|$|E
