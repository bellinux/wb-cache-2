5000|$|Soon after SPS {{had begun}} {{producing}} the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> set screw, Hallowell {{had the idea}} to make a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap screw (SHCS). Hallowell said, [...] "Up to this moment {{none of us had}} ever seen a socket head cap screw, and what I am about to relate concerns what I believe was the first socket head cap screw ever made in this country U.S.." [...] SPS gave their line of screws the Unbrako brand name, chosen for its echoing of the word [...]|$|E
50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> set screws, and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar {{was soon copied}} by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hex</b> <b>socket</b> screw <b>heads</b> {{are usually}} made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
50|$|A {{counterbore}} hole is usually used when {{the head of}} a fastener, such as a <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> or <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> capscrew, is required to be flush with or below the level of a workpieces surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type cam follower is a slot, for use with a flat <b>head</b> screwdriver. However, <b>hex</b> <b>sockets</b> are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in blind holes. <b>Hex</b> <b>socket</b> cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the cam follower. RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the <b>hex</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Torx design {{allows for}} a higher torque to be exerted than a {{similarly}} sized conventional <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> without damaging the head and/or the tool. The diagram on the right depicts {{the interaction between the}} male and female components of a conventional hex drive and a Torx drive. The clearance between the components is exaggerated for clarity. The diagram does not show a true Torx profile, but illustrates the general shape and geometry.|$|E
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex socket drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> <b>head,</b> beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|E
5000|$|A can wrench is {{a wrench}} made {{to open a}} {{telephone}} distribution terminal also called a telco can or demarcation point box. One end of the can wrench is a 7/16 inch <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> used for recessed fasteners on closures, and the other end is a 3/8 inch <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> for use on binding posts. The wrench is {{also referred to as}} a 216C tool which was the Bell System specification version. They are often insulated against electric shock. The <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> on each end is a thin wall thickness to allow the outside diameter to be placed into the tight recessed access often found on telco cans and demarc boxes.|$|R
50|$|The Allen socket may be 6 {{point or}} 12 point (also {{known as a}} double <b>hex</b> <b>socket).</b> They are used where hex or square nuts won't fit.|$|R
50|$|Some devices contain {{non-standard}} screws or bolts in {{an attempt}} to deter access. Examples are telephone switching cabinets (which have triangular bolt <b>heads</b> that a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> fits) and computer hard drives, which usually have a star-shaped head for the screws, known as Torx heads. Drivers for these heads are commonly available from electronics retailers.|$|R
5000|$|A spider is a simple, {{relatively}} inexpensive, limited-capability {{version of}} an independent-jaw chuck. It typically consists of a ring of metal with screw threads tapped radially into it, in which screws (<b>hex</b> cap, <b>socket</b> <b>hex</b> cap, or set screws) serve as independent jaws. Spiders can serve various purposes: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1909-1910, William G. Allen {{patented}} {{a method}} of cold-forming screw heads around a hexagonal die (...) [...] Published advertisements for the [...] "Allen safety set screw" [...] by the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, exist from 1910. Although {{it is unlikely that}} Allen {{was the first person to}} think of a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive, his patent for a manufacturing method and his realized product appear to be the first.|$|R
5000|$|The half-turn T-slot nut {{attachment}} screws have Unified Thread Standard #10-24 threads (0.19 {{in major}} thread diameter and a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> button {{which uses a}} [...] inch or 0.125 in hex key. The closest ISO metric screw thread equivalent, which is preferred for military use, is an M5 thread (5 mm major thread diameter) and a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> button which uses a 3 mm hex key.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> {{cap screws}} {{connecting}} the shell {{to the mother}} board were replaced with button head cap screws.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, Fastenal {{acquired}} {{parts of}} Holo-Krome, a US <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> screw-making company. Fastenal and {{was added to}} the S&P 500 index in late 2008, replacing removed corporations.|$|R
5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> screw drive was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|R
5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive.|$|R

5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ‚å¥) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap screw, is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (<b>hex</b> <b>socket)</b> shortly followed in 1911.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of joint between shell and arbor {{involves}} a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a dog clutch). Within the central cylindrical area, one or several <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap screws fasten the shell to the arbor.|$|R

50|$|Pearl Flutes {{manufacture}} all {{of their}} instruments with French Pointed Keywork, and a Pinless Mechanism system based {{on the use of}} <b>socket</b> <b>headed</b> screws. This is different from other flute makers, most of whom would choose to use small pins to hold together critical parts of the flute's mechanism - which have been known to snag on clothing and let moisture into the delicate internal workings of the flute.|$|R
50|$|Most medieval European battle axes had a <b>socketed</b> <b>head</b> (meaning {{that the}} thicker, {{butt-end}} {{of the blade}} contained an opening into which a wooden haft was inserted), and some included langets‚Äîlong strips of metal affixed to {{the faces of the}} haft to prevent it from being damaged during combat. Occasionally the cheeks of the axehead bore engraved, etched, punched or inlaid decorative patterns. Late-period battle axes tended to be of all-metal construction.|$|R
5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the socket wrench's drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> cap screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R

50|$|A {{set screw}} {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used to secure an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a set screw has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a hexagon <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> hollow set screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. ‚Ä¶ I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|R
5000|$|Specialized [...] "wobble" [...] or swivel sockets {{are made}} {{that have a}} {{separate}} <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> and <b>socket</b> wrench connection that allows the socket to wobble or swivel over a limited range independent of the socket wrench or tool position when it {{is attached to the}} bolt or nut. This may be a distinct advantage in some applications with restricted access. These [...] "wobble/swivel" [...] sockets, with their typical ball and socket joint swivel attachments, are made {{in a wide variety of}} types and sizes including deep, shallow, impact, triple square. They are often found in impact sets since they can be built sturdier than a common universal joint socket.|$|R
2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> bolts on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|R
50|$|Two metal cams, one {{stationary}} and one movable, {{are used}} to immobilize the rope. The position of the movable cam {{is controlled by the}} locking handle. When the handle is raised, the movable cam is pressed towards the stationary cam so as to grip the rope by compressing it between the cams. Conversely, the lock is released by lowering the handle, thus retracting the movable cam away from the stationary cam and releasing the grip on the rope. The position of the stationary cam can usually be adjusted with a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> adjustment screw. This enables the spacing between the cams to be adjusted so that, when locked, the rope lock can accommodate ropes of different diameters.|$|R
50|$|Burial 1 was {{unearthed}} with {{a wooden}} tray in the ankle region, {{in addition to the}} presence of two bronze <b>socketed</b> axe <b>head,</b> three axe hafts, a wooden stick and a shaft of bamboo. Four pottery objects and 36 Chinese coins were found next to the left hand.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the fish}} bones were oceanic species (such as bonito and sea bass), and the {{presence}} of combination fish hooks and open <b>socketed</b> harpoon <b>heads</b> indicates that the local inhabitants had the capability of offshore fishing as well as gathering of marine resources from inner bay areas.|$|R
25|$|Goldsmith's {{cross is}} located in the Fox Tor Mire area between Childe's Tomb and Nun's Cross, on the Monks' Path. It was named for Lieutenant M. Lennon Goldsmith who {{discovered}} the <b>socket,</b> <b>head</b> and lower part of the shaft in 1903, making it the last major discovery of a cross on the moor. He reported his find to William Crossing whose detailed book on the crosses of Dartmoor had just been published. Crossing was unwilling to believe in its existence, so Goldsmith re-erected it with the help of four sailors from his ship. He passed the details to Crossing who conceded and included it in the 1910 edition of his Guide to Dartmoor. The cross is short and stumpy because {{the upper part of the}} shaft was never found.|$|R
