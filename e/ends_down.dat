25|$|Before the Barnsley and Shepley Lane Head Turnpike was built, {{this small}} hamlet was {{situated}} on the packhorse route from Penistone to Huddersfield. Merchants would travel from Penistone, through Thurlstone, along Broadstones Road and Dearne Dike Lane to Five Lane <b>Ends,</b> <b>down</b> Piper Wells Road, Cross Lane and Carr Lane, before turning down the long drive into Shepley Carr. The route would then follow the fields (before they were enclosed), past the Shepley War Memorial, and into the village. The travellers would then head out towards Stocksmoor and Farnley Tyas through Stones Wood (where Devil worship once took place). Some old locals tell stories of a ghostly coach and fours furiously speeding down the long drive on wintry nights before vanishing at the hamlet. The present house at Shepley Carr is the third building on this site and dates from 1862. A house which stood on the site previously burnt down in 1740.|$|E

2500|$|Rheinschild {{returned}} to the football team in 1907. [...] Playing at tackle and occasionally at fullback, he scored three touchdowns in Michigan's victory over Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University) in October 1907. [...] He also scored touchdowns against Wabash College and Ohio State in 1907. [...] At {{the end of the}} 1907 season, Rheinschild was one of two Michigan players selected by Fielding H. Yost for the All-American team he selected for the North American Press Syndicate. [...] He was also selected as an All-Western tackle by Walter Eckersall, who wrote that Rheinschild [...] "has no equal at tackle." [...] Eckersall continued:"Rheinschild of Michigan played close to the top this year, and his work in the Pennsylvania game would have given him even without his work in the other games. [...] It was the best of any tackle on the field, and clearly indicated his caliber. [...] One of his points is getting down the field under kicks. [...] He often beat his <b>ends</b> <b>down,</b> and was sure and deadly in his tackle. [...] He was not made use of sufficiently in offense to get his value in that respect. [...] He was able to lunge from his position with extreme rapidity, to assist either the offense or defense. [...] His play was, if anything less showy than in former years, but fully as effective, and this was clearly demonstrated all year." ...|$|E

60|$|When Frank {{stepped over}} {{to the place where}} his canoe lay, the aspect of the camp was very {{different}} from what it had been an hour before. The fire had burned low, and {{was little more than a}} mass of glowing embers, from which a fitful flame shot forth now and then, casting a momentary glare on the forms of the men, who, having finished their pipes, were all extended in a row, side by side, under the large canoe. As they possessed only a single green blanket each, they had to make the most of their coverings, by rolling them tightly around their bodies, and doubling the <b>ends</b> <b>down</b> under their feet and over their heads; so that they resembled a row of green bolsters, all their feet being presented towards the fire, and all their heads resting on their folded capotes. A good deal of loud and regular snoring proved that toil and robust health seldom court the drowsy god long in vain. Turning to his own canoe, Frank observed that his Indian friends were extended out under it, with a wide space between them, in which his own bedding was neatly arranged. The grave sons of the forest had lain down to rest long before their white comrades, and they now lay as silent and motionless as the canoe that covered their heads. Being a small canoe, it did not afford protection to their legs and feet; but in fine weather this was of no consequence, and for the morrow they cared not.|$|E

50|$|The user scrapes dishes clean, such as {{by pushing}} uneaten food from a plate into a waste {{container}} as food waste. From the early 2010s, manufacturers have designed consumer dishwashers for use without pre-rinsing or pre-washing, so after scraping the user places dishes into the dishwasher. Dishwashers {{are designed to}} hold different dishes in different places. For the most common installed two-rack consumer style of dishwasher, the user loads cups, bowls, and small dishes onto the top rack. Eating utensils go in the bottom rack into a container, with pointed <b>ends</b> <b>down</b> for safety. Some dishwashers have a third rack for utensils. Heavier dishes go on the bottom rack, with large pots facing downward toward the spray nozzle. After the dishwasher is loaded, the user puts dishwasher detergent into the machine. Contemporary dishwashers use sensors {{to determine how much}} washing is required, and when they finish, will provide clean dishes.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a junior}} and senior, Muirhead helped lead Michigan to {{consecutive}} undefeated seasons {{and a national}} championship in 1923. [...] In 1923, an NEA News Service profile on {{the stars of the}} Michigan football team noted: [...] "Muirhead's tackling has been as good as the middle west section has seen in some time. Time and again he has beaten the <b>ends</b> <b>down</b> under punts and nailed the receiver in his tracks. On offense his work has likewise been of high class." [...] Muirhead played his final game in a Michigan uniform against the University of Minnesota in November 1923, and a newspaper account described his performance in that game as follows:"In his last game against Minnesota, November 24, Muirhead was everywhere. He made three-fourths of the tackles under punts, and was always on the ball. A check was made during the game of Muirheads's tackles. No less than twenty-two times did this stalwart tackle bring down his man. He was a veritable demon on the field. He could not be stopped. If there is a greater tackle in the country than Stan Muirhead of Michigan he has not yet been seen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Incubation can {{successfully}} occur artificially in machines {{that provide the}} correct, controlled environment for the developing chick. The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator. Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1 °C (1.8 °F) from the optimum temperature of [...] will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because {{the rate at which}} eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed <b>ends</b> <b>down</b> and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} a fifteen-month investigation, the NTSB {{determined}} that the fire that downed Flight 592 began in a cargo compartment below the passenger cabin. The cargo compartment was a Class D design, in which fire suppression is accomplished by sealing off the hold from outside air. Any fire in such an airtight compartment would quickly exhaust all available oxygen and then burn itself out. As the fire suppression is accomplished without any intervention by the crew, such holds are not equipped with smoke detectors. However, the NTSB {{determined that}} just before takeoff, over 100 expired chemical oxygen generators were placed in the cargo compartment in five boxes marked COMAT (company material) by ValuJet's maintenance contractor, SabreTech, in contravention of FAA regulations forbidding the transport of hazardous materials in aircraft cargo holds. Failure to cover the generators' firing pins with the prescribed plastic caps made an accidental activation much more likely. The investigation revealed that rather than covering the firing pins, the SabreTech workers simply duct-taped the cords around the cans, or cut them, and used tape to stick the <b>ends</b> <b>down.</b> The cylindrical, tennis-ball-can-sized generators also may have been loaded on board in the mistaken belief that they were just empty canisters, thus being certified as safe to transport in an aircraft cargo compartment. SabreTech employees indicated on the cargo manifest that the [...] "oxy canisters" [...] were [...] "empty" [...] instead of being expired oxygen generators. ValuJet employees interpreted this to mean they were empty oxygen canisters, when in fact they were neither simple oxygen canisters, nor empty. A worker then loosely packed the oxygen canisters in several cardboard boxes with a layer of bubble wrap.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War, civil {{administration}} was reconstituted. All the mayors (Bürgermeister) that Münchwald has had since then {{are listed in}} the table below under Mayors. In the early 1950s, the chapel-building club was founded under then schoolteacher Dr. Konrad Eckes’s leadership. It built Saint Conrad’s Chapel (Kapelle St. Konrad), which was financed through donations, and which was named after its patron, Saint Conrad of Parzham. The consecration was celebrated on 29 August 1954. In 1968, the municipality built a mortuary at the graveyard, again financing it through donations. In 1950, the municipality took over all financial repayment obligations from the Münchwald Watermain Collective that it had incurred through the actual building of the watermain in 1930. This also brought the watermain under the municipality’s ownership. In late 1960, municipal council passed a bylaw dealing with the village’s connection to the public waterworks and water contributions thereto. Council made a decision to procure and install water meters and put it into action in 1963. Since Münchwald was always struggling with a dearth of water, it was decided to dig a deep-bore well. This was successful, and the waterworks were improved in 1967 with a newly built high-level water cistern. Also after the Second World War, a shift in structure set in, at first only in fits and starts. While many people in Münchwald still earned their livelihoods in farming, others had already found other earning opportunities at the industrial works in Bad Kreuznach. After Adam Hart had opened his tourist pension at the Struthof as early as 1932 or 1933, tourism began to become a significant economic factor in Münchwald beginning in the 1960s. Also rising alongside the existing pottery craft were other crafts and, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, there came new businesses in the service sector. At the same time, there was also a shift towards becoming a residential community. Today, many villagers drive to work in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main region. The structural shift also led to there being no more grocery shop in Münchwald. Such shops had been run after the First World War by Ottilie Tullius, then beginning in 1920 by Friedrich Kessel, in 1930 by the Family Lauterbach, and then by the Family Bamberger. Finally, from 1968 to 1979, the Family Knötgen ran one. Ever since, there have been no shops at all in Münchwald. In 1966, the school in Münchwald was dissolved. Ever since, the schoolchildren have had to attend the primary school and Hauptschule in Wallhausen, and any higher schools are to be had in Bad Kreuznach and Hargesheim. The schoolhouse was wholly at the municipality’s disposal. Temporarily, the schoolroom was converted into a dwelling and, like the teacher’s former dwelling upstairs, was let. After the tenant on the ground floor moved out in 1992, the municipality built the old schoolroom into a community hall with seating for 55, which is now used for festive events and as a conference room. For bigger events and for the sport association’s exercise sessions, there is the Hubertus-Halle, built in 1979, a former school pavilion belonging to the Alfred-Delp-Schule Hargesheim. Münchwald’s rising attractiveness as a residential community was accommodated by the opening of the Frauenwald new building zone in 1969. Another new building zone called Münchheide opened in 1983. It begins at Soonwaldstraße and <b>ends</b> <b>down</b> from the Struthof, thus also affording a road link between Münchwald (main centre) and the outlying Struthof. It was decided in 1999 to expand Münchheide by 9 lots after the zone had been all but filled. The expansion is called Münchheide II. From 1965 to 1970, Münchwald repeatedly participated in the contest Unser Dorf soll schöner werden (“Our village should become lovelier”), and even won a gold badge at the 1970 state-level competition. In 2000, the municipality of Münchwald celebrated its 300th anniversary.|$|E
