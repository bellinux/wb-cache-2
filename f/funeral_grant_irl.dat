The aim is to confirm the impact of the global economic crisis to strengthen those benefits. Since 2008 welfare benefits are toughen in our country. Toughen up benefits impacts families with children whom are primarily set these benefits. Thus decreasing doses that are designed for families with children? State makes austerity. It reduces expenditures of the state budget. In my thesis I examine the impact of the tightening of state social support system of assistance in material need. Therefore reduce the expenditures of the state budget, or just spilling over into another social security?

40|$|The Social Security Scheme was {{launched}} in 1990, covering formal sector private employees for non-work related sickness, maternity and invalidity including cash benefits and <b>funeral</b> <b>grants.</b> The scheme is financed by tripartite contributions from government, employers and employees, each of 1. 5 % of payroll (total of 4. 5 %). The scheme decided to pay health care providers, whether public or private, on a flat rate capitation basis to cover both ambulatory and inpatient care. Registration of the insured with a contractor hospital was a necessary consequence of the chosen capitation payment system. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the operation of the scheme, and to explore the implications of capitation payment and registration for utilisation levels and provider behaviour. A key weakness of the scheme's design is suggested to be the initial decision to give employers not employees the responsibility for choosing the registered hospitals. This was done for administrative reasons, but it contributed to low levels of use of the contractor hospitals. In addition, low levels of use were also probably the result of the potential for cream skimming, cost shifting from inpatient to ambulatory care and under-provision of patient care, though since monitoring mechanisms by the Social Security Office were weak, these effects are difficult to detect conclusively. Mechanisms to improve utilisation levels were gradually introduced, such as employee choice of registered hospitals and the formation of sub-contractor networks to improve access to care. A beneficial effect of the capitation payment system was that the Social Security Fund generated substantial reserves and expenditures on sickness benefits were well stabilised. The paper ends by recommending that future policy amendments should be guided by research and empirical findings and that tougher monitoring and enforcement of quality of care standards are required.
