5000|$|In 1927, Heinrich Freudenthal {{formed a}} family-owned company, Deutsche Pentosin-Werke, {{creating}} veterinary and medical products. The high {{reputation of the}} products rapidly developed, and by 1935, the company was licensing the production of various Pentosin products in other countries, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy and Switzerland. The founder also recognised the need to supply the growing automotive markets, and started development of automotive lubricants and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> <b>fluids.</b> Around this time, Freudenthal recognised that car makers initiated specific product approvals, and Pentosin progressed their research and development (R&D) in this direction. Pentosin were rewarded with approvals to supply the initial [...] "factory fill", and with the resultant approvals, aftermarket sales progressed in a positive manner. From the outset, Freudenthal demanded a key objective of quality in all Pentosin products, and this stance still remains today.|$|E

DEGBE is also a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of {{diethylene glycol monobutyl ether}} acetate, diethylene glycol dibutyl ether, and piperonyl acetate, and as a solvent in high baked enamels. Other applications of DEGBE are as a dispersant for vinyl chloride resins in organosols, a diluent for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> <b>fluids,</b> and a mutual solvent for soap, oil, and water in household cleaners. The textile industry uses DEGBE as a wetting-out solution. DEGBE is also a solvent for nitrocellulose, oils, dyes, gums, soaps, and polymers. DEGBE is also used as coupling solvent in liquid cleaners, cutting fluids, and textile auxiliaries. In the printing industry, DEGBE applications include: solvent in lacquers, paints, and printing inks; high boiling point solvent to improve gloss and flow properties; and used as a solubilizer in mineral oil products.|$|E

40|$|Modem {{aircraft}} use Carbon-Carbon Composite (CCC) {{materials for}} the heat-pack elements of the brake (Tarter, 1991). The elevated wear-rate mechanism of CCC brakes at low operating temperatures (< 100 °C) is well understood (Abbott, 1995). Oxidation of these friction materials increases between temperatures of 400 °C - 600 °C (Cullinan et al, 1989), which also increases the level of heat-pack wear. The current method for monitoring the life of CCC brakes is by visual inspection of the wear pin indicator. The limitation of this method {{is that there is}} no means of determining the causes of elevated heat-pack wear. This executive summary presents two innovative solutions to this wear-rate problem.

50|$|Scarab made an ill-fated {{entry into}} Formula One during the 1960 season with front-engined cars which by then were nearly obsolete. The engines in these front-engined cars were 4-cylinder units similar in layout to the Offenhauser, but entirely of Scarab's own design penned by Leo Goossen of Offenhauser, and later Meyer-Drake fame. They {{featured}} desmodromic valve gear similar in design to that {{found on the}} Mercedes F1 engine of the 1950s and were built and maintained by Travers and Coon. The engines were the shortcoming of the team as the desmodromic gear could not cope with {{the large amount of}} movement in the engine block and would consistently pull the valves too far closed resulting in valve failure. Scarab participated in five Grands Prix, entering a total of nine cars. Reventlow and his chief mechanic Chuck Daigh drove the blue and white liveried cars. Both Scarabs were entered in the Grands Prix of Monaco (where they suffered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> aeration problems and did not qualify for the race), Holland, Belgium, and France (where both Daigh and Ginther experienced oil starvation issues resulting in burnt bearings), while only Daigh's car was entered in the final race of the 1960 F1 season, the American Grand Prix at Riverside, California (the Scarabs' home track). Daigh finished because he had to keep the engine RPMs under 6000 to prevent fuel delivery problems (vapor lock) on the hot southern California day and, in doing so, did not encounter the mysterious oil starvation issue that occurred closer to 7000 RPM that had plagued the Scarabs previously. Daigh, while entered in the Dutch Grand Prix, did not race due to qualification/appearance payment issues.|$|R
50|$|The term 'power {{hydraulic}} brakes' {{can also}} refer to systems operating on very different principles where an engine-driven pump maintains continual hydraulic pressure {{in a central}} accumulator. The driver's brake pedal simply controls a valve to bleed pressure into the brake units at the wheels, rather than actually creating the pressure in a master cylinder by depressing a piston. This form of brake is analogous to an air brake system but with hydraulic fluid as the working medium rather than air. However, on an air brake air is vented from the system when the brakes are released and the reserve of compressed air must be replenished. On a power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system <b>fluid</b> at low pressure is returned from the brake units at the wheels to the engine-driven pump as the brakes are released, so the central pressure accumulator is almost instantly re-pressurised. This makes the power hydraulic system highly suitable for vehicles that must frequently stop and start (such as buses in cities). The continually circulating fluid also removes problems with freezing parts and collected water vapour that can afflict air systems in cold climates. The AEC Routemaster bus is a well-known application of power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> and the successive generations of Citroen cars with hydropneumatic suspension also used fully powered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> rather than conventional automotive brake systems.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> is an {{arrangement}} of braking mechanism which uses <b>brake</b> <b>fluid,</b> typically containing glycol ethers or diethylene glycol, to transfer pressure from the controlling mechanism to the braking mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>braking</b> {{system is}} {{designed}} as a closed system: {{unless there is a}} leak in the system, none of the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> enters or leaves it, nor does the fluid get consumed through use. Leakage may happen, however, from cracks in the O-rings or from a puncture in the brake line. Cracks can form if two types of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> are mixed or if the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> becomes contaminated with water, alcohol, antifreeze, or any number of other liquids.|$|R
25|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> is an {{arrangement}} of braking mechanism which uses <b>brake</b> <b>fluid,</b> typically containing ethylene glycol, to transfer pressure from the controlling unit, which is usually near the operator of the vehicle, to the actual brake mechanism, which is usually {{at or near the}} wheel of the vehicle. In 1918, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> was invented by Malcolm Loughead, which replaced the mechanical brake which was used previously on automobiles.|$|R

5000|$|In a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system, {{the driver}} applies force by a {{mechanical}} link from the {{pedal to the}} master brake cylinder. In turn the master <b>brake</b> cylinder develops <b>hydraulic</b> pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the electro-hydraulic brake SBC provides the brakes with a <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> supply from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|R
50|$|Brake {{bleeding}} is {{the procedure}} performed on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> systems whereby the brake lines (the {{pipes and hoses}} containing the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid)</b> are purged of any air bubbles. This is necessary because, while the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> is an incompressible liquid, air bubbles are compressible gas and {{their presence in the}} brake system greatly reduces the hydraulic pressure that can be developed within the system. The same methods used for bleeding are also used for purging, where the old fluid is replaced with new fluid, which is necessary maintenance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> {{also use}} brake levers to push fluid through a hose to move pistons in a caliper, thus forcing pads against a <b>braking</b> surface. While <b>{{hydraulic}}</b> rim <b>brakes</b> exist, today the hydraulic actuation mechanism is identified mostly with disc brakes. Two types of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> are used today: mineral oil and DOT fluid. Mineral oil is generally inert, while DOT is corrosive to frame paint {{but has a}} higher boiling point. Using the wrong fluid can cause seals to swell or become corroded. A hydraulic mechanism is closed and therefore less likely have problems related to contamination at exposed areas. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> rarely fail, but failure tends to be complete. Hydraulic systems require specialized equipment to repair.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> {{is a type}} of {{hydraulic}} <b>fluid</b> used in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> and <b>hydraulic</b> clutch {{applications in}} automobiles, motorcycles, light trucks, and some bicycles. It is used to transfer force into pressure, and to amplify braking force. It works because liquids are not appreciably compressible—in their natural state, the component molecules do not have internal voids and the molecules pack together well, so bulk forces are directly transferred to compress the fluid's chemical bonds.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system, {{when the}} brake pedal is pressed, a pushrod exerts {{force on the}} piston(s) in the master cylinder, causing <b>fluid</b> from the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> {{reservoir}} to flow into a pressure chamber through a compensating port. This results {{in an increase in}} the pressure of the entire hydraulic system, forcing fluid through the hydraulic lines toward one or more calipers where it acts upon one or more caliper pistons sealed by one or more seated O-rings (which prevent leakage of the fluid).|$|R

2500|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} a major {{ingredient}} in [...] "gas dryer" [...] fuel additives. In significant quantities water {{is a problem in}} fuel tanks as it separates from the gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at cold temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline; rather, the alcohol solubilizes water in gasoline. Once soluble, water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it will no longer accumulate in the supply lines and freeze, but will be consumed along with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windshield or door lock de-icer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> traces from <b>hydraulic</b> <b>braking</b> systems, so that the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> (usually DOT 3, DOT 4, or mineral oil) does not contaminate the brake pads, which would result in poor braking.|$|R

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system has several {{advantages}} over traditional brake actuation systems.

Implementation of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system dynamics...|$|R
