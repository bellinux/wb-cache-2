40|$|Background: <b>Halofuginone</b> <b>hydrobromide</b> (1) is {{recognized}} as an effective drug against several species of Eimeria (E.) in poultry. In this paper, we describe a convenient and low cost preparation method for the compound, as well as primary validation of its activity. Methods: First, 7 -bromo- 6 -chloroquinazolin- 4 (3 H) -one (2) was prepared from m-chlorotoluene by a conventional process, and then chloroacetone was creatively introduced in two steps. Finally, <b>halofuginone</b> <b>hydrobromide</b> (1) was obtained from 7 -bromo- 6 -chloro- 3 -(3 -cholroacetonyl) quinazolin- 4 (3 H) -one (4) by a four-step reaction sequence including condensation, cyclization, deprotection and isomerization. The structures of the relative intermediates and target compound were characterized by melting point, IR, MS and 1 H-NMR. Besides, the protective effect of compound 1 -supplemented chicken diet at doses of 6, 3 and 1. 5 mg per 1 kg were evaluated on chickens infected with E. tenella, by reduction in mortality, weight loss, fecal oocyst excretion and gut pathology, respectively. Results: <b>Halofuginone</b> <b>hydrobromide</b> (1) was prepared successfully by and improved and innovative method based on traditional research. Moreover, the synthesized <b>halofuginone</b> <b>hydrobromide</b> significantly exhibited an anti-coccidial property. Conclusions: The fruitful work described in this Communication has resulted in <b>halofuginone</b> <b>hydrobromide,</b> which has a good pharmaceutical development prospects, becoming more available for large-scale production...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA multi-residue HPLC-ESI-MS/MS {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the simultaneous extraction, detection, and confirmation of the 11 coccidiostats concerned by Regulation 2009 / 8 /EC (lasalocid sodium, narasin, salinomycin sodium, monensin sodium, semduramicin sodium, maduramicin ammonium alpha, robenidine hydrochloride, decoquinate, <b>halofuginone</b> <b>hydrobromide,</b> nicarbazin, and diclazuril) in feedingstuffs at carry-over level. The sensitivity of the method allows quantification and confirmation for all coccidiostats below target concentration. The method was in-house validated and meets all criteria of European legislation (2002 / 657 /EC). The precision of the method was determined under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions; RSDr and RSDR were below the maximum permitted values for every tested concentration. The specificity was checked by analysing representative blank samples and blank samples fortified with potentially interfering substances (benzimidazoles, corticosteroides, triphenylmethane dyes, quinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenicols) and no interference were found. Concerning quantification, a quadratic regression model was fitted to every calibration curve with a regression coefficient R 2 above 0. 99 on each data set. Finally, the expanded uncertainty U was calculated with data obtained within the laboratory while applying the method during validation and in routine tests...|$|E
