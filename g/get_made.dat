Series creator Shu Takumi, who wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role for the production, had wanted the series to end with Trials and Tribulations, as he felt that Phoenix's character had been explored fully; when it was decided that the game would <b>get</b> <b>made,</b> he wanted it to have a new main character with a new story, and wanted Phoenix to not make an appearance. Despite this, it was decided that Phoenix would be the accused in the first case in the game. Apollo Justice sold around 250,000 copies during the first retail week and 515,417 by the end of 2007, and has been mostly positively received by critics.|$|E

But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

The film almost did not <b>get</b> <b>made</b> since the Kanins were not under any studio contract, and having shopped the script around without attracting any interest, it was only after a rewrite inspired by Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday that producer Bill Perlberg and director George Seaton purchased it.|$|E

500|$|... “I {{am writing}} {{this story about}} a detective who turns into a tree” was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what {{he was working on}} during the early 1980s.

500|$|For {{the female}} lead, {{no fewer than}} ten actresses were {{considered}} {{to play the role}} before finally the choice of Sandra Bullock in October 2010. In 2010, Angelina Jolie, who had rejected a sequel to Wanted (2008), was in contact with Warner Bros. to star in the film. [...] Scheduling conflicts involving Jolie's Bosnian war film In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011) and a possible Salt (2009) sequel led Jolie to exit her involvement with Gravity, leaving Warner Bros. with doubts that the film would <b>get</b> <b>made.</b> The studio approached her for a second time to reconsider her former decision to which Jolie again declined. In mid-2010, Marion Cotillard screen tested the part but instead went on to accept a role in another sci-fi film, Inception alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and the comedy drama Little White Lies. Scheduling conflicts with the TV series Gossip Girl in Manhattan and the acclaimed movie The Town in Boston prevented actress Blake Lively from getting the part. For the female role, Cuarón was in search of a lead who was akin to Tom Hanks' character in Cast Away and began looking at a wide range of thespians for the role. Other stars who were considered for the role includes Naomi Watts, Carey Mulligan, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Abbie Cornish, Rebecca Hall, and Olivia Wilde.|$|E

A message on the group's website read [...] "when we were kids the only thing that got us through most days was music. It's why we started Fall Out Boy in the first place.

The band's chart success was best described as unexpected by music journalists.

In some ways, it never really did. Bad movies <b>get</b> <b>made</b> as often as good ones, but so few movies <b>get</b> <b>made</b> now, period. If you write for a studio, you may be one of eight writers, so it’s not like you can have an artistic vision of your own and achieve it solely through screenwriting. I was very lucky because Ridley really wanted to tell Thelma & Louise. He wanted to make the movie I wanted to make. But often times that’s not the case at all. They think your script is a good idea and that’s all. So they buy it and then they hire two or three other people to take a whack at it and it can be a very disappointing thing." ...|$|E
