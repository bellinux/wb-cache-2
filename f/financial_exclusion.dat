The interplay of caregiving consequences: poverty, discrimination and stigma, lack of support from others, diminished social relationships, depression, emotional trauma, and poor or interrupted sleep are associated caregiver burden. Objective: The burden of care on caregivers of people living with MDs was assessed in two districts located in the middle part of Ghana. Coping strategies and available support for caregivers of MDs were also assessed. Design: A qualitative study was carried out involving 75 caregivers of participants with MDs registered within the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. Data were gathered from caregivers about their experiences in providing care for their relations with MDs. Results: Caregivers reported various degrees of burden, which included <b>financial,</b> social <b>exclusion,</b> emotional, depression, and inadequate time for other social responsibilities. Responsibilities around caregiving were mostly shared among close relatives but to a varying and limited extent. Religious prayers and the anticipation of cure were the main coping strategies adopted by caregivers, with expectation of new treatments being discovered.

30|$|A social {{innovation}} is therefore required because existing {{public and private}} institutions cannot solve the problem. Schumpeter (1935) considers innovation as {{the production of a}} new good, the introduction of a new method of production, the opening of a new market, the conquest of a new source of raw material, {{and the creation of a}} new organization. Social innovation means that new forms of social relations are required in order to overcome the <b>financial</b> and social <b>exclusion</b> and create empowerment (Moulaert et al. 2013 b). Evidently, this requires overcoming conservative forces which would prefer to perpetuate the existing system or try to take over any new system to its own advantage and, thus, either perpetuate the exclusion or find new ways to exploit (Moulaert et al. 2013 a). This agency paradox needs to be overcome by institutional entrepreneurs, aiming at creating, maintaining, and disrupting institutions (Lawrence et al. 2009). They do this by influencing public policy and legislation.|$|R

50|$|Financial {{inclusion}} or inclusive financing is {{the delivery}} of financial services at affordable costs to sections of disadvantaged and low-income segments of society, in contrast to <b>financial</b> <b>exclusion</b> where those services are not available or affordable. Financial refers to all types of financial services, including savings, payments and credit from all types of formal financial institutions. An estimated 2 billion working-age adults globally {{have no access to}} the types of formal financial services delivered by regulated financial institutions. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 24% of adults have a bank account even though Africa's formal financial sector has grown in recent years. It is argued that as financial services can be viewed in that are significant positive externalities when more people and firms participate. The availability of financial services that meet the specific needs of users without discrimination is a key objective of financial inclusion.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} banking approach focuses on adverse selection {{as the main}} consequence of the information imperfection between lender and the borrower; however, {{there is also the}} problem of moral hazard. In general there are two moral hazard problems related to the capital market. First, borrowers could lie about their financial situation and not repay their debts in full. If the lender could not check whether the borrower is lying, then there might not be any lending in the market at all, especially when the debt is unsecured. Second, when a borrower, for example, a firm makes a bad decision that leads to its bankruptcy, it does not bear the full consequence of her mistake since part of the cost will be borne by the bank that helps finance the project. Therefore, the firm is likely to make riskier decisions when the investment is financed by a bank than when the investment is financed out of the firm's own pocket. Economists show that these problems could be solved by an implicit contract in which the borrower has to pay some costs when she defaults on the debt. The borrower's cost of default can be the expense of hiring lawyers and accountants to persuade the lender of her <b>financial</b> distress, <b>exclusion</b> from capital market and future borrowing, or economic sanctions if the borrower is a country. However, since some of these costs will reduce the amount collectible to the lender in the bankruptcy, the expected rate of return is lower than if there were no moral hazard problems. Therefore, the investment level would also be lower, causing credit rationing in the size of loans.|$|R

40|$|Waste {{generation}} rates {{continue to}} grow around the world, creating {{a need for more}} comprehensive waste management strategies to meet sustainability needs. Remote islands are profoundly affected by the growth in waste and have a critical need to develop policy that addresses their unique characteristics, such as limited land space for waste disposal, higher per capita waste generation rates due to tourism, and lack of opportunities for interstate waste transport. This case study investigated one Hawaiian County's collaborative approach to adopting a new solid waste management policy. Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD) was utilized to examine the facilitating and impeding institutional factors that affect the adoption of more sustainable waste management approaches on remote islands. The impeding factors that created barriers to sustainability included blueprint models, lack of financial incentives, <b>financial</b> cost, infrastructure, <b>exclusion</b> from waste services, remoteness, and illegal dumping. Facilitating factors were environmental concerns and exemplary waste examples by other communities. Recommendations are provided for addressing these barriers and using the available opportunities to work toward greater sustainable resource management on remote islands.

50|$|More recently, a new {{formulation}} of ILD has emerged. With origins in community {{economic development in}} the United States, the new ILD model describes the use of data to generate actionable information or information solutions to development challenges. Examples of this include the inclusion of non-financial payment obligations in consumer credit files, also known as alternative data, {{and the use of}} this information in underwriting, as a means to reduce <b>financial</b> <b>exclusion</b> in the United States, where an estimated 54 million Americans are shut out of mainstream credit access as there is insufficient information about them in their credit files to be scored by a credit scoring model. This variant of ILD was pioneered by PERC, a non-profit policy research organization and development intermediary headquartered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Other US-based organizations, including Social Compact and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, employ variants of ILD, but none has applied this internationally except for PERC.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the recent}} {{concerns}} on financial inclusion have emanated {{from the results of}} the All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2002. Over a period of 40 years, the share of non-institutional sources of credit in sources of credit for cultivator households had declined sharply from about 93 per cent in 1951 to about 30 per cent in 1991, with the share of money lenders having declined from 69.7 per cent to 17.5 per cent. In 2002, the AIDIS revealed, however, that the share of money lenders had again increased to 27 per cent, while that of non-institutional sources overall rose to 39 per cent. In other words, notwithstanding the outreach of banking, the formal credit system {{has not been able to}} adequately penetrate the informal financial markets; rather it seems to have shrunk in some respects in recent years. Coincidentally, it is also true that the rate of agricultural growth during the last decade has slowed down and it is particularly striking in respect of foodgrains production. Since the green revolution, banks have been mainly focused on financing crop loans connected largely with food grains. There is, therefore, reason to believe that <b>financial</b> <b>exclusion</b> may actually have increased in the rural areas over the last 10-15 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and measure the effects of inflation on corporation income taxes and on the net cash flows of business. Five ways in which inflation alters corporate taxable income are identified. The paper begins by showing how the use of historical costs rather than the replacement costs of assets in the calculation of depreciation will cause taxable income to be overstated. Taxable income is also overstated because taxation rules require the use of the first-in first-out pricing rule for measuring the cost of goods sold from inventories. They also require the inclusion in taxable income of the full nominal value of interest earned even though during a period of inflation much of the nominal interest earned is simply compensation for the fall in the real value of <b>financial</b> assets. The <b>exclusion</b> of the loss in the real value of cash balances from deductible expenses causes taxable income to be further overstated. Partially offsetting these effects on taxable income is the provision for the full deduction of interest expense, nominal interest rates tend to increase by approximately the same number of percentage points to compensate for the fall in the real value of the principal outstanding. Hence, the amount of the nominal interest paid may increase dramatically even though the real cost of funds might not be appreciably changed. inflation, corporate taxes, cash flow...|$|R
