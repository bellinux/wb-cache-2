40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the determinants of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7 disclosures on Qatari listed banks. An un-weighted disclosure index and multiple regression analysis were employed to conduct this study; a sample from 2007 (the first year of IFRS 7 's implementation) to 2012. The banks' characteristics employed are bank size, the existence of a risk management committee (RMC), net assets value (NAV), the cost to income (CTI) ratio, earnings per share (EPS) and the price earnings (PE) ratio. The level of financial instruments (FIs) disclosure was 52 % in 2007 and by the end of 2012 it had reached 71 %. Moreover, the study found that the FIs disclosure is significantly and positively associated with a bank's size and the presence of an RMC. This study contributes to our knowledge in a number of ways: for example, it indicates how IFRS 7 's implementation has impacted on banks' <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>disclosures.</b> IFRS 7; IAS 30; IAS 32; IAS 39; financial instruments disclosure; Qatar; banking industry; International Financial Reporting Standards; bank size; risk management committee; net assets value; cost to income ratio; earnings per share; price earnings ratio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} pattern of <b>Financial</b> <b>Instrument</b> <b>Disclosures</b> (FIDs) within the annual reports of Australian listed {{extractive}} resource companies (mining and petroleum) over a four year longitudinal period encompassing the 2003 to 2006 financial years. This is an important period to investigate FID patterns as it encompasses those {{years leading up to}} and immediately following formal adoption of the Australian equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Using an index (FIDI) comprising 120 items of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> information to measure the extent of FIDs, there is a statistically significant increase in disclosures over the four year period with the greatest percentage increase occurring on transition to IFRS. Under IFRS, direct comparability with firms internationally can be made. Although the <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements are the same pre- and post- IFRS adoption, the introduction of a new form of regulation makes a difference to managements’ financial reporting <b>disclosure</b> incentives. Total <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures,</b> as measured by FIDI, increased from 34 % in Yr 1 (year ending 31 December 2002 or year ending 30 June 2003) to 52 % in Yr 4 (year ending 31 December 2005 or 30 June 2006), the latter representing the first full year annual reporting period under IFRS. Similar trends are observed for mandatory <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures</b> (comprising 57 items) and discretionary <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures</b> (comprising 63 items). The results of the main model regression analysis demonstrate that the independent variables of corporate governance, capital management, overseas listing and income tax characteristics of firms are factors which are variably significantly associated with FID patterns for panel data. Statistically significant associations are achieved for pooled regression results. Control variables comprising firm size, leverage, top 20 shareholder concentration, sub-industry and return on assets are statistically significant predictor variables of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures.</b> In contrast, overseas stock exchange listing of firms and additional income tax characteristics that are related to financial reporting transparency are found to be significantly negatively associated with FID patterns. Discrete items that comprise FIDI are individually statistically significantly associated with the independent and control variables. Similarly, discrete items that comprise the independent variable scores are individually statistically significant predictor variables of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures.</b> This thesis contributes {{to an understanding of the}} extent, trends and rationale behind resource firms’ <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> practices in Australia. Further, this thesis examines the association of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures</b> with corporate governance, capital management, overseas listing and income tax characteristics of firms leading up to and immediately following IFRS adoption in Australia...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the corporate governance determinants of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> (FID) practices of Australian listed resource firms in their annual reports for the 2005 financial year. This is an important time period to explain FID patterns for Australian resource companies leading up to formal adoption of the Australian equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Design/methodology/approach – The extent of FID was measured using a <b>Financial</b> <b>Instrument</b> <b>Disclosure</b> Index (FIDI) comprised of 120 items of both mandatory and discretionary <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> information. Hypothesis testing used empirical data from {{a representative sample of}} Australian listed resource firms. Research limitations/implications – The results of regression analysis demonstrate that corporate governance characteristics of firms are significant determinants of FID patterns. Univariate and multivariate results showed that FIDs were significantly and positively associated with strength of corporate governance structure and the control variables – leverage, firm size and industry.

40|$|Until {{reporting}} periods ending on or after 31 December 1997, <b>disclosure</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> was unregulated in Australia. This thesis examines moti. v ati. n g factors for Australian firms' voluntary derivative <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures</b> during the unregulated reporting regime spanning 1992 - 1997. It proposes that managers' disclosure strategies are {{a consequence of}} explicit and implicit contractual arrangements aimed at protecting and enhancing individuals'and firms' financial reporting reputations and maximising firm value. Aims Financial statement preparers' preferences can be revealed through voluntary reporting practices andlor lobbying activity. By investigating firms' voluntary disclosure practices in response to proposed accounting regulation and professional requirements, this study contributes to understanding costlbenefit tradeoffs with respect to information disclosures. Specifically, the thesis examines two dimensions of voluntary derivative <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures.</b> The first dimension focuses on predicting {{the degree to which}} Australian firms comply with the disclosure requirements contained in an exposure draA (ED 65) and an Industry Statement issued by Australian accounting standard setting bodies and the Australian Society of Corporate Treasurers (ASCT) respectively. The thesis examines disclosures longitudinally, transcending' {{reporting periods}} where the disclosures are purely voluntary to periods where coercive pressure is exerted on firms for transparency in relation to their derivative instrument activities. It tests whether changes in derivative disclosures across the different reporting regimes are significantly associated with changes in disclosure pronouncements. The thesis then tests for systematic differences in the characteristics of high and low disclosure firms. The tests use variables grounded in costly contracting theory as well as variables developed using a legitimacy framework. This extends the extant literature by: (a) simultaneouslayp piying these alternate frameworks; and (b) applying legitimacy theory to a financial reporting issue, as distinct from a social or environmental issue. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this study are: (1) Why, and to what degree, do Australian entities voluntarily comply with the derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements contained in ED 65 and the ASCT Industry Statement? (2) Are there any systematic differences in the characteristics of entities with high disclosure compliance versus low disclosure compliance in relation to derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instruments?</b> Scope The thesis studies the voluntary disclosure responses of Australian financial statement preparers to derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements proposed by ED 65 and the ASCT Industry Statement. Given that regulation governing derivative <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures</b> did not become effective until reporting dates on or after 31 December 1997, this thesis studies voluntary disclosures in firms' 1992 - 1997 annual reports. Using a self-constructed disclosure index, firms are assigned an integer score determined by the presencelabsence in their annual report of a range of derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> information. The information score relates to policy, risk, and net market value disclosures. Conclusions A change in the number and quality of derivative financial disclosures during 1992 - 1997 reporting periods is evident. Early 1990 s derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures</b> {{are more likely to be}} by large firms or firms in the extractive industry. The disclosures increase significantly in 1995, coinciding with the period when the ASCT Industry Statement and exposure draft are issued. This suggests that managers reassess derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> strategies in line with the increased probability of mandated disclosure requirements and the pressure on financial statement preparers to he professionally responsible. Firms subject to public scrutiny and firms with professional affiliations with the body issuing the industry statement and the Group of 100 companies are particularly responsive to the demand for derivative instrument activity transparency. Apart from firm leverage, variables grounded in costly contracting theory are generally not significant predictors of derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures.</b> This study is significant in that the results highlight the potential for professional organisations, other than the accounting profession, to influence the content of financial information contained in annual reports. This is an important consideration for accounting regulators. It indicates the need of regulators to respond in a timely manner to financial accounting issues in order to maintain their credibility and legitimacy. Whilst other interpretations may be possible, the findings also highlight the importance managers attach to firms' derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosures</b> as a means of personal and corporate reputation and legitimacy maintenance and enhancement. Furthermore, the study introduces firm attributes that are new to financial accounting disclosure choice studies and in doing so demonstrates the benefits of simultaneously applying alternative paradigms to voluntary reporting issues...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} several characteristics of firms {{on the extent to}} which Malaysian listed companies disclosed <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> during the voluntary and mandatory periods of MASB 24 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) Standard. Following prior studies, we predict that larger and more profitable firms are more likely to disclose more information on <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> We also hypothesize that strong internal control mechanisms, such as the existence of a risk management committee and audit quality, also result in higher levels of disclosure. The sample consists of firms that were listed with the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia in 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003. This study employs a multiple regression analysis over 484 firm-years. Our results indicate that, on average, the disclosure quality among Malaysian firms is low before the period of mandatory disclosure. However, the level of disclosure appears to increase immediately after the issuance of the MASB 24. We also find that the existence of a risk management committee, firm size and leverage are positively associated with the <b>disclosure</b> quality of <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> Finally, in general, the results indicate that the implementation of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> standards influence firms, to some extent, to provide high-quality reporting...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the level of comparability of the International Accounting Reporting Standard - IFRS 7 <b>Financial</b> <b>Instruments</b> <b>Disclosure</b> in banks’ annual reports across different European countries (Italy, Spain, France, Germany and UK) from 2007 to 2014. The banking sector seems to be particularly concerned with the issue of financial risks, especially during the most recent global financial crisis. In addition, risk disclosure has led to vigorous debates at both the national and international levels among scholars and standard setters. To test the comparability across countries, we use the van der Tas C index. Our results show that there is a medium level of comparability. Despite the accounting boards’ and authorities’ commitment to regulating this information, there are still substantial differences in the practices of risk disclosure, which have negative effects on comparability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} managers' responses to derivative <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements proposed by the Australian accounting standard setting bodies and the Australian Society of Corporate Treasurers (ASCT). Confronted with societal pressures to make derivative activities more transparent, managers responded in a manner that can be explained by legitimacy and institutional theories and the maintenance of the managers' and their firms' financial reporting reputations. Discretionary reporting is predicted to be positively related to the magnitude of reputation costs confronting managers and firms. While the desire for legitimacy is unobservable, financial reporting reputation is proxied by the following attributes-ASCT, auditor, and Group of 100 (G 100) affiliations. With the exception of auditor affiliation, results from the analysis are consistent with the hypotheses. Alternative explanations of the results may be possible. However, the consistency and significance of the results implies that legitimacy and institutional theories provide a plausible explanation as to what impulse prompted managers' responses.

40|$|International {{harmonization}} and {{convergence of}} accounting had gradually {{become one of}} the most challenging topic of worldwide research and a very hot debated issue in practitionersâ€™ sphere, too. Several studies have addressed both formal and material accounting harmonization along time, a wide range of instruments have been developed and various statistical tools have been used in this respect. Basing on this background, we focused our attention on Romanian banking system which is now experiencing a great challenge by finally entirely adopting IFRS after the first step from 2005 when consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS were required and the second one from 2009 when informative individual financial statements under IFRS begun compulsory. Therefore, the objective of our paper is to empirically measure and compare the levels and progress of material accounting harmonization in Romanian banking sector focusing on <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and their related disclosure requirements. First studies conducted in the measurement of harmonization practices (Nair and Frank, 1981; McKinnon and Janell, 1984; Doupnik and Taylor, 1985) started at the beginning of the 80 â€™s, but were merely descriptive, focused on examining how IAS had been adopted in various countries around the world. In the earliest 90 â€™s, there were developed the first instruments for measuring material harmonization, namely the concentration indices (H, C and I Index) (Van der Tas, 1988; 1992) and various other forms of these (Archer et al., 1995), which were widely used in various research studies (Herrmann and Thomas, 1995; Aisbitt, 2001; Taplin, 2004). Basing on these measurement tools and cconsidering the main aim of our study â€“ to measure material accounting harmonization in Romanian banking sector â€“ we stated four hypotheses, thus trying to answer our questions: â€œAre the accounting practices related to <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>disclosure</b> in Romanian banking system harmonized with international requirements? Was there a progress in this respect in the latest years?â€ The research methodology used for achieving our goal is based on both static and dynamic analysis using appropriate statistical tools â€“ concentration indices (H or Herfindahl index) for measuring the improvements in financial instrumentsâ€™ disclosure practices,, thus pointing out the degree of material harmonization reached step by step as well as the overall progress. In this respect, firstly, we developed a disclosure checklist structured on three sections dealing with financial instrumentsâ€™ general disclosures, derivatives and hedge accounting and risk disclosures. The results of the performed analysis reveal that accounting practices in Romanian banking sector as regards <b>disclosures</b> related to <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> experienced a continuous improvement both at individual and consolidated level, but the level of material harmonization is still relatively moderate. In case of individual financial reporting this can be explained by the recently introduced requirement of preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRS and only for informative purposes. Thus, by now we can talk about a real material harmonization just in case of consolidated financial reporting. Unlike prior research studies which were focused on similar goals - to measure accounting harmonization around the world, our paper provides a particular approach on a specific business field, the banking one that was not separately explored on this topic before. Thus, we considered for analysis its related accounting practices focusing on <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>disclosure,</b> which is a particular issue, too, thus enriching the research literature on this field...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the factors affecting firms' decision to use foreign exchange (FX) derivative instruments by using the data of 86 non-financial firms listed on Karachi Stock Exchange for the period 2004 - 2007. Design/methodology/approach – Required data were collected from annual reports of listed firms of Karachi Stock Exchange. Non-parametric test was used to examine the mean difference between users and non-users operating characteristics. Logit model was applied to analyze the impact of firm's financial distress costs, underinvestment problem, tax convexity, profitability, managerial ownership and foreign exchange exposure on firms' decision to use FX derivative instruments for hedging. Findings – Results explain that firms having higher foreign sales are more likely to use FX derivative instruments to reduce exchange rate exposure. Moreover, financially distressed large-size firms with financial constraints and fewer managerial holdings are more likely to use FX derivatives. Research limitations/implications – Incomplete <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements restricted researchers to using binary variable as a dependent variable instead of notional value or fair value of derivative usage. Practical implications – The study shows that in the presence of amateur derivative market, Pakistani corporations possessing higher agency costs of debt, agency costs of equity, and financial constraints will benefit more by defining hedging policies coherent with the firm's investment and financing policies in order to enhance firm value. Originality/value – Until now, no earlier empirical study focused on the determinants of a firm's hedging policies in Pakistan, in the presence of volatile exchange rates,. The current study, therefore, attempts to identify the factors which affect the firm's decision to use derivative instruments for hedging FX exposure of non-financial firms in Pakistan.

Specifically, it aims to examine the level of compliance with FRS 132 : <b>Financial</b> <b>Instruments</b> – <b>Disclosure</b> and Presentation for financial periods beginning or after 2006. Design/methodology/approach – The approach taken is content analysis and coding procedure. Findings – Although a large number of companies have shown compliance with FRS 132 in relation to disclosing the financial risk management policy, there are systematic differences across companies in terms of level of details (i. e. qualitative and quantitative) disclosure. Interest rate disclosure was the most mentioned category and the credit risk was the least mentioned category of market risk. There is telling evidence that most Malaysian firms did not engage in hedging any type of market risk over the reporting period of 2006 - 2007. Research limitations/implications – There is a need for some standardized risk reporting format to achieve greater financial transparency to make investors aware of the market risks. Originality/value – This is believed to be the first study to provide survey findings on the use of derivatives instruments by listed firms in Malaysia.

If fair value adjustments are transitory in nature and managers are able to assess their implications for future earnings, fair value adjustments in net income is expected to have no distribution consequences. However, positive fair value adjustments may lead to higher dividends when management incorrectly assesses their persistence. This can have a procyclical impact because higher dividends increase leverage, and thus risk. We use a Russian setting that mandates fair value accounting for <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and requires <b>disclosure</b> of unrealised fair value adjustments in income. We find no empirical support for the concern that dividends increase in response to positive fair value adjustments.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{standard}} setters, regulators and professional bodies worldwide have shown an {{increased interest in}} risk reporting. This has reflected the fallacy of the financial reporting model to communicate a company’s risk profile, the recent scandals and the financial crisis. In the EU, the Accounting Modernization Directive (AMD, 2003) requires companies to highlight the principal risks and uncertainties that they face, whereas the international accounting standards (IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosure) requires companies to disclose their exposures, objectives and policies {{for each type of}} risk arising from <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> Recently, the <b>Financial</b> Stability Board (FSB) has also developed new guidelines to improve risk reporting. High quality risk disclosures help investors and other market participants by providing {{a better understanding of the}} risk exposures and risk management practices of companies. In the literature, the four main areas of investigation of risk disclosure are: i) risk reporting practices and the level of risk disclosure; ii) the relationship between voluntary and mandatory risk disclosure; iii) the determinants of voluntary risk disclosure; iv) the economic consequences of risk disclosure, in terms of the impact on the cost of capital (cost of equity and cost of debt). However, these have focused mainly on corporate disclosure or risk disclosure rather than on financial risk disclosure. The aim of this research project is twofold. Firstly, we examine the level of compliance with IFRS 7 disclosure requirements on financial risks in order to understand how Albanian and Italian listed companies have implemented the risk reporting introduced by the IASB. IFRS 7 requires companies to disclose qualitative and quantitative information on their exposure to risks arising from <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> including <b>disclosures</b> about credit risk (the risk that one party to a <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation), liquidity risk (the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset) and market risk (this risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risks). To verify the degree of compliance with regulation we use content analysis. Secondly, we investigate the determinants of financial risk disclosure in order to test whether size, leverage, industry and ownership affect the level of financial risk disclosure.
