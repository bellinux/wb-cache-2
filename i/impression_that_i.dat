500|$|There is {{a lengthy}} study of Missoula {{in the title}} essay of Jonathan Raban's Driving Home: An American Journey: despite writing that on his arrival, [...] "I had the {{powerful}} <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had driven deep into the Rocky Mountains and somehow arrived in Rotherham or Barnsley," [...] and that [...] "the overall effect [...] was oddly unsettling; the streets too open for comfort, the town too closed in, inducing mild claustrophobia and agoraphobia at the same time", he notes the literary heritage {{of the city and}} its reputation as a [...] "kindly town" [...] (evidenced by its being a place where [...] "odds and ends naturally collected and cohered").|$|E
500|$|On November 17, the Swedish Academy {{announced}} that Dylan would not travel to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize Ceremony due to [...] "pre-existing commitments". At the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm on December 10, 2016, Dylan's banquet speech {{was given by}} Azita Raji, U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. The speech stated: [...] "From an early age, I've been familiar with and reading and absorbing the works {{of those who were}} deemed worthy of such a distinction: Kipling, Shaw, Thomas Mann, Pearl Buck, Albert Camus, Hemingway. These giants of literature whose works are taught in the schoolroom, housed in libraries around the world and spoken of in reverent tones have always made a deep <b>impression.</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> now join the names on such a list is truly beyond words." [...] Patti Smith accepted Dylan's Nobel with a [...] "transcendent performance" [...] of his song [...] "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" [...] to orchestral accompaniment.|$|E
500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew pretty much what I was doing, and they sort of got the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E

[...] "I" [...] continued Heyst, [...] "am so rebellious to outward <b>impressions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't say <b>that</b> much about myself. I don't react with sufficient distinctness." [...] He changed his tone. [...] "You know I went to see those men first thing this morning." ...|$|R

What has convinced me {{of the importance of}} this subject are a few very general conclusions, indeed <b>I</b> would say, <b>impressions,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have drawn from the truly remarkable development of our powers to analyse the risk decision-making process over some years now. Risk, uncertainty, home security, expected utility, non-expected utility, OECD...|$|R
2500|$|Kimmel {{plays the}} bass clarinet, {{and was a}} guest {{performer}} at a July 20, 2008, concert in Costa Mesa, California, featuring The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, performing with the group on the song [...] "The <b>Impression</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Get".|$|E
2500|$|After touring {{as part of}} the 1996 Warped Tour lineup (which {{they would}} repeat the {{following}} year), the Bosstones began work on their next studio album. Released in 1997, Let's Face It, would prove to be the band's biggest seller, mostly due to its first single [...] "The <b>Impression</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Get", which reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album was followed by Video Stew, a VHS compilation of the band's twelve music videos. The mainstream exposure led to the band's appearance on Sesame Street's Elmopalooza television special and Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album. In it, the band performs the song [...] "The Zig Zag Dance" [...] with the Muppet The Count. The band also made their Saturday Night Live debut, performing [...] "The <b>Impression</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Get".|$|E
2500|$|After the 2007 Throwdown, the Bosstones {{played a}} few shows {{every couple of}} months. At two of the March shows in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel served as a guest star on bass {{clarinet}} during [...] "The <b>Impression</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Get". Former saxophonist Lenear rejoined the band, replacing Fleysher, whose job prevented him {{from being able to}} play with the band. Despite the activity, the Bosstones remained non-committal on whether they would record and release a studio album. They did make it known that they would no longer tour at the frequency they were known for in the past.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Not,' said Glossin, perceiving he {{had made}} the desired <b>impression,</b> 'not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am against being civil'; and he slid into Hatteraick's passive hand a bank-note of some value.|$|R
2500|$|Bowie {{himself was}} quoted in a 1998 {{interview}} as saying [...] "I really did object to the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not write the songs on The Man Who Sold the World. You only have {{to check out the}} chord changes. No-one writes chord changes like that". [...] "The Width of a Circle" [...] and [...] "The Supermen", for example, were already in existence before the sessions began. Ralph Mace played a Moog modular synthesizer borrowed from George Harrison; Mace was a 40-year-old concert pianist who was also head of the classical music department at Mercury Records.|$|E
2500|$|... "Machine {{guns and}} rifles opened {{up on us}} the moment we topped the rise behind which we had formed up. I {{remember}} thinking that the sound of crackling bullets was just like hailstorm on a iron-roofed building, so you may guess what the fusillade was....A whole heap of men and horses went down twenty or thirty yards from the muzzles of the guns. The squadron broke into a few scattered horsemen at the guns and seemed to melt away completely. For a time I, at any rate, had the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was the only man left alive. I was amazed to discover we were the victors".|$|E
2500|$|The Bosstones {{are often}} {{credited}} {{as one of}} the progenitors of the genre of ska punk and the creators of its subgenre ska-core a form of music which mixes elements of ska with punk rock and hardcore. Since the release of their 1989 debut Devil's Night Out, the band toured and recorded extensively throughout the 1990s, becoming a key figure {{in the development of the}} American third wave ska scene and one of the first bands to popularize the genre in the musical mainstream, reaching their commercial peak with their platinum-selling 1997 album Let's Face It and its hit single [...] "The <b>Impression</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Get". The band had released seven studio albums, three EPs and a live album by the time they announced a [...] in December 2003. In 2007, the Bosstones reunited to resume recording and touring. [...] From 1994-2002, and since 2007, they have hosted the annual Hometown Throwdown music festival.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes; {{you might}} as well try to say {{something}} cheerful, which might do away with the <b>impression.</b> Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think it will be of any use; only do not let him think it has been under discussion." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{showed the}} varying <b>impressions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{produced}} {{on his mind}} without the slightest concealment. My separation from Eustace distressed him. My resolution to dispute the Scotch Verdict, and my unjust suspicions of Mrs. Beauly, first amused, then surprised him. It was not, however, until I had described my extraordinary interview with Miserrimus Dexter, and my hardly less remarkable conversation with Lady Clarinda, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> produced my greatest effect on the lawyer's mind. I saw him change color for the first time. He started, and muttered to himself, {{as if he had}} completely forgotten me. [...] "Good God!" [...] I heard him say--"can it be possible? Does the truth lie that way after all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{assurance}} of his speech, she could note, quite held up its head in him; his eyes met her own so, for the declaration, {{that it was}} as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed upon her, from afar off, out of his strange consistency. She kept her direction still, however, under that. [...] "Oh, the thing I've known best of all is that you've never wanted, together, to offend us. You've wanted quite intensely not to, and the precautions you've had to take for it have been for a long time one of the strongest of my <b>impressions.</b> <b>That,</b> <b>I</b> think," [...] she added, [...] "is the way I've best known." ...|$|R
2500|$|That is not surprising. In a 1995 {{interview}} Wild nominated {{his most}} significant achievement {{to be the}} building of the Culgoora radio-heliograph and providing the world with a unique eye to view and record moving pictures of rapidly changing solar activity. He observed:most scientific discoveries, had they not been made by the originator, would have been made by somebody else within a year or so or even less. To my mind the most significant discoveries or projects are those which would have eluded other researchers for decades or more. … The [...] revealed a whole range of previously unknown phenomena at a wavelength millions of times longer than the wavelength of all other moving pictures ever taken of the sun. Today, nearly three decades later, the instrument has not been duplicated and the results remain unique. In saying this I do not want to give the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did it all by myself. I owe much to the CSIRO and the Ford Foundation for providing the resources and to a wonderful bunch of colleagues who built it and made it all work.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Answers in Genesis filmed an {{interview}} with Richard Dawkins, a prominent evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, resulting in a controversial video that AiG posted on its website. Dawkins addressed it in the essay: [...] "The 'Information Challenge'", published in A Devil's Chaplain in 2003. The [...] "suspiciously amateurish" [...] interview included, according to Dawkins, [...] "the kind of question only a creationist would ask in that way" [...] (namely, to [...] "give {{an example of a}} genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome"). Realising that he had been duped, Dawkins, at his own admission, was angry at the thought and initially refused to answer the question, but relented and continued the interview. Dawkins wrote: [...] "My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Haneke {{dealt with}} the matter since 1992. The work on the script was {{interrupted}} by a writer's block. Haneke normally wrote out the script exactly before the writing process. This time {{the end of the story}} was not clear to him. He began writing in the hope that this would occur to him at work, but this did not happen. [...] "I have tormented myself terribly with the script and I was left with the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not succeeded in getting the hang of this topic", he said. At the same time the director realized that the Swiss-Canadian Léa Pool with La dernière fugue (2010) had created a similar story, about an old man who is taken care of by his wife. Therefore, he let the project in favor of another. He worked only sporadically on it, until his writer's block loosened and he could finish the script quickly. Haneke wrote it specifically for Trintignant, having already written the scripts for The Piano Teacher (2001) and Caché (2005) specifically for actors (Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil). Haneke prefers this way of working, because in this way one [...] "writes specifically something that fits to the advantages of each actor and helps to particularly work them out".|$|E

Yet I have a vague <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It {{seemed to me to be}} something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.|$|R
5000|$|Ono {{approached}} producer Jack Douglas, {{with whom}} the couple had previously worked, and gave him Lennons demos to listen to.

6000|$|... "My sister told me," [...] M. de Bellegarde continued, [...] "that I {{ought to}} come and remove the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had taken such great pains to produce upon you; the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a lunatic.

6000|$|He obeyed at once, and, as {{he slowly}} urged up the unruly sash, the {{handsome}} profile was again turned toward me, and again I was possessed by my first <b>impression</b> so strongly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> involuntarily said,-- ...|$|R

"My first <b>impression</b> was <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> as {{a living}} being, was {{standing}} before my own body and was dead - as in a time-warp perspective, at once {{in the future and}} the present.
