25|$|All-round pilot {{vision was}} {{provided}} by a wrap-around windshield and bubble canopy. Unlike the F-16's steeply raked seat and sidestick controller, however, the Lavi employed a conventional upright seat and central control column. The cockpit employed HOTAS (hands-on-throttle and stick) controls, while a Hughes Aircraft wide-angle diffractive optics head up display (HUD) was integrated onto a single El-Op up-front control panel. There were {{a total of three}} conventional <b>display</b> <b>units,</b> two of which were color. Display redundancy was ensured via data-sharing between the HMDs. A fully computerised Elta ARC-740 ultra high frequency (UHF) radio was incorporated along with a navigation suite, the latter of which included the Tuman TINS 1700 advanced inertial navigation system. Aspects such as flexibility and situational awareness were emphasized to reduce pilot workload while under high g-forces and within a dense threat environment.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Lynx's {{components}} {{had been}} derived from earlier Westland helicopters {{such as the}} Scout and Wasp. The Lynx has been substantially upgraded since originally entering service in the 1970s; improvements made to in-service aircraft have typically included strengthened airframes, new avionics and engines, improved rotor blades, additional surveillance and communications systems. Various subsystems from overseas suppliers have been incorporated into some Lynx variants; during a South Korean procurement, hulls produced in the United Kingdom were equipped with Korean-built systems, such as ISTAR, electro-optical, electronic warfare, fire-control systems, flight control actuators, and undercarriages. A glass cockpit was adopted on the Super Lynx 300, featuring fully integrated flight and mission display systems, a variety of integrated <b>display</b> <b>units</b> including head-up displays, and dual controls; AgustaWestland has commented that the new cockpit reduces aircrew workload and increases aircraft effectiveness. The head-up display installed could {{be replaced by a}} helmet-mounted sight system on customer demand.|$|E

25|$|Various {{avionics}} and onboard {{systems are}} integrated on the Lynx {{in order to}} perform differing mission profiles. Several operators have equipped their Lynx with BAE Systems' Sea Spray surveillance radar to provide for a surface search capability, which is used in maritime patrol, search and rescue, and other mission profiles. British Army models are equipped with a Marconi Elliot automatic flight control system capable of performing automatic three axes stabilisation. The integration of both avionics and weapons systems is customized upon each Lynx batch to customer specifications and requirements. Most of the installed sensors and avionics are typically integrated with the aircraft's avionics management system (AMS), from {{where they can be}} managed by either pilot; sensors such the optional nose-mounted FLIR can be set up to directly cue the weapon systems. Functions such as navigation and communications are also tied into the AMS, information from these systems are displayed directly to the pilots on interchangeable integrated <b>display</b> <b>units</b> in the cockpit. The Lynx is considerably easier to service and maintain than the AgustaWestland Apache.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual <b>display</b> <b>units</b> as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and map information can be displayed instead of engine readouts, whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems. The other display unit is fitted to the centre console and uses a bi-directional screen to show different images depending on viewing angle (may not be available in the US). This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in the front passenger seat can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example. This system also contains a state-of-the-art multi-camera system from Valeo Vision Systems in Ireland, which allows the driver to see around the vehicle during manoeuvres and which contains multiple overlays and views.|$|E

[...] In January 2013, Boeing delivered the first integrated battle station (IBS) equipped B-1. This replaced several displays with new multi-function color <b>display</b> <b>units,</b> an upgraded central integrated test system, and a newer aircraft performance monitoring computer.

2500|$|<b>Display</b> <b>units</b> (CRT, LCD, LED monitors), {{processors}} (CPU, GPU, or APU chips), memory (DRAM or SRAM), {{and audio}} components have different useful lives. [...] Processors {{are most frequently}} out-dated (by software no longer being optimized) {{and are more likely}} to become [...] "e-waste" [...] while <b>display</b> <b>units</b> are most often replaced while working without repair attempts, due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology. This problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or Phonebloks. These types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly. Being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce e-waste.|$|E

Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: Sharp introduced the CS-10A, which weighed [...] and cost 500,000 yen ($), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and <b>display</b> <b>units</b> could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).|$|E

40|$|Local <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> {{functions}} as a user interface of the protection relay. It is therefore an indispensable part of the relay, used for monitoring and controlling of the relay and,consequently, of certain power grid elements. Local <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> is composed of two parts: a standalone peripheral <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> (the master device), and a software driver (the slave) running on the protection relay control unit. The thesis describes a software driver which is incorporated into the existing architecture of the 'rcman' information-communication system, and runs on the protection relay. The software driver communicates with the master device using the Modbus protocol over an RS- 232 interface. The two key requirements to be met in preparation of the thesis were a high data throughput, on one hand, and a simple extensibility of the driver on the other hand. During the initial development phase it was established that the implemented subset of Modbus functions is not sufficient for communication between the driver and the peripheral <b>display</b> <b>unit.</b> Therefore,certain Modbus functions had to be modified {{at the expense of}} losing their compatibility with the standard Modbus protocol. The result is a working software driver that meets the above mentioned requirements and provides the peripheral <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> with the data describing alarms, events, analogue measurements,LED indications, and the status of digital input lines. ...|$|R
