5|$|The {{club was}} founded on 16 October 1878 as an amateur side known as Ipswich A.F.C., under the {{presidency}} of local MP Thomas Cobbold who had played football at Charterhouse School. George S Sherrington & J. M. Franks were elected joint Captains. Ipswich A.F.C.'s first match was a 6–1 home victory over Stoke Wanderers at the Broom Hill ground on 2 November 1878. This {{was followed by a}} 2–0 victory over Harwich in the club's first away match. Losing only one game in 17 in its second season, the club was able to build enough interest to enrol players for a second team. Ipswich recorded their biggest ever victory during the 1880–81 season, a 15–0 defeat of East Stamford with one player, John Knights, registering a treble hat trick; both achievements remain club records. The team moved to Portman Road, the current ground, in 1884, and would share, until 1936, the facilities with the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The Cobbold <b>family</b> <b>involvement</b> continued when, in 1885, Nathanael Fromanteel Cobbold was elected as a vice-president of the club. Following his sudden death the following year, the position was then held by his nephew John Dupuis Cobbold.|$|E

25|$|Some {{believe that}} those who have a high degree of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is <b>family</b> <b>involvement</b> where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.|$|E

He held out for 17 days before signing a five-year {{contract}} with the team. The terms included a $2.3 million signing bonus and escalating base salaries totaling over $2.9 million. [...] The negotiations were prolonged in part because of extensive <b>family</b> <b>involvement.</b> [...] Wheatley set no goals for himself and lived by his grandmother's motto on preparing oneself: [...] "You can set your sails, but you can't set the wind". [...] The Giants viewed Wheatley as their running back of the future, since Rodney Hampton was in the final year of his contract.|$|E
500|$|An {{evaluation}} of an individual's abilities, limitations and communication needs {{is necessary to}} select appropriate AAC techniques. The purpose of the assessment is to identify potential AAC approaches that can bridge discrepancies between a potential user's current communication and their present and future communication needs. AAC evaluations are often conducted by specialized teams which may include a speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, rehabilitation engineer, physiotherapist, social worker and a physician. Users, family members and teachers are also {{key members of the}} decision making team. Sensitivity to and respect of cultural diversity contributes to ongoing <b>family</b> <b>involvement</b> and to the selection of the most appropriate AAC system. [...] For members of some cultural groups the presence of an AAC device increases the visibility of disability and is thus viewed as stigmatizing.|$|E

2500|$|Redmond's family {{heritage}} {{was more}} complex than that of most of his nationalist political colleagues. His mother came from a Protestant and unionist family; although she had converted to Catholicism on marriage, she never converted to nationalism. His uncle General John Patrick Redmond, who had inherited the family estate, was created CB for his role during the Indian mutiny; he disapproved of his nephew's involvement in agrarian agitation of the 1880s.

2500|$|One funeral {{industry}} professional of 40 {{years experience}} lauded {{the goal of}} greater <b>family</b> <b>involvement</b> in funerals, but said it was [...] "virtually impossible" [...] for many families today to return to preparing bodies themselves or hosting wakes in their own homes, citing the challenges of moving a body themselves, or dealing with a body that had been autopsied, or, especially, the innate fear of contact with the dead, {{which he did not}} think would [...] "ever change". Doughty says her 'dream funeral' is one where the family is involved, washing and dressing the body and keeping it at home. When they've taken the time they need with the dead person, transporting the person to a natural burial cemetery and putting them straight into the ground, no heavy sealed casket or vault. Just food for worms.|$|E

Costello wanted to increase the <b>family</b> <b>involvement</b> in lucrative financial schemes; he was less interested in low grossing criminal activities that relied on brutality and intimidation. Costello believed in diplomacy and discipline, and in diversifying family interests. Nicknamed [...] "The Prime Minister of the Underworld", Costello controlled much of the New York waterfront and had tremendous political connections. It was said that no state judge could be appointed in any case without Costello's consent. [...] During the 1940s, Costello allowed Luciano associates Meyer Lansky and Benjamin [...] "Bugsy" [...] Siegel to expand the family business in Southern California and build the first modern casino resort in Las Vegas. When Siegel failed to open the resort on time, his mob investors allegedly sanctioned his murder.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Chalmers was a Scottish {{immigrant}} to America {{who came}} to the U.S. about 1842. By 1844 he was at Chicago, Illinois and had found work with P.W.
