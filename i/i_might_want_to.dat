60|$|It {{had been}} my {{intention}} before this {{to remain in the}} West, even if I was made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw the situation it was plain that here was the point for the commanding general to be. No one else could, probably, resist the pressure that would be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans and pursue others. I determined, therefore, before I started back to have Sherman advanced to my late position, McPherson to Sherman's in command of the department, and Logan to the command of McPherson's corps. These changes were all made on my recommendation and without hesitation. My commission as lieutenant-general was given to me on the 9th of March, 1864. On the following day, as already stated, I visited General Meade, commanding the Army of the Potomac, at his headquarters at Brandy Station, north of the Rapidan. I had known General Meade slightly in the Mexican war, but had not met him since until this visit. I was a stranger to most of the Army of the Potomac, I might say to all except the officers of the regular army who had served in the Mexican war. There had been some changes ordered in the organization of that army before my promotion. One was the consolidation of five corps into three, thus throwing some officers of rank out of important commands. Meade evidently thought that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make still one more change not yet ordered. He said to me that I might want an officer who had served with me in the West, mentioning Sherman specially, to take his place. If so, he begged me not to hesitate about making the change. He urged that the work before us was of such vast importance to the whole nation that the feeling or wishes of no one person should {{stand in the way of}} selecting the right men for all positions. For himself, he would serve to the best of his ability wherever placed. I assured him that I had no thought of substituting any one for him. As to Sherman, he could not be spared from the West.|$|E

Despite the significant number of transracial Aboriginal adoptions that haven taken place in Canada, little research is available that addresses the psychological and psychosocial ramifications for the children involved. The scant literature that does exist raises concerns about the psychological impact of this type of adoption. The present research used narrative inquiry to bring greater understanding to the experiences of Aboriginal children raised in nonAboriginal families. The life stories of four Aboriginal adults were gathered through audio-taped interviews. Seven “narrative threads” were found to run across the four participants’ life stories: disconnection, passing, diversion, connection, surpassing, reconnection, and identity coherence...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} Web search, as {{traditionally}} formulated, {{has a very}} “pure” motivation: it seeks to take the content people produce on the Web and find the pages that are most relevant, useful, or authoritative for any given query. However, {{it soon became clear}} that a lucrative market existed alongside this for combining search with advertising, targeted to the queries that users were issuing. The basic idea behind this is simple. Early Web advertising was sold on the basis of “impressions, ” by analogy with the print ads one sees in newspapers or magazines: a company like Yahoo! would negotiate a rate with an advertiser, agreeing on a price for showing its ad a fixed number of times. But suppose I’m a very small retailer who’s trying to sell a specialized product; say, for example, that I run a business that sells calligraphy pens over the Web. Then paying to display ads to the full Internet-using population seems like a very inefficient way to find customers; instead, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work out an agreement with a search engine that said, “Show my ad to any user who enters the query ‘calligraphy pens. ”’ After all, search engine queries are a potent way to get users to express their intent — what it is that they’re interested in at the moment they issue their query — and an ad that i...|$|E

For years, my daughter told people that the greatest threat to Western civilization was her father at a podium without a red light. Before becoming Solicitor General, I spent my career as a trial lawyer, arguing only a few appeals. I found this red light tradition a little peculiar.

40|$|ABSTRACT. It {{is argued}} {{that there is no}} agreed {{definition}} of disease. Purely biological definitions are inadequate and combined biological and social defini-tions are not yet satisfactory. One approach has been to say that what doctors treat is disease. We are uncomfortable with that because we feel it releases people from obligations on a basis of convenience. In practice the weight given to the idea of disease varies according to what it will imply about obligations and privileges. It is suggested that what doctors treat can be accepted as disease provided that we recognize that the significance of disease must vary with circumstances. Those circumstances include the agreement, more or less, of all persons affected when someone {{is considered to be a}} patient. The individual must also be competent and not constrained except by his own biological or psychological characteristics. Key Words: disease, patient-physician relationship, obligation. <b>I.</b> WHY WE <b>MIGHT</b> <b>WANT</b> <b>TO</b> DEFINE DISEASE The Country Wife by William Wycherley is one of the two or three most famous restoration comedies and still a popular play. Its plot turns on the deception practiced by a man who persuades his doctor to put it about that he has become impotent, so that his acquaintances trust him with rather ready access to their wives and daughters. A cynical friend commented on this play that it showed that one could get away with anything with the help of a doctor's note. Other possibilities of this sort, albeit perhaps less exciting, spring readily to mind.
