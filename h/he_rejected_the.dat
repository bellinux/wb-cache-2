5|$|According to Moubayed, Atrash's anti-government {{activities}} significantly {{contributed to}} Shishakli's resignation and departure from Syria in February 1954 amid the countrywide unrest. In the first post-Shishakli democratic election later that year, Atrash {{was elected to}} parliament. Atrash was offered a cabinet position in Said al-Ghazzi's September 1955 government, but <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> offer because of the Ba'ath Party's opposition to the government's makeup.|$|E
5|$|His new {{alphabet}} closely resembled an 1853 {{publication of}} Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored {{with the original}} Deseret alphabet, and so <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote the alphabet {{as part of his}} job despite his reservations.|$|E
5|$|Mulla Sadra (c. 1571/2 – 1640) was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher who was {{influenced}} by earlier Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna and Suhrawardi, {{as well as the}} Sufi metaphysician Ibn 'Arabi. Sadra discussed Avicenna's arguments for the existence of God, claiming that they were not a priori. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> argument on the basis that existence precedes essence, or that the existence of human beings is more fundamental than their essence.|$|E

5|$|Castro {{proclaimed the}} new {{administration}} a direct democracy, in which Cubans could assemble at demonstrations to express their democratic will. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio-economic elites. U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties, {{and the absence of}} freedom of speech and press.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

According to Schweitzer, [...] "The world should be divided between rationalists and 'arationalists.|$|R
5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E

He had a trial spell at Derry City before quitting football {{at the age of}} 32.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations {{on the basis of}} accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E

5|$|When the Manhattan Project assumed {{responsibility}} {{for the development of}} nuclear weapons in September 1942, it also assumed {{responsibility for}} the development of suitable countermeasures. At the time, the threat posed by the German nuclear energy project was taken very seriously. Consideration was given to issuing a public warning of the danger of a German nuclear attack on the United States, but the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., considered the likelihood of this to be sufficiently remote that <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> notion of taking so drastic a step.|$|E
5|$|Botha, who {{had been}} asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make {{policies}} and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to be unfair to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention {{in a way that}} Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.|$|E
5|$|Despite Spielberg's rejection, {{the studio}} {{went ahead with}} plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month {{pre-production}} process. Howard Sackler, who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a prequel based on {{the sinking of the}} USS Indianapolis, the story relayed by Quint in the first film. Although Universal president Sidney Sheinberg thought Sackler's treatment for the film was intriguing, <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> idea. On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director John D. Hancock was chosen to helm the picture. Sackler later felt betrayed when Dorothy Tristan, Hancock's wife, was invited to rewrite his script.|$|E

5|$|Francis Marrash {{was born}} in Aleppo, a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their {{literary}} interests. Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in Aleppo, although they had gone through troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818. Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash. Francis' father, Fathallah, tried to defuse the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> Filioque. He had built up a large private library to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly {{in the field of}} Arabic language and literature.|$|E
5|$|In October 1956, Sunderland manager Bill Murray bought Revie for a £22,000 fee. Poor results {{left the}} Black Cats facing relegation {{towards the end}} of the 1956–57 campaign, but a late seven-game unbeaten run lifted them to safety, just one place above relegated Cardiff City. A {{financial}} scandal over illegal payments to players resulted in harsh sanctions at Roker Park from The Football Association and forced Murray's resignation. His replacement, Alan Brown, preferred a more physical style of play that did not suit Revie. Sunderland suffered relegation from the First Division for the first time in the club's history in the 1957–58 season, and Revie was dropped for the 1958–59 Second Division campaign in favour of a youth policy. In September 1958, <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to sign for hometown club Middlesbrough – had he joined the club then he would have played alongside captain Brian Clough and goalkeeper Peter Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Moreno {{was born}} in Buenos Aires in 1778. His father was Manuel Moreno y Argumosa, born in Santander, Spain, who arrived in the city in 1776 and married María del Valle. Mariano was the firstborn of the Moreno family, and had {{thirteen}} brothers. During his youth he studied Latin, logic, and philosophy at San Carlos Royal College, followed by college studies of law at Chuquisaca. During these studies, he learned the new ideas of the Spanish Enlightenment. He married María Guadalupe Cuenca and returned to Buenos Aires, becoming a prominent lawyer for the Cabildo. Unlike most other criollos, <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> Carlotist project and the administration of Santiago de Liniers, joining instead the ill-fated mutiny of Álzaga against him. He worked for the next viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. He wrote the economic paper The Representation of the Landowners, which persuaded the viceroy to open trade with Britain.|$|E

5|$|Octavius was {{studying}} and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria, when Julius Caesar {{was killed on}} the Ides of March (15 March) 44BC. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security. Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law, and so had adopted Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir. Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though Suetonius describes Antony's accusation as political slander. After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium, Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company {{had won a}} {{significant}} victory, but now had 23 wounded and was very low on ammunition. Frazier landed on the newly captured airstrip in his Piper Cub at 12:30. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> airstrip as unsuitable for Dakotas, and oversaw the preparation of a new airstrip on better ground near Mission Hill. This was still a difficult approach, as aircraft had to land upwind while avoiding Mission Hill. Although it was not known if the airstrip would be ready, Hutchison flew in for a test landing there the next day, 21 September, at 15:30. He collected the wounded and flew them to Nadzab, and returned an hour later with a load of rations and ammunition. He also brought with him Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, {{the commander of the}} 21st Infantry Brigade, and his headquarters, who took charge of the area. Around 18:00, six more transports arrived.|$|E
5|$|The operas in the Bayreuth canon are {{the last}} ten of the {{thirteen}} that Wagner completed. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> first three – Die Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi – as apprentice works. Although these have been staged elsewhere and Rienzi was very popular into the early 20th century, the works in the canon exceed them, both {{in the number of}} performances given and in the number of available recordings. The term Bayreuth canon is therefore sometimes taken to mean the composer's mature operas. Georg Solti was the first conductor to complete studio recordings of all the works in the canon, starting in 1958 with Das Rheingold and finishing in 1986 with Lohengrin.|$|E
