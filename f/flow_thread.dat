The Green-Lagrange strain tensor is determined from the measurements obtained. The deviator stress tensor is calculated by using the constitutive law of the work material.

At 20 - 30 Re, the disappearance of the center of the plasma sheet and the appearance of tailward <b>flows</b> <b>threaded</b> with southward fields strongly suggest reconnection occurs earthward of this distance. Recent AMPTE/CCE and DMSP observations suggest that current disruption begins near synchronous orbit on closed field lines and expands tailward.

To counter these reports we present magnetic field and plasma data from substonns observed on an outbound pass by ISEE- 2. We show that the tail field responds in the manner predicted by the near-earth neutral line (NENL) model, growing in strength and tilting earthward in the growth phase, and decreasing and tilting upward in the expansion phase.

In the cylindrical coordinates (r, φ,z), We write the 1. 5 dimensional, the steady state (∂/∂ t= 0) and axisymmetric (∂/∂φ= 0) inflow-outflow equations by using the self similar solutions. Also a model for radiation pressure supported accretion <b>flow</b> <b>threaded</b> by both toroidal and vertical components of magnetic field has been formulated. For studying the outflows, we adopt a radius dependent mass accretion rate as Ṁ=Ṁ_out(r/r_out) ^s+ 1 / 2 with s= 1 / 2. Also by following the previous works, we have considered the interchange of mass, radial and angular momentum and the energy between inflow and outflow. we have found numerically that two components of magnetic field have the opposite effects on the thickness of the disc and similar effects on the radial and angular velocities of the flow. We have found that the existence of the toroidal component of magnetic field will lead to increasing of radial and azimuthal velocities as well as the relative thickness of the disc, which is increased. Moreover, the thickness of the disc will decrease when the vertical component of magnetic field becomes important in magnetized flow. The solutions indicated that the mass inflow rate, the specific energy of outflow affect strongly on the advection parameter. We have shown that by increasing the two components of magnetic field, the temperature of the accretion flow will decrease significantly. On the other hand we have shown the bolometric luminosity of the slim discs for high values of ṁ (ṁ>> 1) is not sensitive to mass accretion rate and is kept constant (L ≈ 10 L_E).

We investigate standing kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in <b>flowing</b> prominence <b>threads</b> from a theoretical point of view. We model a prominence fine structure as a cylindrical magnetic tube embedded in the solar corona with its ends line-tied in the photosphere. The magnetic cylinder is composed of a region with dense prominence plasma, which is flowing along the magnetic tube, whereas {{the rest of the}} flux tube is occupied by coronal plasma. We use the WKB approximation to obtain analytical expressions for the period and the amplitude of the fundamental mode as functions of the flow velocity. In addition, we solve the full problem numerically by means of time-dependent simulations. We find that both the period and the amplitude of the standing MHD waves vary in time as the prominence <b>thread</b> <b>flows</b> along the magnetic structure. The fundamental kink mode is a good description for the time-dependent evolution of the oscillations, and the analytical expressions in the WKB approximation are in agreement with the full numerical results. The presence of flow modifies the period of the oscillations with respect to the static case. However, for realistic flow velocities this effect might fall within the error bars of the observations. The variation of the amplitude due to the flow leads to apparent damping or amplification of the oscillations, which could modify the real rate of attenuation caused by an additional damping mechanism.

Our approach does not require a full trace of program execution events but is instead based on a straightforward extension to the summary data already collected by an existing profiling tool. In multithreaded applications each thread may define its own independent flow of control, complicating both the recording as well as the visualization of the execution dynamics. Our approach allows for the full flexibility with respect to independent threads.

40|$|Transverse {{oscillations}} of thin threads {{in solar}} prominences are frequently reported in high-resolution observations. Two typical {{features of the}} observations are that the oscillations are damped in time and that simultaneous mass <b>flows</b> along the <b>threads</b> are detected. <b>Flows</b> cause the dense threads to move along the prominence magnetic structure while the threads are oscillating. The oscillations have been interpreted in terms of standing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves of the magnetic flux tubes which support the threads. The damping is most likely due to resonant absorption caused by plasma inhomogeneity. The technique of seismology uses the observations combined with MHD wave theory to estimate prominence physical parameters. This paper presents a theoretical study of the joint effect of flow and resonant absorption on the amplitude of standing kink waves in prominence threads. We find that flow and resonant absorption can either be competing effects on the amplitude or both can contribute to damp the oscillations depending on the instantaneous position of the thread within the prominence magnetic structure. The amplitude profile deviates from the classic exponential profile of resonantly damped kink waves in static flux tubes. Flow also introduces a progressive shift of the oscillation period compared to the static case, although this effect is in general of minor importance. We test the robustness of seismological estimates by using synthetic data aiming to mimic real observations. The effect of the <b>thread</b> <b>flow</b> can significantly affect the estimation of the transverse inhomogeneity length scale. The presence of random background noise adds uncertainty to this estimation. Caution needs {{to be paid to}} the seismological estimates that do not take the influence of flow into account.
