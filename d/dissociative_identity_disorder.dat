The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E

40|$|Dissociation can {{be defined}} as the failure to {{integrate}} experience. Dissociation is a common symptom of a spectrum of severe psychopathologies, from reactive attachment disorder of infants to <b>dissociative</b> <b>identity</b> <b>disorders,</b> psychotic experiences, borderline personality disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders of adults. The incidence of abuse in the childhood histories of adults with dissociative disorders is extremely high. The adaptational value of dissociation is that it allows survival in catastrophic events. The disadvantage is that when dissociation occurs frequently, the development of neural networks is impaired. Especially disadvantageous are problems which develop with a) higher circuit control over lower circuits, b) primitive parasympathetic regulation by the dorsal motor nucleus, c) memory, d) left hemisphere, e) integration of bodily sensations, f) sense of self, and g) affect and motivation. These aspects are discussed in more detail. The clinician's primary function is as an affect regulator and therapy should focus on integration...|$|R
5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's baby, {{who has been}} identified as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes <b>dissociative</b> <b>identity</b> <b>disorder</b> (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E

During the arrest and trial, Eve and Julian grow closer together and T. C. ends his relationship with Liz to reconcile with his ex-wife. Julian makes a deal with Rebecca that he would give her anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison; the judge declares a mistrial. The plot then focuses on Eve's love triangle with T. C. and Julian as she is torn between taking care of T. C. after his stroke and accepting Julian's proposal of marriage. Eve discovers Julian's affair with Valerie Davis, an employee of Crane Industries, leading to her decision to nurse T. C. back to health and renew their relationship to reunite their family. Julian later explains to Eve that he was paying Valerie to search for their son; Eve forgives Valerie, and she and Julian continue their search. In 2007, Eve and Julian discover that Vincent Clarkson (a blackmailer who raped and murdered several people) is their son, and try to support him despite his criminal past. However, Eve cannot accept her son's criminality and incestuous, adulterous affair with Chad Harris-Crane (Vincent's uncle, adoptive cousin and brother-in-law) and begins abusing drugs and alcohol. Her career and reputation suffer, {{and she has a}} breakdown after Vincent's apparent death on August 30, 2007.

40|$|Dissociative {{disorders}} are frequent and clinically relevant conditions in psychiatric populations. Yet, their recognition in clinical practice is often poor. This study evaluated {{the performance of}} three well known and internationally used dissociation scales in screening for dissociative disorders. Consecutively treated out- and day care-patients (n[*]=[*] 160) from several psychiatric units in Switzerland completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ- 20), and Multidimensional Inventory for Dissociation (MID). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders-Revised (SCID-D-R) was then administered. Test performance of the scales was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves. The diagnostic accuracy, represented by the area under the curve, {{did not differ significantly}} between the three summary scales. Cut-off scores for detecting at least 80 % of any dissociative <b>disorder</b> and <b>dissociative</b> disorder-not-otherwise-specified/dissociative <b>identity</b> <b>disorder,</b> respectively, were 12 and 20 for the DES, 30 and 33 for the SDQ- 20, and 28 and 28 for the MID summary scale. The diagnostic accuracy of the DES subscale ‘absorption’ and the MID subscale ‘somatic symptoms’ was equal or slightly lower than the corresponding summary scale. The DES, SDQ- 20, and MID summary scales are suitable in screening for dissociative disorders in general psychiatric out- and day care-patients. Adequate cut-off scores in the German-adapted DES are lower than in non-German versions. Screening with the DES subscale ‘absorption’ and the MID subscale ‘somatic symptoms’ could be more efficient without the loss of diagnostic accuracy...|$|R

The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with Napoleon Bonaparte {{to the point where he}} sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with <b>dissociative</b> <b>identity</b> <b>disorder,</b> Dorval does not actually imagine his life has become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level. Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see his take on life as a manifestation of genius. The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one. At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of capitalism, and, using Parisian argot, makes allusive references to famous people of the day.|$|E

25|$|Another typical {{disorder}} where {{auditory hallucinations}} are very common is <b>dissociative</b> <b>identity</b> <b>disorder.</b> In schizophrenia voices are normally perceived coming {{from outside the}} person but in dissociative disorders they are perceived as originating from within the person, commenting in their head not behind their back. Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and dissociative disorders is challenging due to many overlapping symptoms especially Schneiderian first rank symptoms such as hallucinations. However, many people not suffering from diagnosable mental illness may sometimes hear voices as well. One important example to consider when forming a differential diagnosis for a patient with paracusia is lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite the tendency to associate hearing voices, or otherwise hallucinating, and psychosis with schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, {{it is crucial to}} take into consideration that, even if a person does exhibit psychotic features, he/she does not necessarily suffer from a psychiatric disorder on its own. Disorders such as Wilson's disease, various endocrine diseases, numerous metabolic disturbances, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, sarcoidosis, and many others can present with psychosis.|$|E
