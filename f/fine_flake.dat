Based on the high-resolution 3 D X-ray computed tomography, the 3 D characteristics of Fe-rich intermetallics and micropores in the gravity-cast Al- 6 Si alloys with different Fe contents were investigated. In addition, the effect of intermetallics on the microporosity was discussed. The results show that with increasing the Fe content from 0. 10 wt. % to 0. 60 wt. %, the volume fraction of Fe-rich intermetallics and {{the volume of the}} largest size Fe-rich intermetallic increased, and the 3 D morphology of intermetallics changed from <b>fine</b> <b>flake</b> to network aggregation.

AZ 91 scraps would be immersed in 50 &# 730;C carbonate aqueous solution, continuously stirring 3 h, the GAXRD analysis showed the surface of scraps had grown Mg,Al hydrotalcite film with intercalated carbonate ions. The Mg,Al hydrotalcite scraps were calcined at 450 &# 730;C, then absorbed chlorine and fluorine ions in aqueous solution respectively. The Al,Li hydrotalcite in-situ grown on Mg,Al hydrotalcite scraps, that could directly absorbed fluorine ions. The Mg,Al hydrotalcite scraps were immersed in the acid 3. 5 wt. % NaCl aqueous solution, its intercalated ion become chlorine ion, then named Mg,Al(Cl-) hydrotalcite. In the experiment of absorption of fluorine ion, three kinds of treatment of hydrotalcite scraps which Mg,Al(Cl-) hydrotalcite scraps absorption capacity of the best, and 3. 7 times of Al,Li/Mg,Al hydrotalcite scraps, and slightly better than the calcined Mg,Al hydrotalcite scraps. The Mg,Al hydrotalcite scraps continuously stirred in aqueous solution, due to the hydrotalcite film disintegration could be obtained powders, all of the powders had the composition of Mg,Al hydrotalcite structure through XRD analysis measured. By field emission scanning electron microscope, the powder showed the shape of hydrotalcite, but the powder by longer stirring, that hydrotalcite flake becomes smaller. The FTIR analysis of all powder showed that interlayer carbonate ions located at low symmetry C 2 v location. The FTIR results revealed the main structure of the powder was Mg 3 Al hydrotalcite between initial and intermediate stirring stage, in this stage the original hydrotalcite film disintegrated then made. At the post stage main structure of the powder was Mg 2 Al hydrotalcite that created by continuously generated the new film via stirring process. 摘要……………………………………………………………………i ABSTRACT……………………………………………………………ii 總目錄…………………………………………………………………iv 表目錄…………………………………………………………………vi 圖目錄…………………………………………………………………vii 第一章 前 言…………………………………………………………… 1 1. 1. 鎂合金切削屑……………………………………………………… 1 1. 2.

To some she is an early Neolithic woman and to others a Pre-Neolithic one, with the Neolithic starting at either 6500 or 6000 accordingly.

40|$|In {{the study}} a novel method for {{synthesis}} {{of a dark}} magnetic flake powder for detecting latent fingerprint has been developed. Even though, flake powders,of aluminium, brass and highly reflective magnetic iron flake are already in use in crime scenes, it is highly desirable to develop a suitable darker variety of magnetic flake powder for print development on light background surfaces. In order to achieve rapid production of dark metal flakes, a new high energy prototype vibratory mill has been designed, manufactured and develo ed. The design concepts were developed following {{a comprehensive review of}} the various commercially available milling devices and undertaking some initial experimentation. The mechanical milling process which results in changing the particle morphology of starting atomised iron powder to flaky shaped powder was investigated in terms of different milling phases like micro forging, fracture and agglomeration. The effect of milling process parameters on the flake quality was investigated. It was shown that the amount of stearic acid content, ball packing fraction and weight loading were important parameters in determining the final flake qualities. The quality of latent fingerprint development with the dark flake powder was investigated. Some of the flake powders produced excellent ridge quality details with good adherence quality on a range of background surfaces. The present study has been able to establish the relationship between the visual characteristics (dark) and adherence property of the flake fingerprint powder with respect to the particle dimensions and surface characteristics of the flakes. It was also found that <b>finer</b> <b>flakes</b> are darker in colour and the low weight percentage of stearic acid has produced the best adherence quality for the dark flake powder. Some unique relationship between the flake dimensions with the nature of the print deposit was also established as it was found that slightly coarser flakes are suitable for heavy print deposit whereas <b>finer</b> <b>flakes</b> are more sensitive to aged prints. Further, the role of process variables in influencing the milling process were established such that optimum conditions by vibration milling can be determined to obtain dark flakes of desired quality. While the weight loading significantly influenced the milling behaviour of the powder, the role of stearic acid as an additive was found to influence the surface quality of flakes, besides restricting particle welding. Increasing the pre determined theoretical ball size does not result in faster milling, but increasing the ball packing fraction from 50...|$|R
5000|$|The Mount William Aboriginal stone axe quarry {{comprises}} {{the remains of}} hundreds of mining pits and the mounds of waste rock where Aboriginal people obtained greenstone (diabase), and manufactured stone blanks for axe heads.

The absence of the sun's rays alone left a sense of chilling cold, and a few hours of night were certain to bring frost, even at midsummer. Thus it is that storms of trifling import in themselves gain power over the human frame, by its reduced means of resistance, and when to this fact is added the knowledge that the elements are far fiercer in their workings in the upper than in the nether regions of the earth, the motives of Pierre's concern will be better understood by the reader than they probably wese by himself, though the honest guide had a long and severe experience to supply the place of theory.|$|R
