25|$|The {{steam power}} plant gets its input heat from the high {{temperature}} exhaust gases from gas turbine power plant. The steam generated thus {{can be used to}} drive steam turbine. The Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) has 3 sections: <b>Economiser,</b> evaporator and superheater.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{recovery}} boiler is item 5 in the COGAS figure shown above. No combustion of fuel {{means that there}} is no need of a fuel handling plant, and it is simply a heat exchanger. Exhaust enters in super heater and the evaporator and then in to <b>economiser</b> section as it flows out from the boiler.|$|E
25|$|Steam power came to {{the mill}} in three major {{building}} phases. In 1865 a beam engine house was built, together with a boiler house and the first chimney on the site. In the 1890s a second beam engine arrived, the boiler house was extended and the existing chimney built, and then in 1910 the existing horizontal engine was fitted, the Green's <b>economiser</b> house added and the boiler house extended again.|$|E

25|$|Introducing {{cold water}} into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for {{locomotives}} was the exhaust steam feedwater heater that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted {{on top of the}} boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary steam pump. The rare <b>economiser</b> type differed in that it extracted residual heat from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the pre-heater drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.|$|E
500|$|The South station {{had five}} {{generating}} sets and the North station had four. Each generating set had a bunker for 1,250 tonnes of coal, fed by a conveyor from the coal store. This conveyor belt system {{was built by}} E.N. Mackley & Co, Gateshead. Each bunker fed coal into a pulveriser, manufactured by Raymond. From here it was fed into a boiler in powder form and burned. All of the boilers were suspended from the boiler houses' steel frames, and were made by Clarke Chapman Group Ltd, Gateshead. The boilers were forged in Sheffield, {{the first of the}} nine arriving at Stella South in 1953. At 62tonnes, the boilers were at the time the largest ever made in the UK. The boilers were of the radiant-heat type, comprising a water-cooled combustion chamber, controlled-type superheater and an <b>economiser.</b> Each of the boilers had an evaporation rating of 550 kL/h, a steam pressure of 950 psi and a steam temperature of 925°F. Each boiler was equipped with two forced and two induced Howden fans, twenty-two electrically operated Clyde soot blowers, an automatic control system made by Bailey and Sturtevant electrostatic precipitators. [...] Each station was designed to burn 2,000 tonnes of bituminous coal a day.|$|E

50|$|In the station's {{boiler house}} were eight Lancashire boilers, each 30 ftlong and 8 ft in diameter. They were fitted with <b>economisers</b> and natural draught, {{working at a}} {{pressure}} of 160 psi. Flue gasses from the boilers were discharged through a 177 ft tall brick built chimney.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, {{the firm}} of Henschel rebuilt {{locomotives}} 52 893 and 52 894 with Franco-Crosti <b>economisers</b> (Abgasvorwärmer). Because of the resulting higher axle load, the engines were classified by the Deutsche Bundesbahn as Class 42.90 locomotives and given the operating numbers 42 9000 and 42 9001.|$|R
2500|$|The Stirling engine (or Stirling's {{air engine}} {{as it was}} known at the time) was invented and {{patented}} in 1816. It followed earlier attempts at making an air engine but was probably the first put to practical use when, in 1818, an engine built by Stirling was employed pumping water in a quarry. The main subject of Stirling's original patent was a heat exchanger, which he called an [...] "economiser" [...] for its enhancement of fuel economy {{in a variety of}} applications. The patent also described in detail the employment of one form of the <b>economiser</b> in his unique closed-cycle air engine design in which application it is now generally known as a [...] "regenerator". Subsequent development by Robert Stirling and his brother James, an engineer, resulted in patents for various improved configurations of the original engine including pressurization, which by 1843, had sufficiently increased power output to drive all the machinery at a Dundee iron foundry.|$|E
60|$|We {{have been}} {{considering}} {{the position of}} those who would fain divide the community into two great castes; the one of thoughtful and instructed persons using their minds freely, but guarding their conclusions in strict reserve; the other of the illiterate or unreflecting, who should have certain opinions and practices taught them, not because they are true or are really what their votaries are made to believe them to be, but because the intellectual superiors of the community think the inculcation of such a belief useful in all cases save their own. Nor is this a mere theory. On the contrary, it is a fair description of an existing state of things. We have the old disciplina arcani among us in as full force as in the primitive church, but with an all-important difference. The Christian fathers practised reserve for the sake of leading the acolyte the more surely to the fulness of truth. The modern <b>economiser</b> keeps back his opinions, or dissembles the grounds of them, for the sake of leaving his neighbours the more at their ease in the peaceful sloughs of prejudice and superstition and low ideals. We quote Saint Paul when he talked of making himself all things to all men, and of becoming to the Jews a Jew, and as without the Law to the heathen. But then we do so with a view to justifying ourselves for leaving the Jew to remain a Jew, and the heathen to remain heathen. We imitate the same apostle in accepting old time-worn altars dedicated to the Unknown God. We forget that he made the ancient symbol the starting-point of a revolutionised doctrine. There is, as anybody can see, a whole world of difference between the reserve of sagacious apostleship, on the one hand, dealing tenderly with scruple and tearfulness and fine sensibility of conscience, and the reserve of intellectual cowardice on the other hand, dealing hypocritically with narrow minds in the supposed interests of social peace and quietness. The old disciplina arcani signified the disclosure of a little light with a view to the disclosure of more. The new means the dissimulation of truth with a view to the perpetuation of error. Consider the difference between these two fashions of compromise, in their effects upon the mind and character of the person compromising. The one is fully compatible with fervour and hopefulness and devotion to great causes. The other stamps a man with artifice, and hinders the free eagerness of his vision, and wraps him about with mediocrity,--not always of understanding, but that still worse thing, mediocrity of aspiration and purpose.|$|E
50|$|The <b>economiser</b> is {{a crucial}} {{component}} for efficient performance of a thermal power plant. It is a non-steaming type of heat exchanger which {{is placed in the}} convective zone of the furnace. It takes the heat energy of the flue gases for heating the feed water before it enters the boiler drum. The thermal efficiency/boiler efficiency largely depends on the performance of the <b>economiser.</b> CFD analysis helps in optimizing the thermal performance of the <b>economiser</b> by analysing the pressure, velocity and temperature distribution, and to identify the critical areas for further improvement with the result obtained by CFD analysis.|$|E
500|$|The Borodino-class {{ships were}} powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one {{propeller}} shaft, using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers.

50|$|Economizers (US and Oxford spelling), or <b>economisers</b> (UK), are {{mechanical}} devices {{intended to}} reduce energy consumption, or to perform useful function such as preheating a fluid. The term economizer {{is used for}} other purposes as well. Boiler, power plant, heating, Refrigeration, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) uses are discussed in this article. In simple terms, an economizer is a heat exchanger.|$|R
50|$|The main {{pumping plant}} {{consists}} of four Woolf compound, rotative, beam pumping engines. These are arranged in mirror image pairs, in two separate engine houses, with a central boiler house (containing five Lancashire boilers with <b>economisers)</b> and chimney. The engines were built in 1885 by Gimson and Company of Leicester. All the engines are similar, and the following description is limited to only one, but applicable to all.|$|R
5000|$|Ernest Godward - {{inventor}} of the spiral hairpin and the petrol <b>economiser</b> ...|$|E
50|$|He invented what {{he called}} the Heat <b>Economiser</b> (now {{generally}} known as the regenerator), a device for improving the thermal/fuel efficiency of a variety of industrial processes, obtaining a patent for the <b>economiser</b> and an engine incorporating it in 1816. In 1818 he built the first practical version of his engine, used to pump water from a quarry.|$|E
50|$|It {{is likely}} that Robert Stirling's air engine of 1818, which {{incorporated}} his innovative <b>Economiser</b> (patented in 1816) was the first air engine put to practical work. The <b>economiser,</b> {{now known as the}} regenerator, stored heat from the hot portion of the engine as the air passed to the cold side, and released heat to the cooled air as it returned to the hot side. This innovation improved the efficiency of Stirling's engine and should be present in any air engine that is properly called a Stirling engine.|$|E

An external engine shed, behind the <b>economisers</b> and chimney. The water tower is prominent, {{but there are other}} stair towers. All this is placed next to the mill lodge, a reservoir used to provide cooling water for the engines condensor.|$|R
50|$|From {{running number}} 2094 (1921 series) onwards the {{locomotives}} had factory-fitted compressed-air brakes, from running number 2112 (1923 series) the engines were equipped with Knorr feedwater heaters on {{the crown of}} the boiler barrel behind the chimney. Those engines delivered prior to that were all retrofitted with compressed-air brakes and, in most cases, also with surface <b>economisers.</b> The 1908/09 series only rarely had preheaters. Where they were fitted they were located {{to the side of}} the chimney.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{subcooling}} is {{the name}} normally given to the temperature drop produced inside the condenser (condenser subcooling), combined with the temperature drop happening through the pipeline alone, excluding any heat exchangers of any kind. When there is no mechanical subcooling (i.e. an internal heat exchanger), natural subcooling should equal total subcooling. On the other hand, mechanical subcooling is the temperature reduced by any artificial process that is deliberately placed to create subcooling. This concept refers mainly to devices such as internal heat exchangers, independent subcooling cascades, <b>economisers</b> or boosters.|$|R
5000|$|When OT is used, {{conductivity}} after {{cation exchange}} (CACE) at the <b>economiser</b> inlet {{must be maintained}} below 0.15μS/cm [...] this {{can be achieved by}} the use of a condensate polisher.|$|E

50|$|The {{increasingly}} powerful engines {{required more}} boilers with <b>economisers</b> and superheaters. Mills needed reservoirs {{to supply the}} boilers and condense the steam. The chimneys were round and taller. Three types of engines were used: triple expansion horizontal cross compound engines, Inverted marine type compounds which were more compact, and Manhattans with vertical and horizontal cylinders such as the 3500 hp engine at New Pear Mill. Rope drives were used exclusively. Electricity was gradually introduced firstly on group drives driving a shaft (Little Mill, 1908), {{and then later on}} individual machines.|$|R
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} housed three {{coal-fired}} Lancashire boilers, each of 200 HP capacity and each with individual <b>economisers.</b> These boilers provided steam for two 410 kilowatt (kW) and one 150kW direct current Parsons turbo generators. This gave the station a total generating capacity of 970kW. Before {{being used in}} the Lemington power station, these generators had been used in Forth Banks Power Station and in Newburn Steelworks. One of the steam turbines from these sets is now on display at the Electric Power and Historical Museum in Yokohama, Japan, after sitting on display in the entrance to Blyth Power Station for many years.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{constructed}} by W Brealey of Exeter. It was of brick construction and contained a boiler room, engine room, offices, an annexe for <b>economisers,</b> and a 155 ft tall chimney at one end. The boiler room measured 102 ft by 55 ft and {{was lined with}} glazed bricks and had a terrazzo marble floor. Boilers were provided by Babcock & Wilcox and steam engines by Belliss and Morcom. British Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company generating equipment was also installed. Coal feed equipment and additional iron work was designed and built by Willey's, and cabling from the station throughout the city {{was provided by the}} Siemens Brothers of London.|$|R

50|$|Economizers were {{eventually}} fitted to virtually all stationary steam engines {{in the decades}} following Green's invention. Some preserved stationary steam engine sites still have their Green's economisers although usually they are not used. One such preserved site is the Claymills Pumping Engines Trust in Staffordshire, England, {{which is in the}} process of restoring one set of economisers and the associated steam engine which drove them. Another such example is the British Engineerium in Brighton & Hove, where the <b>economiser</b> associated with the boilers for Number 2 Engine is in use, complete with its associated small stationary engine. A third site is Coldharbour Mill Working Wool Museum, where the Green's <b>economiser</b> is in working order, complete with the drive shafts from the Pollit and Wigzell steam engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{slightly}} more successful adoption {{was the use}} of hybrid water-tube / fire-tube systems. As the hottest part of a locomotive boiler is the firebox, it was an effective design to use a water-tube design here and a conventional fire-tube boiler as an <b>economiser</b> (i.e. pre-heater) in the usual position.|$|E

50|$|Various {{turbo-generators}} {{spent time}} working at Forth Banks, and two 410 kW Parsons machines which spent {{time at the}} station were installed in DisCo's Lemington Power Station by 1907. By 1907, some of the original turbo alternators operating at Forth Banks had been discarded and new ones had been added due to rapid developments in the size, power and efficiency of turbo alternators. By then, the station was operating three 500 kW and six 150 kW AC turbo generators, giving a total generating capacity of 2,400 kW. The station's boiler room contained eight Lancashire boilers, each with a capacity of 200HP, and three Green <b>economisers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Designed by Sentetsu, the Mateni {{class was}} {{designed}} for long-distance freight and passenger trains on steep lines; shipments increased with the higher speeds offered by these locomotives. A total of 33 were built from 1943 through 1945, all by Kawasaki. The maximum axle load was 22 tons, {{in comparison to the}} 18 tons of Sentetsu's standard mainline freight locomotives, the Mikasa class, and the tractive effort of the Mateni was 220.2 kN, as compared to the 179.0 kN of the Mikasa class. In addition, the locomotives were equipped with automatic stokers and <b>economisers</b> to improve boiler efficiency. In addition to being used for heavy freight trains, they were also used on passenger trains, and was the last type of locomotive designed by the Chosen Government Railway Bureau.|$|R
