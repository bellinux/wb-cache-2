5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. <b>Emotions</b> <b>were</b> commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Rebirth {{is set in}} a {{world where}} humans (called Huma) and beast people (Gajuma) coexist in {{relative}} peace. The world's magical power is called Force, which manifests in various people as control over an element or aspect of the physical laws. In ancient times, after a war sparked when Huma attempted to enslave Gajuma, both races joined forces to found the kingdom of Karegia. An unspecified time before the events of the game, Geyorkias, the ruler of a spirit race called the Sacred Beasts, sought to destroy the Huma as their dark <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> fueling a primordial destructive force known as Yuris: the other Sacred Beasts put a stop to Geyorkias' plan by sealing him away, then acting to nullify Yuris' threat. The story opens with the death of Karegia's king, Ladras Lindblum, poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan: during his final moments, he releases his power into the world, causing many humans to become possessed by Force, including Veigue, Annie and Tytree. As the king has failed to name a successor, Karegia enters an interregnum at his death.|$|E

5000|$|According to some theories, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> {{universal}} phenomena, albeit {{affected by}} culture. <b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> [...] "internal phenomena that can, {{but do not}} always, make themselves observable through expression and behavior". While some <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> universal and are experienced in similar ways {{as a reaction to}} similar events across all cultures, other emotions show considerable cultural differences in their antecedent events, the way they are experienced, the reactions they provoke and the way they are perceived by the surrounding society. According to other theories, termed social constructionist, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> more deeply culturally influenced.

50|$|<b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> complex. According to some theories, {{they are}} states of feeling {{that result in}} {{physical}} and psychological changes that influence our behavior. The physiology of <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> closely linked to arousal {{of the nervous system}} with various states and strengths of arousal relating, apparently, to particular <b>emotions.</b> <b>Emotion</b> <b>is</b> also linked to behavioral tendency. Extroverted {{people are more likely to}} be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their <b>emotions.</b> <b>Emotion</b> <b>is</b> often the driving force behind motivation, positive or negative. According to other theories, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include motivation, feeling, behavior, and physiological changes, but no one of these components <b>is</b> the <b>emotion.</b> Nor <b>is</b> the <b>emotion</b> an entity that causes these components.|$|R
25|$|In 1991, Rimé et al. {{noted that}} in {{contemporary}} scientific research, <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> considered to be responses to preceding events that are then restrained by self-control and self-restoration. As such, <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> generally regarded as ephemeral and intrapersonal experiences. Rimé also later pointed out that attachment theory rendered emotional regulation to be of an interpersonal nature for children, yet to become mature adults one must become autonomous and capable of regulating emotions independently. In the field of psychology a healthy individual is typically seen as “self-contained, independent and self-reliant, capable of asserting himself and influencing his environment”. Riger also suggests that this individualistic view of emotional regulation could {{have been influenced by}} the context within which it had been studied, i.e. the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this chapter, {{we first}} {{introduce}} {{the idea that}} <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluations. Next, we explore two approaches attempting to account for this idea in terms of attitudes that are alleged to become emotional when taking evaluative contents. According to the first approach, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluative judgments. According to the second, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> perceptual experiences of evaluative properties. We explain why this theory remains unsatisfactory insofar as it shares with the evaluative judgement theory the idea that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluations in virtue of their contents. We then outline an alternative – the attitudinal theory of emotions. It parts with current theorizing about the emotions in elucidating the fact that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> evaluations {{not in terms of}} what they represent, but in terms of the attitude subjects take towards what they represent. We explore what sorts of attitudes <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> and claim that they are felt bodily attitudes...|$|R
50|$|Emotion {{perception}} {{refers to}} the capacities and abilities of recognizing and identifying emotions in others, in addition to biological and physiological processes involved. <b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> typically viewed as having three components: subjective experience, physical changes, and cognitive appraisal; <b>emotion</b> perception <b>is</b> {{the ability to make}} accurate decisions about another's subjective experience by interpreting their physical changes through sensory systems responsible for converting these observed changes into mental representations. The ability to perceive <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> believed to be both innate and subject to environmental influence and is also a critical component in social interactions. How <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> experienced and interpreted depends on how it is perceived. Likewise, how <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> perceived is dependent on past experiences and interpretations. <b>Emotion</b> can <b>be</b> accurately perceived in humans. <b>Emotions</b> can <b>be</b> perceived visually, audibly, through smell and also through bodily sensations and this process is believed to be different from the perception of non-emotional material.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — an <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> {{a mental}} and {{physiological}} state {{associated with a}} wide variety of feelings, thoughts, and behavior. <b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> subjective experiences, or experienced from an individual point of view. <b>Emotion</b> <b>is</b> often associated with mood, temperament, personality, and disposition.

25|$|The Toegye School, {{founded by}} Yi Hwang, {{believed}} that Li (rationality) was absolute, while Qi (material) was relative (this, however, {{does not mean}} that they believed that the Li was in any way superior to the Qi).

25|$|The {{importance}} of these findings is that they contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact {{in an attempt to}} avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> negligible. Feeding was thought {{to be the most important}} factor in the formation of a mother–child bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the mother–child bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of love. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either mother or father. Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love.|$|E
25|$|At {{the first}} {{hearings}} of the Seventh, most listeners wept. This was true even when Shostakovich played the {{piece on the}} piano for friends. The requiem pages of the first movement made a special impression, much as the Largo of his Fifth Symphony had done. Some scholars believe that, {{as he had done}} in the Fifth, Shostakovich gave his audience a chance to express thoughts and suffering that, {{in the context of the}} Great Purges, had remained hidden and accumulated over many years. Because these previously hidden <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> expressed with such power and passion, the Seventh became a major public event. Alexei Tolstoy, who played a pivotal role in the life of the Fifth Symphony, was the first to note the significance of the spontaneous reaction to the Seventh. After hearing an orchestral rehearsal of it, Tolstoy wrote a highly positive review of the work for Pravda.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Are there {{justified}} emotions? Can they justify evaluative judgements? We first {{explain the}} need for an account of justified emotions by emphasizing that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> states for which we have or lack reasons. We then observe that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> explained by their cognitive and motivational bases. Considering cognitive bases first, we argue that an <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> justified if and only if the properties the subject is aware of constitute an instance of the relevant evaluative property. We then investigate the roles of motivational bases. Finally, we argue that justified <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> sufficient for justified evaluative judgement...|$|R

25|$|Similar to the {{problems}} of a restricted educational background, the subjects of the first studies on the social sharing of <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> limited to Belgian and French populations. While later studies conducted in Netherlands, Italy, and Spain produced similar results to the first studies, the question of whether social sharing exists in non-Western cultures. The first intercultural study compared Dutch subjects to Turkish and Surinamese immigrants, and the findings showed that social sharing was a prominent behavior in each group, although slightly less so for the Surinamese subjects. Other studies comparing Western and Eastern cultures produced similar results, finding that Eastern cultures had slightly lower rates of social sharing. Furthermore, several general qualitative differences were found between Western and Eastern populations. On average, Western subjects shared an emotional event more often (5–6 times) than Asian subjects (2–3 times). There was also a longer delay between the emotional event and the social sharing for Asian groups than for Western ones.|$|E

25|$|Thus by the 13th {{century the}} tender joys of the Nativity of Jesus {{were added to}} the agony of his Crucifixion and a whole new range of {{approved}} religious <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> ushered in, with wide ranging cultural impacts for centuries thereafter. The Franciscans approached both ends of this spectrum of emotions. On one hand the introduction of the Nativity scene encouraged the tender image of Jesus, while on the other hand Francis of Assisi himself had a deep attachment to the sufferings of Jesus on the Cross and was said to have received the Stigmata as an expression of that love. The dual nature of Franciscan piety based both on joy of Nativity and the sacrifice at Calvary had a deep appeal among city dwellers and as the Franciscan Friars travelled, these emotions spread across the world, transforming the Kyrios image of Jesus to a more tender, loving, and compassionate image. These traditions did not remain limited to Europe and soon spread to the {{other parts of the world}} such as Latin America, the Philippines and the United States.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all human}} based {{scientific}} experiments there are limitations to what researchers can do. Attempting to study <b>emotions</b> <b>is</b> especially hard since <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> complex {{and can lead}} to subjective response.

Below are two major issues associated with many of the experiments studying emotion that require further explanation.|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} we are passive victims of our <b>emotions,</b> that they <b>are</b> wild and {{uncontrollable}} things which just happen to (or "in") us is very common. Robert Solomon thinks that this idea stems from a faulty philosophical analysis: the analysis that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> a kind of "feeling" or physiological happening. On this analysis, "feelings" and occurrences are externally caused; as such they are non-rational and involuntary, the types {{of things that we}} cannot be held responsible for. In his seminal article "Emotions and Choice. " Solomon opposes this view. He wants to show that we can be held accountable for our emotions, even praised or blamed for having them. To achieve this end, he shows that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> rational events, and hence are importantly conceptual events. Taken to its logical conclusion, Solomon proposes that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> judgments. That explains, in a way in which the traditional view can't explain, why <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> subject to rational control and conscious manipulation, and therefore why we can rightly be held accountable for them. In this thesis I agree with Solomon that the intentionality of <b>emotions</b> cannot <b>be</b> accounted for by a "Components" model. What I don't agree with <b>is</b> that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> inferior judgments. If <b>emotions</b> really <b>are</b> a species of judgment (and I see no reason why the reverse might not be true, that judgments are a kind of emotion), then Solomon has given no adequate reason for his implicit view that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> inferior judgments. When we look more closely at Soloman's view of judgments, we see that he wobbles between a non-componential and a componential analysis. Since it is his thesis that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> importantly non-componential, and that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> judgments, this wobbliness jeopardises Soloman's entire philosophical project. After examining the second half of "Emotions and Choice", I conclude that Soloman's strongest reason for thinking <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> inferior judgments really {{has nothing to do with}} the nature of judgments at all. It is because he is covertly, and maybe unwittingly, holding a view of emotions as self-deceptions...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of emotion researchers reject the feeling theory of emotions; they deny that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> feelings. Some of these researchers admit that emotions have feelings as components, but {{they insist that}} emotions contain other compo-nents as well, such as cognitions. I argue for a qualified version of the feeling theory. I present evidence in support William James’s conjecture that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> perceptions of patterned changes in the body. When such perceptions are conscious, they qualify as feelings. But the bodily perceptions constituting emo-tions can occur unconsciously. When that occurs, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> unfelt. Thus, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> feelings when conscious, {{and they are not}} feelings when uncon-scious. In the end of the paper, I briefly sketch a theory of how emotions and other perceptual states become conscious. According to one strand in folk psychology, <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> feelings; they are phe-nomenally conscious mental episodes. This little morsel of commonsense is a whipping post in philosophy. From the very first philosophical musings about the emotions to the present day it has been popular to insist that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> no...|$|R
