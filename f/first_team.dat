Voting is {{conducted}} by the NBA head coaches; who {{are not allowed to}} vote for players on their own team. The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a <b>first</b> <b>team</b> and a second team. The players each receive two points for each <b>first</b> <b>team</b> vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the <b>first</b> <b>team,</b> with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the <b>first</b> <b>team</b> consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when Kawhi Leonard, Iman Shumpert, and Brandon Knight tied in votes received. No respect is given to positions. For example, the <b>first</b> <b>team</b> had four forwards, and one guard in 2008, while the <b>first</b> <b>team</b> had four centers (two of which were forward-centers) and one guard in 2016.|$|E
