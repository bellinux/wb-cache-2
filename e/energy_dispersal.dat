2500|$|Ambiguities in {{the terms}} {{disorder}} and chaos, which usually have meanings directly opposed to equilibrium, contribute to widespread confusion and hamper comprehension of entropy for most students. As the second law of thermodynamics shows, in an isolated system internal portions at different temperatures tend to adjust to a single uniform temperature and thus produce equilibrium. A recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of <b>energy</b> as <b>dispersal,</b> which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant {{in accordance with the}} first law of thermodynamics (compare discussion in next section). Physical chemist Peter Atkins, for example, who previously wrote of dispersal leading to a disordered state, now writes that [...] "spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy".|$|R

30|$|The {{anthocyanin}} flavonoid pigments are ancient secondary metabolites of land {{plants that}} can be biochemically detected in species as ancient as mosses (Bendz 1961). Anthocyanins have two major roles in plant physiology. First, they provide visual cues to animals to help induce pollination and seed spread. Therefore, the anthocyanin family of pigments is responsible for most red, orange, pink, purple and blue flowers and fruits observed in nature. The second function of anthocyanins is as a light <b>energy</b> absorbance and <b>dispersal</b> system. These pigments can diminish photo-oxidative injury in leaves, both by protecting chloroplasts from excess high-energy quanta and by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Anthocyanins defend plants against ultraviolet radiation damage by absorbing in the 280 – 320  nm wavelengths (Takahashi et al. 1991; Li et al. 1993). Additionally, these pigments can absorb wavelengths between 500 and 550  nm and may also reflect across a wide region near 600 – 640  nm (Gausman 1983; Neill and Gould 2003).|$|R

The different morphological characteristics of the two barriers are attrib-uted to the spatial variation in energy levels and to the differences in offshore gradients on the two coasts.

40|$|We {{present results}} from direct N-body {{simulations}} of collisions between gravitational aggregates of varying size {{as part of}} a study to parameterize planetesimal growth in the Solar System. We find that as the ratio of projectile to target mass departs from unity, the impact angle has less effect on the outcome. At the same time, the probability of planetesimal growth increases. Conversely, for a fixed impact energy, collisions between impactors with mass ratio near unity are more dispersive than those with impactor mass ratio far from unity. We derive an expression for the accretion probability as a function of mass ratio. For an average mass ratio of 1 : 5, we find an accretion probability of ∼ 60 % over all impact parameters. We also compute the critical specific <b>dispersal</b> <b>energy</b> Q ∗ D as a function of projectile size. Extrapolating to a projectile size of 1 m with a 1 -km target, we find Q ∗ D = 103 – 10 4 Jkg− 1, in agreement with several other collision models that use fundamentally different techniques. Our model assumes that the components of each gravitational aggregate are identical and indestructible over the range of sampled impact speeds.

Coral eggs typically contain a high proportion of wax esters, which have been hypothesized to provide a source of <b>energy</b> for long-distance <b>dispersal.</b> To better understand the role of lipids in the dispersal of broadcast spawning coral larvae, ontogenetic changes in the lipid and fatty acid composition of Goniastrea retiformis were measured from the eggs until larvae were 30  days old. Egg biomass was 78. 8  ±  0. 5 % lipids, 86. 3  ±  0. 2 % of which were wax esters, 9. 3  ±  0. 0 % polar lipids, 4. 1  ±  0. 2 % sterols, and 0. 3  ±  0. 1 % triacylglycerols. The biomass of wax esters declined significantly through time, while polar lipids, sterols and triacylglycerols remained relatively constant, suggesting that wax esters are the prime source of energy for development. The most prevalent fatty acid in the eggs was palmitic acid, a marker of the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, highlighting the importance of symbiosis in coral reproductive ecology. The proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids declined through time, suggesting that they are essential for larval development. Interestingly, triacylglycerols are only abundant in the propagules that contain Symbiodinium, suggesting important differences in the energetic of dispersal among species with vertical and horizontal transmission of symbionts...|$|R
40|$|We {{carry out}} a {{systematic}} exploration {{of the effect of}} pre-impact rotation on the outcomes of low-speed collisions between planetesimals modeled as gravitational aggregates. We use pkdgrav, a cosmology code adapted to collisional problems and recently enhanced with a new soft-sphere collision algorithm that includes more realistic contact forces. A rotating body has lower effective surface gravity than a non-rotating one and therefore might suffer more mass loss {{as the result of a}} collision. What is less well understood, however, is whether rotation systematically increases mass loss on average regardless of the impact trajectory. This has important implications for the efficiency of planet formation via planetesimal growth, and also more generally for the determination of the impact energy threshold for catastrophic disruption (leading to the largest remnant retaining 50 % of the original mass), as this has generally only been evaluated for non-spinning bodies. We find that for most collision scenarios, rotation lowers the threshold <b>energy</b> for catastrophic <b>dispersal.</b> For head-on collisions, we develop a semi-analytic description of the change in the threshold description as a function of the target’s pre-impact rotation rate, and find that these results are consistent with the “universal law ” of catastrophic disruption developed by Leinhardt & Stewart. Using this approach, we introduce re-scaled catastrophic disruption variables that take into account the interacting mass fraction of the target and the projectile in order to translate oblique impacts into equivalent head-on collisions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Presentation date: 1971 - 05 - 07 This {{study was}} {{designed}} to provide life history information about juvenile fall Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), in a small coastal river by 1) documenting the length of residence of the juveniles throughout the river, 2) exploring several factors possibly influencing their length of residence, and 3) assessing the relative importance of freshwater and estuarine rearing areas for producing returning spawners. The juveniles were followed from their emergence in the spawning streams to their entry into the ocean. Most information on the length of residence of the juveniles was obtained by seining and trapping at various times and locations in the river. Spawning was distributed throughout the tributary streams, but most egg deposition occurred in Dry Creek. Most fish spawned from November to January. Fry emerged from the gravel from March to May. Newly emerged fry moved downstream from the spawning areas in large numbers at night. Based on experimental studies of juvenile behavior, this movement apparently resulted from emergence at night and lack of visual orientation of the fry during darkness. Downstream movement was reduced during increased light levels (daylight or moonlight). This initial movement of fry is thought to assure rapid dispersal of juveniles throughout the river without extensive <b>energy</b> costs of <b>dispersal</b> by a social mechanism. Many juveniles remained in fresh water until early summer. Most then entered the estuary, possibly because of the influence of high temperature in the main river. A small number of fish continued to reside in the cool spawning tributaries. Detailed studies in 1969 showed that juveniles began entering the estuary in spring, but large increases in the population did not occur until June. During the period of increasing abundance, many juveniles were also captured in the ocean surf. The population level in the estuary peaked at about 145, 000 fish during July and August and then declined to a low level in autumn. The rate of growth of the juveniles was reduced for three months during the period of high population abundance. Population density is hypothesized as a major cause of the depressed rate of growth of the juveniles. After the population declined in late summer, growth of juveniles again improved. Following the autumn freshets, most fall Chinook salmon remaining in the estuary and those in the cool spawning streams entered the ocean. A few fish from the tributary populations remained in fresh water through the winter and migrated to the ocean as yearlings the following spring. Based on variation in the length of residence of the juveniles in fresh water and the estuary, five types of life histories were defined. Scale patterns from these types were distinguished and returning spawners from the 1965 brood sorted into the various types. The type- 3 fish, those remaining in fresh water until early summer and then remaining for a period of improved growth in the estuary, represented about 90 percent of the returning spawners. Based on the return of these type- 3 fish, freshwater and estuarine rearing were concluded to be about equally important to fall Chinook salmon in Sixes River...|$|R

50|$|This {{approach}} {{provides a}} good basis for understanding the conventional approach, except in very complex cases where the qualitative relation of <b>energy</b> <b>dispersal</b> to entropy change can be so inextricably obscured that it is moot. Thus in situations such as the entropy of mixing when the two or more different substances being mixed are at the same temperature and pressure {{so there will be}} no net exchange of heat or work, the entropy increase will be due to the literal spreading out of the motional energy of each substance in the larger combined final volume. Each component’s energetic molecules become more separated from one another than they would be in the pure state, when in the pure state they were colliding only with identical adjacent molecules, leading to an increase in its number of accessible microstates.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} energy, when a solid becomes a liquid or a vapor, {{motional}} energy {{coming from the}} surroundings is changed to ‘potential energy‘ in the substance (phase change energy, which is released back to the surroundings when the surroundings become cooler than the substance's boiling or melting temperature, respectively). Phase-change energy increases the entropy of a substance or system because it is energy that must be spread out in the system from the surroundings so that the substance can exist as a liquid or vapor at a temperature above its melting or boiling point. When this process occurs in a 'universe' that consists of the surroundings plus the system, the total energy of the 'universe' becomes more dispersed or spread out {{as part of the}} greater energy that was only in the hotter surroundings transfers so that some is in the cooler system.

5000|$|When {{considered}} at a microscopic level, the term disorder may correctly suggest an increased range of accessible possibilities; {{but this may}} result in confusion because, at the macroscopic level of everyday perception, more ordered things seem more disordered, and more disordered things seem more ordered.

It has to be stressed, therefore, that [...] "disorder", as used in a thermodynamic sense, relates to a full microscopic description of the system, rather than its apparent macroscopic properties. Many popular chemistry textbooks in recent editions increasingly have tended to instead present entropy through the idea of degrees of freedom and <b>energy</b> <b>dispersal,</b> which is a dominant contribution to entropy in most everyday situations.The textbook examples of a messy (disordered) and tidy (ordered) bedroom for describing entropy do not provide particularly good analogies, because (being a textbook) they're both still images, meaning there are no degrees of freedom.|$|E
50|$|Stanley Sandler, in his 1989 Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics, {{described}} how given any thermodynamic process, a quantity TS {{can be interpreted}} as the amount of mechanical energy that has been converted into thermal energy by viscous dissipation, dispersion, and other system irreversibilities. In 1997, John Wrigglesworth described spatial particle distributions as represented by distributions of energy states. According to the second law of thermodynamics, isolated systems will tend to redistribute the energy of the system into a more probable arrangement or a maximum probability energy distribution, i.e. from that of being concentrated to that of being spread out. By virtue of the First law of thermodynamics, the total energy does not change; instead, the energy tends to disperse from a coherent to a more incoherent state. In his 1999 Statistical Thermodynamics, M.C. Gupta defined entropy as a function that measures how energy disperses when a system changes from one state to another.

Nonsense!", a second article completed his critique of the inadequacy of describing entropy in terms of [...] "disorder". Then, in 2002 [...] "Entropy Is Simple , Qualitatively" [...] described the spontaneous increase in entropy as fundamentally due to the tendency of all types of energy to disperse in space, if they are not constrained - with molecular motion and energy content as the most important in chemistry. Five further publications by Lambert and colleagues on the subject appeared through 2011. The latest article briefly summarizes how Boltzmann’s 1898 statement produced the conceptual error of “entropy is disorder” for the 20th century. In 2004, Science noted the emphases of his articles and listed his major website. [...] His ideas have been used by other authors in the Journal of Chemical Education.
