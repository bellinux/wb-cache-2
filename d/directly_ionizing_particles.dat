40|$|The {{understanding}} of inactivation radiobiological mechanism in individual cells is important when {{from one side}} the application of ionizing radiation to tumour therapy and {{from the other side}} the protection against radiation are to be effectively improved. Important part of this mechanism is double-strand break (DSB) formation; these DSB may be formed <b>directly</b> by impacting <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles</b> or indirectly by different secondary radicals. The latter kind of formation is much more frequent when cells contain normal water content. Mathematical model of the corresponding chemical stage will be presented with the aim to demonstrate how the individual radicals, but also other chemical agents present in the water during irradiation may influence DSB formation.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a core-shell structured <b>ionized</b> <b>particle</b> between two parallel conductor plates, which is biased with a direct current (DC) voltage, have been investigated. It {{has been found}} that an <b>ionized</b> <b>particle</b> oscillates rapidly between the DC voltage biased parallel conductors, where the frequency of oscillation depends on the free-charge density carried by the particle, the DC bias voltage, and the gap across the two conductor plates. As the presented system involves a spatially oscillating <b>ionized</b> <b>particle,</b> it represents a natural prototype for the electric dipole radiation source. Since the frequency of oscillating <b>ionized</b> <b>particle</b> depends on the DC bias voltage across the parallel conductor plates, the presented device has a broad wavelength adjustment range for the emitted radiation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a report of the}} {{investigations}} carried out {{to determine whether or not}} the rise time of the output pulses of semiconductor nuclear particle detectors is influenced by the type of <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> striking the detector. Charge collection rise times are calculated in the customary fashion, neglecting interaction between the lines of charge produced by the <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle.</b> A model of the detector is developed on which rise time calculations may be carried out taking into account charge interaction. The calculations are carried out for several different types of <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles.</b> Comparing the calculated rise times shows no difference between the rise time calculated taking into account charge interaction and those neglecting charge interaction: to within the accuracy of the method of calculation. The design of a vide-band amplifier is discussed: and the performance characteristics of the system used to observe detector charge collection rise times are presented. Resistivity and junction capacitances of several detectors were measured. In only one of the available detectors could the charge collection time be observed. Using an eight m. e. v. alpha source, the charge collection time of the detector was measured and found to be several times longer than was predicted. No other types of particle sources were readily available: so it was not possible to determine if this effect varied with the type of <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> striking the detector. This effect (i. e. an apparent lengthening of the charge collection time) has, however, been observed by others: who have determined experimentally that the effect does not depend on the particle type. The conclusion then, of this paper is that there is a definite lengthening of the charge collection time over that calculated by usual methods. This effect does not vary with different types of <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles.</b> No explanation for this effect is offered...|$|R

The resolution worsened to 100 ps for ~ 1 kHz/cm 2 proton flux and for ~ 100 Hz/cm 2 Carbon flux.

This article describe chemical processes running in water solutions after the impact of <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles.</b> A simplifield mathematical model is introduced.

The effects are described as changes mostly in the offset of detector output, but not in the gain. We conclude that the changes in the offset are caused mainly by increase in dark current. We establish a method to correct these ionizing radiation effects. The method is essential to improve the quality and to increase the sky coverage of the AKARI mid-infrared all-sky-survey map.
