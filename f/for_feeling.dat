The brain anatomy of bonobos has more developed and larger regions assumed to be vital <b>for</b> <b>feeling</b> empathy, sensing distress in others and feeling anxiety, which makes them less aggressive and more empathic than their close relatives. They also have a thick connection between the amygdala, an important area that can spark aggression, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, which helps control impulses.

For filming of the episode's closing reveal, the director used similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in the previous episode. The episode title is an allusion to the epithet used to describe the Red Priestess Melisandre. In the United States, the episode premiere achieved a viewership of 7.94 million in its initial broadcast, and a same-day total including the streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now of 10.7 million viewers, a record for the series.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} book, the vultures are grim and evil characters who feast on the dead. Disney lightened {{it up by}} having the vultures bearing a physical and vocal resemblance to The Beatles, including the signature mop-top haircut. It was also planned to have {{the members of the}} band to both voice the characters and sing their song, [...] "That's What Friends Are For". However, the Beatles member John Lennon's refusal to work on animated films in that period led to the idea being discarded. The casting of the vultures still brought a British Invasion musician, Chad Stuart of the duo Chad & Jeremy. In earlier drafts of the scene the vultures had a near-sighted rhinoceros friend named Rocky, who was to be voiced by Frank Fontaine. However, Walt decided to cut the character <b>for</b> <b>feeling</b> that the film had already much action with the monkeys and vultures.|$|E

[...] The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent Call of Duty games and pointed out how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of the original, but nonetheless criticized it <b>for</b> <b>feeling</b> limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar, due to the original having inspired numerous sequels and imitations, but praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again.

He praised the Jim-Pam storyline for its realism and depth, but worried that their eventual reconciliation would not feel earned, due to the few episodes left in the series. He praised the Dwight-Clark-Stanley storyline, writing that [...] "the true comedy in the episode came primarily from Dwight" [...] and called it Clark Duke's [...] "strongest appearance to date". Cornet gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10, calling it [...] "Good". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "the funniest episode on television this week", considering it a [...] "gem" [...] from the season.

He praised the episode <b>for</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "like a big answer to many of the issues that have plagued the show so far this season", specifically pointing to Dwight's meta-commentary on Cathy's [...] "lack of personality". He moreover wrote that he was {{looking forward to the}} rest of the season and the change in dynamic. Despite this, he criticized Dwight's role in the episode, comparing his orientation to Michael's conference room lectures and wrote he had a [...] "distaste" [...] for the broader moments for the character.

Adams gave the episode a B-. TV.com columnist Nick Campbell complimented the choice of using Andy as a villain, for further developing the Erin-Pete relationship, which he called [...] "one of two satisfying events in this episode".

500|$|Damon Wise of Empire called Changeling [...] "flawless", and McCarthy {{said it was}} [...] "emotionally {{powerful}} and stylistically sure-handed". He stated that Changeling was a more complex and wide-ranging work than Eastwood's Mystic River, saying the characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an [...] "almost breathtaking deliberation". He said that as [...] "a sorrowful critique of the city's political culture", Changeling sat {{in the company of}} films such as Chinatown and L.A. Confidential. Honeycutt said the film added a [...] "forgotten chapter to the L.A. noir" [...] of those films, and that Eastwood's melodic score contributed to an evocation of a city and a period [...] "undergoing galvanic changes". Honeycutt said, [...] " [...] small-town feel to the street and sets... captures a society resistant to seeing what is really going on". Séguret said that while Changeling had few defects, it was mystifying that other critics had such effusive praise for it. Denby said it was beautifully made, but that it shared the chief fault of other [...] "righteously indignant" [...] films in congratulating the audience <b>for</b> <b>feeling</b> contempt for the [...] "long-discredited" [...] attitudes depicted.

500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode <b>for</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems that way because it's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E

500|$|Walton's {{next major}} {{composition}} was the massive choral cantata Belshazzar's Feast (1931). It {{began as a}} work on a modest scale; the BBC commissioned a piece for small chorus, orchestra {{of no more than}} fifteen players, and soloist. Osbert Sitwell constructed a text, selecting verses from several books of the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. As Walton worked on it, he found that his music required far larger forces than the BBC proposed to allow, and Beecham rescued him by programming the work for the 1931 Leeds Festival, to be conducted by Malcolm Sargent. Walton later recalled Beecham as saying, [...] "As you'll never hear the work again, my boy, why not throw in a couple of brass bands?" [...] During early rehearsals, the Leeds chorus members found Walton's music difficult to master, and it was falsely rumoured in London musical circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to quell a revolt. The first performance was a triumph for the composer, conductor and performers. A contemporary critic wrote, [...] "Those who experienced the tremendous impact of its first performance had full justification <b>for</b> <b>feeling</b> that a great composer had arisen in our land, a composer to whose potentialities it was impossible to set any limits."

5000|$|Damasio also {{proposed}} that emotions {{are part of}} homeostatic regulation and are rooted in reward/punishment mechanisms. He recovered William James' perspective on feelings as a read-out of body states, but expanded it with an [...] "as-if-body-loop" [...] device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation process later uncovered by mirror neurons). He demonstrated experimentally that the insular cortex is a critical platform <b>for</b> <b>feelings,</b> a finding that has been widely replicated, and he uncovered cortical and [...] induction sites for human emotions, e.g. in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala.
