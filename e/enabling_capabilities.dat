40|$|In {{order to}} attain the coveted {{information}} superiority in NATO Network <b>Enabled</b> <b>Capability</b> (NNEC), the challenge of integrating information from different sources in this highly dynamic environment needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by using a system of lightweight cooperative hybrid agents that rely on Semantic Web technologies. The primary objective when conducting operations according to NATO Network <b>Enabled</b> <b>Capability</b> (NNEC) is to attain information superiority. NNEC {{is based on an}} idea of a common information space through which the participating information systems supply information for others to utilize, and retrieve the information needed according to their role (Buckman 2005). In order to realize this idea, the challenge of integrating information from heterogeneous sources in...|$|R

40|$|The U. K. Ministry of Defence (MoD) aims to {{significantly}} enhance military effect through the networking of existing and future military capabilities, {{under the banner}} of Network <b>Enabled</b> <b>Capability</b> (NEC). To respond to this need, the EPSRC and BAE Systems are jointly funding the Network <b>Enabled</b> <b>Capability</b> Though Innovative Systems Engineering (NECTISE) project, which involves ten U.

One of the objectives of the NECTISE project is to develop a systematic approach that would lead to flexible service-oriented architectures for through-life evolution by investigating how loosely coupled services can be used to describe the functions and quality of service for heterogeneous systems and networks. In this paper, we present the concept of evolutionary service-oriented architecture (SOA) for NEC using agile methodologies to adapt to changes for the provision of dependable and sustainable military capability...|$|R
