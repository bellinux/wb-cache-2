5|$|WWE {{considers}} {{the crowd to}} be the fourth largest live audience ever to attend a WWF/E event, with 80,355 in attendance; WrestleMania 29 in 2013 is reported as having 80,676 <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> attendance, WrestleMania III in 1987 is reported as having 93,173 <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> attendance and WrestleMania 32 in 2016 is reported as having 101,763 <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> attendance. Some writers believe that the WWF inflated the attendance figure for WrestleMania III, however, and that SummerSlam 1992 had a larger crowd. Between ticket prices and merchandise sales, the WWF made over $3,650,000 in revenue. Reviews of the event are almost all positive, and the Smith-Hart match has been rated the best match in SummerSlam history.|$|E
5|$|After {{a loss to}} the New Orleans Saints on November 26, 2006 in the Georgia Dome, Vick made {{an obscene}} gesture at <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> an {{apparent}} reaction to booing, holding up both hands with the middle finger extended. He was fined $10,000 by the NFL and agreed to donate another $10,000 to charity.|$|E

5|$|Attendees include {{artists and}} dealers {{offering}} {{products and services}} for sale to fans, and those wish to buy them.

Some later publish a con report detailing their experiences.|$|E
5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} accommodated {{in the corner}} of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{obtained}} {{younger and}} faster players in 1909; McGraw had Chief Meyers ready to succeed Bresnahan at catcher. Stanley Robison of the St. Louis Cardinals {{became interested in}} hiring Bresnahan to be a player-manager. As McGraw {{did not want to}} block Bresnahan from the opportunity, the Giants traded Bresnahan to the Cardinals for Red Murray, Bugs Raymond and Admiral Schlei after the 1908 season. Bresnahan led the Cardinals, who won only 49 games in 1908, to 54 wins in 1909 and 63 wins in 1910. Attendance increased from 205,000 <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> 1908 to 299,000fans in 1909, and 355,000 <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> 1910.|$|E

5|$|ACC teams viewed a {{berth in}} the Humanitarian Bowl as {{undesirable}} due to its location. Aside from {{being one of the}} lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively expensive and historically caused low turnout among ACC <b>fans.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|After {{lying on}} the ice for {{approximately}} 10 minutes, Moore {{was removed from the}} playing surface on a stretcher. He was treated for three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves, and facial lacerations. He was also suffering from amnesia. Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> a press conference two days later.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E

They then broke into an apartment building to threaten Kosovan refugees with a knife, mistakenly believing them to be Turkish. Six people were arrested and three Metropolitan Police officers were injured.

5|$|Atlético de Kolkata, and the ISL in general, were {{initially}} announced with a mixed reception among football <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> Kolkata. Some locals feared {{that it could}} overshadow the development of players at the city's two long-established I-League clubs, while others saw the new franchise {{as a way to}} unite both sets of I-League supporters, who would be drawn together further by the involvement of Ganguly, who is idolised across the state.|$|E
