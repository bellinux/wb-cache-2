Sarkozy has publicly stated {{his intention to}} attain EU approval of a progressive <b>energy</b> <b>package</b> {{before the end of}} his EU Presidency. This <b>energy</b> <b>package</b> would clearly define climate change objectives for the EU and hold members to specific reductions in emissions. In further support of his collaborative outlook on climate change, Sarkozy has led the EU into a partnership with China. On 6 December 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of France's then presidency of the Council of the EU, met the Dalai Lama in Poland and outraged China, which has announced that it would postpone the China-EU summit indefinitely.|$|E

The Southern Cross Climate Coalition (SCCC) is an alliance of the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Social Service and The Climate Institute. The SCCC welcomes the Clean <b>Energy</b> Future <b>package</b> as a critical first step forward on climate change in Australia. The price on pollution and its complementary measures lay the foundation for reducing emissions and remaining competitive in the emerging global low pollution economy. In November 2010 the SCCC outlined four foundations to drive a fair and inclusive transition to a low pollution economy.

5000|$|Generally, {{the fighter}} that {{is able to}} {{maintain}} a higher <b>energy</b> <b>package</b> will have the advantage. However, a high energy-package alone does not improve maneuverability, because optimum turn performance typically occurs within a range near a certain speed, called the [...] "corner speed." [...] Also, increasing {{the mass of the}} aircraft would increase its <b>energy</b> <b>package,</b> but angular momentum would hamper maneuverability, causing the heavier aircraft to turn wider circles. Instead, the fighter's useful energy is calculated by dividing its <b>energy</b> <b>package</b> by its weight, determining its specific energy (total energy per unit-weight). A fighter with less mass will generally be more maneuverable than a fighter with more mass, even if energy packages are equal, because the lighter aircraft has more specific-energy. [...] "Specific power," [...] on the other hand, is the thrust divided by weight, and the fighter's ability to generate excess specific-power aids the craft in maintaining its specific energy longer when forced to turn at an energy-depleting rate. Typically, the fighter with higher energy (energy fighter) will make an [...] "energy move" [...] like an [...] "out-of-plane maneuver," [...] to maintain the energy-advantage, while the fighter at an energy-disadvantage (angles fighter) will make an [...] "angles move" [...] such as a break turn, trying to use the opponent's energy to their own advantage.|$|E
