Second, using a detailed simulation model, we profile the real-time performance of a representative set of these secure CC protocols for a variety of security-classified workloads and system configurations.

50|$|Koscom was {{established}} in 1977 by the Ministry of Finance and the Korea Exchange. In 1980s, a synthesized <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> system for operating the entire capital market was required due to a rapid growth of the Korean stock market. In order to provide customers with a stable environment for making safe, easy and speedy stock trading with every <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> company, Koscom launched <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> by building automated trading systems for securities firms, insurance companies, government agencies and banks. The Korea Exchange is the largest shareholder of Koscom and {{a quarter of its}} shares split into several securities firms. Since Korea has opened its financial market to foreign investors in 1992, Koscom has been developing an integrated online financial system that would be utilized by the financial community to accurately monitor and analyze the entire capital flow of the Korean financial market. In 1988, Koscom initially introduced automated trading systems for financial markets. Koscom developed a data search tool and began to install terminals including the latest service called CHECKExpert for professional investors or brokers. The system also provides the latest market activity news and information on securities firms or information businesses as well as real-time financial market data movement to its users. The company launched STOCK-NET(1991), CRS2000(1999), SignKorea(2000) and ISAC(2003) services.|$|R
40|$|Software {{concurrent}} {{systems such}} as <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> are very popular today. Rigorous testing of such systems is indispensable. Nevertheless, the state-explosion problem, in which {{the size of a}} system grows exponentially with the number of concurrent components, is a severe obstacle to the generation of test cases. In this study, we propose a new relationship assuring the conformities of test cases for concurrent systems. We stipulate it in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), which is an excellent tool to study concurrent systems. Specification of concurrent systems is expressed as processes that are composed sequentially and concurrently. Our proposal supports both abstraction and process composition. This approach decomposes a given process into sequential compositions of component processes. Each component can be anti-extended into abstract forms. Sequential and concurrent combinations of abstract forms can substitute their corresponding extending components in a process to form aggregated abstract forms. Since the given processes, components and abstract forms are all processes, this approach can be applied recursively and compositionally. We prove that these aggregated abstract processes should be anti-extension...|$|R

40|$|Many {{real-time}} database applications {{arise in}} <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> safety-critical installations and military systems where enforcing security {{is crucial to}} the success of the enterprise. We investigate here the performance implications, in terms of killed transactions, of guaranteeing multi-level secrecy in a real-time database system supporting applications with firm deadlines. In particular, we focus on the buffer management aspects of this issue. Our main contributions are the following. First, we identify the importance and difficulties of providing secure buffer management in the real-time database environment. Second, we present SABRE, a novel buffer management algorithm that provides covert-channel-free security. SABRE employs a fully dynamic one-copy allocation policy for efficient usage of buffer resources. It also incorporates several optimizations for reducing the overall number of killed transactions and for decreasing the unfairness in the distribution of killed transactions across security levels. Third, using a detailed simulation model, the real-time performance of SABRE is evaluated against unsecure conventional and realtime buffer management policies for a variety of security-classified transaction workloads and system configurations. Our experiments show that SABRE provides security with only a modest drop in real-time performance. Finally, we evaluate SABREs performance when augmented with the GUARD adaptive admission control policy. Our experiments show that this combination provides close to ideal fairness for real-time applications that can tolerate covert-channel bandwidths of up to one bit per second (a limit specified in military standards) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} since our last survey, there have been {{significant}} legal developments {{in the areas of}} virtual currencies, prepaid payroll cards, online tribal lending, and payday lending. What connects some of these topics is an increasingly common strategy by federal banking regulators to influence and control the actions of entities that are not directly subject to their supervision through the relationships such entities have with regulated financial institutions. These developments also demonstrate robust state legislative and regulatory action relating to the provision of <b>electronic</b> payments and <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> and document class actions alleging violations of federal and state laws.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} {{the determinants of}} the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> in Tanzania with respect to the role of household behavioural factors. This is achieved by attempting three interrelated research questions: i) What are the financial experiences of households in Tanzania? ii) What are beliefs held by households in Tanzania about the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> iii) What are the effects of household behavioural characteristics for intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> and subsequent usage of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are employed to achieve the research objective. The empirical findings suggest that behavioural factors matter for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Firstly, the examination of household financial experiences on a sample of 30 households through the application of financial diary methodology revealed a variety of household financial experiences that highlight the necessity of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> to households. Secondly, despite the fact that most households do not use <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> it is found that households hold positive beliefs about <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> for saving facilities, security, finance, money management and improving economic well-being. Thirdly, structural equations models indicate that attitudes towards <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> perceived behavioural control and subjective norms significantly impact the intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived behavioural control is observed to prominently influence the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> The study offers the following contributions: Firstly, it develops a behavioural conceptual framework that integrates financial and psychological perspectives. This framework facilitates a broader understanding of the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> from various perspectives. Secondly, it provides distinct insights into the influence of behavioural characteristics in the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> This adds to the limited empirical literature about the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> specifically the effects of behavioural factors.
