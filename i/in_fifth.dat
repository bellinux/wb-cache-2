25|$|Orchestral kobza, {{with four}} strings tuned <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> using tunings that {{parallel}} {{those used by}} the instruments of the violin family. The instruments are made in prima (soprano), alto and tenor and contrabass sizes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{small number}} of bass players tune their strings <b>in</b> <b>fifths,</b> like a cello but an octave lower (C-G-D-A low to high). This tuning {{was used by the}} jazz player Red Mitchell and is used by some {{classical}} players, notably the Canadian bassist Joel Quarrington. Advocates of tuning the bass <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> point out that all of the other orchestral strings are tuned <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> (violin, viola and cello), so this puts the bass in the same tuning approach. Fifth tuning provides a bassist with a wider range of pitch than a standard E-A-D-G bass, as it ranges (without an extension) from C1 to A2. Some players who use fifths tuning who play a five-string bass use an additional high string (thus, from lowest to highest: C-G-D-A-E). Some fifth tuning bassists who only have a four string instrument and who are mainly performing soloistic works use the G-D-A-E tuning, thus omitting the low C string but gaining a high E. Some fifth tuning bassists who use a five-string use a smaller scale instrument, thus making fingering somewhat easier. The Berlioz-Strauss Treatise on Instrumentation (first published in 1844) states that, [...] "A good orchestra should have several four-string double-basses, some of them tuned <b>in</b> <b>fifths</b> and thirds." [...] The book then shows a tuning of (E-G-D-A) from bottom to top string. [...] "Together with the other double-basses tuned in fourths, a combination of open strings would be available, which would greatly increase the sonority of the orchestra." ...|$|R
