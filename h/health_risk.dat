40|$|The {{precautionary savings}} model predicts that {{households}} accumulate wealth to self-insure against unexpected declines in future income and unforeseen expenditures.

Second, we examine the factors that contribute to <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> that the near-elderly face. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to construct two measures of <b>health</b> <b>risks.</b> Our results do not support the hypothesis that household savings increase with the <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> that they face. Individuals who confront higher <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> in the future are those who are already in fair or poor health status or those who have a health condition such as diabetes or lung disease.

5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a <b>health</b> <b>risk.</b> However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> and the {{provision}} of safe drinking water have received great concern in the research field of the science and technologies of drinking water purification. The chemicals, microorganisms, and nano-materials in drinking water exhibit the basic characteristics of low-dosage, complexity, and hard-to-control, and promote potential <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> during the treatment, distribution, and storing of drinking water. The establishment of point-of-use (POU) systems is required for the control of <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> in drinking water according to these practical requirements. This study proposed the philosophy of point-of-use (POU) systems which aimed to control the <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> in drinking water, and introduced several key unit processes. Based on the idea above, the POU systems for <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> control have been developed and successfully used in the Olympic Village and its core areas during the period of 2008 Beijing Olympic Games...|$|R

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E
5|$|For {{surface water}} {{sources such as}} lakes and reservoirs, the volume {{available}} for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO4) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, {{with the possible exception}} of fluorine. The elements iron, manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a <b>health</b> <b>risk.</b> Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a {{magnetic}} field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets {{the magnetic field}} of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from {{the centre of the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E

25|$|Incremental <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> is the {{increased}} risk that a receptor (normally {{a human being}} living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist {{at the same time}} causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.|$|E
