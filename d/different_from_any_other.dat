Yet Monitor was still able to challenge Virginia and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads.|$|E

On 2 December the division was reunited, except {{for the rest of}} the pioneer battalion, which remained stranded in Bosnia by damaged bridges and railways. As a result of continued desertions and the catastrophic casualties suffered by Kampfgruppe Hanke, the division retained little of its original Bosnian character. Despite the return of disarmed Bosnians from labour units, the attachment of Hungarian infantry and artillery units and arrival of German replacements meant the division looked little <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> unit in the Second Panzer Army.|$|E

25|$|Glutathione, {{along with}} {{oxidized}} glutathione (GSSG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), {{have been found}} to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators.

Glutathione has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors that are <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute glutathione receptors, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. Glutathione is also able to activate the purinergic P2X7 receptor from Müller glia, inducing acute calcium transient signals and GABA release from both retinal neurons and glial cells.|$|E

Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the city, this is not significantly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> city.

25|$|Underground {{uranium mining}} is in {{principle}} no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> hard rock mining and other ores are often mined in association (e.g., copper, gold, silver). Once the ore {{body has been}} identified a shaft is sunk {{in the vicinity of}} the ore veins, and crosscuts are driven horizontally to the veins at various levels, usually every 100 to 150 metres. Similar tunnels, known as drifts, are driven along the ore veins from the crosscut. To extract the ore, the next step is to drive tunnels, known as raises when driven upwards and winzes when driven downwards, through the deposit from level to level. Raises are subsequently used to develop the stopes where the ore is mined from the veins.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to make the game look more realistic, many of the real players in the game had their entire body scanned into the game, as opposed to just the face like in {{previous}} NBA 2K games. A first for the NBA 2K series, the full body scanning allows the entire body of a specific player to be uniquely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> body. In previous NBA 2K games, a player's face was unique, while the body was generic and predefined. The full body scanning improves details in players' tattoos as well, something that has been criticized in past NBA 2K games. Cheerleaders, coaches, and fans were also scanned into the game; the designs of cheerleaders, coaches, and the crowd have too been criticized in past games.|$|E
25|$|While most {{molecular}} epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease diagnosis and classification systems, {{it is increasingly}} recognized that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> individual (“the unique disease principle”), considering uniqueness of the exposome (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies {{to examine the relationship}} between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized statistical methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular precision medicine, “molecular pathology” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “molecular pathological epidemiology” (MPE), defined as “epidemiology of molecular pathology and heterogeneity of disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis will further contribute to elucidate etiologies of disease. The MPE approach can be applied to not only neoplastic diseases but also non-neoplastic diseases. The concept and paradigm of MPE have become widespread in the 2010s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As proofs in type theory become {{increasingly}} complex, {{there is a}} growing need to provide better proof automation. This paper shows how to implement a Prolog-style resolution procedure in the dependently typed programming language Agda.

As a result, writing proof automation tactics need not be <b>different</b> <b>from</b> writing <b>any</b> <b>other</b> program. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The 21 st century poses a {{formidable}} instructional challenge for preservice teachers and teacher educators alike. Dramatic changes in student demographics, exponential {{increases in the}} knowl-edge base to be mastered and applied, and dwindling levels of public and administrative support for edu-cation have placed educators in the unenviable position of trying {{to do more with}} less&mdash;and calling it bet-ter. In this paper, I highlight many of the instructional implications associated with teaching diverse groups of learners, describe briefly some promising educational practices for meeting the instructional needs of such students, and explore how those within departments, schools, and colleges of education might go about better preparing their future teachers for accommodating such learning differences. The 21 st century poses {{a formidable}}instructional challenge for all educators. In years to come, we will be teaching groups of students who are quite <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> we have faced in the past. In some respects, these individuals will be harder to teach. They will come to us from more diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds...|$|R

Silver and Dixon get back together, but break up when he finds out Silver kissed Ethan. It is also {{revealed}} that Ethan has decided to stay in Montana with his father. Adrianna is desperate to become a normal teenager, giving up acting, and, much to Navid's dismay, their relationship is put under further pressure with the arrival of Teddy Montgomery, Adrianna's ex-boyfriend (to whom Adrianna lost her virginity). Meanwhile, the emotionally distant and guilt-ridden Annie has cut herself from society as much as possible, contributing to a growing discord between her and her brother, who is angry at her for sending him to summer school. Annie begins to date Jasper, which began as a guilt-ridden friendship but later turned into a relationship. Jasper is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> boy Annie has dated. He is more quiet and mysterious compared to her past boyfriends. Dixon meets a girl named Sasha when he begins his DJing career and is performing near her in a yacht, to whom he lies about his real age. Navid and Adrianna's relationship continues to tremble when Adrianna continues to find Teddy alluring. In the meantime, Harry and Debbie face marital problems when Harry confides to Kelly about his family troubles. Naomi finds out that her SAT scores are not high enough to get into California University, so she decides to date the Dean of Admission's son, Richard. She later falls for Richard's roommate, Jamie. Sasha finally learns about Dixon's real age when Debbie accidentally shows Sasha, whom she met by chance in a salon and does not know, a picture of her son Dixon who is only in high school.|$|E
