5000|$|Peanut is a hyperactive, purple-skinned [...] "woozle" [...] {{with white}} fur {{covering}} {{most of his}} body, a tuft of green hair {{on the top of}} his head, and one sneaker on his left foot. Dunham explains in Arguing with Myself that Peanut is from a small Micronesian island, and that they met in Florida. Peanut's humor is not based on a particular motif or stereotype, as those of the other characters, and has been described as [...] "the bad kid". He often makes fun of Dunham, and torments and mocks José Jalapeño on a Stick. Touching upon his unusual appearance and personality, he asks Dunham in Arguing with Myself, after Dunham denies ever having done drugs, [...] "Then how the hell <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> me?" ...|$|E

Youre not artistic and you have no integrity! You know, you really need some help! And a regular {{psychiatrist}} couldnt even help you! You need to go to, like, Vienna or something, you know what I mean? You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you! Thats the kind of help you need! Not the once a week for eighty bucks, no! You need a TEAM! A team of psychiatrists working round the clock, thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like what they did with the Elephant Man! Thats what Im talking about, because thats the only way youre going to get better! Jerry Seinfeld (in character) ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the origin of the band name, McKay says [...] "There is {{absolutely}} no meaning whatsoever. It was the result of 30 seconds of brainstorming upon the inception of the band, and we just stuck with it." [...] McKay elaborates in their biography:'How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the name?' is definitely the question we’re asked the most when we play shows... I really like band names with catchy abbreviations and chant-able acronyms... S-L-P stays with people - especially because it's associated with a popular breakfast food... I’ve learned for myself that it doesn’t matter how deep of a meaning or back-story there is with your band name - what matters most is the quality of the music you create and the connections you make with the people who come out to shows to hear it. The band name {{is a part of the}} image, but creating good music and sharing an experience with audience matters first and foremost.Reddit users also pointed out McKay's possible history as an online gamer for the first-person shooter Counter-Strike, where there was once a team called Stacked Like Pancakes. When asked if the band ever thought about changing their name, they had already incorporated and [...] "established it pretty well... so there was no going back." ...|$|E

40|$|None {{who knew}} Carl will be {{surprise}} {{to learn that}} scientific meetings contributed next to nothing to our scientific interac-tions. The meeting of the ribosome fraternity that was held in Madison, WI, in 1979 {{is the only one}} I can think of that we both attended, and there Carl gave a talk in which he vehemently criticized the members of that community, to which I belong, for its collective failure to develop a theory about ribosomes and the mechanism of protein synthesis robust enough to guide the research we were doing. 1 It baffled me. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a theory about something you hardly understand, and what good would it <b>do</b> if <b>you</b> <b>did?</b> The theory that was guiding my work at the time, if you can call it that, was {{that it would be a}} Good Thing to know more about the three-dimensional struc-ture of the ribosome.

"And now," [...] I said, [...] "in {{the name}} of goodness, where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> from tied <b>up</b> in flowers like a Roman priest at sacrifice, and riding on a bull like the lady called Europa?

60|$|Now the {{argument}} that the civilized housing of the masses of our population now is impossible because if you set out to <b>do</b> it <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> against the veto of the private owner at every stage, can be applied to almost every general public service. Some little while ago I wrote a tract for the Fabian Society about Boots;[3] and I will not apologize for repeating here a passage from that. To begin with, this tract pointed out the badness, unhealthiness and discomfort of people's footwear as one saw it in every poor quarter, and asked why it was that things were in so disagreeable a state. There was plenty of leather in the world, plenty of labour.|$|R

6000|$|On {{the next}} day he went into Silverbridge, {{intending}} to call on Miss Prettyman. He had not quite made up his mind what he would say to Miss Prettyman; nor was he called upon to do so, as he never got as far as that lady's house. While walking up the High Street he saw Mrs. Thorne in her carriage, and, as a matter of course, he stopped to speak to her. He knew Mrs. Thorne quite as intimately as he did her husband, and liked her quite as well. [...] "Major Grantly," [...] she said, speaking out loud to him, half across the street; [...] "I was very angry with <b>you</b> yesterday. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to dinner? We had a room ready for you and everything." ...|$|R

Why, I was much worse off then than you are now: and yet, you see, a friend came and saved me. You must not give way so, my good fellow. After all, a little management will set everything right," [...] {{and he took the}} husbandman's sturdy hand.|$|R
30|$|From a {{grammatical}} perspective, the A 2 {{demand in}} Table 2 : Exchange 1 includes three moves, realised as three clauses, // <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> on the smartboard // {{and write the}} heading {{for us in the}} middle // just write 'The Water Cycle'//. From this perspective, it may be analysed as a move complex (Martin [1992], Martin and Rose [2007]). But from the perspective of speakers' roles in the pedagogic exchange, it is one functional unit, so we will refer to such A/K units as exchange roles. An exchange is realised by a sequence of one or more roles, each of which is realised by one or more moves.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, {{that will}} do, Eunice!" [...] {{interposed}} the father. [...] "Sit down, Dan, and don't be an ass, if <b>you</b> are engaged. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> expect to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> {{here with a}} bombshell in your pocket, and explode it among us without causing any commotion? We all desire your happiness, and we are glad if you think you've found it, {{but we want to}} have time to realise it. We had only adjusted our minds to the apparent fact that you hadn't found it when you were here before." [...] His father began very severely, but when he ended with this recognition of what they had all blinked till then, they laughed together.|$|R
5000|$|Sam Gazdziak of Engine 145 {{gave the}} song a [...] "thumbs down," [...] calling it [...] "shamelessly sexist" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unremarkable," [...] and saying {{it sounded like}} [...] "something Justin Moore would've passed on." [...] Liv Carter of Urban Country News gave the song a similar review, also giving it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] and heavily criticizing the clichéd lyrics, saying that [...] "I have looked at this songs from every angle but, apart from the {{delightful}} banjo line, I find no redeeming qualities. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with {{one heck of a}} catchy tune though, so I guess the people enjoying this might be people who are just looking for something to dance to without engaging their brain to take in what they’re actually listening to. To those fans I say, fair enough." ...|$|R
5000|$|IronE Singleton, {{who played}} T-Dog, recalled: [...] "when I was first {{cast in the}} show, I was told that I would do two, maybe three episodes, but I ended up staying on the show for three seasons. How miraculous is that? So, I'm very thankful for that." [...] Singleton found it {{liberating}} as an actor to be cast in a role that was not based on a character in the comics, because [...] "you start with a clean slate. There's nothing more liberating about starting with {{something that is not}} written. You pretty much create the history of that character and that character's life story. Whatever <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> whatever <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with, whatever <b>you</b> decide on, you can go with it and, if the director or the execs they like it, then you'll stick with it." [...] Singleton said that he didn't have any conversations with Robert Kirkman, Frank Darabont, or Glen Mazzara on how to develop his character, so [...] "T-Dog basically had my life story. He grew up in the projects, in the city, and he was fortunate enough to get to college through a football scholarship and, eventually, academic scholarships. He majored in speech communications, the same as I did. I also majored in theater, but I did not attach that to T-Dog because it probably would've made him a little more dramatic, and we're already dramatic enough on TV. Then, he graduated from college, but didn't make it to the pros. He came close, but ended up getting a regular blue collar/white collar type of job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you are talking about," [...] he said. [...] "I fired at him through the window--I don't mind saying so to you, because there are no witnesses--and saw him jump up, but I fancied I had missed him. I saw you bolt out of the room, and thought it better to be off at once instead of taking another shot. You gave me a hard chase. It was lucky for <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with me, for if <b>you</b> had <b>done</b> so I should have shot you; I owed you one for having killed as good a comrade as man ever had, and for that bullet you put in my {{shoulder}} before. If I had not been so out of breath that I could not feel sure of my aim I should have stopped for you, but I rode straight to town." ...|$|R
5000|$|Seymour said: [...] "On {{this record}} when I {{started working with}} Matt and Sean, we had songs that were {{the basis of the}} record realised. I sent them out to all these A&R guys and record company stiffs that I had known over the years and got {{absolutely}} no reply. I followed up with phone calls and theyd say they werent interested or werent signing anything. I realised that because of the digital age you make your own records in the back garden and do a lease deal. It is a real drag but thats what <b>you</b> have to <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> have to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the money yourself to get Pro-Tools and the good speakers for your spare room. It is part of the DJ culture but a lot of kids who dont have money dont get money thrown at them anymore. It means the ones coming up the ranks are predominantly middle-class to upper-class kids." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} might know my father better, Mr. Vane," [...] she went on, [...] "I wish {{you might know}} him as I know him, if it were possible. You see, I have been his {{constant}} companion all my life, and I think very few people understand him as I do, and realize his fine qualities. He makes no attempt to show his best side to the world. His life has been spent in fighting, and I am afraid he is apt to meet the world on that footing. He {{is a man of}} such devotion to his duty that he rarely has a day to himself, and I have known him to sit up until the small hours of the morning to settle some little matter of justice. I do not think I am betraying his confidence when I say that he is impressed with your ability, and that he liked your manner the only time he ever talked to you. He believes that you have got, in some way, a wrong idea of what he is trying to <b>do.</b> Why don't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> and talk to him again?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Cook {{recognized}} I Was Dora Suarez as {{his greatest}} and most onerous achievement: “Writing Suarez broke me; I see that now. I don’t {{mean that it}} broke me physically or mentally, although it came near to doing both. But it changed me; it separated out for ever what was living and what was dead. I realised it was doing so at the time, but not fully, and not how, and not at once. … I asked for it, though. If you go down into the darkness, you must expect it to leave traces on you coming <b>up</b> — if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>come</b> <b>up.</b> It’s like working in a mine; you hope that hands you can’t see know what they’re doing and will pull you through. I know I wondered half way through Suarez if I would get through — I mean, if my reason would get through. For the trouble with an experience like Suarez is that you become what you’re writing, passing like Alice through the language into the situation.” (The Hidden Files, pp. 132-133.) ...|$|R
60|$|Another disillusion weighed upon my soul. Before I {{went up the}} Nile, I had a fancy of my {{own that}} the bank was studded with endless ruined temples, whose vast red colonnades were {{reflected}} in the water at every turn. I think Macaulay's Lays were primarily answerable for that particular misapprehension. As a matter of fact, it surprised me to find that we often went for two whole days' hard steaming without ever a temple breaking the monotony of those eternal date-palms, those calm and superciliously irresponsive camels. In my humble opinion, Egypt is a fraud; {{there is too much}} Nile--very dirty Nile at that--and not nearly enough temple. Besides, the temples, when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with them, are just like the villages; they are the same temple over again, under a different name each time, and they have the same gods, the same kings, the same wearisome bas-reliefs, except that the gentleman in a chariot, ten feet high, who is mowing down enemies a quarter his own size, with unsportsmanslike recklessness, is called Rameses in this place, and Sethi in that, and Amen-hotep in the other. With this trifling variation, when you have seen one temple, one obelisk, one hieroglyphic table, you have seen the whole of Ancient Egypt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Big!..." [...] exclaimed R.C. {{with that}} same {{peculiar}} little laugh. [...] "He doesn't look big now. But up there {{he looked like a}} hill.... What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think? He <b>came</b> <b>up</b> that very way you told me to look out for. And if I hadn't had ears he'd got right on me. As it was, when I heard little rolling stones, and then saw him, he was almost on a level with me. My nerve was all right. I knew I had him. And I made sure of my first shot. I knocked him flat. But he got up--let out an awful snarl--and plunged my way. I can't say I know he charged me. Only it was just the same as if he had!... I knocked him down again and this time he began to kick and jump down the slope. That was my best shot. Think I missed him the next three. You see I had time to get shaky. If he had kept coming at me--good night!... I had trouble loading. But when I got ready again I ran down and saw him in that bush. Wasn't far from him then. When he let out that bawl he saw me. I don't know much about bears, but I know he wanted to get at me. And I'm sure of what he'd have done.... I didn't miss my last shot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} yet made clear to <b>you</b> how I <b>came</b> there,' he continued. 'Having ridden, then, some leagues from the field, and noting this windmill, it did occur {{to me that a}} stout man might single-handed make it good against a troop of horse. We have no great love of flight, we Tetheridges. It may be mere empty pride, and yet the feeling runs strong in the family. We have a {{fighting}} strain in us ever since my kinsman followed Ireton's army as a sutler. I pulled up, therefore, and had dismounted to take my observations, when my brute of a charger gave the bridle a twitch, jerked itself free, and was off in an instant over hedges and ditches. I had, therefore, only my good sword left to trust to. I climbed up the ladder, and was engaged in planning how the defence could best be conducted, when I heard the clank of hoofs, and on the top of it <b>you</b> <b>did</b> ascend from below. I retired at once into ambush, from which I should assuredly have made a sudden outfall or sally, had the flour not so choked my breathing that I felt as though I had a two-pound loaf stuck in my gizzard. For myself, I am glad that it has so come about, for in my blind wrath I might unwittingly have <b>done</b> <b>you</b> an injury. Hearing the clank of your sword as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> the ladder, I <b>did</b> opine that <b>you</b> were one of King James's minions, the captain, perchance, of some troop in the fields below.' ...|$|R
