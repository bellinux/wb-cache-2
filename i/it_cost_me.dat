Elizabeth was as sweet as only she could be and protested that it didn't matter, that she didn't mind if she didn't have it, that {{there was much more}} in life than baubles, that she would manage with what she had. The {{inference}} was that she would make do. But not me!... I screamed at Aaron that bugger Cartiers, I was going to get that diamond if <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> my life or 2 million dollars whichever was the greater.

Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In {{many parts of the}} African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [...] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie thenlike all [...] MuslimsI was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. <b>It</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> 12 years.|$|E
500|$|When the Beagle {{returned}} on 2 October 1836, Darwin {{was already}} a celebrity in scientific circles, as in December 1835 University of Cambridge Professor of Botany John Stevens Henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin {{for the first time}} on 29 October, enthusiastic about the support this gave to his uniformitarianism, and in May wrote to John Herschel that he was [...] "very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever, though <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> a pang at first, for it accounted for so much... the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs." [...] Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the Geological Society of London on 31 May 1837.|$|E

500|$|The Broken Ear {{introduced}} the character General Alcazar to the series, {{who went on}} to become a recurring character who appeared in three further Adventures. It was the first in the series to begin and end in Belgium, the first to deal with the hunt for a specific object, and the last in which Tintin is seen taking part in journalistic activity. It was also the first time that the Adventures featured Tintin's flat at 26 Labrador Road, in which Chinese mementos from The Blue Lotus are visible. Influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Hergé inserted an illustration of himself into the second frame. He also made reference to contemporary news stories in the book, having a radio announcer discuss the ongoing Second Italo-Ethiopian War at the start of the story; this was removed in the colour edition. At the end of the story, Hergé killed off Ramón and Alonso and depicted them being dragged to Hell by devils; the killing of the story's antagonists was something not repeated in future stories. This upset the editors of Cœurs Vaillants, who asked Hergé to change the scene; annoyed at their request, he later commented, [...] "On the surface <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> nothing, but that kind of addition was really difficult for me." [...] For their serialisation of the story, he replaced that particular frame with one in which Tintin vouchsafed the souls of Ramón and Alonso for God.|$|E
2500|$|......then we got married, {{lived in}} the unit (in Ramsgate) for a while, and had a baby. We {{moved to a new}} house {{a quarter of a mile}} away. <b>It</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> heaps.

We were really struggling.|$|E

[...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|E

5000|$|Grande Dame of French restaurateurs in London, Madame Prunier was {{considered}} the doyenne of fish cookery of her day. Her English customers were in awe of her. So they should have been, as running a grand restaurant is no easy task. She was particularly adept at making the clientele feel welcome and cared for, even the deposed heads of state post WWII who had visited the restaurants when in power before the war. In 1954, she was made Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur, France's highest honour, in recognition of her services to maintaining the standards and recognition of French cooking. As had said her father: [...] "It's true <b>it's</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> a lot of work. <b>It's</b> true <b>it's</b> <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> a lot of worry. But what a magnificent business it is, quelle belle Maison." ...|$|R
