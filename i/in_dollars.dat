5|$|The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each {{of which}} {{contains}} five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values {{in the first round}} ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001.

5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs <b>in</b> <b>dollars,</b> forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E

2500|$|By August 1978, actual {{construction}} costs were now $85 million ($ <b>in</b> [...] <b>dollars)</b> and {{were expected to}} top $122 million ($ <b>in</b> [...] <b>dollars).</b> The Senate approved a plan to spend another $54 million ($ <b>in</b> [...] <b>dollars)</b> on the structure, and cap costs at $135 million ($ <b>in</b> [...] <b>dollars).</b> [...] Initially, the House approved this plan.

5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only pay for what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States <b>in</b> <b>dollars,</b> thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E

25|$|Boeing's {{production}} costs are mostly in United States dollars, whereas Airbus' {{production costs}} are mostly in Euro. When the dollar appreciates against the euro {{the cost of}} producing a Boeing aircraft rises relatively {{to the cost of}} producing an Airbus aircraft, and conversely when the dollar falls relative to the euro it is an advantage for Boeing. There are also possible currency risks and benefits involved in the way aircraft are sold. Boeing typically prices its aircraft only <b>in</b> <b>dollars,</b> while Airbus, although pricing most aircraft sales <b>in</b> <b>dollars,</b> has been known to be more flexible and has priced some aircraft sales in Asia and the Middle East in multiple currencies. Depending on currency fluctuations between the acceptance of the order and the delivery of the aircraft this can result in an extra profit or extra expense—or, if Airbus has purchased insurance against such fluctuations, an additional cost regardless.|$|E
