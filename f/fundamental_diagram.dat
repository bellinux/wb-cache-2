50|$|The <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> {{of traffic}} flow is a diagram {{that gives a}} {{relation}} between the traffic flux (vehicles/hour) and the traffic density (vehicles/km).

30|$|Considerable {{amount of}} {{research}} has been done for development and application of pedestrian <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Several factors have been considered such as width of the facility, gradients and pedestrian characteristics. Critical investigations have taken place in areas such as bottlenecks, escalators and staircases. Influence of different flow types such as uni-directional, bi-directional, merging and crossing situations on <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> is also studied. <b>Fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> are critical in identifying congested and uncongested condition while monitoring pedestrian movement in small to large gatherings. Development of FDs are also relevant in emergency and evacuation planning.|$|R
40|$|<b>Fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> for uni-, bi- and multidirectional flows at {{corridors}} and crossings are investigated {{by a series}} of experiments under laboratory conditions. At high densities pedestrians are forced to make detours or even change the intended destinations. These unintended movements lead to an overestimation of the performance of crossings. To consider these effects in the determination of the capacities the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> are measured using advanced methods. In comparison to classical methods, significant differences relating to the capacities are found. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> are compared with data of uni-, bi-, and multidirectional flows and with data of the literature...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} some recently introduced discrete kinetic models of vehicular traffic to catch, in their large time behavior, typical features of theoretical <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Specifically, we address the so-called "spatially homogeneous problem" and, in the representative case of an exploratory model, we study the qualitative properties of its solutions for a generic number of discrete microstates.

30|$|After a {{thorough}} review of literature, this paper identifies certain research gaps which {{provides an opportunity}} to enhance the understanding of <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> of pedestrian flow characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> (flow-density) is a {{triangular}} function, a traffic state A with speed vA and density kA {{can be assumed}} in the congestion region. The density on the roadway can be determined using the spacing between vehicles and is computed simply the equation: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory about 2D region of steady states of synchronized flow {{is contrary to}} the {{hypothesis of}} earlier traffic flow theories involving the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> of traffic flow, which suppose a one-dimensional relationship between vehicle density and flow rate.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{bottleneck}} {{limiting the}} flow of traffic which causes {{an increase in the}} density of cars (k) at location (xo). This causes a deceleration for all oncoming cars traveling at speed u to slow to speed vd. This shockwave will travel at the speed of the slope of line U-D on the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram.</b> The wave speed can be calculated as vshock = (qD &minus; qU)/(kD&minus;kU). This line delineates the congestion traffic from oncoming free-flow traffic. If the slope of U-D on the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> is positive congestion will continue downstream of the highway. If it has a negative slope the congestion will continue upstream (see figure a). This deceleration is the case I of Riemann’s problem (see figure b and c).|$|E
40|$|Kinematic wave theory {{consists}} of two main equations: the conservation of vehicles and the equilibrium flow-density relationship. Assuming that each traffic state along a road at each point in time is an equilibrium state, these combine into a single partial differential equation for the propagation of traffic along a network link. Newell (1993) proposed a solution scheme using cumulative numbers of vehicles as the primary variable, which later {{led to the development}} of the Link Transmission Model (Yperman, 2007). Daganzo (2005) implicitly shows that for triangular <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams,</b> this model indeed leads to the correct solution. This requirement of triangular <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> is restrictive. Firstly, it imposes the speed in subcritical traffic to be constant instead of more realistically, depending on the traffic density. Secondly, it impedes any discontinuity between the free-flow capacity and the queue discharge rate, i. e. a capacity drop. We therefore extend the Link Transmission Model to handle arbitrary concave <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams,</b> optionally including capacity drops. The resulting model, which converges to kinematic wave theory if there is no capacity drop, can be used in a network simulation and features both standing queues and moving jams. Building upon the proofs in Daganzo, we derive a finite set of space-time paths that form an exact solution network for continuous concave <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams.</b> This solution method is more general than those proposed by Yperman for piecewise-linear diagrams and Gentile (2010) for continuously-differentiable diagrams and better at reproducing acceleration fans or rarefaction waves. We further extend this model to include capacity drops. By applying a node model without memory effects and using inverted-lambda style <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams,</b> we permit the head of a queue to move upstream. We ensure that the queue discharge rates before and after a discontinuity in an inhomogeneous road are both taken into account. Transport and PlanningTransport and Plannin...|$|R

50|$|For this example, {{consider}} three {{lanes of}} traffic in one direction. Assume that a truck starts traveling at speed v, {{slower than the}} free flow speed vf. As shown on the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> below, qu represents the reduced capacity (2/3 of Q, or 2 of 3 lanes available) around the truck.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{a stretch}} of highway with two lanes in one direction. Suppose that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> is modeled as shown here.

In this paper the movement properties of middle- and old-aged adults are studied with series of single-file movement experiments under laboratory conditions. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> for two different groups of pedestrians and time-space diagrams are compared. For the groups with different composition and status, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> are totally different but maintain the same trend. Active crowd leads to inhomogeneous pedestrian flow but higher flow rate, while inactive pedestrians prefer {{to keep pace with}} others or keep larger personal space, which leads to more jams and stop-and-go waves.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the traffic states and jams in {{vehicular}} traffic merging and bifurcating at a junction on a two-lane highway. The two-lane traffic {{model for the}} vehicular motion at the junction is presented where a jam occurs frequently due to merging, lane changing, and bifurcating. The traffic flow is called the weaving. At the weaving section, vehicles slow down and then move aside on the other lane for changing their direction. We derive the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> (flow-density diagrams) for the weaving traffic flow. The traffic states vary with the density, slowdown speed, and the fraction of vehicles changing the lane. The dynamical phase transitions occur. It is shown that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> depend highly on the traffic states...|$|R
40|$|Capacity drop at active {{bottlenecks}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} puzzling traffic phenomena, but a thorough understanding is practically important for designing variable speed limit and ramp metering strategies. In this study, we attempt to develop a simple model of capacity drop within the framework of kinematic wave theory based on the observation that capacity drop occurs when an upstream queue forms at an active bottleneck. In addition, we assume that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> are continuous in steady states. This assumption is consistent with observations and can avoid unrealistic infinite characteristic wave speeds in discontinuous <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams.</b> A core component of the new model is an entropy condition defined by a discontinuous boundary flux function. For a lane-drop area, we demonstrate that the model is well-defined, and its Riemann problem can be uniquely solved. We theoretically discuss traffic stability with this model subject to perturbations in density, upstream demand, and downstream supply. We clarify that discontinuous flow-density relations, or so-called "discontinuous" <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams,</b> are caused by incomplete observations of traffic states. Theoretical results are consistent with observations in the literature and are verified by numerical simulations and empirical observations. We finally discuss potential applications and future studies. Comment: 29 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The {{kinematic}} wave {{model of}} traffic flow theory is the simplest dynamic traffic flow model that reproduces {{the propagation of}} traffic waves. It {{is made up of}} three components: the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram,</b> the conservation equation, and initial conditions. The law of conservation is the fundamental law governing the kinematic wave model: ...|$|E
50|$|In case II of Riemann’s problem traffic {{goes from}} {{congestion}} to free-flow and the cars accelerate as the density drops. Again {{the slope of}} these shock waves can be calculated using the same formula vshock = (qD &minus; qU)/(kD&minus;kU). The difference this time is that traffic flow travels along the <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> not {{in a straight line}} across but many slopes between various points on the curved <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagram</b> (see figure d). This causes many lines emanating from point x1 all in a fan shape, called rarefaction (see figure e). This model implies that the users later on in time will take longer to accelerate as they meet each of the lines. Instead a better approximation is a triangular diagram where the traffic increases abruptly as it would when a driver sees an opening in front of them (see figures f and g).|$|E
50|$|For this example, {{consider}} three {{lanes of}} traffic in one direction. Assume that a truck starts traveling at speed v, {{more slowly than}} at the free-flow speed vf.

40|$|<b>Fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{describing}} {{the relation between}} pedestrians speed and density are key points in understanding pedestrian dynamics. Experimental data evidence the onset of complex behaviors in which the velocity decreases with the density and different logistic regimes are identified. This paper addresses the issue of pedestrians transport and of <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams</b> for a scenario involving the motion of pedestrians escaping from an obscure tunnel. We capture {{the effects of the}} communication efficiency and the exit capacity by means of two thresholds controlling the rate at which particles (walkers, pedestrians) move on the lattice. Using a particle system model, we show that in absence of limitation in communication among pedestrians we reproduce with good accuracy the standard <b>fundamental</b> <b>diagrams,</b> whose basic behaviors can be interpreted in terms of the exit capacity limitation. When the effect of a limited communication ability is considered, then interesting non-intuitive phenomena occur. Particularly, we shed light on the loss of monotonicity of the typical speed [...] density curves, revealing the existence of a pedestrians density optimizing the escape. We study both the discrete particle dynamics as well as the corresponding hydrodynamic limit (a porous medium equation and a transport (continuity) equation). We also point out the dependence of the effective transport coefficients on the two thresholds - the essence of the microstructure information...|$|R
