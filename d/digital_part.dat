40|$|Historically the {{analogue}} and digitel {{parts of}} a hardware design have been modelled and simulated in different environments {{and could not be}} combined in a single simulator. On the other hand, if a design contains both analog and <b>digital</b> <b>parts</b> simulating their interactions are most important to reliably verify the design. Therefore, we present a method for simulating analogue circuits and digital components in a VHDL simulator. For executing analogue simulations in a VHDL environment an analogue simulator has been developed. It permits to model linear and non-linear circuits using only standard VHDL language elements. This fact allows a similar conversion of this method to different VHDL environments. A netlist is used to model the analogue parts with elements from a model library. In order to interface analogue and <b>digital</b> <b>parts</b> A/D and D/A converter elements are be used. This allows signal feedbacks between both parts during the simulation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years {{technological}} progress in analog to digital (ADC) and digital to analog converters (DAC) has been substantial. Particularly, the analog bandwidth has increased to a level where many new applications in radar techniques become possible. A major goal is to shift the boundary between analog and <b>digital</b> <b>parts</b> of a remote sensing system like radar further towards the antenna {{in order to reduce}} drift and non-linearity effects, and to gain a higher flexibility in signal processing. A high-resolution digital beam-forming (DBF) system requires adequately sampled, stored, and finally processed signals of several receiver channels. For multi-channel systems, especially in the transmit part, one main drawback is the interference between simultaneously transmitted signals being operated in the identical frequency range. However, the use of coded signals can overcome this issue. Currently we are investigating a radar architecture that uses major <b>digital</b> <b>parts,</b> multiple receive and transmit channels, and a wide bandwidth for high resolution imaging.
