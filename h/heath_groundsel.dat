50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{populated}} in the wetter, boggier areas with Purple Moor-grass, Sphagnum Moss and rushes. Also flourishing are Carnation Sedge, Common Cotton-grass and Marsh Violet. In the drier heathland areas there is Heather, Bilberry, Heath Milkwort, Lousewort, Sheep's-bit and <b>Heath</b> <b>Groundsel.</b> Also recorded are Gorse, Foxglove and Bramble. Also found is Blue eyed Grass (sisyrinchium augustifolium). This species {{may have been}} introduced from Ireland in 1959 when the naturalist Bruce Campbell introduced Pitcher Plants and Butterworts {{as part of a}} children's programme.|$|E
50|$|The Whin Sill is an igneous rock, Dolerite, {{which gives}} rise to a soil {{chemistry}} particular to the location, and thus to a distinct habitat for vegetation. Soil on the Whin Sill is thin and prone to drought in summer months. Plant species found at the site include the Perennial plant wild onion (Allium vineale), maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides), common rockrose (Helianthemum nummularium), meadow oat-grass (Avenula pratensis) and crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha). Annual plants including knotted clover (Trifolium striatum), forget-me-nots (Myosotis spp), dove’s-foot cranesbill (Geranium molle), parsley-piert (Aphanes arvensis), <b>heath</b> <b>groundsel</b> (Senecio sylvaticus) and squirreltail fescue (Vulpia bromoides). More acidic areas provide habitat for sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina) and bell heather (Erica cinerea).|$|E
50|$|Senecio sylvaticus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the aster family. It is variously known as the woodland ragwort, <b>heath</b> <b>groundsel,</b> or mountain common groundsel. It is native to Eurasia, {{and it can be}} found in other places, including western and eastern sections of North America, as an introduced species and an occasional roadside weed. It grows best in cool, wet areas. It is an annual herb producing a single erect stem up to 80 centimeters tall from a taproot. It is coated in short, curly hairs. The toothed, deeply lobed leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and borne on petioles. They are evenly distributed along the stem. The inflorescence is a wide, spreading array of many flower heads, each lined with green- or black-tipped phyllaries. The heads contain yellow disc florets and most have very tiny yellow ray florets as well.|$|E
5000|$|The vegetational {{succession}} {{following the}} coppice is being carefully monitored {{by means of}} permanent quadrats. In {{the first year after}} coppicing, more than seventy species of flowering plant have been recorded here - a gratifying increase from the original flora of a mere six species. The newcomers include <b>heath</b> <b>groundsel,</b> which is unknown elsewhere in the Borough, suggesting the possibility that its seed may have lain dormant in the soil since the last coppice was cut before the Second World War. Ring counts of the coppice poles suggest that this was done about sixty years ago. The majority of new plants, however, will have colonised from outside and many of the arrivals are widespread [...] species typical of disturbed open habitats, such as mugwort, sow-thistles and willowherbs. Rosebay willowherb dominates much of the area. A hundred years ago this was a rare plant in southern England and it is noteworthy that it was recorded from Coldfall Wood as early as 1901 (Kent 1975). The appearance of Sumatran fleabane was not entirely unexpected, for it has spread rapidly throughout Haringey since first being recorded from the Borough in 1985 (Wurzell 1988). It is also present in North Wood. There can be few other ancient woods in Britain that include this subtropical species in their flora.|$|E
