50|$|In 1973 {{the glaze}} process started {{changing}} to meet more global standards. The most aggressive change {{was the use}} of glass powder based glazes instead of slip glazes.

40|$|The term glaze can {{be defined}} as a thin layer or coating that is used to coat or seal the ceramic substrate. The glazed ceramic product gives high strength, 0 % porosity, good {{chemical}} resistant, color, hardness, resistant to chemical attacks, high thermal shock resistant, glossiness, whiteness and decorate. Because of all these characteristic and properties in ceramic glazes which makes <b>glaze</b> useful <b>for</b> the various field such as electrical, chemical, mechanical, tile applications, tableware, sanitary-ware and refractory applications. In most cases of glazes to tile applications the major problem faced is defect like crazing and peeling due to presences of alkalis ions in the glaze composition which can be cured by developing an alkali-free <b>glass</b> system <b>for</b> <b>glaze</b> composition. <b>For</b> the present work an alkali-free glass system with composition 65 % SiO 2, 25 % B 2 O 3, 6 % Al 2 O 3, 2 %CaO and 2 % MgO (in wt %) has been prepared by melt quenching method.

40|$|Electrochromic {{device is}} an {{important}} functional device to control the amount of light through a glass. It usually used in sunlight control window <b>glazing</b> <b>for</b> buildings and automobile. The important feature of electrochromic glass {{is the ability to}} response toward the apply voltage in shortest time, and endurance to maintain in color shape after apply voltage. In this thesis, the oxygen gas percentage is optimized during the fabrication of tungsten trioxide (WO 3) as an electrochromic <b>glass</b> <b>for</b> window <b>glazing</b> application by using RF magnetron sputtering. The oxygen flow rate for the deposition is varied from 10 sccm - 22 sccm which is 25 %, 27 %, 30 %, and 35 % of oxygen flow. The structures of WO 3 were investigated using X-Ray diffraction, Field effect scanning electron microscopy (Fe-Sem) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The electrochromic properties were characterized by a cyclic voltammogram and UV-Vis absorption spectra. The results show that nanocrystalline film with particle size of 51. 54 nm was deposited at 27 % oxygen flow rate has the largest charge capacity and coloration efficiency among the others. The time respond taken for complete coloration at 4 V is 2 second. This result is a starting point for future work such as optimizing the film thickness or doping by other metals...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an experimental activityaimed at investigating the technical feasibility and the environmentalperformance of using municipal solid waste incinerationbottom ash to produce <b>glass</b> frit <b>for</b> ceramic <b>glaze</b> (glazefrit). The process includes an industrial pretreatment of bottomash that renders the material suitable for use in glazefrit production and allows recovery of aluminum and iron. The environmental performance of this treatment option isassessed with the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The goal of the LCA study is to assess and compare the environmentalimpacts of two scenarios of end of life of bottomash from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) : landfilldisposal (conventional scenario) and bottom ash recovery forglaze frit production (innovative scenario). The main results ofthe laboratory tests, industrial simulations, and LCA study arepresented and discussed, and the environmental advantages of recycling versus landfill disposal are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of thermal radiation by applying rigorous {{model for the}} radiative heat transfer combined with the conduction and the convection has been performed for a single and double window glazing subjected to solar and thermal irradiation. The glass window is analysed as a non-gray plane-parallel medium disctritized to thin layer as-suming the glass material as participating media in one-dimensional case, using the Radiation Element Method by Ray Emission Model (REM 2). The model allows the calculation of the steady-state heat flux and the temperature distribution within the glass cover. The spectral dependence of the relevant radiation properties of glass (i. e. specular reflectivity, refraction angle and absorption coefficient) is taken into account. Both solar and thermal incident irradiations are applied at the boundary surfaces using the spectral solar model proposed by Bird and Riordan. The optical constant of a commercial clear glass material have been used. The calculation has been performed during winter period {{and the effect of}} the thickness of the <b>glass</b> <b>for</b> a single <b>glazing</b> and of the air layer between the two panels <b>for</b> double <b>glazing</b> has been studied. The result shows that increasing the air layer, the steady heat flux decreases and the temperature distribution within the glass changes...|$|R
30|$|Currently, float <b>glass</b> {{products}} <b>for</b> façade <b>glazing</b> {{are available}} with a variable solar protection index value, obtained by the interposition {{of different kinds of}} solar radiation filters (microlouvers, metal mesh, etc.) or by alternating with reflective microprism surface treatments. However, these conventional protection solutions have three main disadvantages: they do {{not take into account the}} varying conditions of solar incidence due to latitude or the different orientations of each façade, and it is difficult to incorporate free glazing areas without any protective solar treatment in the same unit of glass. There is a search for innovative coatings to redirect incident solar radiation, thus simultaneously reducing glare and projecting daylight deep into the room. The solar gains are reduced for chosen angles corresponding to aestival elevations of the sun, thereby minimising heating loads in winter and cooling loads in summer. Ray-tracing programs [8] have been developed to optimise structures with the aforementioned goals. The chosen solution is based on embedded reflective surfaces that can be combined with a standard double glazed window.|$|R
40|$|Strong glass/solder/metal seals were {{prepared}} between float glass, tin solder and Fe-Ni alloys by the Activated Liquid Tin Solder Anodic Bonding (ALTSAB) process that combines classical anodic bonding with a liquid solder {{to ensure a}} near perfect contact between the bonding surfaces. The optimization of the Al content of the solder enables the production of glass/solder/metal joints without pre-treatment of the metal or glass surfaces. Strong glass/solder bonds are formed by anodic bonding across the oxide/metal interface and strong solder/metal bonds are formed simultaneously by soft soldering. The combined process consists of two very different processes and the optimal solder composition represents the middle ground between the requirements for both interfaces. The glass/solder bond strength increases with increasing Al content {{at the expense of}} the solder/metal bond strength: solders with a very low Al content of 75 ppm constitute the best compromise and result in the strongest glass/solder/metal joints. The optimal solder composition was used to anodically bond Dilaton Fe- 48 wt%Ni frames to the edge of 500 × 500 mm 2 float <b>glass</b> panes <b>for</b> vacuum <b>glazing</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{performances}} of three slit-glazed solar air heaters (SGSAHs) were investigated experimentally.

Ambient air was continuously withdrawn through {{the gaps between}} the glass panes by fans. The experiments were conducted for four different gap distances between the glass panes (0. 5 [*]mm, 1 [*]mm, 2 [*]mm, and 3 [*]mm) and the {{air mass flow rate}} was varied between 0. 014 [*]kg/s and 0. 057 [*]kg/s. The effects of air mass flux on the outlet temperature and thermal efficiency were studied. For the SGSAH with bed height of 7 [*]cm and glass pane gap distance of 0. 5 [*]mm, the highest efficiency was obtained as 82 % at a mass flow rate of 0. 057 [*]kg/s and the air temperature difference between the inlet and the outlet (∆T) was maximum (27 °C) when the mass flow rate was least. The results demonstrate that for lower mass flow rates and larger gaps, the performance of SGSAH with a bed height of 3 [*]cm was better compared to that of others.
