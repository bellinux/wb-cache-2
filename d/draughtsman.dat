He was educated at the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School from 1909, and {{was active in the}} school's Cadet unit.

5|$|In 1772, Forster's father {{became a}} member of the Royal Society. This and the {{withdrawal}} of Joseph Banks resulted in his invitation by the British admiralty to join James Cook's second expedition to the Pacific (1772–75). Georg Forster joined his father in the expedition again and was appointed as a <b>draughtsman</b> to his father. Johann Reinhold Forster's task was to work on a scientific report of the journey's discoveries that was to be published after their return.|$|E
5|$|In May 1839, after 18 {{months at}} the Royal Academy, Heaphy joined the New Zealand Company as a <b>draughtsman.</b> The company was {{established}} by Edward Wakefield as a private venture, to organise colonies in New Zealand and sought well-educated men as staff for planning and surveying new settlements in the country. Heaphy sailed with William Wakefield, Edward's brother, aboard the Tory on an expedition to purchase land suitable for settlement.

5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's needs, the Nclass was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine <b>draughtsman,</b> Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{grouping}} of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his Chief <b>Draughtsman</b> James Clayton incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and valve gear.|$|E

5|$|The {{modifications}} {{are attributed}} to Maunsell’s Chief <b>Draughtsman</b> James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works. They {{were the result of}} cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. The aim was to create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.|$|E
5|$|Two {{drawings}} {{on paper}} in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity. The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has been relegated to a <b>draughtsman</b> closely associated with Lochner.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, {{that it could have been}} the work of any talented <b>draughtsman.</b> The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E

50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1913 by 200 <b>draughtsmen,</b> as the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding <b>Draughtsmen</b> (AESD). It {{expanded}} rapidly, and had more than 14,000 member {{by the end of}} the decade. Although it declined during the Great Depression, it retained most of its members by offering unemployment benefit, and by 1939 established a new high of 23,000 members, this rising to 44,000 by the end of World War II and over 75,000 by 1968. From 1960, it accepted technicians in ancillary roles, changing its name to the Draughtsmen's and Allied Technicians' Association (DATA).|$|R
5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief <b>Draughtsman</b> at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Antoni Gaudí {{started his}} {{professional}} career while still at university. To {{pay for his}} studies, {{he worked as a}} <b>draughtsman</b> for some of the most outstanding Barcelona architects of the time, such as Joan Martorell, Josep Fontserè, Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, Leandre Serrallach and Emili Sala Cortés. Gaudí had a long-standing relationship with Josep Fontserè, since his family was also from Riudoms and they had known each other for some time. Despite not having an architecture degree, Fontserè received the commission from the city council for the Parc de la Ciutadella development, carried out between 1873 and 1882. For this project, Gaudí {{was in charge of the}} design of the Park's entrance gate, the bandstand's balustrade and the water project for the monumental fountain, where he designed an artificial cave that showed his liking for nature and the organic touch he would give his architecture.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} have {{prepared}} on paper before approaching his underdrawings; {{there is little evidence}} of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a <b>draughtsman</b> of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the latter}} part of the twentieth century, all {{architectural}} drawings were manually produced, either by architects or by trained (but less skilled) <b>draughtsmen</b> (or drafters), who did not generate the design, although they made many of the less important decisions. This system continues with CAD draughting: many design architects have little or no knowledge of CAD software programmes and rely upon others to take their designs beyond the sketch stage. <b>Draughtsmen</b> may specialize in a type of structure, such as residential or commercial, or in a type of construction: timber frame, reinforced concrete, prefabrication etc.|$|R
