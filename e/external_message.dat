If two tasks share data, each can gain exclusive access to variables by either disabling interrupts, locking the scheduler, using a semaphore, or preferably, using a mutual exclusion semaphore. Messages can be sent to either an intermediate object called a message queue, or directly to a task, since in µC/OS-III, each task has its own built-in message queue.

Most of the TTP and non-TTP based schemes seem to be impractical for being adopted in MANETs. A hybrid keymanagement scheme addressed these issues effectively by pre-assigned logins on offline basis and issuing certificates on its basis using 4 G services. However, the scheme did not taken into account the CRL status of servers; if it is embedded the nodes need to check frequently the server’s CRL status for authenticating any node and place <b>external</b> <b>messages</b> outside MANET which leads to overheads. We have tried to reduce them by introducing an online MANET Authority responsible for issuing certificates by considering the CRL status of servers, renewing them and key verification within MANET that has greatly reduced the <b>external</b> <b>messages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Opinion {{formation}} {{is an important}} element of social dynamics. It has been widely studied in the last years with tools from physics, mathematics and computer science. Here, a continuous model of opinion dynamics for multiple possible choices is analysed. Its main features are the inclusion of disagreement and possibility of modulating external information/media effects, both from one and multiple sources. The interest is in identifying the effect of the initial cohesion of the population, the interplay between cohesion and media extremism, and the effect of using multiple external sources of information that can influence the system. Final consensus, especially with the <b>external</b> <b>message,</b> depends highly on these factors, as numerical simulations show. When no external input is present, consensus or segregation is determined by the initial cohesion of the population. Interestingly, when only one external source of in{{formation is}} present, consensus can be obtained, in general, only when this is extremely neutral, i. e., {{there is not a single}} opinion strongly promoted, or in the special case of a large initial cohesion and low exposure to the <b>external</b> <b>message.</b> On the contrary, when multiple external sources are allowed, consensus can emerge with one of them even when this is not extremely neutral, i. e., it carries a strong message, for a large range of initial conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — It is a {{challenge}} to provide detection facilities for large scale distributed systems running legacy code on hosts that may not allow fault tolerant functions to execute on them. It is tempting to structure the detection in an observer system that is kept separate from the observed system of protocol entities, with the former only having access to the latter’s <b>external</b> <b>message</b> exchanges. In this paper we propose an autonomous self checking Monitor system, which is used to provide fast detection to underlying network protocols. The Monitor architecture is application neutral and therefore lends itself to deployment for different protocols, with the rulebase against which the observed interactions are matched making it specific to a protocol. To make the detection infrastructure scalable and dependable, we extend it to a hierarchical Monitor structure. The Monitor structure is made dynamic and reconfigurable by designing different interactions to cope with failures, load changes, or mobility. The latency of the Monitor system is evaluated under fault free conditions, while its coverage is evaluated under simulated error injections...|$|E

In the former case, the external eld is found to induce cultural ordering, a behavior opposite to that reported in pre-vious studies using a dierent prescription for the mass media interaction.

Various ways of enhancing these hash functions via message pre-processing or <b>external</b> <b>message</b> expansion have been proposed to make them resistant to known collision attacks. Message preprocessing/expansion {{is a way of}} creating a new hash function from an original one.

In this paper, we examine a novel approach to message pre-processing/expansion, which we call eXtremeShrinking ARC 4 Strengthening (or XSA-strengthening). XSA-strengthening is based on the idea of the self-shrinking generator, the ARC 4 cipher, and MD-strengthening and can be applied to any Merkle-Damg˚ard iterated hash function. XSA-strengthening is deterministic, has small space and computational overhead, and can be efficiently implemented.

We modified the original Deffuant et al. and Hegselmann and Krause models to incorporate both, an external mass media and a heterogeneous distribution of confidence levels. We analysed two cases, one where only two bounds of confidence are taken into account, and other were each individual of the system has her/his own characteristic level of confidence. We found that, in the absence of mass media, diversity of bounds of confidence can improve the capacity of the systems to reach consensus. We show that the persuasion capacity of the <b>external</b> <b>message</b> is optimal for intermediate levels of heterogeneity. Our simulations also show the existence, for certain parameter values, of a counter-intuitive effect in which the persuasion capacity of the mass media decreases if the mass media intensity is too large. We discuss similarities and differences between the two heterogeneous versions of these continuous opinion dynamic models under the influence of mass media...|$|E

The Qur‘ān should be read and understood in totality of its message and spirit. Its verses are local and universal.

It is an apt reply to the infidels that Qur‘ān is a message of God with a serious mission and motto. The Holy prophet used to ask people to recite the Holy poetry of Abu Tālib. Hassān bin thābit used to recite ‘Nāt’ {{in the presence of the}} Prophet. They enhanced the divine mission of the prophets through their facile pen and noble spirit. Hence in the light of above brief dissertation we can profess that Islam does not oppose poetry if it is written on didactic and divine lines. ...|$|E

Compared to The traditional banking services, the originality of this thesis is to make banking transactions easier and to enable interfacing of delivery channels such as phone banking or Internet banking and to enhance its usefulness and increase its security. The platform created acts as a gateway and message handler to allow any customer to access services by passing transactions to the core banking application. The unified platform will act as a middleware between the core banking application and delivery channels that are used to deliver services to the customer. The unified platform is capable of receiving various message formats. The message standard set by the international organization is the most common used format. We adopted this format used in other protocols to communicate with delivery channels to provide electronic banking services. The unified platform adopts IFX (International Financial eXchange) as the message standard that is used to communicate with the core banking system. So the main role of the unified platform is to act as an interface to transform various other external messages formats to IFX. For our practical implementation example, we used plain text format and ISO٨٥٨٣ as illustrations of <b>external</b> <b>message</b> format. IFX is adopted in financial applications as a standard format that is based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language), finally a brief description of messages standards and XML features and benefits is presented, followed by the security and the methods that used to increase the service channels security...|$|E

In spite of the bandwidth expansion and better storage solution, compression still plays an important role particularly in mobile devices and content delivery over Internet. While the requirement of compaction (in terms of retaining major audio components) drives the audio coding approaches, audio classification requires the extraction of subtle, accurate, and discriminatory information to group or index a variety of audio signals. It also covers a wide range of subapplications where the accuracy of the extracted audio information plays a vital role in content-based retrievals, sensing auditory environment for critical applications, and biometrics. Unlike compaction in audio coding or extraction of information in classification, to protect the digital audio content addition of information {{in the form of a}} security key is required which would then prove the ownership of the audio content. The addition of the <b>external</b> <b>message</b> (or key) should be in such a way that the addition does not cause perceptual distortions and remains robust from attacks to remove it. Considering the above requirements it would be difficult to address all the above application areas with a universal methodology unless we could model the audio signal as accurately as possible in a joint TF plane and then adaptively process the model parameters depending upon the application. In line with the above 3 application areas, this paper presents and discusses a TF-based audio coding scheme, music classification, audio classification of environmental sounds, audio fingerprinting, and audio watermarking.|$|E

To date, the most challenging lessons have been those that I have learned about myself. The manifestation of the person that I am today has been an adventure with many twists and turns. This piece aims to {{capture the essence of}} some of the lessons that I have learned. Each poem offers the product of that lesson. The movement entitled “Memories” has a subdued joy in its message. The poem offers nostalgia to begin the piece with. However, it is also a commentary on my own struggles with memory loss. The following movement, “The Musicians’ Wife,” is an exploration of relationships. While the <b>external</b> <b>message</b> may focus on the relationship with another person, the internal message is about the relationship with the self. The third movement, “The Road Not Taken,” is a poem by Robert Frost. The poem’s message is to encourage individuals to walk a different path than everyone else The fourth and fifth movement are centered around the idea of how I personally have come to learn the various lessons that life has offered. The projected message is that the most valuable lessons are those not easily learned. Finally, “O Me! O Life!” utilizes a Walt Whitman poem for the music. The poem, like the corresponding music, asks many hard questions. As it concludes the movement provides a simple and serene answer. The music written is not to accompany each of the poems.
