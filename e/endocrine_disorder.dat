25|$|Lipoid {{congenital}} adrenal hyperplasia is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorder</b> that is {{an uncommon}} and potentially lethal form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It arises from defects in the earliest stages of steroid hormone synthesis: the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria and the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone—the {{first step in the}} synthesis of all steroid hormones. Lipoid CAH causes mineralocorticoid deficiency in affected infants and children. Male infants are severely undervirilized causing their external genitalia to look feminine. The adrenals are large and filled with lipid globules derived from cholesterol.|$|E

40|$|The {{nervous system}} and the {{endocrine}} system are closely interrelated and both involved intimately in maintaining homeostasis. Endocrine dysfunctions may lead to various neurologic manifestations such as headache, myopathy, and acute encephalopathy including coma.

It is valuable to think about 'endocrine disorder' as a cause of the neurologic manifestations. Early diagnosis and treatment of hormonal imbalance can rapidly relieve the neurologic symptoms. Better understanding of the interaction between the endocrine {{system and the}} nervous system, combined with the knowledge about the pathophysiology of the neurologic manifestations presented in the <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders</b> might allow earlier diagnosis and better treatment of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

50|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorder</b> {{most commonly}} found in women of reproductive age that is characterized by oligo- or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries (PCO). This <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorder</b> increases AMH levels at nearly {{two to three times}} higher in women with PCOS than in normal type women. This is often attributed to the increased follicle count number characteristic of PCOS, indicating an increase in granulosa cells since they surround each individual egg. However, increased AMH levels have also been attributed not just to the increased number of follicles, but also to an increased amount of AMH produced per follicle. The high levels of androgens, characteristic of PCOS, also stimulate and provide feedback for increased production of AMH, as well. In this way, AMH has been increasingly considered to be a tool or biomarker {{that can be used to}} diagnose or indicate PCOS.|$|E

50|$|In general, hypoadrenocorticism is underdiagnosed in dogs, and {{one must}} have a {{clinical}} suspicion {{of it as an}} underlying disorder for many presenting complaints. Females are overrepresented, and the disease often appears in middle age (four to seven years), although any age or gender may be affected. Dogs with hypoadrenocorticism may also have one of several autoimmune disorders. Because it is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorder,</b> they may also suffer from neuropathy and some endocrine-related eye diseases.|$|E
50|$|Addison's disease, {{also known}} as primary adrenal {{insufficiency}} and hypocortisolism, is a long-term <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorder</b> in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones. Symptoms generally come on slowly and may include abdominal pain, weakness, and weight loss. Darkening of the skin in certain areas may also occur. Under certain circumstances, an adrenal crisis may occur with low blood pressure, vomiting, lower back pain, and loss of consciousness. An adrenal crisis can be triggered by stress, such as from an injury, surgery, or infection.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{causes of}} fatigue are ill defined, self {{limiting}} or elude diagnosis. Many <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders</b> present with nonspecific features including fatigue, so {{are difficult to}} differentiate on clinical grounds. However, avoiding diagnostic delay is vital to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, a high index of suspicion and knowledge of appropriate investigations is important. <b>Endocrine</b> <b>disorders</b> predispose the individual to developing related disorders; fatigue may be one sign of associated comorbidity. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders</b> that commonly present with or develop fatigue as a prominent feature, with emphasis on particular challenges for diagnosis, investigation or management. Screening recommendations for comorbid disease was generated by an extensive review of current evidence. DISCUSSION: The identification of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders</b> can be both challenging [...] due to patterns of presentation [...] and rewarding for doctors and patients alike, due to importance and effectiveness of treatment...|$|R
40|$|SummaryReproductive {{disorders}} are unusually common among {{women and men}} with epilepsy. They are generally associated with and may be the consequence of reproductive <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders.</b> Both epilepsy itself and antiepileptic drug use have been implicated in their pathophysiology. This review focuses on how temporolimbic dysfunction in epilepsy may disrupt normal neuroendocrine regulation and promote the development of reproductive <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders.</b> The particular nature of the dysregulation may relate to the laterality and focality of the epilepsy and some hormonal changes may develop in close temporal relation to the occurrence of epileptiform discharges. In women, reproductive <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders</b> include polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic amenorrhea, functional hyperprolactinemia, and premature menopause. In men, hypogonadism may be hypogonadotropic, hypergonadotropic or related to hyperprolactinemia. The significance of these reproductive <b>endocrine</b> <b>disorders</b> is that they may contribute not only to sexual dysfunction and infertility but may also have an adverse impact on seizure control...|$|R
