At length one of the mules, being about to give out from fatigue and famine, they hastened to dispatch him. Husbanding this miserable supply, they dried the flesh, and for three days subsisted upon the nutriment extracted from the bones. As to the meat, it was packed and preserved {{as long as they}} could do without it, not knowing how long they might remain bewildered in these <b>desolate</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E

Born in the track of the glacier and the avalanche, they seem to say to us that this Almighty Being is very pitiful, and of tender compassion; that, in his infinite soul, there is an exquisite gentleness and love of the beautiful, and that, if we would be blessed, his will to bless is infinite.|$|E

60|$|It {{was nine}} years before I {{revisited}} the neighbourhood. I travelled at that time with a tilt cart, a tent, and a cooking- stove, tramping all day beside the waggon, and at night, whenever it was possible, gipsying in a cove of the hills, or {{by the side of}} a wood. I believe I visited in this manner most of the wild and <b>desolate</b> <b>regions</b> both in England and Scotland; and, as I had neither friends nor relations, I was troubled with no correspondence, and had nothing in the nature of headquarters, unless it was the office of my solicitors, from whom I drew my income twice a year. It was a life in which I delighted; and I fully thought to have grown old upon the march, and at last died in a ditch.|$|E
60|$|We weighed anchor {{early in}} the morning and left Port Famine. Captain Fitz Roy {{determined}} to leave the Strait of Magellan by the Magdalen Channel, which had not long been discovered. Our course lay due south, down that gloomy passage which I have before alluded to as appearing to lead to another and worse world. The wind was fair, but the atmosphere was very thick; so that we missed much curious scenery. The dark ragged clouds were rapidly driven over the mountains, from their summits nearly down to their bases. The glimpses which we caught through the dusky mass were highly interesting; jagged points, cones of snow, blue glaciers, strong outlines, marked on a lurid sky, were seen at different distances and heights. In the midst of such scenery we anchored at Cape Turn, close to Mount Sarmiento, which was then hidden in the clouds. At the base of the lofty and almost perpendicular sides of our little cove there was one deserted wigwam, and it alone reminded us that man sometimes wandered into these <b>desolate</b> <b>regions.</b> But it would be difficult to imagine a scene where he seemed to have fewer claims or less authority. The inanimate works of nature--rock, ice, snow, wind, and water, all warring with each other, yet combined against man--here reigned in absolute sovereignty.|$|E
60|$|The English author, on {{the other}} hand, without supposing him less of a conjuror than the Northern Warlock, can, you observed, only have the liberty of {{selecting}} his subject amidst the dust of antiquity, where nothing was to be found but dry, sapless, mouldering, and disjointed bones, such as those which filled the valley of Jehoshaphat. You expressed, besides, your apprehension, that the unpatriotic prejudices of my countrymen would not allow fair play to such a work as that of which I endeavoured to demonstrate the probable success. And this, you said, was not entirely owing to the more general prejudice in favour of that which is foreign, but that it rested partly upon improbabilities, arising out of {{the circumstances in which}} the English reader is placed. If you describe to him a set of wild manners, and a state of primitive society existing in the Highlands of Scotland, he is much disposed to acquiesce in the truth of what is asserted. And reason good. If he be of the ordinary class of readers, he has either never seen those remote districts at all, or he has wandered through those <b>desolate</b> <b>regions</b> {{in the course of a}} summer tour, eating bad dinners, sleeping on truckle beds, stalking from desolation to desolation, and fully prepared to believe the strangest things that could be told him of a people, wild and extravagant enough to be attached to scenery so extraordinary. But the same worthy person, when placed in his own snug parlour, and surrounded by all the comforts of an Englishman's fireside, is not half so much disposed to believe that his own ancestors led a very different life from himself; that the shattered tower, which now forms a vista from his window, once held a baron who would have hung him up at his own door without any form of trial; that the hinds, by whom his little pet-farm is managed, a few centuries ago would have been his slaves; and that the complete influence of feudal tyranny once extended over the neighbouring village, where the attorney is now a man of more importance than the lord of the manor.|$|E

50|$|La Maraude {{describes}} the tactic employed by Napoleonic armies of scavenging local villages or enemy populations for supplies instead {{of relying on}} extended lines of supply. It was Napoleon’s belief that armies should be largely self-sufficient, as this freed them from the constraints of supply lines and allowed them to move far more quickly than their more static enemies. The tactic proved very successful in Western and central Europe but was less successful in the more <b>desolate</b> <b>regions</b> of Spain and Russia where food was less plentiful. marauding enabled French soldiers to develop {{a high degree of}} skill in living off the country. The tactic was particularly flawed whenever an army was forced to retreat over land which it had already scavenged as in the retreat from Moscow.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to trigger the {{preparation}} of an international development plan, which will aim to settle the deserts, which form a third of the area of the continents of the world. Design/methodology/approach – This plan will enhance projects aimed to provide food to the present and future starving populations. Findings – Warnings that starvation on a global scale is approaching were heard at the meeting of the World Summit on Food Security, held at the Food and Agriculture Organization Headquarters in Rome (16 - 18 November 2009) and at the UN Copenhagen Conference (7 - 18 December 2009). The warnings were based on the observations that global temperatures are increasing due to the ongoing and forecasted increase in green house gases, and because of the increase in the population in the developing countries. Practical implications – The settling of the deserts will be based on the conceptual model of Progressive Development, which will bring about the greening of the deserts by the utilizing the existing soil reserves and water reserves below and adjacent to the thus far empty and <b>desolate</b> <b>regions.</b> The development will proceed stage by stage from the utilization of shallow groundwater resources to the deeper aquifers and later to diversion of rivers flowing into the sea adjacent to the borders of the deserts. Social implications – Development of renewable energy resources and technical education of local population and new settlers will progress simultaneously. Originality/value – The plan revealed in the following paper is the original initiative of its writer. Deserts, Global warming, Natural disasters, Natural resources...|$|E
