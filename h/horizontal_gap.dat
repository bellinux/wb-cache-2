The cold outer air which he had felt before was now plainly flowing into the heated cabin through the opening. The swishing sound recommenced, and stopped.

Upon that intruding hand the bowie-knife of Demorest descended like a flash of lightning. There was no outcry.

Jwala Narasimha is in the shape of serpent, while Yogananda Narasimha appears sitting in meditation in yoga pose.

5000|$|That was usurped for 2011 {{by the new}} DRS (Drag Reduction System) {{rear wing}} system. This too allows drivers to make adjustments, but the system's {{availability}} is electronically governed - originally {{it could be used}} at any time in practice and qualifying (unless a driver is on wet-weather tyres), but during the race could only be activated when a driver is less than one second behind another car at pre-determined points on the track. (From 2013 DRS is available only at the pre-determined points during all sessions). The system is then deactivated once the driver brakes. The system [...] "stalls" [...] the rear wing by opening a flap, which leaves a 50mm <b>horizontal</b> <b>gap</b> in the wing, thus massively reducing drag and allowing higher top speeds, but also reducing downforce so it is normally used on longer straight track sections or sections which do not require high downforce. The system was introduced to promote more overtaking and is often the reason for overtaking on straights or at the end of straights where overtaking is encouraged in the following corner(s). However, the reception of the DRS system has differed among drivers, fans and specialists. Former Formula 1 driver Robert Kubica has been quoted of saying he [...] "has not seen any overtaking moves in Formula 1 for two years", suggesting that the DRS is an unnatural way to pass cars on track but it does not actually require driver skill to successfully overtake a competitor, therefore it would not be overtaking. The use of aerodynamics to increase the cars' grip was pioneered in Formula One in the late 1960s by Lotus, Ferrari and Brabham.|$|E

Materials and Methods. 51 patients received 60 dental implants in the present study over a 1 -year period. Measurement was performed between the implant shoulder and the most apical and horizontal marginal defect by periapical radiographs to examine the changes of peri-implant alveolar bone before and 12 months after prosthodontic restoration delivery. Results. These marginal bone measurements showed a bone gain of 0. 23 ± 0. 58 [*]mm in the vertical gap and 0. 22 ± 0. 53 [*]mm in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>gap</b> of platform matching, while in platform switching a bone gain of 0. 93 ± 1 [*]mm (P< 0. 05) in the vertical gap and 0. 50 ± 0. 56 [*]mm in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>gap</b> was found.

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{factors that}} may influence ridge alterations occurring at the buccal aspect of the extraction site following immediate implant placement. Material and methods: In 93 subjects, single-tooth implants were placed immediately into extraction sockets in the maxilla (tooth locations 15 - 25). A series of measurements describing the extraction site were made immediately after implant installation and at re-entry, 16 weeks later. The implant sites were stratified according to four factors: (i) implant location (anterior/posterior), (ii) cause of tooth extraction (periodontitis/non- periodontitis), (iii) thickness of the buccal bone walls (≤ 1 /> 1 mm) and (iv) the dimension of the horizontal buccal gap (≤ 1 /> 1 mm). Results: (i) The location where the implant was placed (anterior/posterior) as well as (ii) {{the thickness of the}} buccal bone crest and (iii) the size of the horizontal buccal gap significantly influenced the amount of hard tissue alteration that occurred during a 4 -month period of healing. At implant sites in the premolar segment, the fill of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>gap</b> was more pronounced than in the incisor-canine segment, while the vertical crest reduction was significantly smaller. Furthermore, at sites where the buccal bone wall was thick (> 1 mm) and where the <b>horizontal</b> <b>gap</b> was large (> 1 mm), the degree of gap fill was substantial.

40|$|In the UK, {{disposal}} of packaged intermediate-level radioactive waste may involve waste packages {{being placed in}} a geological disposal facility (GDF) and surrounded by a cementitious backfill. Cracking of the backfill could occur due {{to a number of}} mechanisms, and this could affect the post-closure performance of the GDF. This work has assessed potential cracking in the backfill during the backfilling and early post-closure period of GDF vaults with an open crown space in a higher strength rock. From the comprehensive range of processes considered, three were identified as potentially causing cracking: (1) during backfilling, plastic settlement under solid horizontal surfaces could result in <b>horizontal</b> <b>gaps</b> beneath waste packages; (2) within days of backfilling, early-age thermal contraction of the backfill could result in primarily vertical cracks; (3) over a number of years, expansion of waste packages could result in large horizontal cracks. A groundwater flow model incorporating a representation of the cracks was used to calculate flows through a backfilled GDF vault, and through the cracks themselves. Including cracks increased the flow rate significantly. A reactive transport model was used to estimate the evolution of the pore water chemistry as groundwater flows through the cracked backfill.
