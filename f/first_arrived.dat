5|$|In 1804, {{fifty years}} before the city of Omaha was founded, the Lewis and Clark Expedition <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> via the Missouri River. The 1806 Fort Lisa and 1820 Cabanne's Trading Post were {{important}} fur trading outposts located in proximity to the river, along with earlier Fontenelle's Post in Bellevue. The Engineer Cantonment was built by Captain Stephen Watts Kearny's Yellowstone Expedition in 1819.

5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek was {{historically}} {{known as}} Popemetang, {{but it was}} known as Roaring Creek by the late 1700s. Settlers such as Quakers <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> {{in the area in}} the 1770s. In the 19th century, various mills and furnaces were constructed on the creek and several bridges were constructed. Agriculture was also a major industry in the watershed in the early 20th century. More bridges were constructed across the creek in the 20th century. The Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since antiquity, {{first by the}} Ohlone and Miwok peoples, followed by the Spanish, who <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> in 1769 and established the area's first mission, Mission San Francisco de Asís, in 1776. After being ceded to the United States in 1848, the Bay Area grew immensely due to the California Gold Rush, establishing itself {{as one of the}} most important regions on the West Coast. Today, the Bay Area is the home of Silicon Valley, Wine Country, and numerous companies, universities, bridges, airports, and parks.|$|E

5|$|The Normans <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> in Southern Italy in 1015 from {{northern}} France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire. As {{they were paid}} with lands, soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the Pope at the Battle of Civitate, forcing him to acknowledge their authority. In 1059, the Pope made Robert Guiscard, of the Hauteville family, Duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in Saracen hands.|$|E

The fighting helped prevent a Japanese occupation of Australia, but resulted in 60,000 East Timorese deaths.|$|E

5|$|The {{land that}} became Sullivan County was {{originally}} part of Northumberland County, then {{became part of}} Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. Settlers <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> in the park's townships in 1794. Shrewsbury Township was formed from Muncy Township in 1803, and Forks Township was formed from Shrewsbury Township in 1833, both while still part of Lycoming County. Sullivan County was formed from the northeastern part of Lycoming County on March 15, 1847.|$|E
5|$|When Europeans <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> to Canada {{they relied}} on Aboriginal peoples for fur trading skills and survival.

5|$|After he {{was told}} that the Dutch had {{followed}} him, Tiku ordered most of his followers to return to Tondon while he and a group of fifteen, including his two wives, continued south. They <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> at Ambeso, but the fortress fell several days later, at which time they evacuated to Alla'. This fortress fell at the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to work his way back to Tondon through the forest. He and the other leaders, Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops. The other leaders capitulated to the Dutch and were sentenced to either three years in a prison in Makassar or exile to Buton. Tiku, meanwhile, stayed hidden in the forests.|$|E

5|$|Aircrew {{training}} {{using the}} F-4Es began {{three days after}} the aircraft <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> at Amberley. The aircraft were initially operated as a pool controlled by No.82 Wing (the parent headquarters for No.1 and No.6 Squadrons) and were allocated between the two squadrons only after all the Phantoms, aircrew and ground crew had arrived in Australia. The training program gradually increased in complexity, with night flying beginning in October, practice-bombing sorties commencing in late November and air-to-air sorties being flown from January 1971. Ground attack missions were practiced from February 1971, and in June that year the Phantoms began dropping live bombs during exercises. The introduction of several of the aircraft into service was delayed by an initial shortage of spare parts, but all were operational by the end of 1970.|$|E
5|$|Before the Spanish conquest, Chiapas was {{inhabited}} {{by a variety}} of indigenous peoples, including the Zoques, various Maya peoples, such as the Lakandon Ch'ol and the Tzotzil, and an unidentified group referred to as the Chiapanecas. Soconusco had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire, centred in Valley of Mexico, and paid the Aztecs tribute. News of strangers <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> in the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew the Aztec Empire. In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Cristóbal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comitán, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave-raiding rights.|$|E
5|$|Despite renewed {{interest}} from Camacho, then coach of Osasuna, Pablo moved to England, where {{he signed a}} three-year deal with West Bromwich Albion, newly returned to the Premier League, to begin on 1 July 2010 when his contract with Atlético expired. He made his debut on {{the opening day of}} the season, partnering Gabriel Tamaș in central defence as Albion lost 6–0 at Chelsea, and scored his first goal ten days later, in a 2–0 win at League One (third-tier) club Leyton Orient in the League Cup. He was used sporadically, making only ten Premier League appearances, of which just two came in 2011. Teammate Jonas Olsson suggested that it took at least a season to accustom oneself to English football, especially for someone who spoke little English when he <b>first</b> <b>arrived.</b>|$|E
