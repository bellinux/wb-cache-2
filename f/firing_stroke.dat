50|$|A {{variation}} on the opposed-piston engine is the free-piston engine, which was patented in 1934 by Raúl Pateras de Pescara. It has no crankshaft, and the pistons are returned after each <b>firing</b> <b>stroke</b> by compression and expansion of air in a separate cylinder. Early applications were for use as an air compressor or as a gas generator for a gas turbine, such as the Pratt & Whitney PT1 design. There is now renewed interest in it for powering vehicles by using it to drive a linear alternator.|$|E

When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid <b>fire</b> <b>strokes</b> all in an effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|R
50|$|Every {{cylinder}} added beyond five {{increases the}} overlap of <b>firing</b> <b>strokes</b> and makes for less primary order vibration. An inline-six gets a power stroke every 120 degrees. So {{there is more}} overlap (180° - 120° = 60°) than in a five-cylinder engine (180° - 144° = 36°). However, this increase in smoothness of a six-cylinder engine over a five-cylinder engine is not as pronounced {{as that of a}} five-cylinder engine over a four-cylinder engine. The inline-five loses less power to friction as compared to an inline-six. It also uses fewer parts, and it is physically shorter, so it requires less room in the engine bay, allowing for transverse mounting.|$|R

5000|$|The {{abstract}} reads: [...] "A virtual three-stroke engine with {{intake and}} compression strokes approximately {{one half of}} the power stroke of approximately 12 to one expansion ratio and with total <b>firing</b> cycle <b>stroke</b> lengths equal to approximately three expansion strokes to minimize engine throttling and frictional losses over the real world drive cycle and provide high torque from a one-to-one drive shaft RPM to engine firing cycle RPM provided by a cam type driver for controlling the piston motions and extracting the power from the piston".|$|R
50|$|This {{method of}} {{speed-control}} {{is often referred}} to as the Hit or Miss method because the engine mis-fires (for lack of fuel-mixture) on those power-strokes where the engine is running faster than the governed speed, but will hit (<b>fire)</b> on power <b>strokes</b> where the speed is too low. Note that no fuel is used on the mis-fire strokes.|$|R
40|$|Cylinder {{deactivation}} improves {{part load}} fuel economy in spark-ignition engines by reducing pumping losses. The efficiency {{benefits of a}} new intake valve system that enables flexible deactivation of different cylinders are investigated in this study. The intake valve system involves two intake valves in series, with a fast solenoid-actuated valve upstream of a conventional cam-actuated intake poppet valve. Compared to conventional cam-actuated variable valve timing, the new valve system has potential to achieve {{a high degree of}} flexibility in respect of the timing of inlet valve closure, while requiring lower actuation forces than fully-flexible valve actuation systems that act directly on the poppet valves. The fuel economy benefits provided by a number of valve control strategies are evaluated using a one-dimensional modelling approach, considering a vehicle following the New European Drive Cycle. Use of the intake valve system to control load by deactivation of different percentages of <b>firing</b> <b>strokes</b> is predicted to offer a very substantial improvement in fuel economy, achieving as much as a 43 % fuel saving over the New European Drive Cycle compared to throttled engine operation. Use of flexible cylinder deactivation also affords fuel savings and thermal management benefits compared to more conventional cylinder deactivation schemes in which a fixed subset of the cylinders, typically one half, are deactivated at one time. The use of the valve system to make fine adjustments to the intake valve closure timing, as opposed to deactivation, is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|A Master's Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of M. Phil of Loughborough University. The control of hydrocarbon emissions from spark ignition engines is important {{and there is a}} need for a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to this source of emissions. The absorption/desorption mechanism is believed to be a significant contributor to hydrocarbon emissions. The aim of the project has been to validate the absorption/desorption model experimentally. Modelling studies predict that sufficient fuel vapour is absorbed into the cylinder wall oil film on the compression and early <b>firing</b> <b>strokes</b> with subsequent desorption late in the expansion stroke to seriously affect hydrocarbon emissions in the exhaust, as temperatures are too low for adequate oxidation. The experimental investigation which follows develops a method to allow accurate measurement of hydrocarbon specie levels in the exhaust of a spark ignition engine. The object of the experiment was to detect and measure differences in hydrocarbon levels for two fuels, Iso-octane and Iso-pentane, at identical engine conditions and therefore establish whether the absorption/desorption effect is significant to hydrocarbon emissions. The theory behind this relies upon the varying solubilities of both fuels in a given oil with temperature wh ich shoul d refl ect a varyi ng base fuel hydrocarbon emissions level for each fuel if absorption/desorption is in fact taking place. Samples of exhaust were taken from a Ricardo-hydra test engine and analysed chromatographically. Experimental results (which compare favourably with prediction from modell ing studies) indicate about 30 percent of total hydrocarbons are due to the absorption/desorption mechanism. In conclusion, the results suggest that the solubility of the fuel in the engine oil has a significant effect on hydrocarbon levels in the exhaust...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Wildland fires {{attributed}} to lightning ignitions in Victoria, Australia, are examined systematically {{through the use}} of lightning occurrence data. Lightning stroke data were obtained by a network of ground-based lightning detection sensors over a 9 -year period. Characteristics of these fires are examined including the temporal variability in the average chance of fire occurrence per lightning stroke and the time period from lightning ignition of a fire until the fire grows large enough to be first observed, as well as distributions of fire duration and total area burnt. It is found that the time of day that lightning occurs does not have a significant influence on the chance of <b>fire</b> per lightning <b>stroke,</b> in contrast to the time of year, for which a significant annual variation occurs. Regional variability is examined by discussing the results for Victoria, Australia, in relation to results of studies {{from other parts of the}} world...|$|R
5000|$|The new station’s lens was {{installed}} and tested in June 1895, however, its full-time service was delayed until mid-August so mariners could be properly informed of the station’s new light characteristic. Lt. Frederick Mahan of the Lighthouse Board proposed that all U.S. lighthouses be given a “numerical flash” pattern. The first-order lens at Cape Charles made a complete revolution every thirty seconds, producing nine flashes: four quick flashes followed by a dark interval of three seconds, then five more flashes followed by sixteen seconds of darkness. Cape Charles would thus have a 4-5 pattern, and mariners could easily associate these numbers with Cape Charles. This numbering system was likened to a <b>fire</b> alarm bell <b>stroking</b> out the exact numerical identity of a beleaguered building. “By this method,” Mahan maintained, “the light is identified absolutely…” Due to {{the high cost of}} these special lenses, only the “4-5” light at Cape Charles, and the “1-4-3” light at Minots Ledge were ever deployed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHuman C-tactile (CT) afferents respond vigorously to gentle skin {{stroking}} {{and have}} gained attention for their importance in social touch. Pharmacogenetic {{activation of the}} mouse CT equivalent has positively reinforcing, anxiolytic effects, suggesting a role in grooming and affiliative behavior. We recorded from single CT axons in human participants, using the technique of microneurography, and stimulated a unit's receptive field using a novel, computer-controlled moving probe, which stroked {{the skin of the}} forearm over five velocities (0. 3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 cm s 1) at three temperatures (cool, 18 °C; neutral, 32 °C; warm, 42 °C). We show that CTs are unique among mechanore-ceptive afferents: they discharged preferentially to slowly moving stimuli at a neutral (typical skin) temperature, rather than at the cooler or warmer stimulus temperatures. In contrast, myelinated hair mechanoreceptive afferents proportionally increased their <b>firing</b> frequency with <b>stroking</b> velocity and showed no temperature modulation. Furthermore, the CT firing frequency correlated with hedonic ratings to the same mechano-thermal stimulus only at the neutral stimulus temperature, where the stimuli were felt as pleasant at higher firing rates. We conclude that CT afferents are tuned to respond to tactile stimuli with the specific characteristics of a gentle caress delivered at typical skin temperature. This provides a peripheral mechanism for signaling pleasant skin-to-skin contact in humans, which promotes interpersonal touch and affiliative behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{heme oxygenase}} (HO) and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) systems display notable {{similarities}} {{as well as}} differences. HO and NOS are both oxidative enzymes using NADPH as an electron donor. The constitutive forms of the enzyme are differentially activated, with calcium entry stimulating NOS by binding to calmodulin, whereas calcium entry activates protein kinase C to phosphorylate and activate HO 2. Although both NO and carbon monoxide (CO) stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase to form cGMP, NO also S-nitrosylates selected protein targets. Both involve constitutive and inducible biosynthetic enzymes. However, functions of the inducible forms are virtual opposites. Macrophage-inducible NOS generates NO to kill other cells, whereas HO 1 generates bilirubin to exert antioxidant cytoprotective effects and also provides cytoprotection by facilitating iron extrusion from cells. The neuronal form of HO, HO 2, is also cytoprotective. Normally, neural NO in the brain seems to exert some sort of behavioral inhibition. However, excess release of NO in response to glutamate's N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation leads to stroke damage. On the other hand, massive neuronal <b>firing</b> during a <b>stroke</b> presumably activates HO 2, leading to neuroprotective actions of bilirubin. Loss of this neuroprotection after HO inhibition by mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein may mediate neurotoxicity in Familial Alzheimer's Disease. NO and CO both appear to be neurotransmitters {{in the brain and}} peripheral autonomic nervous system. They also are physiologic endothelial-derived relaxing factors for blood vessels. In the gastrointestinal pathway, NO and CO appear to function as coneurotransmitters, both stimulating soluble guanylyl cyclase to cause smooth muscle relaxation...|$|R
40|$|Muscle {{weakness}} {{is the most}} common outcome after stroke and a leading cause of adult-acquired motor disability. Single motor unit properties provide insight into the mechanisms of post-stroke motor impairment. Motor units on the more-affected side are reported to have lower peak firing rates, reduced discharge variability and a more compressed dynamic range than healthy subjects. The activity of 169 motor units was discriminated from surface EMG in 28 stroke patients during sustained voluntary contractions 10 % of maximal and compared to 110 units recorded from 16 healthy subjects. Motor units were recorded in three series: ankle dorsiflexion, wrist flexion and elbow flexion. Mean <b>firing</b> rates after <b>stroke</b> were significantly lower on the more-affected than the less-affected side (p< 0. 001) with no between-side differences for controls. When data were combined, firing rates on the less-affected side were significantly higher than those either on the more-affected side or healthy subjects (p< 0. 001). Motor unit mean firing rate was higher in the upper-limb than the lower-limb (p< 0. 05). The coefficient of variation of motor unit discharge rate was lower for motor units after stroke compared to controls for wrist flexion (p< 0. 05) but not ankle dorsiflexion. However, the dynamic range of motor units was compressed only for motor units on the more-affected side during wrist flexion. Our results show that the pathological change in motor unit firing rate occurs on the less-affected side after stroke and not the more-affected side as previously reported, and suggest that motor unit behavior recorded in a single muscle after stroke cannot be generalized to muscles acting on other joints even within the same limb. These data emphasize that the less-affected side does not provide a valid control for physiological studies on the more-affected side after stroke and that both sides should be compared to data from age- and sex-matched healthy subjects...|$|R
