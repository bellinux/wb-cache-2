The {{character}} named Santiago Nasar is based on a good friend from García Márquez's childhood, Cayetano Gentile Chimento. Pelayo classifies this novel as a combination of journalism, realism and <b>detective</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|For , {{a planned}} {{expansion}} to Halo 3 {{that became a}} full game, O'Donnell and Salvatori abandoned all previous Halo themes and started anew. Due to ODSTs shift to a new protagonist, O'Donnell created new music that was evocative of past Halo but branched in a different direction. Since Bungie was aiming for a smaller, <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> feel, O'Donnell felt that a jazz-influenced approach worked best in echoing the film noir atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's next Tintin story, The Broken Ear (1935–37), was {{the first}} for which the plot {{synopsis}} had been outlined from the start, being a <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> that took Tintin to South America. It introduced the character of General Alcazar, and also saw Hergé introduce the first fictional countries into the series, San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico, two republics based largely on Bolivia and Paraguay.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{immediately}} {{embark on}} {{the creation of a new}} Tintin adventure, Hergé agreed to a proposal that Le Soir crime writer, Paul Kinnet, would author a <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> featuring Thomson and Thompson. The story was titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives (Thomson and Thompson, Detectives), and was illustrated by Hergé.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{central theme}} {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{also began}} work on the fragmentary writing Soborul țațelor ("The Council of Busibodies", 1929) and the <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> Sub pecetea tainei ("Under the Seal of Secrecy", 1930), but they would remain unfinished. In its first draft, Sub pecetea tainei was {{published}} by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933, while Soborul țațelor was kept in three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for Sub pecetea tainei, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its plot was meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to wrongly assume that the text ended abruptly.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's next Adventure of Tintin {{would be}} The Secret of the Unicorn, serialised in Le Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had {{introduced}} many elements {{from the work}} of Jules Verne into the <b>detective</b> <b>story,</b> in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. The Secret of the Unicorn marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised in Le Soir from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.|$|E

When the Theatre Guild revived George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan later in the same year, with Uta Hagen in the title role, Scourby was cast as Peter Cauchon, the Bishop of Beauvais.
