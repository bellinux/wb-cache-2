5|$|Since the {{eruption}} of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three <b>dozen</b> <b>times.</b> It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian Cassius Dio. In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported {{as far away as}} Constantinople. The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted exemption from taxes by Theodoric the Great, the Gothic king of Italy. Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded lava flows. The volcano became quiescent {{at the end of the}} 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater was moderately filled with shrubbery.|$|E

At 10:00 on 20 June, the team again ascended the mountain. Bernt Porten climbed halfway up at least a <b>dozen</b> <b>times,</b> taking water up and bringing down bodies wrapped in tarpaulin.

5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England {{and took}} {{much of the}} land north of Durham. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the {{counties}} of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing {{for the most part}} the modern England–Scotland border. The region also saw violence during the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day conception of the war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic – Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, and in just 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed – now the northernmost town in England – changed hands more than a <b>dozen</b> <b>times.</b> The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle south of the border, chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> before surfacing to breathe.|$|E

25|$|While gliding occurs {{independently}} from powered flight, it {{has some}} ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very energy-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as fruits, nectar, and insects. In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> among extant vertebrates), however these groups have not radiated {{nearly as much as}} have groups of flying animals.|$|E

25|$|Schwartz and Ballard were {{introduced}} to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and sold him {{on the idea of}} developing a new rechargeable lithium battery technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that no one knew what the product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium dithionite, which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium dithionite, and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about a <b>dozen</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
