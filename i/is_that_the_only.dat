Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} allocator proposal incorporated some language {{features that}} had not yet been accepted by the committee, namely the ability to use template arguments that are themselves templates. Since these features could not be compiled by any existing compiler, there was, according to Stepanov, [...] "an enormous demand on Bjarne 's and Andy 's time trying to verify that we were using these non-implemented features correctly." [...] Where the library had previously used pointer and reference types directly, it would now only refer to the types defined by the allocator. Stepanov later described allocators as follows: [...] "A nice feature of STL <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> place that mentions the machine-related types (...) is encapsulated within roughly 16 lines of code." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

500|$|All {{acknowledged}} subject {{experts and}} authorities {{agree that there}} is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of [...] "Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.|$|E

2500|$|Bipolar {{instruments}} {{generally are}} designed with two [...] "active" [...] electrodes, such as a forceps for sealing blood vessels.

2500|$|For filmmakers to {{do justice}} to the biblical {{accounts}} of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism. Absent such scholarly and theological understanding, productions such as The Passion could likely falsify history and fuel the animus of those who hate Jews. Rabbi Daniel Lapin, the head of the Toward Tradition organization, criticized this statement, and said of Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL, [...] "what he is saying <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate your faith".|$|E

2500|$|Many times an {{individual}} has a physical sickness {{and goes to the}} physician for help. But <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> kind of sickness there is? Kierkegaard was interested in spiritual sickness called sin and the expectancy of forgiveness which are both Christian categories. We [...] "must want to understand the forgiveness of sins-and then despair of understanding it." [...] Later, in The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard writes of the sin of despairing over one's sin and the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins. Robert L. Perkins from Mercer University published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to fear and wonder within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.|$|E
