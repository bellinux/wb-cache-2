5|$|This <b>homophonic</b> choral {{passage is}} {{followed}} by the first of three short four-bar orchestral ritornellos, with a texture that has already been heard very briefly in the bar when the chorus pause between the fugato and <b>homophonic</b> passages. As in the opening sinfonia, the instruments play in four distinct groups—alto recorders, oboes, upper strings and continuo—but the sparseness there is now replaced by a jubilant canzona-style flourish.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Indonesia (i.e. in {{the music}} of the Toraja in South Sulawesi, in Flores, in East Kalimantan and in North Sulawesi), two-part harmonies are common, usually in {{intervals}} of thirds, fourths or fifths. Additionally, much music of the Middle East is generally <b>homophonic,</b> although polyphony is also an important texture, while Chinese music is generally thought to be <b>homophonic,</b> since instruments typically provide accompaniment in parallel fourths and fifths and often double the voice in vocal music, heterophony also being common in China.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} section in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, the predominant mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two <b>homophonic</b> episodes; here a <b>homophonic</b> episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Jazz {{and other}} forms of modern popular music {{generally}} feature <b>homophonic</b> influences, following chord progressions over which musicians play a melody or improvise (see melody-dominated homophony).|$|E
5|$|A <b>homophonic</b> texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts have the same rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of {{homophony}}. The {{most common type of}} homophony is melody-dominated homophony, in which one voice, often the highest, plays a distinct melody, and the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony.|$|E
5|$|After the fugato episode, the ritornello resumes {{for a third}} time, {{with the}} chorus singing a variant of their <b>homophonic</b> {{material}} {{with much of the}} counterpoint inverted; this time, however, there is no fugal episode inserted before the final two bar cadence.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is scored for five-part choir, woodwinds and strings. As the Dresden Mass style required, it {{opens with a}} short <b>homophonic</b> section, followed by an extended fugue in two sections, which both begin with an instrumental fugue.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his French chansons, he wrote at least three pieces {{in the manner of}} the Italian frottola, a popular Italian song form which he would have encountered during his years in Milan. These songs include Scaramella, El grillo, and In te domine speravi. They are even simpler in texture than his French chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and <b>homophonic,</b> and they remain among the most frequently sung portions of his output.|$|E
5|$|Monody {{is similar}} to melody-dominated {{homophony}} in that one voice becomes the melody, while another voice assumes the underlying harmony. Monody, however, {{is characterized by a}} single voice with instrumental accompaniment, whereas melody-dominated homophony refers to a broader category of <b>homophonic</b> music, which includes works for multiple voices, not just works for solo voice, as was the tradition with early 17th-century Italian monody.|$|E
5|$|Homophony first {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the predominant textures in Western classical music during the Baroque period in the early 17th century, when composers began to commonly compose with vertical harmony in mind, the <b>homophonic</b> basso continuo becoming a definitive feature of the style. The choral arrangement of four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has since become common in Western classical music. Homophony began by appearing in sacred music, replacing polyphony and monophony as the dominant form, but spread to secular music, for which {{it is one of the}} standard forms today.|$|E
5|$|Josquin's motet style {{varied from}} almost {{strictly}} <b>homophonic</b> settings with block chords and syllabic text declamation to highly ornate contrapuntal fantasias, to the psalm settings which combined these extremes {{with the addition}} of rhetorical figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he was also a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices. No motets of more than six voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin.|$|E
5|$|The altos and tenors {{are joined}} after seven bars by the fugue {{subject in the}} soprano voice. After a further seven bars the basses sing the last {{statement}} of the subject, accompanied by the full orchestra playing colla parte except for the two alto recorders, bringing the first fugato section to a close. The alto recorders play fragmented quaver figures in unison {{some of which are}} derived from the angular three-note continuo motif, leading into the first seven bar <b>homophonic</b> choral passage.|$|E
5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers on the beat in the oboes and off the beat in the alto recorders. It leads directly into the <b>homophonic</b> coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E
5|$|Josquin lived {{during a}} {{transitional}} stage in music history. Musical styles were changing rapidly, in part {{owing to the}} movement of musicians between different regions of Europe. Many northern musicians moved to Italy, {{the heart of the}} Renaissance, attracted by the Italian nobility's patronage of the arts; while in Italy, these composers were influenced by the native Italian styles, and often brought those ideas with them back to their homelands. The sinuous musical lines of the Ockeghem generation, the contrapuntal complexity of the Netherlanders, and the <b>homophonic</b> textures of the Italian lauda and secular music began to merge into a unified style; indeed Josquin was to be the leading figure in this musical process, which eventually resulted in the formation of an international musical language, of which the most famous composers included Palestrina and Lassus.|$|E
5|$|Later the Calvinism {{that came}} to {{dominate}} the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms. The Scottish Psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church. It drew {{on the work of}} French musician Clément Marot, Calvin's contributions to the Strasbourg Psalter of 1539 and English writers, particularly the 1561 edition of the Psalter produced by William Whittingham for the English congregation in Geneva. The intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm, but of 150 psalms, 105 had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century, common tunes, which could be used for psalms with the same metre, became more frequent. Because whole congregations would now sing these psalms, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns, there was a need for simplicity and most church compositions were confined to <b>homophonic</b> settings.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation had {{a severe}} impact on church music. The song {{schools of the}} abbeys, cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down, choirs disbanded, music books and manuscripts {{destroyed}} and organs removed from churches. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship, drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs. The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis, which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms. The Scottish Psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church. It drew {{on the work of}} French musician Clément Marot, Calvin's contributions to the Strasbourg Psalter of 1529 and English writers, particularly the 1561 edition of the Psalter produced by William Whittingham for the English congregation in Geneva. The intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm, but of 150 psalms, 105 had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century. Common tunes, which could be used for psalms with the same metre, became more frequent. The need for simplicity for whole congregations that would now all sing these psalms, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns, necessitated simplicity and most church compositions were confined to <b>homophonic</b> settings. There is evidence that polyphony survived and it was incorporated into editions of the Psalter from 1625, but usually with the congregation singing the melody and trained singers the contra-tenor, treble and bass parts.|$|E
25|$|Stylistically, {{his music}} is more <b>homophonic</b> than {{much of the}} music by his English contemporaries, who still {{preferred}} a polyphonic idiom.|$|E
25|$|The strongest <b>homophonic</b> (harmonic) cadence, the {{authentic}} cadence, dominant to tonic (D-T, V-I or V7-I), {{is in part}} created by the dissonant tritone created by the seventh, also dissonant, in the dominant seventh chord, which precedes the tonic.|$|E
25|$|Language letter {{frequencies}} {{may offer}} little help for some extended historical encryption {{techniques such as}} <b>homophonic</b> cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.|$|E
25|$|A {{texture of}} similar density {{is also found}} in the ending of the shorter D minor piece, where three voices engage in {{imitative}} counterpoint. In pairs of preludes and fugues Pachelbel aimed to separate <b>homophonic,</b> improvisatory texture of the prelude from the strict counterpoint of the fugue.|$|E
25|$|Common types {{included}} monophonic texture (a single melodic voice, {{such as a}} {{piece for}} solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), polyphonic texture and <b>homophonic</b> texture (chords accompanying a melody).|$|E
25|$|In present participles of the {{thematic}} verb classes, the feminine ī-suffix {{along with the}} <b>homophonic</b> neuter dual {{is attached to the}} aṅga stem in -nt. In the athematic classes, it may be attached to either; in the reduplicated athematic class no aṅga-based forms are used at all, so it is again attached to the -t stem.|$|E
25|$|Because many {{different}} Hanja—and thus, {{many different}} words written using Hanja—often {{share the same}} sounds, two distinct Hanja words (Hanjaeo) may be spelled identically in the phonetic Hangul alphabet. Since Hanja's language of origin, Chinese, has many homophones, Hanja words became even more <b>homophonic</b> when they came into Korean since Korean lacks a tonal system, which is how Chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise make them <b>homophonic</b> to each other. For example, while 道, 刀, and 島 are all phonetically distinct in Mandarin, which are pronounced dào, dāo, and dǎo respectively, they are all pronounced do (도) in Korean. Thus, Hanja are often used to clarify meaning, either on their own without the equivalent Hangul spelling, or in parentheses after the Hangul spelling {{as a kind of}} gloss. Hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines, advertisements, and on signs, for example the banner at the funeral for the sailors lost in the sinking of ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772).|$|E
25|$|The Russian phonetic {{keyboard}} layout (also called <b>homophonic</b> or transliterated) {{is widely used}} outside Russia, where normally there are no Russian letters drawn on keyboard buttons. This layout is made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts, like the common English QWERTY keyboard, and follows the Greek and Armenian layouts in placing most letters at the corresponding Latin letter locations. It is famous among both native speakers and people who use, teach, or are learning Russian, and is recommended — along with the Standard Layout — by the linguists, translators, teachers and students of AATSEEL.org. The earliest known implementation of the Cyrillic-to-QWERTY <b>homophonic</b> keyboard was by former AATSEEL officer Constance Curtin between 1972 and 1976, for the PLATO education system's Russian Language curriculum developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Curtin's design sought to map phonetically related Russian sounds to QWERTY keys, to map proximate phonetic and visual cues nearby one another, {{as well as to}} map unused positions in a mnemonically ideal way. Peter Zelchenko worked under Curtin at UIUC, and his later modifications to the number row for Windows and Macintosh keyboards follow Curtin's original design intent.|$|E
25|$|His thirty chansons show a {{diversity}} of style, some being akin to the late Burgundian style (for example, as seen in Hayne van Ghizeghem or Gilles Binchois), and others using a more current imitative polyphonic style. Since La Rue never spent time in Italy, he never picked up the Italian frottola style which featured light, <b>homophonic</b> textures (which Josquin used so effectively in his popular El Grillo and Scaramella), and which so charmed {{the other members of}} his generation.|$|E
25|$|Around 1500, Mouton {{seems to}} have {{become more aware of}} chords and {{harmonic}} feeling, probably due to his encounter with Italian music. At any rate this was a period of transition between purely linear thinking in music, in which chords were incidental occurrences as a result of correct usage of intervals, and music in which the harmonic element was foremost (for example in lighter Italian forms such as the frottola, which are <b>homophonic</b> in texture and sometimes have frankly diatonic harmony).|$|E
25|$|Certon wrote eight masses that survive, motets, psalm settings, chansons spirituelles (chansons with {{religious}} texts, {{related to the}} Italian madrigali spirituali), and numerous secular chansons. His style is relatively typical of mid-century composers, except that he was unusually attentive to large-scale form, for example framing longer masses (such as his Requiem) with very simple movements, with the inner movements showing greater tension and complexity. In addition he was skilled at varying texture between <b>homophonic</b> and polyphonic passages, and often changing the number and register of voices singing at any time.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, {{some of the}} {{students}} at colleges such as those in Sárospatak and Székelyudvarhely were minor nobles from rural areas who brought with them their regional styles of music. Whilst the choirs in these colleges adopted a more polyphonic style, {{the students}}' songbooks indicate a growth in the popularity of <b>homophonic</b> songs. Their notation, however, was relatively crude and no extensive collection appeared until the publication of Ádám Pálóczi Horváth’s Ötödfélszáz Énekek in 1853. These songs indicate that during the mid to late 18th century the previous Hungarian song styles died out and musicians looked more to other (Western) European styles for influence.|$|E
25|$|From the 18th century, donkey {{gradually}} replaced ass, {{and jenny}} replaced she-ass, {{which is now}} considered archaic. The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of rooster for cock, or that of rabbit for coney, which was formerly <b>homophonic</b> with cunny. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both ass and arse had caused them to become homophones. Other words used for the ass in English from this time include cuddy in Scotland, neddy in southwest England and dicky in the southeast; moke is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to art and architecture, {{there was an}} explosion of musical activity in Minas Gerais in the 18th century. Printed copies of European music, as well as accomplished musicians, made the journey to the area, and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication. Several composers worked in Minas Gerais in the 18th century, mainly in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto), Sabará, Mariana, and other cities. Some of the names which have survived include José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita, Marcos Coelho Netto, Francisco Gomes da Rocha and Ignácio Parreiras Neves; they cultivated a style related to the classical European style but marked by more a more chordal, <b>homophonic</b> sound, and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments.|$|E
25|$|Each {{suite of}} Musikalische Ergötzung {{begins with an}} {{introductory}} Sonata or Sonatina in one movement. In suites 1 and 3 these introductory movements are Allegro three-voice fughettas and stretti. The other four sonatas are reminiscent of French overtures. They have two Adagio sections which juxtapose slower and faster rhythms: the first section uses patterns of dotted quarter and eighth notes in a non-imitative manner. The second employs the violins in an imitative, sometimes <b>homophonic</b> structure, that uses shorter note values. The dance movements of the suites show traces of Italian (in the gigues of suites 2 and 6) and German (allemande appears in suites 1 and 2) influence, {{but the majority of}} the movements are clearly influenced by the French style. The suites do not adhere to a fixed structure: the allemande is only present in two suites, the gigues in four, two suites end with a chaconne, and the fourth suite contains two arias.|$|E
25|$|Later the Calvinism {{that came}} to {{dominate}} the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms.

25|$|Once Wert {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of the virtuoso singing ladies of Ferrara, the concerto delle dame, {{he began to}} write madrigals for them in an appropriate style – with elaborate parts for three high voices, often containing separate blocks for high and low voices, and the most virtuosic singing required in the topmost part. His music during this period {{was influenced by the}} other composers working in Ferrara, including Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and his favorite poets of the time were those most closely associated with Ferrara – Tasso and Guarini. In his tenth book of madrigals (1591), six of the compositions may have been intended for a solo singer with instrumental accompaniment, in the manner of the monodies which were one of the forerunners of opera. The late music is tonal, anticipating the changes in musical language of the early Baroque, during which functional tonality crystallized out of the pre-tonal universe of the late Renaissance; in addition these late compositions are mainly <b>homophonic,</b> with only occasional polyphonic passages appearing as an animating contrast. An influence from the Venetians is his occasional use of the concertato style, with groups of voices in dialogue.|$|E
25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access to}} the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or <b>homophonic</b> tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
500|$|Homophony has {{appeared}} in several non-Western cultures, perhaps particularly in regions where communal vocal music has been cultivated. When explorer Vasco da Gama landed in West Africa in 1497, {{he referred to the}} music he heard there as being in [...] "sweet harmony". While the concept of harmony in that time was not necessarily the same as the concept of homophony as understood by modern scholars, it is generally accepted that <b>homophonic</b> voice harmonies were commonplace in African music for centuries before contact with Europeans and is common in African music today. Singers normally harmonize voices in <b>homophonic</b> parallelism moving in parallel thirds or fourths. This type of harmonic model is also, implemented in instrumental music where voices are stacked in thirds or fourths. <b>Homophonic</b> Parallelism is not restricted to thirds and fourths, however all harmonic material adheres to the scalar system the particular tune or song is based on. The use of harmony in sixths is common in areas where a hexatonic scale system is used [...] For instance, the Fang people of Gabon use homophony in their music.|$|E
500|$|The semiquaver motifs in the alto {{recorders}} {{were already}} {{heard in the}} second and third bars of the obbligato accompaniment to the <b>homophonic</b> episode, but here they play in thirds. The other orchestral groups play pairs of detached quaver chords, with upper strings on the beat and oboes off the beat. The choir then rejoin the orchestra for the second of the three <b>homophonic</b> passages to the text [...] "und dein Gerichtigkeit wird vor dir hergehen". At fourteen bars in length, it is the longest and most complex of the three. The broad structure of the episode is a canon between the soprano and bass parts.|$|E
