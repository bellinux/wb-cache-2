500|$|In 2016, filmmaker {{and activist}} Michael Moore {{said he had}} wanted to use [...] "Panic in Detroit" [...] for his 1998 {{documentary}} The Big One; denied at first, he was given the rights after calling Bowie personally. [...] "I've read stuff since his death saying that he wasn't that political and he stayed away from politics. But that wasn't the conversation that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{talked to}} Yoko {{the day after}} he was killed, and the first thing she said was, [...] "John was really fond of you." [...] The last {{telephone}} conversation <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.|$|E
500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [...] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.|$|E

500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
500|$|... "Listen to the Rain on the Roof" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E
500|$|By September 2015, John Paesano {{had begun}} {{composing}} {{music for the}} season. He felt that the season's new showrunners [...] "were true to {{what we were trying}} to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge" [...] such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that [...] "it’s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory, you know? It’s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." [...] When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he [...] "took all those preconceived notions <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> a grain of salt" [...] and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 15, 2016.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} the Foo Fighters' first instrumental, [...] "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners". [...] It {{was written by}} Grohl after meeting {{with one of the}} miners involved in the Beaconsfield mine collapse who requested an iPod with In Your Honor in it during the incident. As Grohl was moved by this action, he decided to [...] "write something just to dedicate to him that night because he definitely seemed like a hero", and later promised to include the instrumental on the album. The album version features Kaki King, whom Grohl invited to record the song as she was visiting Studio 606. Grohl later said that [...] "I showed it to her once, and she shredded 10 times better than I ever played it". Another guest was guitarist Pat Smear, who had been a bandmember from 1995 to 1998, and a guest musician on the tour for In Your Honor. Smear, who has since been reinstated as a full-on member, described his participation as [...] "the oddest recording experience <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Foo Fighters" [...] given he had no input in composition and was [...] "going in and playing on a song that was already written".|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, and that I should just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her. I really got to know the character, and she had so many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas said, [...] "Daniel {{offers a}} few of the {{characteristics}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Hulk when I was with him in Porto... He is an extremely quick player, and he has technique at pace." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The only record <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> me," [...] {{explained}} the phonograph, [...] "is one the Magician attached {{just before we}} had our quarrel. It's a highly classical composition." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{book was}} {{unveiled}} at the Iranian mission at the United Nations in New York City. The translator, Paul Sprachman, admired {{the book and}} said: [...] "I got {{a deeper understanding of}} the book, after the conversation <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Seyyedeh Zahra Hossein, the narrator of Da. I discovered the difference between the Iran-Iraq war and other wars, after I read Da. It was, as Iranians say, a sacred defense and full of spirituality." ...|$|E
2500|$|C. S. Lewis {{in his own}} {{preface to}} That Hideous Strength, notes: [...] "I believe {{that one of the}} central ideas of this tale came into my head from conversations <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> a {{scientific}} colleague, some time before I met a rather similar suggestion in the works of Mr. Olaf Stapledon. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2017, Mysterio {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that he may consider opening up his own wrestling school. During the interview (hosted by organisation known as TheWrap), he said: [...] "I just thought I would never have the time. Now being able to make that time - to not have the busy schedule <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> WWE - gives me plenty of time to be a family man. I'm hoping that this time I'm spending with my son will open up that idea again and create a Rey Mysterio Wrestling school".|$|E
6000|$|... "You will waste {{breath in}} denying it," [...] Trenchard took it again {{upon himself to}} admonish them. [...] "For <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> me the {{landlord}} of the Hare and Hounds, who will corroborate, upon oath, what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> {{the utmost}} sincerity, after long thinking, given my {{judgment}} upon this arduous affair; {{but with the}} utmost deference and submission to public wisdom and power.|$|R

2500|$|In March 1954 Jarrold was {{contacted}} by a South Australian called Fred Stone. Stone agreed {{to form a}} branch of Jarrold’s group and so the AFSB (SA) was formed. However, this relationship was fragile and as Jarrold's behavior changed due to stress the relationship deteriorated. The RAAF also noted problems with Jarrold. Sq Leader A.H. Birch, AFC, Air Force Headquarters, Victoria Barracks, Victoria, made note of this in a letter dated 5 April 1955: [...] "...the discussion during the brief interview <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Jarrold mainly concerned the possibility of his Society causing embarrassment to the Royal Australian Air Force." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eisner {{negotiated}} {{an agreement}} with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright The Spirit, but, [...] "Written down in the contract <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> 'Busy' Arnold— and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership— Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership". This would include the eventual backup features [...] "Mr. Mystic" [...] and [...] "Lady Luck".|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, 2009, in an {{exclusive}} interview between The Bachelor season 13 contestant Megan Parris, and Steve Carbone, Megan commented that the producers edit the footage to create a fictional storyline. [...] "I don't think [...] showed any real conversation <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> anyone... The viewers fail to realize that editing is what makes the show... You'll hear someone make one comment and then they'll show a clip of somebody's face {{to make it look like}} that is their facial reaction to that statement, but really, somebody made that face the day before to something else. It's just piecing things together to make a story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a fool," [...] he said. [...] "All {{these days}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken her for you. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> pleaded <b>with</b> her--no wonder that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> pleaded <b>with</b> her in vain. And {{all this time}} perhaps you have been waiting, expecting to hear from me. Is it so, Annabel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Gudruda spoke: [...] "Strange tales {{are told}} of thee and Eric, Groa's daughter! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done <b>with</b> Eric, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done <b>with</b> thee also. Thou hast thrust thyself here {{against my will}} and, if I may, I would see thy face no more." ...|$|R

2500|$|Two serious flaws {{work against}} the novel, however — flaws made all the worse by being easily correctable, to my mind. Carl opens the book by {{throwing}} almost the entire cast at the reader, {{making it hard to}} grasp and identify with any of them, much less the setting of contemporary Glastonbury. ... The other major problem <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Lucifer's Crown is infuriating simply because it's so utterly unnecessary: The novel takes place in the final months of the year 2000. That's right, we're treated to yet another clichéd end-of-the-millennium apocalypse. Other than hopelessly dating a story that otherwise manages to be effectively timeless, the move is just downright dumb.|$|E
2500|$|The SL game system, {{for all its}} acclaim...was {{based on}} a flawed foundation. [...] The {{subsequent}} gamettes, in building on that start, only complicated matters by attempting to patch that foundation rather than replace it altogether....here's how I rationalize it. [...] A few years ago, ...I was so enamored by (video cassette recorders) that I just had to have one. [...] Two years later they were selling models for half the price with twice the features which mine had. [...] Sometimes I regret buying that VCR so soon, but then I recall all the fun <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> it when it was new and eventually concluded that my money was well spent after all.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Mike Sharkey panned {{the game}} in his initial review, but after the game received a major overhaul patch he later stated, [...] "Well, AoE Online is now on Steam, and courtesy of a massive spring patch, {{the vast majority of}} the problems <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> it have been addressed." [...] PC Gamer initially gave the game a 65/100 at launch, but later reviewed the specific DLC Celts campaign giving it a score of 90/100 and calling it, [...] "The best free RTS gaming you'll find, the Celts bring AoEO two steps closer to greatness." [...] PC Gamer later summarized the game's major complaints during its initial launch and noted that many of them were addressed or improved by the developers.|$|E
