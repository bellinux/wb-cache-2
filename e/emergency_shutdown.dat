5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors provide backup or <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> {{power to}} {{low-power}} {{equipment such as}} RAM, SRAM, micro-controllers and PC Cards.

40|$|A digital {{computer}} study of <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns</b> of a 60 -kWe reactor Brayton power system was conducted. Malfunctions considered were (1) loss of reactor coolant flow, (2) loss of Brayton system gas flow, (3) turbine overspeed, and (4) a reactivity insertion error.

5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's {{main propulsion system}} is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|R
25|$|The 3rd {{nuclear power}} plant, Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant, of Taiwan Power Company nearby was {{affected}} by the earthquake. Because of the vigorous vibration, the alarm at Reactor #2 was activated, forcing the operators to carry out SCRAM immediately. However, Reactor #1 was not affected and remained operational. After the <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> of Reactor #2, engineers checked the facilities at the plant and no problems were found.|$|E
25|$|With {{the steam}} {{generators}} no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure {{increased in the}} reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, control rods were inserted into the core to halt the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor continued to generate decay heat and, because steam was no longer {{being used by the}} turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, each reactor {{unit has}} been {{equipped}} with an emergency building (NANO, NAchr√ºstung NOtstandsystem). These contain additional safety systems for the reactor <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> and for the feeding of the steam generators, a 50kV emergency power line, and a diesel generator. They are heavily protected (bunkerised) from external hazards and, if needed, are able to cool and shut down the power plant without human intervention for 72 hours. The at least 1.5m thick concrete-steel housings protect the critical systems from external agents like earthquakes or plane crashes. Each unit of the KKB has a large dry type containment in concrete and steel.|$|E
50|$|Blade {{pitch control}} is a feature of nearly all large modern horizontal-axis wind turbines. While {{operating}}, a wind turbine's control system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes. Feathering the blades stops the rotor during <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> or whenever the wind speed exceeds the maximum rated speed. During construction and maintenance of wind turbines, the blades are usually feathered to reduce unwanted rotational torque {{in the event of}} wind gusts.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that transit-time ultrasonic flowmeters (TTUF) are unsuitable for bubblecontained flows. This paper presents a new online monitoring method based on optical observation, which monitors the functionality of the TTUF {{in the presence}} of bubbles in the fluid. The method avoids the unnecessary <b>Emergency</b> <b>Shutdowns</b> (ESD) due to bubble presence in the fluid by bubble detection. The proposed method accomplishes bubble identification through a combination of image processing and wavelet analysis. In addition, a new method is proposed which estimates single bubble size in horizontal pipes using a data fusion approach...|$|R

2500|$|In late December 1988, C-5A 70-0450 {{caught fire}} in flight while being flown {{on a local}} {{training}} flight at and near Travis AFB, CA. [...] The fire originated shortly after the training mission began in the [...] "center wing" [...] area. [...] Likely cause was a ruptured hydraulic line which led to [...] "hydraulic misting", and was ignited by an electrical source. [...] The fire was not detected by the crew in flight since {{it was more than}} 100 feet behind the nearest crew member and in an enclosed area. [...] The fire was not detected until after the aircraft had landed. [...] The captain declared an emergency with the Travis Ground Control, executed <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> procedures, and ordered an evacuation. [...] The fire continued to rage for almost an hour until it was extinguished by the fire department. The aircraft was later repaired but not used again for cargo flights. [...] It is now in storage at Davis Monthan AFB, AZ.|$|E

40|$|This {{position}} paper describes {{the challenge of}} ensuring run-time safety in cyber-physical systems. The overarching problem is ensuring that computer-based systems will maintain safe operations {{even in the face}} of design-time and run-time faults. One way to address this problem is by creating an ability to perform run-time safety checks on CPS applications that can be used to record hazards, trigger <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns</b> (where doing so is safe), or perform other actions to minimize the consequences of an unsafe system behavior. Existing foundations for creating such a capability exist in the areas of software safety, temporal logic, model based diagnosis, and fault tolerance...|$|R
50|$|The reactor uses a {{total of}} four control rods.

40|$|A beam permit module {{has been}} {{developed}} to concentrate RHIC 2 subsystem sensor outputs, permit beam, and initiate <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> The modules accept inputs from the vacuum, cryogenic, power supply, beam loss, and superconducting magnet quench detection systems. Modules are located at equipment locations around the RHIC ring. The modules are connected by three fiberoptic communications links; a beam permit link, and two magnet power supply interlock links. During operation, carrier presence allows beam. If a RHIC subsystem detects a fault, the beam permit carrier terminates- initiating a beam dump. If the fault was a superconducting magnet quench, a power supply interlock carrier terminates- initiating an emergency magnet power dump. In addition, the master module triggers an event to cause remote sensors to log and hold data at the time-of-failure. 1. Work preformed {{under the auspices of}} the U. S...|$|R

50|$|According to the South Korean Ministry for a Knowledge Economy, the APR-1400's {{fuel costs}} are 23 {{percent lower than}} France-based Areva‚Äôs EPR, known {{to be the most}} {{advanced}} nuclear power plant in the world. The government is also planning development of a new nuclear plant design, which will have 10 percent higher capacity and a safety rating better than the APR-1400. South Korea‚Äôs nuclear power plants currently are operating at a rate of 93.4 percent, higher than the comparable U.S. operation rate of 89.9 percent, France's 76.1 percent, and Japan's 59.2 percent. South Korean nuclear plants have repeatedly recorded the lowest rate of <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns</b> in the world, a record {{due in large part to}} highly standardised design and operating procedures. The APR-1400 is designed, engineered, built and operated to meet the latest international regulatory requirements concerning safety, including those for aircraft impact resistance.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{abundance}} of water phase in oilfield operations as it is produced along with the oil in often large quantities, viscosity reduction in heavy crude oils and bitumens {{can be achieved by}} transporting these crude oils as oil-in-water emulsions (Langevin et al. 2004). This does not impose any operational problems during <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns</b> (Simon and Poynter 1970) since emulsions can be stabilized {{for long periods of time}} using nonionic surfactants because they are cheap and thermodynamically stable in saline water (Rivas et al. 1998). Emulsions are prepared by mixing the oil and water phases through stirring and/or flow through flow restrictions such as valves and chokes. The produced oil-in-water emulsions can have a viscosity more than two orders of magnitude lower than the oil (Yaghi and Al-Bemani 2002). An additional advantage of the transport of heavy oil via oil-in-water emulsions is the reduction in pipe corrosion sediment formation (Poynter and Tigrina 1970).|$|R
40|$|An aeroelastically scaled {{model of}} a wind turbine is described, {{featuring}} active individual blade pitch and torque control. The model, governed by supervision and control systems {{similar to those of}} a real wind turbine, is capable of simulating steady conditions and transient maneuvers in the boundary layer test section of the wind tunnel of the Politecnico di Milano. Expanding the classical scope of wind tunnel models, the present experimental facility enables applications ranging from aerodynamics to aeroelasticity and control. After a description of the model design and of its main characteristics, several applications are presented. Results are shown for the validation of a wind misalignment observer, for the optimization of the open-loop pitch profile used during <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> for the control in wake interference conditions of two models, and for active load alleviation by higher harmonic individual blade pitch control. Results demonstrate the potential of the proposed experimental facility to enable non-standard observations in the controlled environment of the wind tunnel, beyond the classical purely aerodynamic ones...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 13 - 26 For every {{centrifugal}} compressor installation, {{the design of}} the surge control system is vitally important to prevent damage of the compressor internal components, seals, and bearings. While most surge control systems are capable of preventing surge for steady-state operation, <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns</b> (ESDs) are particularly challenging, since the surge control system must respond faster than the deceleration rate of the train. The available experimental data are not of sufficient quality and resolution to properly validate current software packages. This paper outlines an experimental test program using a full-scale compressor tested in a hydrocarbon flow loop under controlled, laboratory conditions. Transient compressor surge data during and ESD were captured over a variety of initial speed, pressure, and flow conditions. Furthermore, the anti-surge valve was modified in subsequent tests to simulate a slower and a smaller valve, providing a more varied test condition. Results of the testing and model comparisons will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis is reduction of hydraulic emissions, minimizing of process <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> exploitation of intervention capacity, and reduction of costs. Today, monitoring of hydraulic leakages is scarce {{and the main}} way to detect leakage is the constant need for filling of hydraulic fluid to the Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU). Leakage detection and diagnosis has potential, which would be adressed in this thesis. A strategy towards leakage detection and diagnosis is given. The strategy defines three approaches, define an approach, explore the approach and propose a solution. Relevant instrumentation, both existing and additional instrumentation is discussed. Relevant methods towards leakage detection and diagnosis are presented. An overview of a bewidering amount of methods is given, and basics towards application. An example from pipelines of state-of-the‚Äìart leakage detection and diagnosis is also given. A solution proposal for a simple and available leakage method with fair detectability and limited diagnostics is proposed.
