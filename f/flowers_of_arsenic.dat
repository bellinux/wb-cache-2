30|$|The {{adsorption}} <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> {{is strong}} at acidic to neutral conditions, however, increases in pH {{will result in}} desorption <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> from oxide surfaces and a resultant increase in dissolved concentrations (Fuller et al. 1993).

As a result of the pH dependence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> adsorption, changes in ground-water pH can promote adsorption or desorption <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> According to calculated saturation indexes it was considered two different mechanism that can lead to the release <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> in groundwater (a) the first is the development of high pH, and hence mineral weathering, leading the desorption <b>of</b> adsorbed <b>arsenic</b> (i.e. arsenate species) from natural mineral oxides, or prevents arsenic from being adsorbed in the first place (b) the second is the direct dissolution of mineral phases, derived from volcanic materials, presented in the aquifer system.|$|R

40|$|Arsenic {{concentration}} in groundwater throughout Cache Valley exceeds {{the drinking water}} limit. Aquifer solids were collected from an area near the Logan Landfill. Chemical extraction procedures {{were used to determine}} whether the arsenic is associated with the local geology or is from anthropogenic sources. The results indicate that the arsenic in groundwater is from natural aquifer solids. Although mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> release to groundwater from minerals {{have been reported in the}} literature, there are still disputes on specific mechanisms and the importance of contributing factors to the mobilization <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> Anaerobic microcosms containing two selected aquifer solids, one site-oxidized and one site-reduced, and groundwater collected near the landfill, groundwater with the addition of glucose, and landfill leachate, were constructed and analyzed over time to evaluate the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> solubilization. Microcosms were sacrificed for analysis <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> in solution, oxidation state <b>of</b> the <b>arsenic,</b> biogenic Fe(ll) production, changes in mineralogy, organic species, and water chemistry parameters. Reductive dissolution of iron oxides contributes to the mobilization <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> in the site-oxidized aquifer solid with groundwater and leachate treatments. The addition of glucose enhanced reducing conditions and the solubilization <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> from the host minerals. With the site-reduced sediment, the two water treatments caused reductive dissolution of iron minerals and arsenic release.

The first objective was to delineate mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> solubilization from sediments collected at the study site.

The observed solubilization <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> was decoupled from iron reduction in the site-oxidized sediments {{in the presence of}} native organic carbon, which disagreed with the widely accepted hypothesis that arsenic solubilization is derived from microbial driven reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Carbonate minerals were defined as the mineral phase associated with arsenic that contributed to the arsenic measured in solution. The second objective was to determine how altering redox and water conditions down a profile affects arsenic geochemistry and hence solubility. Redox stratification was delineated in two sediment cores based on chemical analyses and visual observation of redox-sensitive parameters. The vadose zone released a considerable amount <b>of</b> <b>arsenic,</b> while the next zone, the carbonate enrichment zone, released the highest concentration <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> Soluble arsenic was exclusively As(V) in the redox transition zone, where As was primarily associated with iron oxides.
