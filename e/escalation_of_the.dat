5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab–Israeli conflict. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E
5|$|The International Control Commission, {{in order}} to avoid a major <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armed {{conflicts}} with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 6, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis. Zografos accepted the proposal and an armistice was ordered the next day. By the time the cease-fire order was received, the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Korçë, making the city's Albanian garrison's surrender imminent.|$|E
5|$|No.75 Squadron was {{reestablished}} at Williamtown in April 1955. It {{was initially}} equipped with Vampires and Gloster Meteor fighters, {{but these were}} replaced with CAC Sabre aircraft in early 1957. While operating Sabres the squadron {{made a number of}} deployments to Darwin for air defence exercises which often involved RAF units. On 8December 1958 No. 75 Squadron transferred from No.78 Wing to become an independent unit under the direct command of RAAF Base Williamtown. In November 1964 several of the squadron's pilots took part in an emergency deployment to Darwin when an Indonesian attack was feared as part of an apparent <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.|$|E
25|$|Parliamentarians of Greek and Latvian Parliaments, Garifalia Kanelli and Sergejs Potapkins respectively, visited <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Nagorno-Karabakh after <b>the</b> clashes. According to Potapkins, it is inadmissible, {{when the}} {{peaceful}} population {{suffers from the}} military aggression. <b>The</b> re-establishment <b>of</b> peace is a prior problem, <b>the</b> <b>escalations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict don’t promote the establishment and maintenance of peace.|$|R
25|$|Campaign Z was {{notable for}} <b>escalations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laotian Civil War conflict. The Vietnamese Communists brought 130mm field guns and T-34 tanks into action in Laos {{for the first}} time. The Vietnamese People's Air Force also {{launched}} MiG 21 attacks into Lao air space to challenge the Royalist side's air supremacy. On its side, the Royal Lao Government and its Central Intelligence Agency backers imported copious numbers <b>of</b> mercenaries from <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Thailand as reinforcements, and depended on American air power support, including Arc Light strikes by B-52 Stratofortresses. An independent Laos would narrowly survive Campaign Z.|$|R
25|$|The {{years from}} 1972 to 1981 saw an <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> {{violence}} against <b>the</b> Christians <b>of</b> Egypt {{culminating in a}} massacre of Christians in a poor district of Cairo in 1981.|$|R
5|$|The clash at the Plitvice Lakes worsened {{the overall}} {{situation}} in Croatia {{and led to}} an <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict. Even though the Croatian and Serb forces were separated by the JNA at the Plitvice Lakes, {{the situation in the}} area continued to deteriorate following the clash. In nearby Plaški, Croatian police personnel left the local police station and were replaced by Serb officers. Both SAO Krajina and Croatian forces set up several roadblocks on the Saborsko–Lička Jasenica–Ogulin road. By summer, the blockades were extended to the north of Plaški and south of Saborsko, where Croatian authorities established another 30-strong police station on 2 April. Only JNA vehicles were permitted to pass the roadblocks, and that brought about a shortage of food, medicine and electricity in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamics}} of the air war changed in June 1941. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. The <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. The operations of the Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make hit-and-run attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E
5|$|The <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War was {{highlighted}} by Truman's approval of NSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U.S. and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document {{was drafted by}} Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. HeteroMPI is an {{extension}} of MPI designed for high performance computing on heterogeneous networks <b>of</b> computers. <b>The</b> recent new feature <b>of</b> HeteroMPI is <b>the</b> optimized version <b>of</b> collective communications. <b>The</b> optimization is based on a novel performance communication model of switch-based computational clusters. In particular, the model reflects significant non-deterministic and non-linear <b>escalations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> execution time <b>of</b> many-to-one collective operations for medium-sized messages. The paper outlines this communication model and describes how HeteroMPI uses this model to optimize one-to-many (scatter-like) and many-to-one (gather-like) communications. We also demonstrate that HeteroMPI collective communications outperform their native counterparts for various MPI implementations and cluster platforms...|$|R

5|$|An already tense {{situation}} in the Lika region, following 1 April Plitvice Lakes incident when the first fatalities of the Croatian War of Independence occurred, deteriorated further in June when Croatia reaffirmed its sovereignty through a parliamentary declaration. This {{was reflected in the}} rise of violent incidents, setting up of unauthorized road checkpoints and occasional exchanges of small arms fire. On 22 June, three policemen were abducted on the road between Gospić and SAO Krajina-controlled Gračac, and a series of attacks on the Croatian police occurred in various parts of Lika, including Gospić, on 27–28 June. In July 1991, the JNA started to openly confront the Croatian police and the ZNG in Lika. On 1 July, Plitvice police station was surrounded by the JNA, and on 6 July, two ZNG troops were killed and another two wounded in a JNA ambush near Gospić. Further <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting was seen at the Ljubovo pass on the Gospić–Korenica road, where the JNA and SAO Krajina troops fought and pushed the ZNG back on 28–29 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the Confrontation is {{generally}} split into three distinct phases. In the first, Indonesia supported revolts against the Anglo-Malaysian rule in Northern Borneo, most notably the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. In the second, the guerrilla raids for which this conflict is most reputed for began in earnest, from April 1963 onwards. The fighting in this phase, while causing some damage and casualties, was relatively small in scale and the incursions were usually only made by small bands of no more than platoon size crossing the Kalimantan border into Sarawak and Sabah. These operations were the essence of the initial strategy to improve the Indonesian negotiating position and continued alongside said negotiations throughout the summer of 1963. However, 16 September, the negotiations concluded with the formation of the Malaysian Federation, which included Malaya, Singapore, and most importantly, the two Borneo states (Sarawak and Sabah). In response, the raids were intensified into larger groups working with or consisting of Indonesian regular troops. This {{was the beginning of the}} <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict into its third and most dangerous phase.|$|E
5|$|In 1564, Sweden and Russia {{agreed the}} Treaty of Dorpat, whereby Russia {{recognised}} Sweden's right to Reval and other castles, and Sweden accepted Russia's patrimony {{over the rest}} of Livonia. A seven-year truce was signed between Russia and Sweden in 1565. Eric XIV of Sweden was overthrown in 1568 after he killed several nobles in the Sture Murders (Sturemorden) of 1567, and was replaced by his half-brother John III. Both Russia and Sweden had other problems and were keen to avoid an expensive <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war in Livonia. Ivan IV had requested the delivery of John's wife, the Polish-Lithuanian princess Catherine Jagellonica, to Russia, since he had competed with John to marry into the Lithuanian-Polish royal family. In July 1569 John sent a party to Russia, led by Paul Juusten, Bishop of Åbo, which arrived in Novgorod in September, following the arrival in Moscow of the ambassadors sent to Sweden in 1567 by Ivan to retrieve Catherine. Ivan refused to meet with the party himself, forcing them to negotiate instead with the Governor of Novgorod. The Tsar requested that Swedish envoys should greet the governor as 'the brother of their king', but Juusten refused to do so. The Governor then ordered an attack on the Swedish party, that their clothes and money be taken, and that they be deprived of food and drink and be paraded naked through the streets. Although the Swedes were also to be moved to Moscow, fortunately for them this occurred at the same time Ivan and his oprichniki {{were on their way to}} an assault on Novgorod.|$|E

25|$|The landing {{shocked the}} British, {{who had not}} {{expected}} such a strong and prominent step from the Indonesians, but did not incite them to respond to Sukarno's <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> tensions. <b>The</b> absence <b>of</b> violent reply stiffened Sukarno's burgeoning resolve, and led him to continue with more landings, amphibious and airborne, throughout {{the fall and winter}} of 1964.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} Israeli views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace process. <b>The</b> {{official}} position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Israel is that peace {{ought to be}} negotiated on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> giving up some control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupied territories {{in return for a}} stop to the conflict and violence. Israel's position is that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ought to be the negotiating partner in the peace talks, and not Hamas, which has at times engaged with Israel in <b>escalations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict and attacks Israel's civilian population. The Oslo Accords and the Camp David 2000 summit negotiations revealed <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> a two state system being accepted by Israeli leadership as a possible peace solution.|$|R
5|$|News of the {{invasion}} quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and {{would not be able to}} hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E

40|$|Escalations {{refer to}} the actions taken when {{workflow}} activities, which constitute business processes, miss their deadlines. Typically, <b>escalations</b> increase <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> business processes due to <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> additional activities, <b>the</b> compensation <b>of</b> finished activities, or <b>the</b> intervention <b>of</b> highly-paid workers. In this paper, we present on-going research addressing workflow escalations and the cost associated with them. Our goal is twofold: (a) minimize <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>escalations</b> during process execution and (b) reduce the cost associated with escalations when they cannot be avoided. To reduce <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> executions that result in escalations, we propose to keep track <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slack time accumulated during process executions {{and use it to}} adjust the deadlines (i. e., delay <b>escalations)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining activities. To reduce <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> inevitable <b>escalations,</b> we describe an approach for predicting whether a process is going to escalate at some future point and, then, deciding wheth [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In four studies we {{examined}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> overconfidence on <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> commitment in investment tasks.
