At {{the front of the}} compressor was an intake fairing with a prominent [...] "nose cone" [...] containing the <b>front</b> <b>main</b> <b>bearing.</b> Four guide vanes held the cone in place, with a power takeoff shaft running inside one of them to power the top-mounted accessories section. The nose cone also held the electric starter motor, which acted as a generator once the engine was up and running. The engines used on the CF-100 also contained a uniquely Canadian invention, two prominent winglettes at the very front that sprayed alcohol into the intake as a de-icing system. The CF-100 versions also mounted the debris cage, mentioned earlier.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinook's {{compressor}} {{consisted of}} nine axial stages. The first two {{were made of}} stainless steel to help with debris but the remaining seven stages were made of aluminum alloy. These were attached to hubs that were also primarily made of aluminum, except the ninth disk, which was steel. Behind the compressor were the six straight-through flame cans, exiting onto a single-stage steel turbine. The final exhaust gas temperature was 650 degrees Celsius. Air cooling for the turbine was provided {{by a series of}} six tubes running {{from the middle of the}} compressor to the turbine, lying between the flame cans, which exited in front of the turbine face. An accessories section was powered off a shaft at the front of the engine at the main bearing. The <b>front</b> <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> was located under a prominent nose cone that extended well out in front of the engine. An oil tank was [...] "wrapped" [...] around the engine at about the 4 o'clock position, as viewed from the front.|$|E
5000|$|The HiPo {{engine was}} {{engineered}} to increase performance and high-RPM reliability over standard 289 fare. It had solid lifters with hotter cam timing; 10.5:1 compression; a dual point, centrifugal advance distributor; smaller combustion chamber heads with cast spring cups and screw-in studs; low-restriction exhaust manifolds; and a bigger, manual-choke 595 CFM carburetor (the standard 289-4V was 480 CFM). The water pump, fuel pump, and alternator/generator pulleys were altered, fewer vanes, extra spring, and larger diameter, respectively; to help handle the higher engine speeds. Even the HiPo’s fan was unique. Bottom-end improvements included a flaw-free selected standard block, thicker {{main bearing caps}} and crankshaft damper/balancer, larger-diameter rod bolts, a crankshaft made from 80% nodular iron {{as opposed to the}} regular items at 40%, all were checked for correct 'nodularity' by polishing an area of the rear counterweight and comparing that surface using a magnification arrangement against a picture datum, increased crankshaft counterweighting to compensate for the heavier connecting rod big ends, the increased external counter weighting at the front was split between the crankshaft damper and a supplementary counterweight place adjacent to the <b>front</b> <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> journal (all designed to reduce the 'bending moment' in the crankshaft at high-rpm), all for high-rpm reliability. The HiPo carried SAE gross ratings of [...] at 6,000 rpm and 312 lbft Nm at 3,400 rpm. About 25,000 were manufactured at CEP1 between March 1963 and June 1967.|$|E

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> in terms of: • radial deformations of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis, Engine Bearing Analysis and Design, is directed towards the prediction of the performance characteristics of full central circumferentially grooved journal bearings. Due to the complexities of a full solution of such bearings, several simplifications have been made, including the assumptions of rigid circular journal and bearing and that a thin isoviscous Newtonian lubricant exists between the bounding solids. The work presented can be split into three main areas of research. These are theoretical predictions {{in relation to the}} performance predictions of steadily and dynamically loaded cases, and the subsequent verification of the transient solution techniques developed by carrying out an extensive experimental investigation.

5000|$|Crankshafts on six-cylinder engines {{generally}} have either four or seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> Larger engines and diesels {{tend to use}} seven bearings because of high loadings and to avoid crankshaft flex. Because of the six-cylinder engine's smooth characteristic, {{there is a tendency}} for a driver to load the engine at low engine speeds. This can produce crankshaft flex in four <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> designs where the crank spans the distance of two cylinders between <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> This distance is longer than the distance between two adjacent <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> on a V6 with four mains, because the V6 has cylinder bores on opposite banks which overlap significantly; the overlap may be as high as 100%, minus the width of one connecting rod (1.00" [...] or so). In addition, modern high-compression engines subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures, requiring the crankthrows to have greater support from adjacent bearings, so it is now customary to design straight-sixes with seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find a method to study the {{lubrication}} character of the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> and load condition of the crankshaft about the marine two-stroke diesel engine. Based on the finite element method, multi-body dynamics, elastohydrodynamic and Green-Tripp theory about contact, the simulation of coupling between the elastic crankshaft and engine block is carried out. The load of <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> the minimum of oil film thick, orbital path of journal, average of asperity contact pressure are explored.

Degradation and damage in the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> which carries the axial loads can cause severe damage inside the gearbox as it causes non-torque loads entering the gearbox. Therefore, monitoring of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> is very important. In this paper, different fault cases of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered and responses are obtained by the multi-body simulation. Gearbox failure is then evaluated in two different perspectives: one from the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> itself by analysing vibration, and one through studying the remaining fatigue life of another bearing inside the gearbox. The results reveal that not only the local vibration of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> housing is important, but also the consequence of this degradation on other components can be {{a key factor in}} the “system” failure.
