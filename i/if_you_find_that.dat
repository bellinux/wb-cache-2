500|$|Two musical {{works from}} this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing {{completion}} in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be [...] "very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore {{there will probably be}} no artistic merits in it." [...] He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that [...] "I shan't be at all surprised and offended <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts." [...] Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, [...] "the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} {{circumstance}} which must come before your Lordships in this business. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Hastings {{has received the}} two lac of rupees, then {{you will find that}} he was guilty, without color or pretext of any kind whatever, of acting in violation of his covenant, of acting in violation of the laws, and all the rules of honor and conscience. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he has taken the lac and a half, which he admits, but which he justifies under the pretence of an entertainment, I shall beg to say something to your Lordships concerning that justification.|$|E

6000|$|A {{trace of}} gravity crept into Flora Schuyler's blue eyes, which were unusually {{attractive}} ones. [...] "When they come too often I send them back," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, I know I'm careless now and then, but {{one has to}} do the square thing, and I wouldn't let any man do all that for me unless I was so fond of him that I meant to marry him. Now I'm going to talk quite straight to you, Hetty. You'll {{have to give up}} Larry by and by, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that's</b> going to hurt you, send the other man away." ...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of Agile Methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban or XP is the ability to move PBIs around, taking into account their relative priority - for example - without much effort. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> PBIs <b>that</b> are tightly dependent, a good idea might be to combine them into a single PBI.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yours and Lady Tringle's, {{and your}} daughters', no doubt. At any rate, Sir Thomas, you {{will think of}} this again. I am sure you will think of it again. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> your daughter's {{happiness}} depends upon it--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your mother. I am much mistaken <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will not}} <b>find</b> <b>that</b> she, {{with all her}} hospitality, would prefer that I should recover my {{strength}} elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dearest," [...] he said presently, [...] "what a {{happy life}} ours will be. That is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have made a mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Give that,' {{said the}} guest, who had {{by this time}} sealed the note, and who beckoned his {{messenger}} towards him as he spoke, 'into Mr Haredale's own hands.

6000|$|... "You {{must keep}} all your {{favorable}} opinions for the Delaware girls, Deerslayer, if you seriously think thus {{of those of}} your own colour," [...] she said, affecting to laugh.

5000|$|Despite this criticism, {{the slogan}} has an {{enduring}} symbolic meaning for activists. As one protester remarked, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it's true, it's a valid rallying cry... it's just a metaphor." [...] Speaking to the Daily Mail, Elizabeth Brondolo, a psychology professor at St. John's University in New York, said [...] "The truth always really matters, but it's {{important to recognize}} that past experience to stereotypes also influences the perception of hands being raised." ...|$|R

60|$|Then, Beatrice, {{have your}} will, sow your seed of tears, {{and take your}} chance. You may find that you were right and the worldlings wrong, and you may reap a harvest beyond the grasp of their poor imaginations. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> they are right and you are wrong, what will it matter to you who sleep? For of this at least you are sure.

5000|$|... 1978s Gentlehands {{is about}} {{a young man who}} becomes {{involved}} with a young woman from a much wealthier family. When he tries to get to know his estranged grandfather, he learns that the man was a Nazi who killed Jews at Auschwitz. The premise for the book, stated Kerr, was, [...] "I wanted to provoke the idea of what <b>if</b> <b>you</b> meet a nice guy, a really nice man, and what <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> out <b>that</b> in his past he wasnt such a nice man? How would you feel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please. I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Ned Plymdale {{has taken}} a house--the one in St. Peter's Place next to Mr. Hackbutt's.

6000|$|Terrified at {{the thought}} that she might lose her only {{remaining}} brother, the princess entreated him to give up his project, but he remained firm. Before setting out, however, he gave her a chaplet of a hundred pearls, and said, [...] "When I am absent, tell this over daily for me. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the beads stick, so that they will not slip one after the other, you will know that my brother's fate has befallen me.

6000|$|... § 3. Hence I {{would say}} to these philosophers: If, instead of using the sonorous phrase, [...] "It is objectively so," [...] you will use the plain old phrase, [...] "It is so;" [...] and if instead of the sonorous phrase, [...] "It is subjectively so," [...] you will say, in plain old English, [...] "It does so," [...] or [...] "It seems so to me;" [...] you will, on the whole, be more intelligible to your fellow-creatures: and besides, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> a thing which {{generally}} [...] "does so" [...] to other people (as a gentian looks blue to most men) does not so to you, on any particular occasion, you will not fall into the impertinence of saying that the thing is not so, or did not so, but you will say simply (what you will be all the better for speedily finding out) that something is the matter with you. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> you cannot explode the gunpowder, you will not declare that all gunpowder is subjective, and all explosion imaginary, but you will simply suspect and declare yourself to be an ill-made match. Which, on the whole, though {{there may be a}} distant chance of a mistake about it, is, nevertheless, the wisest conclusion you can come to until farther experiment.[53] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only {{six of us}} will go in,' Mr. Hardy said; 'there will be {{less chance}} of detection,--Jamieson, Percy, Herries, my boys, and myself.

And Farquhar, {{two or three of}} you get matches ready, and stick a blue-light into the straw roof of the hut. We must have light, or we lose all the advantage of our firearms. Besides, as we retreat we shall be in darkness, while they will be in the glare.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} measure of precaution on this point is the absolute exclusion of every thing like angry looks and words as accompaniments of punishment. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> any wrong which your child commits awakens irritation or anger in your mind, suspend your judgment of the case and postpone all action until the irritation and anger have subsided, and you can consider calmly and deliberately what to do, with a view, not of satisfying your own resentment, but of doing good to the child. Then, when you have decided what to do, carry your decision into effect in a good-natured manner--firmly and inflexibly--but still without any violence, or even harshness, of manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely certain. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{would save}} {{yourself}} and your friends I pray you to call upon them at once to mount and ride in a body {{to one of the}} gates.
