2500|$|The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), {{also known}} as the <b>jackass</b> <b>penguin</b> and black-footed penguin is a species of penguin, {{confined}} to southern African waters. [...] It is also widely known as the [...] "jackass" [...] penguin for its donkey-like bray, although several related species of South American penguins produce the same sound. Like all extant penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh on average [...] and are [...] tall. It has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and a black facial mask; the body upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band. The pink gland above their eyes helps them to cope with changing temperatures. When the temperature gets hotter, the body of the African penguin sends more blood to these glands to be cooled by the air surrounding it. This then causes the gland to turn a darker shade of pink.|$|E
60|$|I {{have little}} to remark on the zoology of these islands. I have before {{described}} the carrion-vulture of Polyborus. There are some other hawks, owls, and a few small land-birds. The waterfowl are particularly numerous, and they must formerly, from the accounts of the old navigators, {{have been much more}} so. One day I observed a cormorant playing with a fish which it had caught. Eight times successively the bird let its prey go, then dived after it, and although in deep water, brought it each time to the surface. In the Zoological Gardens I have seen the otter treat a fish in the same manner, much as a cat does a mouse: I do not know of any other instance where dame Nature appears so wilfully cruel. Another day, having placed myself between a penguin (Aptenodytes demersa) and the water, I was much amused by watching its habits. It was a brave bird; and till reaching the sea, it regularly fought and drove me backwards. Nothing less than heavy blows would have stopped him; every inch he gained he firmly kept, standing close before me erect and determined. When thus opposed he continually rolled his head from side to side, in a very odd manner, as if the power of distinct vision lay only in the anterior and basal part of each eye. This bird is commonly called the <b>jackass</b> <b>penguin,</b> from its habit, while on shore, of throwing its head backwards, and making a loud strange noise, very like the braying of an ass; but while at sea, and undisturbed, its note is very deep and solemn, and is often heard in the night-time. In diving, its little wings are used as fins; but on the land, as front legs. When crawling, it may be said on four legs, through the tussocks or {{on the side of a}} grassy cliff, it moves so very quickly that it might easily be mistaken for a quadruped. When at sea and fishing, it comes to the surface for the purpose of breathing with such a spring, and dives again so instantaneously, that I defy any one at first sight to be sure that it was not a fish leaping for sport.|$|E

The {{foraging}} {{of breeding}} <b>Jackass</b> <b>Penguins</b> Spheniscus demersus was studied {{in and around}} southwestern Cape Province, Saldanha Bay (33 ⁰ S, 18 ⁰ E), South Africa. Penguins are difficult to observe at sea. Hence, I devised {{a number of new}} techniques for studying the foraging behaviour of <b>Jackass</b> <b>Penguins</b> at sea. I built electronic and autoradiographic remote-sensing devices to measure swimming speed, distance travelled and time spent at each depth by foraging <b>Jackass</b> <b>Penguins.</b> Penguin swimming speed was reduced in proportion to the cross-sectional area of the devices, and results derived from birds wearing the devices had to be interpreted accordingly. Penguins do not regurgitate their stomach contents when handled, so I constructed a wet-offloading stomach pump which extracted 100 % of the stomach contents. Using this pump, I determined that the rate of digestion of fish and squid by <b>Jackass</b> <b>Penguins</b> differed. Care is needed in diet interpretations where both fish and squid are major food items...|$|R

The {{relationships}} between the pelagic purse-seine fishery and <b>Jackass</b> <b>penguins</b> (Spheniscus demersus) were investigated at Saldanha Bay, on the south-western coast of South Africa, between December 1982 and August 1983. The distribution at sea and the foraging behaviour of <b>Jackass</b> <b>Penguins</b> were examined by running standard transects with a sail boat in waters close to the birds' breeding islands. The use of a sail boat permitted close observation of foraging penguins with minimal disturbance. Penguin numbers at sea were lowest in December, when birds were confined to the breeding islands during moulting and were high in March and July during breeding peaks. While most penguin group sizes were small (one or two birds), over 44 % of penguins occurred in groups of more than 10 birds. Three stereotypic penguin group formations occurred: 'facing-search', 'line-abreast', and 'pointed-ovoid'. Penguins also foraged in association with other sea birds and marine mammals...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 68 - 83. In {{this thesis}} {{the use of}} the <b>jackass</b> <b>penguin</b> Spheniscus demersus as a sampler of the marine {{environment}} is assessed. Between February 1987 and July 1988, 638 monthly diet samples were obtained from adult jackass penguins at west - (Marcus and Jutten Islands) and southwest-coast (Dyer Island) colonies off South Africa, supplementing data collected since 1980. Penguin diet was compared over time and between colonies in order to establish {{the presence or absence of}} qualitative changes or quantified trends in the biology of pelagic schooling fish species important to the South African purseseine fishery, viz. anchovy Engraulis capensis, pilchard Sardinops ocellatus, maasbanker Trachurus trachurus and red-eye Etrumeus whiteheadii. The principal prey of jackass penguins and major contributor to commercial catches is anchovy and, consequently, the biology of this fish species was emphasized. Monthly and annual trends in prey composition and anchovy size-range were related to the availability, abundance and distribution of the penguins' prey species in the marine environment...|$|E
50|$|Black-backed jackals are omnivores, which feed on invertebrates, such as beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, millipedes, spiders and scorpions. They {{will also}} feed on mammals, such as rodents, hares and young antelopes {{up to the}} size of topi calves. They will also feed on carrion, lizards, and snakes. A pair of black-backed jackals in the Kalahari desert was {{observed}} to kill a kori bustard and, on a separate occasion, a black mamba via prolonged harassment of the snake and crushing of the snake's head. Black-backed jackals will occasionally feed on fruits and berries. In coastal areas, they will feed on beached marine mammals, seals, fish and mussels. A single jackal is capable of killing a healthy adult impala. Adult dik-dik and Thomson's gazelles seem to be the upper limit of their killing capacity, though they will target larger species if those are sick, with one pair having been observed to harass a crippled bull rhinoceros. They typically kill tall prey by biting at the legs and loins, and will frequently go for the throat. In Serengeti woodlands, they feed heavily on African grass rats. In East Africa, during the dry season, they hunt the young of gazelles, impalas, topi, tsessebe and warthogs. In South Africa, black-backed jackals frequently prey on antelopes (primarily impala and springbok and occasionally duiker, reedbuck and steenbok), carrion, hares, hoofed livestock, insects, and rodents. They will also prey on small carnivores, such as mongooses, polecats and wildcats. On the coastline of the Namib Desert, jackals feed primarily on marine birds (mainly Cape and white-breasted cormorants and <b>jackass</b> <b>penguins),</b> marine mammals (including Cape fur seals), fish, and insects. Like most canids, the black-backed jackal caches surplus food.|$|R
