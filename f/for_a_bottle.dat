5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E

25|$|After her husband's death, Laura Upthegrove {{lived under}} an assumed name in western Florida for a time. In {{the next two}} years, she was arrested on several {{occasions}} before eventually opening a gas station at Canal Point on Lake Okeechobee. She later {{moved in with her}} mother in Upthegrove Beach. On August 6, 1927, she died during an argument with a man trying to buy moonshine from her. In the heat of the moment, she swallowed a bottle of disinfectant and died within minutes. It is unclear whether it was an accident, as some claim she mistook it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of gin, but it was widely reported that she had committed suicide. She was 30 years old.|$|E
500|$|The works Banksy has {{included}} in Better Out Than In primarily consist of stencil graffiti, {{much of which}} are political in nature. His first installment, which he captioned [...] "the street is in play", depicted a child reaching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of spray paint on a sign reading [...] "graffiti is a crime". The sign was stolen and later replaced by Queens-based graffiti group Smart Crew with a new sign that read [...] "street art is a crime". Like most of his other works, the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website or by calling a toll-free 800 number.|$|E
500|$|The crowd became {{steadily}} younger over time. In the 1990s, {{when her}} parents still operated the bar, Barisich {{asked if she could}} sell a case of what was then considered premium beer. She recalled, [...] "I convinced them to let me buy a case of Heineken's, which at that time sold for unheard-of price of a buck a bottle. My dad said that people would never pay that much <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of beer, and they'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn't sell." [...] Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful. Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz-Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment.|$|E

500|$|One of the Silence calls Rory [...] "the man who {{dies and}} dies again", a {{reference}} to the many times he appears to die. The episode's main plot centres around the damage caused by River when she tries to re-write a fixed point in time. The concept of [...] "fixed points" [...] in history which may not be altered, even by the Doctor or his companions, was introduced in The Aztecs (1964) and was named and explored in the new series with episodes such as [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] and [...] "The Waters of Mars". When River meets Amy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of wine, she is wearing military fatigues and says that she [...] "just climbed out of the Byzanthium", and that she saw Amy there. This refers to events in [...] "Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] (the [...] "crash of the Byzanthium" [...] first being mentioned in [...] "Silence in the Library".) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} U2 have {{undertaken}} {{a number of}} side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates. In 1985, Bono recorded the song [...] "In a Lifetime" [...] with the Irish band Clannad. The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film Captive in 1986, which included a vocal performance by Sinéad O'Connor that predates her own debut album by a year. Bono and the Edge wrote the song [...] "She's a Mystery to Me" [...] for Roy Orbison, which was featured on his 1989 album Mystery Girl. In 1990, Bono and the Edge provided the soundtrack to the Royal Shakespeare Company London stage adaptation of [...] (one track, [...] "Alex Descends into Hell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bottle</b> of Milk/Korova 1", was on the b-side to [...] "The Fly" [...] single). That same year, Mullen co-wrote and produced a song for the Republic of Ireland national football team {{in time for the}} 1990 FIFA World Cup called [...] "Put 'Em Under Pressure", which topped the Irish charts for 13 weeks.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, the FDA {{reported}} {{shortages of}} some, but not all, forms of doxycyline [...] "caused by increased demand and manufacturing issues". Companies involved included an unnamed major generics manufacturer that ceased production in February 2013, Teva (which ceased production in May 2013), Mylan, Actavis, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals. The shortage {{came at a}} particularly bad time, since there were also shortages of an alternative antibiotic, tetracycline, at the same time. The market price for doxycycline dramatically increased in the United States in 2013 and early 2014 (from $20 to over $1800 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of 500 tablets), before decreasing again.|$|E
2500|$|Although Jacob Crimmel {{would remain}} with Fostoria Glass through its {{eventual}} move to West Virginia, Henry Crimmel {{became involved with}} Novelty Glass Company of Fostoria. [...] Novelty was located on the original Fostoria site for the Buttler Art Glass Company, which was destroyed by fire in 1889. [...] Henry Crimmel and his son, A. C. Crimmel were {{among a group of}} six listed as the “incorporators”. [...] Henry Crimmel was the plant manager, while son A. C. Crimmel was the new company’s secretary. [...] The works opened in early 1891, making items such as figurine salt shakers, punch bowls, cups, and other blown-ware. [...] Glass bottles were also one of the plant’s products, and in 1892 Henry received a patent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> and stopper combination that could be resealed but not refilled. [...] The original Novelty Glass Company was short-lived: [...] it became part of the U.S. Glass Company (as Factory T) in mid-1892, and was destroyed by fire in 1893.|$|E
2500|$|Faber {{published}} {{the book in}} 1936. Though reviews treated it as a major work of art, the book did not sell well. Barnes received no advance from Faber and the first royalty statement was for only £43; the U.S. edition published by Harcourt, Brace the following year fared no better. Barnes had published little journalism in the 1930s and was largely dependent on Peggy Guggenheim's financial support. She was constantly ill and drank more and more heavily—according to Guggenheim, she accounted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> of whiskey a day. In February 1939 she checked into a hotel in London and attempted suicide. Guggenheim funded hospital visits and doctors, but finally lost patience and sent her back to New York. There she shared a single room with her mother, who coughed all night and who kept reading her passages from Mary Baker Eddy, having converted to Christian Science. In March 1940 her family sent her to a sanatorium in upstate New York to dry out. Furious, Barnes began to plan a biography of her family, writing to Emily Coleman that [...] "there is no reason any longer why I should feel for {{them in any way}} but hate." [...] This idea would eventually come to fruition in her play The Antiphon. After she returned to New York City, she quarreled bitterly with her mother and was thrown out on the street.|$|E

50|$|Cold-pressed juices {{could cost}} $10 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 16-ounce <b>bottle,</b> and {{as high as}} $12 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 12-ounce <b>bottle.</b> The high cost has been {{attributed}} to the organic ingredients and the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process is costly as an HPP machine could cost from $800,000 to over 2 million. Alternatively, the incremental cost of toll processing could range from $0.25 - $0.45 per bottle, not including transport. Juice companies say that consumers who juice at home with similar ingredients will pay a similar price.|$|R
