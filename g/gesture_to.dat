30|$|In this research, we {{investigated}} whether teacher <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> linked representations—including symbolic representations (equations) and visuospatial representations (graphs)—would promote student learning from a lesson about {{the links between}} those representations. Instead, we found that teachers’ <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the equations were detrimental to students’ learning. We did not find compelling evidence that teachers’ <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> graphs were beneficial for students’ learning.|$|R

30|$|But, was the {{information}} in the teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the equations actually more redundant than {{the information}} in the teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the graphs? Perhaps so. As noted above, the teacher's speech referred quite unambiguously to the digits in the equations (e.g., pointing to the “ 2 ” in the equation while saying “ 2 ”), and in this sense, her gestures were redundant with her speech. The information expressed in <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the graph was also redundant with speech (e.g., the teacher said, “we go over to the 2 on the x-axis” while tracing along the x-axis from the origin to (0, 2)). However, there are inherent differences in how verbal and visuospatial representations present information; Schnotz (2002) characterized this difference in terms of the distinction between descriptive representations (such as text or equations), which represent content via convention, and depictive representations (visual displays, such as diagrams or graphs), which represent content via common structural features that are either concrete or abstract. One potential consequence of these differences is that <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> visuospatial representations may be inherently less redundant with speech about those representations than are <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> symbolic representations that occur with speech about those representations. If this is the case, then <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> equations, by virtue of being more redundant with speech, should be more likely than <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> graphs to evoke extraneous processing that can be detrimental to performance.|$|R

Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E

5|$|During season 2, it is {{revealed}} that Pope {{had been involved}} in an electoral fraud scheme that had ensured Fitz's election. During a break in her relationship with Fitz, Pope develops an emotional and physical attachment to Fitz's Navy colleague Jake Ballard (Scott Foley). Fitz' affair with Pope caused him to become estranged from his wife, Mellie (Bellamy Young), and led to his romantic <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> move Pope into the White House. However, the season ended with Pope telling Fitz he should go back to his wife and run for reelection after Fitz and Pope were driven apart by White House Chief of Staff Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry). The season ends with a mysterious relationship with her father, Rowan Pope (Joe Morton), coming to the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, Napoleon ordered this bucentaur to be destroyed, {{less for}} the sake of its golden decorations than as a {{political}} <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> symbolize his victory in conquering the city. French soldiers broke up the carved wooden portions and the gold decorations of the ship into small pieces, carted them to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and set fire to them to recover the gold. The ship burned for three days, and French soldiers used 400 mules to carry away its gold. The decorative elements of the vessel that survived the flames are preserved in the Museo Civico Correr in Venice, and there is a detailed scale model of the vessel in the Arsenale. The hull survived and, renamed the Prama Hydra and armed with four cannons, was stationed {{at the mouth of the}} Lido's port where it served as a coastal battery. Subsequently, the ship was returned to the Arsenale and used as a prison ship until it was entirely destroyed in 1824.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a {{goodwill}} <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> South Korea {{during a}} visit to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E

They soon develop a relationship, with Sun wanting {{to run away}} with Jin to America, but Jin insisting they honorably tell her father that they are seeing each other. Sun's father approves of their relationship as long as Jin takes a job working for him. One night after they're married, Jin returns home covered in someone else's blood. Sun is angry that he refuses to explain the blood to her and slaps him. He tells Sun that he does whatever her father tells him to do. A few years later, Sun secretly plots to leave Jin and her father, so she will be free to go wherever she wants. However, she does not go through with her plans after he expresses a loving <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> her, and boards Flight 815 with her husband.|$|E
5|$|The League {{kicked off}} in September 1888, with Preston {{one of the}} 12 founder members. North End proved {{superior}} to their opponents, winning the title with several matches to spare. This allowed the club {{to concentrate on the}} FA Cup, which they duly won by defeating Wolverhampton Wanderers. In completing the League and Cup double Preston remained unbeaten for the entire season. The team, nicknamed the Invincibles, contained ten Scots, tempted south by the money on offer as professionalism was still banned in Scotland. Wishing for a grander <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> celebrate his team's success than the League committee's suggestion of a flag bearing the club's name, Sudell convinced the League to spend 50 guineas on a trophy. However, despite being responsible for the creation of the trophy, Preston North End have not won it since.|$|E

5|$|The {{main effect}} of the aid package was to fuel a rapid {{expansion}} in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials {{were aware of the}} failure of the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the solidification of urban support for the government to be very important. They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding as a <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.|$|E

José Mourinho was ordered to the stands after Chelsea's {{equaliser}} for making a <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> the Liverpool fans. Despite the incident, Chelsea continued their dominance into extra-time and a goal each from Didier Drogba and Mateja Kežman gave them a 3–1 lead.

The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E
