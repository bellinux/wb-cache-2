40|$|Introduction: By {{increase}} of esthetic demand, application of resin composite as a posterior restoration {{is greater than}} before. Microleakage and post operative sensitivity are two challenges {{to the success of}} this filling material. To overcome these, the best selection of dentin bonding system and light curing units are important. This study evaluated the two above mentioned factors. Methods and Materials: In this experimental study class II cavities were prepared in both mesial and distal side of 30 healthy third molar teeth, and the samples randomly divided into 4 groups. Each group restored by use of one of these bonding system: total etch (Excite) or self etch (SE Bond) and one of light curing units: QTH or LED, and a similar restorative composite. After thermocycling, sealing and immersing the samples in dye, they sectioned and evaluated by steriomicroscope and analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Results: LED light curing unit and self etch bonding agent had best result in controlling microleakage. Conclusion: LED depth of cure is more than that of QTH and the efficacy of self <b>etch</b> <b>primer</b> to infiltration etched dentin is greeter than total etch dentin bonding agents, because they do not dehydrate dentin and do not collapse collagen fibers.

40|$|Introduction: Today a new {{restorative}} resin called “Class V cervical restorative resin” with itsspecific surface sealer “Seal-n-Shine” {{has been}} introduced to use for reducing of micro leakage inclass V restorations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of surface sealer or self-etchprimer on micro leakage around class V cavities filled with “Class V cervical restorative resin”. •Methods and Materials: In this in vitro experimental study, wedge shaped cavities were prepared onfacial surface of 40 intact premolars, using No. 56 carbide bur. The occlusal margin was prepared inenamel and the cervical margin was in cement. The teeth then were divided into 4 groups of 10. Fourgroups of materials were used, one for each group of the teeth: class V restorative resin; class Vrestorative resin and its specific sealer; self – <b>etch</b> <b>primer</b> of Clearfil SE Bond and Class V restorativeresin; and self – <b>etch</b> <b>primer</b> of Clearfil SE Bond, class V restorative resin and surface sealer ofClearfil SE Bond. Then all the samples were thermo cycled (1500 cycle, 5 - 55). Afterwards they wereplaced in 50 % silver nitrate solution and developing solution, respectively. Finally they were sectionedlongitudinally and were evaluated by stereo-microscope at × 28 magnifications. The data wasanalyzed using Kruskall-Wallis and Man-Whitney tests. •Results: There were no significant differences in micro leakage of enamel margins between the fourgroups. But, considering the dentinal margins, the differences were significant between groups 1, 2; 1, 3; and 1, 4. The differences between the other two paired groups were insignificant. •Conclusion: For decrease of micro leakage, the usage of class V cervical restorative resin per se is noteffective, and it is better to apply its specific sealer (Seal-n-Shine) on the surface of restoration, or aself-etch dentin bonding agent under it. •Key words: Micro leakage, Rebounding, Surface sealant, Self-etch primer, Class V restorations...|$|E
40|$|Composite resin is {{a widely}} used {{aesthetic}} restoration. The restoration can fail due to secondary caries. Chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % {{is used as a}} cavity disinfectant to eliminate microorganisms on the prepared cavity and to prevent the secondary caries. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the effect of chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % to the bond strength of composite resin with self etch system adhesive on dentine. Sixteen specimens of buccal dentine of premolars crown are divided into 2 different groups. Group I: Clearfil SE Bond self-etch primer was applied for 20 seconds, Clearfil SE Bond bonding was applied for 5 seconds and polymerized for 10 seconds. Composite resin was constructed incrementally and polymerized for 20 seconds. Group II: prior to self <b>etch</b> <b>primer</b> application as in group I, chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % was applied for 15 seconds.

40|$|AIM: 1. To {{determine}} {{in vitro}} bond strength {{of metal and}} ceramic orthodontic brackets when using <b>etch</b> and separate <b>primer,</b> or self-etching primer (SEP) 2. To assess remaining adhesive following removal of orthodontic bracket METHOD: 180 previously extracted teeth were randomly allocated to one of six test groups. Each was subjected to either separate <b>etch</b> and <b>primer</b> or SEP and then bonded with an orthodontic bracket. These were metal (3 M Unitek Victory), metal reinforced ceramic (3 M Unitek Clarity) and poly-crystalline ceramic (3 M Unitek Transcend). Samples were stored at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Each bracket was debonded using shear force applied by the Instron Universal testing machine. Samples were examined under x 10 light microscopy and allocated an Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) score. RESULTS: Variation in shear bond strength (SBS) was seen across all groups. Lowest SBS was recorded with Victory series brackets bonded with SEP (7. 08 MPa) and the highest was with Clarity series brackets bonded with separate <b>etch</b> and <b>primer</b> (15. 96 MPa). Pooled data showed significantly higher SBS with separate <b>etch</b> and <b>primer</b> than SEP (T= 2. 83, p< 0. 01). Significant correlation for ARI score was found with Clarity series brackets and SEP. Multiple Chi squared analysis showed no significant correlation between test group and ARI score. CONCLUSION: Separate <b>etch</b> and <b>primer</b> provides a significantly greater bond strength then SEP. Greater amounts of adhesive remain on the tooth surface when SBS exceeds 12. 4 MPa.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of water and saliva {{contamination}} on shear bond strength of APC Plus orthodontic brackets bonded with 3 different adhesives (Transbond XT, Transbond Moisture Insensitive Primer, and Transbond Plus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer)</b> 24 h after bonding and after thermocycling. A total of 270 bovine permanent mandibular incisor were randomly divided into 18 groups (n= 15). Each adhesive material was tested in 3 different enamel surface conditions: dry, water and saliva application after etching. As a result 9 groups were defined and debonded after 24 h 9 other similarly partitioned groups debonded after thermocycling (1500 thermocycles: 5 ± 2 / 50 ± 5 °C, bath 30 ", transfer 5 "). The samples have been subjected to a shear bond test and data were statistically analyzed (ANOVA, Scheffè). The adhesive surfaces of enamel have been observed (16 x) before bonding brackets and after the detachment to assess the quantity of adhesive left on the surface (ARI score; Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney tests). Conventional adhesive had the highest bond strength on dry enamel surfaces and the lowest on moisture contemned surfaces (p< 0. 001). Transbond Plus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer</b> and Transbond Moisture Insensitive Primer were less influenced by water and saliva contamination (p< 0. 05) without significant differences.

40|$|Conventional {{adhesive}} systems use {{three different}} agents, an enamel conditioner, a primer solution, and an adhesive resin during the bonding of orthodontic brackets to enamel. A unique characteristic of some new bonding systems in operative dentistry, {{is that they}} combine the conditioning and priming agents into a single application. Combining conditioning and priming saves time and should be more cost-effective to the clinician and indirectly to the patient. AIM: To assess and compare the effects of using two self-etch primers including an experimental one, on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets. DESIGN: In vitro study. SETTING: College of Dentistry, University of Iowa. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The brackets were bonded to extracted human teeth {{according to one of}} three protocols; Group I (Control) : Teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid. After applying the sealant, the brackets were bonded with Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, California, USA) and light cured for 20 seconds. Group II: A self-etch acidic primer (ESPE Dental AG, Seefeld, Germany) was placed on the enamel for 15 seconds and gently evaporated with air as suggested by the manufacturer. The brackets were then bonded with Transbond XT as in the first group. Group III: A new experimental self-etch primer EXL# 547 (3 M ESPE, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA), was rubbed on the enamel for 10 seconds and left to stand for 20 seconds before it was air-dried and then light cured for 10 seconds. The brackets were then bonded as in groups I and II RESULTS: The present in vitro findings indicated that the shear bond strengths of the three groups were significantly different (P= 0. 018). Duncan multiple range tests indicated that Prompt L-Pop had a significantly lower (mean = 7. 1 ± 4. 4 MPa) shear bond strength than both the new EXL# 547 self- <b>etch</b> <b>primer</b> (mean = 9. 7 ± 3. 7 MPa) or phosphoric acid and the conventional adhesive system (mean = 10. 4 ± 2. 8 MPa).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of blood {{contamination}} on shear bond strength (SBS) and bond failure pattern of metallic brackets bonded using a new hydrophilic resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty human premolars were randomly allocated into 4 groups (n= 20) according to the bonding material and contamination pattern. GI: brackets bonded with the Transbond XT conventional system without contamination; GII: brackets bonded with the Transbond XT conventional system with blood contamination; GIII: brackets bonded with the Transbond Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer</b> and Transbond Plus Color without contamination; GIV: brackets bonded with the Transbond Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer</b> and Transbond Plus Color with blood contamination. The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h and then submitted to SBS test at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. After bond failure, the enamel surfaces were observed under an optical microscope at 40 x magnification. RESULTS: Blood contamination decreased (P< 0. 05) shear bond strength when both the hydrophobic (GII) and the hydrophilic resin (GIV) were used. However, the bond strength of Transbond Color Change group was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that of the Transbond XT conventional system group under blood contamination condition. Under dry conditions no difference was observed between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic resin groups. Regarding the bond failure pattern, when blood contaminated the enamel, the adhesive remnant index (ARI) showed predominance of scores 0 and 1, which indicates low adhesion to enamel. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a significant decrease in the shear bond strength for both adhesive systems under blood contamination, the hydrophilic system showed significantly higher bond strength than the hydrophobic resin adhesive. Therefore, it is advisable to use the hydrophilic resin under risk of blood contamination...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} caries infiltrant preconditioning on the shear bond strength of orthodontic resin cements on sound and demineralized enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stainless-steel brackets were bonded to sound or artificially demineralized (14 d, acidic buffer, pH 5. 0) bovine enamel specimens using a resin cement {{or a combination of}} caries infiltrant preconditioning (Icon, DMG) and the respective resin cement (light-curing composite: Heliosit Orthodontic, Transbond XT, using either Transbond XT Primer or Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer; light-curing resin-modified glass ionomer cement: Fuji Ortho; or self-curing composite: Concise Orthodontic Bonding System). Each group consisted of 15 specimens. Shear bond strength was evaluated after thermo-cycling (10, 000 ×, 5 °C to 55 °C) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, and data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney test, and Weibull statistics. Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scores and enamel fractures were determined at 25 × magnification and were statistically analyzed by regression analyses (P <. 05). RESULTS: The caries infiltrant system significantly increased the shear bond strength of Transbond XT Primer, Transbond Plus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer,</b> and Fuji Ortho in sound specimens, and of all resin cements except for the Concise Orthodontic Bonding System in demineralized enamel. Overall, caries infiltrant preconditioning decreased significantly the number of enamel fractures, but it did not affect ARI scores.

30|$|In {{the current}} study, using the caries infiltrant (ICON) before bonding did not {{significantly}} change the bond strength {{compared to the other}} groups, although the bond strength was lower when self-etching primer was used than when phosphoric acid was used for enamel preparation before bonding. This was also observed in the control group; shear bond strength was lower when self-etching primer was used than when phosphoric acid was used, but this difference was statistically insignificant. Previous studies found {{a significant increase in the}} shear bond strength of Transbond XT adhesive with phosphoric acid and Transbond XT primer when ICON was used before bonding orthodontic brackets to sound enamel [[36]] or even to demineralized enamel [[37]]. The shear bond strength was also increased when Transbond Plus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer</b> was used instead of the conventional phosphoric acid etching to sound enamel [[36]]. The shear bond strengths recorded in this study were sufficient for clinical use in all the six groups presenting different combinations of adhesive systems and enamel protective agents as well as control groups. The average range of bond strength was suggested by Reynolds [[38]] to be 5.9 to 7.8  MPa for clinical and 4.9  MPa for laboratory performances. In vitro and in vivo studies of SBS are both needed; in vitro measurements of shear bond strength provide useful information about the bonding efficiency of different types of materials, but the actual performance of these materials can only be evaluated in the environment where they were intended to function [[39]]. Unfortunately, no one variable or combination of variables that can be measured in the laboratory is perfectly predictive of what might occur when the bonding adhesive is used in the demanding environment of the oral cavity [[40]-[42]]. Therefore; in vitro studies are mainly important as a preliminary guide to the clinician, while in vivo studies are needed for evidence-based practice.|$|R

METODOLOGIA: para este estudo foram realizados ensaios in vivo com dinamômetro portátil digital e {{in vitro}} com máquina de ensaios mecânicos {{universal}} com e sem termociclagem, complementado pelo Índice de Adesivo Remanescente (IAR). Braquetes Edgewise Standard (Abzil) foram colados utilizando adesivo Transbond Plus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer</b> (SEP) e Resina Transbond XT. Foram formados 3 grupos com 10 dentes em cada um deles. No GI os braquetes foram colados nos segundos pré-molares dos pacientes. Nos GII e GIII utilizaram-se primeiros pré-molares extraídos por motivos ortodônticos. Os ensaios mecânicos do GI foram realizados 24 horas após a polimerização diretamente na boca dos pacientes com dinamômetro portátil digital. No GII os corpos-de-prova foram armazenados em água destilada e levados à estufa a 37 ºC durante 24 horas e, posteriormente, submetidos à termociclagem, com 1000 ciclos a 5 e 55 ºC. No GIII os corpos-de-prova foram armazenados em água destilada em temperatura ambiente por 24 horas e posteriormente submetidos aos ensaios mecânicos. RESULTADOS: os valores médios da resistência ao cisalhamento em Megapascal foram de: GI = 4, 39; GII = 7, 11 e GIII = 7, 35. Após a descolagem foram realizadas fotografias das áreas de colagem, tanto dos dentes submetidos a testes in vivo quanto in vitro e ampliadas 5 x para facilitar a visualização.

40|$|Purpose:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of two adhesion promoters, EnhancetmLC and AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin, and their effects with two different adhesion systems (Light Bondtmand TransbondtmXT). To better understand their behavior upon failure, the amount of adhesive remnant remaining on the tooth surface was also observed. Methods:One-hundred forty human premolars, which were extracted for reasons other than this study, were utilized and divided into seven groups of 20 teeth each. Groups A 1 and B 1 were bonded without adhesion promoters and with two different adhesive systems - Light Bondtmand TransbondtmXT. Groups A 2 and B 2 were bonded using EnhancetmLC. Groups A 3 and B 3 were bonded using AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin. Group C, a third reference control, was bonded with TransbondtmPlus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer,</b> not amenable with the adhesion promoter bonding protocol. A Universal Testing Machine was used to create bond failure and obtain the shear bond strength (SBS). After debonding, teeth and brackets were scored with a modified adhesive remnant index (ARI). Kruskal-Wallis with a Post-Hoc Bonferroni tests were completed on all SBS and ARI data. Results:This study demonstrated that no significant differences were found in SBS of samples bonded with adhesion promoters, relative to their controls. Groups bonded with AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin had significantly higher ARI scores than the control groups and groups bonded with EnhancetmLC. Shear bond Strengths achieved with the self-etching primer were comparable to conventional bond strengths with and without adhesion promoters. ARI scores for the self-etching primer resulted in more adhesive remnant than conventional bonding. Conclusions:The application of adhesion promoters, EnhancetmLC and AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin, did not significantly increase SBS compared to non-adhesion promoter bonding with either adhesive system (TransbondtmXT and Light Bondtm) upon normal enamel. The adhesion promoters did not demonstrate a material-specific predilection for one adhesive system over another.

Materials and methods: For the study, 80 bovine incisors were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups (n= 16 each) : XT- acid etching + Transbond XT, XT/Er:YAG- Transbond XT associated with Er:YAG laser irradiation (λ= 2. 94 μm, 60 mJ, 10 Hz) and SEP- Transbond Plus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer.</b> Samples were submitted to thermal-mechanical cycling, simulating 1 year of orthodontic treatment. Afterward, the shear bond strength test was performed in a universal test machine at a speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Samples were evaluated under a stereomicroscope and by scanning electron microscopy for analysis of enamel surface and adhesive remnant index. Data were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney (with Bonferroni correction) statistical tests. Results: Statistically significant difference was observed between the groups studied (p< 0. 05). Groups XT and SEP showed the highest bond strength values, without statistical difference between them, while group XT/Er:YAG showed reduction in bond strength values. Higher frequency of adhesive failures between enamel and adhesive system was verified for groups XT and XT/Er:YAG. Conclusion: The conventional (XT) and self-etching (SEP) adhesive systems showed mean bond strength values, similar between them, whereas the previous application of Er:YAG laser promoted the lowest bond strength values.

Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the shear bond strength of metallicbrackets with the composite Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, USA) in severalenamel preparations and to evaluate, after the debonded process, the adhesiveremnant index (ARI). One hundred and fourteen bovine permanent inferior incisorswere included in plastic tubes, in a center position, with an acrylic resin leaving thevestibular face of the tooth perpendicular to the bottom plane of the tube. Thevestibular face of all the teeth were cleared with a nonfluoridated pumice andwater for 10 seconds, washed, dried for the same time and divided in eight groups:Group I- the composite Transbond XT was used in a conventional way; Group IItheenamel was dried and the Transbond MIP (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, USA) wasapplied; Group III- the enamel was contaminated with human saliva and theTransbond MIP was applied; Group IV- the enamel was moistened with distilledwater and soon afterwards the Transbond MIP was applied; Group V- enamelwas etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 30 seconds, washed, dried and appliedthe same primer of the Groups II, III and IV; Groups VI, VII and VIII- TransbondPlus Self <b>Etching</b> <b>Primer</b> (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, USA) was applied in dry enamel,contaminated with saliva and moistened with distilled water, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare shear bond {{strengths}} of brackets bonded to stainless steel crowns using various orthodontic adhesives and surface conditioning techniques. One hundred and twenty mandibular first molar stainless steel crowns were randomly divided into groups: (1) : Aluminablasting + Metal Primer + Assure; (2) : Aluminablasting + Silane Coupling Agent + Transbond; (3) : Diamond Bur Abrasion + Metal Primer + Assure; (4) : Diamond Bur Abrasion + Silane Coupling Agent + Transbond; (5 : control) : Acid <b>Etching</b> + Metal <b>Primer</b> + Assure; (6 : control) : Acid Etching + Silane Coupling Agent + Transbond. Bond strength was tested using a universal testing machine. 				Both aluminablasting and diamond bur abrasion surface preparation techniques, when used in conjunction with metal primer and Assure bonding resin, reached clinically acceptable bond strength values (9. 05 and 9. 30 MPa, respectively).

40|$|Self etching primers, due to ease of manipulation, {{have been}} {{extensively}} used in recent years. These self etching primers containing a relatively weak acid, may not provide an optimal bond strength. The {{purpose of the}} present in-vitro investigation was to evaluate the effects of 37 % phosphoric acid application prior to applying self etching primers on composite bond strength. In this experimental study a total of 48 premolar and molar teeth, free of caries, filling, abrasion, crack or other dental defects were selected. The extracted teeth were immediately stored in physiologic serum and divided randomly into two equal groups (n= 24). Each group was also divided into two subgroups of twelve teeth each as follows: Subgroup A: enamel was not acid-etched, subgroup B: enamel was acid-etched (group I). Subgroup C: dentin was not acid- etched, subgroup D: dentin was acid-etched (group II). In acid-conditioned groups, water rinsing was followed by the application of a bonding agent (<b>Etch</b> & <b>Primer</b> 3), however for non-acid-treated groups, just the bonding agent was used. Then composite resin blocks (1. 5 × 2 mm and 2. 5 mm in diameter) were formed and light cured at all directions for 40 seconds, following this the specimens were placed in an Instron universal testing machine to determine shear bond strength. The data were analyzed by t-test. Results showed that no statistically significant differences were between the mean values of etch and un-etch enamel (P= 0. 232), similarly those of etch and un-etch dentin (P= 0. 148). In this investigation we concluded that acidic components employed in self-etching primers were of weak type, but self-etching primers could be used without phosphoric acid conditioning...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion to enamel {{has become}} a routine {{technique}} in restorative dentistry. Adhesion to dentin, however, is still under investigation. Except structural elements of the dentin, smear layer {{has been one of}} the reasons that the interaction between the adhesive system and this tissue is difficult. The smear layer tissue created by cutting a tooth. It varies in thickness, roughness, density and degree of attachment andoccludes tubules and reduces the dental permeabilita. Dentin adhesivesystems can react with intertubular and peritubular dentin only when this smear layer is removed or when the adhesive system is capable of diffusion through layer of debris. As part of restorative procedures required by adhesive dentistry, the smear layer must be removed, modified or impregnated by the resin to allow for bonding between the tooth and the restorative material. For remove and dissolve of smear layer acid conditioners on total <b>etch</b> and self-etching <b>primers</b> were used. Self-etching primer systems are undergoing rapid evolution; their results are not yet sufficiently predictable overall, but some systems have achieved positive results in both enamel and dentin bonding. Further studies are necessary to confirm the long-term efficiency of these self-etching primers...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} and compare the shear bond strength of 4 fissure sealant systems (Dyract Seal, Concise, Visio-Seal, Helioseal) to enamel using conventional <b>etch</b> and self-etching <b>primer</b> (Prompt-L-Pop). METHODS: Fifty-six newly extracted noncarious first permanent molars were used and embedded in a Teflon mold (3 -mm height, 3 -mm internal diameter). Mesial surfaces were exposed to a flattened area of enamel and then dried and washed. The teeth were divided into 8 groups, each consisting of 7 specimens stored in 37 degrees C distilled water for 24 hours. Then specimens were tested in a shear mode (Instron) at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. The mean and standard deviations were subjected to an analysis of variance. RESULTS: The average bond strengths using Prompt-L-Pop were: (1) Dyract Seal= 20. 61 MPa; (2) Concise= 23. 42 MPa; (3) Visio-Seal= 2. 94 MPa; and (4) Helioseal= 11. 83 MPa. These values were higher than and statistically different from those of Dyract Seal (10. 18 MPa) and Concise (9. 17 MPa) when the conventional etch system was used (student t test, P<. 001). CONCLUSION: The bond strengths of Prompt-L-Pop, in conjunction with Dyract Seal and Concise fissure sealant materials, exceeded those of conventional etch. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Background: Newer {{available}} {{composite resin}} adhesives have chromatic agents that change their color during setting from pink to colorless. It has an advantage of easy flash removal thus {{reducing the amount}} of plaque accumulation and helping patients to maintain better hygiene. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare shear bond strengths of light-cure orthodontic bonding agents, namely glass ionomer (FujiOrthoLC, GC Orthodontics), conventional composite resin (Transbond XT, 3 M Unitek), and color-changing composite resin (Transbond Plus, 3 M Unitek) with conventional <b>etch</b> and self-etch <b>primer</b> (Transbond PlusSEP, 3 M Unitek). Materials and Methods: Maxillary premolars (n= 300) were bonded on the facial surface in five groups. The INSTRON machine was used for shear bond strength testing. Statistical Analysis: Comparison of the mean rank among the groups was done by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To determine the mean difference among groups, the Mann-Whitney test with Bon Ferroni adjustment was applied. Observations: It was observed that light-cure conventional composite resin with the conventional etchant group had the highest and glass ionomer resin adhesive had the lowest shear bond strength. There was no statistically significant difference between conventional composite used with conventional etchant and color-changing composite resin used with conventional etchant or with self-etch primer. Conclusion: Considering the advantages of a color-changing composite and self-etch primer especially in patients having high DMFT scores or physically and mentally compromised patients unable to maintain their hygiene properly, it was concluded in the present study that it would be the most suitable material for direct bonding...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (1) to determine the depth of demineralization into intact dentin using several self-etching primer systems with different pH values, and (2) to evaluate whether hybridization of intact dentin in Clearfil SE Bond may be affected by variation in the thickness of the smear layers. Materials and Methods: Dentin disks were created from mid-coronal dentin in extracted, human third molars. Three self-etching primer systems (Clearfil Liner Bond II, Liner Bond 2 V, and SE Bond) were applied separately to these disks to evaluate how deep self-etching systems penetrate through smear layers into intact dentin. Dentin treated with All-Bond 2 using the 'no-etch' technique was used as a control group. In {{the second part of the}} study, dentin disks with different smear-layer thicknesses were produced. The cryofractured control group was devoid of a smear layer. The experimental teeth were ground with 60 -, 180 -, or 600 -grit SiC paper and bonded using SE Bond. Dentin disks were bonded together and examined with TEM. Results: All-Bond 2 did not etch beyond the smear layer. The three self-etching <b>primers</b> <b>etched</b> beyond the smear layer to form true hybrid layers within intact dentin. This layer was thickest with Liner Bond 2 (ca 1. 2 to 1. 4 μm), but very thin (0. 5 μm) using both Liner Bond 2 V and SE Bond. Application of SE Bond to dentin of different surface roughness produced hybridized smear layers of variable thickness. However, the thickness of the underlying true hybrid remained consistent for the four groups (ca 0. 4 to 0. 5 μm). Conclusion: Self-etching primers create thin hybrid layers that incorporate the smear layer. The suspicion that thick smear layers may interfere with the diffusion of self-etching primers into the underlying intact dentin was not confirmed...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate different surface treatments between new and old resin composites and to determine the best surface treatment to re-establish the original resinresin bond strength (microTBS). Materials and methods: Twenty-one 4 -mm composite blocks (Tetric Ceram, IVOCLAR VIVADENT) were kept in an incubator for 30 months. Eight different surface treatments were used: (1) Acid etching, (2) Diamond roughening + acid etch, (3) Air abrasion (CoJet, 3 M ESPE) + acid etch, (4) CoJet + SE Bond (KURARAY), (5) CoJet + acid etch + CompositeRepair (ALL DENTAL PRODX), (6) CoJet + acid <b>etch</b> + Porcelain <b>Primer</b> (BISCO), (7) CoJet + Clearfil Repair (KURARAY). Excite bonding agent (IVOCLAR VIVADENT) was applied and cured on specimens in all groups except groups 4 and 7. Fresh composite was applied and light-cured in 2 -mm increments. Immediate layering on freshly prepared 4 mm resin composite block was the control group (8). After 24 h storage in water, the specimens were sectioned into 0. 8 -mm thick slabs, trimmed to a cross-sectional area of 1 mm 2, and loaded to failure at crosshead speed of 1 mm/min using an EZ test testing machine. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey B test (p< 0. 05). Results: Resin-resin mean bond strengths were as follows in MPa: (1) 17, 5 a, (2) 30, 3 b, (3) 30, 0 b, (4) 36, 9 b,c, (5) 28, 9 b, (6) 40, 7 c,d, (7) 47, 8 d, (8) 47, 6 d.
