25|$|An object offers as much {{resistance}} to the air as the air <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome {{the resistance of the}} air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.|$|E
25|$|In 1812, Laplace issued his Théorie analytique des probabilités {{in which}} he laid down many {{fundamental}} results in statistics. The {{first half of this}} treatise was concerned with probability methods and problems, the second half with statistical methods and applications. Laplace's proofs are not always rigorous according to the standards of a later day, and his perspective slides {{back and forth between the}} Bayesian and non-Bayesian views with an ease that makes some of his investigations difficult to follow, but his conclusions remain basically sound even in those few situations where his analysis goes astray. In 1819, he published a popular account of his work on probability. This book bears the same relation to the Théorie des probabilités that the Système du monde <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Méchanique céleste.|$|E

500|$|Forensic {{toxicology}} is {{the study}} of the pharmacodynamics, or what a substance <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body, and pharmacokinetics, or what the body <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substance. [...] To accurately determine the effect a particular drug has on the human body, forensic toxicologists must be aware of various levels of tolerance that an individual can build up as well as the therapeutic index for various pharmaceuticals. [...] Toxicologists are tasked with determining whether any toxin found in a body was the cause of or contributed to an incident, or whether it was at too low a level to have had an effect. [...] While the determination of the specific toxin can be time-consuming due to the number of different substances that can cause injury or death, certain clues can narrow down the possibilities. [...] For example, carbon monoxide poisoning would result in bright red blood while death from hydrogen sulfide would cause the brain to have a green hue.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people left behind." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1958, Blake-More Godwin of the Toledo Museum of Art stated that, {{although}} September Morn {{was certainly}} art, {{it was not}} [...] "great art" [...] and was overshadowed by the controversy it had created; the painting, he said, [...] "bears the same relationship to art as a minor poem <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> classic and the imperishable". Three years later, {{in an article in}} The Kenyon Review, Alfred Werner described September Morn as a [...] "classic of kitsch" [...] and [...] "the 'idealized' nude at its worst": [...] "without a wrinkle of the skin, without any breathing of the flesh... pink, soft, spineless". This classification of kitsch has been applied by several further writers, including Kendrick and the film scholar Norman Taylor.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{felt that}} the special effects overshadowed other {{elements}} of the film. Canby stated that the film [...] "owes more to [...] than it <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> director, the writers or even the producer". Livingston felt that Trumbull and Dykstra's work on the film was not as impressive as on Star Wars and Close Encounters due to the limited amount of production time. Godfrey called the effects [...] "stunning", but conceded that they threatened to overpower the story two-thirds of the way into the film. Kroll, Martin, and Arnold agreed that the effects were not able to carry the film or gloss over its other deficiencies; [...] "I'm not sure that Trumbull & Co. have succeeded in pulling the philosophic chestnuts of Roddenberry and his co-writers out of the fire," [...] Arnold wrote.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} pilot, Rodat {{dedicated}} a five-page montage to the alien invasion, but {{decided not to}} go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds. [...] "I wrote a few drafts of it and I looked at and say, 'Ay-yay-yay, I’ve seen this before. There’s no emotion to this. It feels like one of those montages,'" [...] he said. Rodat {{came up with the idea}} of having the children in the series [...] "harnessed by aliens". [...] "When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [...] was the idea that adults are killed if they’re a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we’ll explore is what the harnessing <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kid over the course of the show but that also is something that’s going to have to unveil itself gradually," [...] he stated. Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.|$|E

50|$|A {{search was}} {{conducted}} in order to locate any damage <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface {{in the form of}} surface ruptures. This search was heavily conducted in and around the Kato Achaea train station. The Kato Achaia Train station is located about four fifths of a kilometer from the coastline. This search took place two days after the incident of the earthquake. The search consisted of a mapping of the train station, discussion with a station operator, and a careful process of observing the ground. There was significant notable damage <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rails of the station. In {{the northern part of the}} station there was both compression and extension damage noted on the ground. This <b>did</b> damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kato Achaia train station's rails. Although the rails were replaced before the inspection began. This was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>the</b> operation of the station immediately after the earthquake occurred. On the southern side of the station there was obvious evidence of compression damage <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rails. The movements of the Earth caused <b>the</b> southern rails <b>to</b> buckle together, making them unusable.|$|R
2500|$|Once the untranslatables {{have been}} set aside, the {{problems}} for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two: [...] What does the translator think the poetic line says? [...] And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the target language? [...] Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, [...] "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate." [...] Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit dilemma. [...] At the literalist extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about {{the language of the}} original Chinese poem. [...] "The dissection, though," [...] writes Link, [...] "normally <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> art of a poem approximately what the scalpel of an anatomy instructor <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> life of a frog." ...|$|E
