40|$|Waste is {{anything}} {{which is considered}} to be no longer useful to anyone. In reality, it actually possesses the ability to be the raw material for several other processes and applications. Improper <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> could result in several environmental hazards such as air pollution, soil erosion, methane emissions, low birth rate and others. In developing countries, proper <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> is one <b>of</b> the important topics to be focussed from an environmental perspective. This thesis aims to propose an improved waste collection system in Gaborone through investigating the current waste management practices in Gaborone from different perspectives. Several stakeholders were interviewed for gathering information related to the present waste legislations, waste collection, treatment, and disposal methods. A composition study was also conducted along with the other research teams in order to support the objective of this thesis. The results shows that the current waste management practices has certain flaws which the management has to overcome {{in order to avoid the}} environmental impacts caused by the waste generation in Gaborone. Basic Recycling and treatment facilities are absent in Gaborone.

5000|$|Citizen suits come {{in three}} forms. First, {{a private citizen}} can bring a lawsuit against a citizen, corporation, or {{government}} body for engaging in conduct prohibited by the statute. For example, a citizen can sue a corporation under the Clean Water Act (CWA) for illegally polluting a waterway. Second, a private citizen can bring a lawsuit against a government body for failing to perform a non-discretionary duty. For example, a private citizen could sue the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to promulgate regulations that the CWA required it to promulgate. In a third, less common form, citizens may sue for an injunction to abate a potential imminent and substantial endangerment involving generation, disposal or <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> {{regardless of whether or}} not the defendant's conduct violates a statutory prohibition. This third type of citizen suit is analogous to the common law tort of public nuisance.
