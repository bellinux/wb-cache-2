50|$|Some vendors, {{including}} Intel, use {{the term}} lockstep memory to describe a multi-channel memory layout in which cache lines are distributed between two memory channels, so {{one half of the}} cache line is stored in a DIMM on the first channel, while the second half goes to a DIMM on the second channel. By combining the single error correction and double error detection (SECDED) capabilities of two ECC-enabled DIMMs in a lockstep layout, their single-device <b>data</b> <b>correction</b> (SDDC) nature can be extended into double-device <b>data</b> <b>correction</b> (DDDC), providing protection against the failure of any single memory chip.|$|E

50|$|The density {{matching}} {{property of}} vector quantization is powerful, especially for identifying {{the density of}} large and high-dimensioned data.

50|$|Error {{detection}} and correction (EDAC) depends on an expectation {{of the kinds}} of errors that occur. Implicitly, it is assumed that the failure of each bit in a word of memory is independent, resulting in improbability of two simultaneous errors. This used to be the case when memory chips were one-bit wide, what was typical {{in the first half of}} the 1980s; later developments moved many bits into the same chip. This weakness is addressed by various technologies, including IBM's Chipkill, Sun Microsystems' Extended ECC, Hewlett Packard's Chipspare, and Intel's Single Device <b>Data</b> <b>Correction</b> (SDDC).|$|E
5000|$|A C2 {{error is}} a read error of a compact disc. C2 errors can {{to a degree}} be {{recovered}} by the hardware error detection and correction scheme. A CD drive can have extraction errors when the data on the disc is not readable due to scratches or smudges. The drive can compensate by supplying a [...] "best guess" [...] of what the missing data was, then supplying the missing data. C2 error correction is an analysis over many interleaved frames, an improvement over C1 error correction, which analyzed just one frame, resulting in more accurate <b>data</b> <b>correction.</b> C2 error correction codes are also used by the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) format.|$|E
5000|$|Using the {{strongly}} typed {{retrieval methods}} {{can be more}} cumbersome, especially without specific knowledge of the underlying data. Numeric values in the database can translate to several [...]NET types: Int16, Int32, Int64, Float, Decimal, or Currency. Trying to retrieve a value using the wrong type results in an exception being thrown, which stops code from running further, and slows the application down. This is also true when you use the right type, but encounter a DbNull value ( [...] this can be avoided by using the IsDbNull boolean function of the DataReader class [...] ). The benefit to this retrieval method is that data validation is performed sooner, improving the probability of <b>data</b> <b>correction</b> being possible.|$|E

5000|$|A {{peculiar}} {{aspect of}} nearly all IR FPAs is that the electrical responses of the pixels on a given device tend to be non-uniform. In a perfect device every pixel would output the same electrical signal when given {{the same number of}} photons of appropriate wavelength. In practice nearly all FPAs have both significant pixel-to-pixel offset and pixel-to-pixel photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU). When un-illuminated, each pixel has a different [...] "zero-signal" [...] level, and when illuminated the delta in signal is also different. This non-uniformity makes the resulting images impractical for use until they have been processed to normalize the photo-response. This correction process requires a set of known characterization data, collected from the particular device under controlled conditions. The <b>data</b> <b>correction</b> can be done in software, in a DSP or FPGA in the camera electronics, or even on the ROIC in the most modern of devices.|$|E

5000|$|Since 1989 Christy, {{along with}} Roy Spencer, has {{maintained}} an atmospheric temperature record derived from satellite microwave sounding unit measurements, commonly called the [...] "UAH" [...] record (see also satellite temperature record). This was once quite controversial: From {{the beginning of}} the satellite record in late 1978 into 1998 it showed a net global cooling trend, although ground measurements and instruments carried aloft by balloons showed warming in many areas. Part of the cooling trend seen by the satellites can be attributed to several years of cooler than normal temperatures and cooling caused by the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano. Part of the discrepancy between the surface and atmospheric trends was resolved {{over a period of several}} years as Christy, Spencer and others identified several factors, including orbital drift and decay, that caused a net cooling bias in the data collected by the satellite instruments. Since the <b>data</b> <b>correction</b> of August 1998 (and the major La Niña Pacific Ocean warming event of the same year), data collected by satellite instruments has shown an average global warming trend in the atmosphere.
