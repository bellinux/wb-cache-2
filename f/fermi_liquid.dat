5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a <b>Fermi</b> <b>liquid</b> of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} <b>Fermi</b> <b>liquid</b> theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of the color force makes the properties of quark matter unlike gas or plasma, instead leading {{to a state of}} matter more reminiscent of a liquid.

50|$|Important {{examples}} of where <b>Fermi</b> <b>liquid</b> {{theory has been}} successfully applied are most notably electrons in most metals and Liquid He-3. Liquid He-3 is a <b>Fermi</b> <b>liquid</b> at low temperatures (but not low enough to be in its superfluid phase). He-3 is an isotope of helium, with 2 protons, 1 neutron and 2 electrons per atom. Because there is an odd number of fermions inside the nucleus, the atom itself is also a fermion. The electrons in a normal (non-superconducting) metal also form a <b>Fermi</b> <b>liquid,</b> as do the nucleons (protons and neutrons) in an atomic nucleus. Strontium ruthenate displays some key properties of Fermi liquids, despite being a strongly correlated material, and is compared with high temperature superconductors like cuprates.|$|E
