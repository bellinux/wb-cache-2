40|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station’s last bulletin on Oats, in March, 1908, a number of additional experiments with this cereal were inaugurated which are now drawing toward completion. The variety test was increased to cover all of the kinds generally grown in the state; others, some new and some well known, were imported from the irrigated and “dry-farming” districts of the west, from Canada, Michigan, Missouri and Illinois, and from Scotland and England. Other experiments were undertaken upon the size and weight of seed and upon the rate and method of seeding. These, while as yet incomplete, are showing some tendencies which are valuable and should now be made public. From the variety tests we find certain types adapted to certain soils and conditions. Buying heavy seed in the open market does not show satisfactory returns for the money invested. The value of repeated fanning of seed oats has been overestimated. Longtime tests with drilling vs. broadcasting give more favorable results for the drill. <b>Heavy</b> <b>seeding</b> we find more profitable than is usually considered to be the case...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at z > 6 is still a major {{challenge}} for theoretical models. If it starts from black hole (BH) remnants of Population III stars (light seeds with mass ~ 100 Msun) it requires super-Eddington accretion. An alternative route is to start from <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> formed by the direct collapse of gas onto a ~ 10 ^ 5 Msun BH. Here we investigate the relative role of light and <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> as BH progenitors of the first SMBHs. We use the cosmological, data constrained semi-analytic model GAMETE/QSOdust to simulate several independent merger histories of z > 6 quasars. Using physically motivated prescriptions to form light and <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> in the progenitor galaxies, {{we find that the}} formation of a few <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> (between 3 and 30 in our reference model) enables the Eddington-limited growth of SMBHs at z > 6. This conclusion depends sensitively on the interplay between chemical, radiative and mechanical feedback effects, which easily erase the conditions that allow the suppression of gas cooling in the low metallicity gas (Z Jcr). We find that <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> can not form if dust cooling triggers gas fragmentation above a critical dust-to-gas mass ratio (D > Dcr). In addition, the relative importance of light and <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> depends on the adopted mass range for light seeds, as this dramatically affects the history of cold gas along the merger tree, by both SN and AGN-driven winds.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{establishment}} and evolution of the empirical correlation between black hole mass (M BH) and velocity dispersion (Σ) with redshift. We trace the growth and accretion history of massive black holes (MBHs) starting from high-redshift seeds that are planted via physically motivated prescriptions. Two seeding models are explored in this work: ‘light seeds’, derived from Population III remnants, and ‘heavy seeds’, derived from direct gas collapse. Even though the seeds themselves do not satisfy the M BH –Σ relation initially, {{we find that the}} relation can be established and maintained at all times if self-regulating accretion episodes are associated with major mergers. The massive end of the M BH –Σ relation is established early, and lower mass MBHs migrate on to it as hierarchical merging proceeds. How MBHs migrate towards the relation depends critically on the seeding prescription. Light seeds initially lie well below the M BH –Σ relation, and MBHs can grow via steady accretion episodes unhindered by self-regulation. In contrast, for the <b>heavy</b> <b>seeding</b> model, MBHs are initially over-massive compared to the empirical correlation, and the host haloes assemble prior to kick-starting the growth of the MBH. We find that the existence of the M BH –Σ correlation is purely a reflection of the merging hierarchy of massive dark matter haloes. The slope and scatter of the relation however appear to be a consequence of the seeding mechanism and the self-regulation prescription. We expect flux limited active galactic nucleus surveys to select MBHs that have already migrated on to the M BH –Σ relation. Similarly, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is also likely to be biased towards detecting merging MBHs that preferentially inhabit the M BH –Σ. These results are a consequence of major mergers being more common at high redshift for the most massive, biased, galaxies that host MBHs which have already migrated on to the M BH –Σ relation. We also predict the existence of a large population of low-mass ‘hidden’ MBHs at high redshift which can easily escape detection. Additionally, we find that if MBH seeds are massive, ∼ 10 5 [*]M ⊙, the low-mass end of the M BH –Σ flattens towards an asymptotic value, creating a characteristic ‘plume’...|$|E

We tested the hypotheses that between related species-pairs and among populations of single species a similar trend for increasing seed weight with increasing altitude should be present. Firstly, we measured seed weights from 29 species-pairs, with one species occurring in lowland areas and a congeneric species from high altitudes. Seeds of the alpine species were 28 +/- 8 % larger than seeds from lowland species (P > 0. 01). Compared to the related lowland species, 55 % of the alpine species had <b>heavier</b> <b>seeds,</b> 3 % (one species) had lighter, and 41 % had seeds of approximately equal weight. Secondly, we compared seed weights among populations of four species from different habitats and with different life histories.
