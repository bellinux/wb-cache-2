5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds themselves in an uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>up</b> to par.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>up</b> to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

Furthermore, the ambiguity of concepts of maximization, efficiency, and rationalization pin the analysis to a certain notion {{of the behavior of}} the rationalizing individual, making the analysis either tautological or reduced to a set of power relations translated into the language of material exchange.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} story, then titled [...] "The Shroud," [...] {{was written}} by Joseph Stefano, who had previously worked on The Outer Limits. Hannah Louise Shearer was given the task of re-writing the original take. The first draft had Yar's death occur earlier in the episode with {{the main focus of}} the episode being the Armus creature rather than her death. It was the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry who argued in favor of her sudden demise as he felt it was suitable for a security officer. Roddenberry also argued against killing Armus in retaliation. Shearer later described the decision, saying [...] "Gene felt we couldn't kill the creature, because it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>up</b> to us as human beings to make a moral judgement on any creature that we encounter, because we are not God".|$|E

500|$|Owing to its {{popularity}} and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a modern version of Russell's teapot. Proponents argue that, since {{the existence of the}} invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monsterâ€”similar to other proposed supernatural beingsâ€”cannot be falsified, it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. Richard Dawkins explains, [...] "The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>up</b> to us to disprove it." [...] Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of The Journal of Religion and Theater, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is [...] "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books The God Delusion and The Atheist Delusion.|$|E
500|$|In {{the debate}} over {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "redskin", team {{supporters}} frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>up</b> to non-Indians to define an idealized image of what it is to a Native American." [...] The [...] "positive" [...] stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is [...] "...forcing your idea of what it is to honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to take it seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>up</b> to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for the Gone to Coney Island were {{positive}} with two positive, but altogether undetailed reviews in The Moving Picture World. A detailed review in The Moving Picture News {{acknowledged that the}} film will have a lasting impact [...] "as {{it is one of}} a class of pictures which can almost be shown as a repeater without hurting the reputation of the theatre." [...] The reviewer praised the photography and found the acting adequate, but the decision to include the marriage scene was deemed peculiar. For Booming Business, The Moving Picture World gave it two sentences which said the film was funny beyond description, butThe New York Dramatic Mirror provides a more detailed and negative review of the film by stating, [...] "This 'comic' <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>up</b> to the usual Thanhouser standard. In fact, it is rather silly all through, the only laughs being brought about by blows, falls, and smashing furniture. The principal character comes down to the camera and indicates the things he intends doing all through the picture, robbing it of every element of reality. He has a small store and adopts various schemes to boom business, such as giving health treatment with a magnetic battery, teaching boxing, and so on. Everything turns out badly and ends in general confusion." [...] Bowers notes that The New York Dramatic Mirror was not an unbiased reviewer, for the publication was slanted to the favor the Licensed companies instead of the Independents. Another window into the film is provided by an advertisement by the Amuzu in The Twin-City Daily Sentinel which states the grocery-man attempts to spur business in a variety of comical ways.|$|E
