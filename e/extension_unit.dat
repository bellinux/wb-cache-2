40|$|The {{quantity}} and characterization of extracted flavan- 3 -ol monomers and procyanidins was determined in seeds from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon berries, {{over the course}} of ripening and at dierent levels of vine water status. The per berry extractive yield of all polyphenols decreased with maturity, and followed second-order kinetics. The flavan- 3 -ol monomers decreased most rapidly, followed by the procyanidin <b>extension</b> <b>units</b> and finally, the terminal units. The relative proportion of procyanidin <b>extension</b> <b>units</b> did not vary with maturity. During fruit ripening, the mean degree of polymerization of extracted procyanidins is unchanged when analyzed intact by HPLC, but decreases by thiolytic degradation. The proportion of extracted procyanidins resistant to acid catalyzed thiolysis increased with maturity. Changes in vine water status aected polyphenol amounts, indicating that cultural practices can be used to influence composition. Oxidation of the seed polyphenols during frui...|$|R

50|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} in weave extensions are lace fronts, {{which are made}} from a nylon mesh material formed into a cap that is then hand-ventilated by knotting single strands of hair into the tiny openings of the cap, giving the hair a more natural and authentic continuity than typical extensions. It has few variations including straight, wavy and curly. Furthermore, the <b>extension</b> <b>units</b> can be woven in or attached to a person's hairline with special adhesives. To ensure a proper fit, head measurements {{are taken into account}} with this type of weave. A lace frontal is best placed by a professional since more advanced weaving and hair extensions are used. This method is commonly used because it makes it possible to have access to a certain part of their scalp.|$|R
