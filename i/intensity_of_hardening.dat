40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on {{the influence of}} thermo cyclic treatment on the anneal <b>hardening</b> effect <b>of</b> a cast Cu- 10 Al and Cu- 10 Zn alloys are presented. The cast samples of both alloys were performed to the same thermo mechanical treatment. Quenched samples of both alloys were subjected to cold rolling followed by only annealing and annealing with thermo cycling treatment below the recrystallisation temperature. Anneal hardening effect has been observed with alloys in an annealing temperature range of 180 - 300 0 C, the hardness and electrical conductivity being increased with the amount of reduction at the prior cold- rolling. These investigations showed that the thermo cyclic treatment increased the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> anneal <b>hardening</b> effect some higher at Cu-Zn than at Cu-Al alloy...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of a 12 -week work hardening program designed for back injured workers. Study design: In this study, 32 subjects were recruited. Pre- and post-assessment results were used to measure the program effectiveness. The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the work <b>hardening</b> program was based on the overloading training principle. Subjects were contacted by phone three months after the program completion for their work status. Result: The findings of this study suggested that there was a significant difference in the subjects' physical demand characteristic level before and after the work hardening program. Seventy-five percent of the subjects who completed the work hardening program were able to resume employment. Conclusion: The rate of returning to work for back injured workers in this study was comparable to that of other studies. Thus, this study suggests that the overloading principle should be used in designing a work hardening program to improve clients' physical function. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{depicts the}} results of the {{research}} of tribological high speed steel HS 6 - 5 - 2 remelted with the electric arc. Steel was remelted with different parameters. The amperage of electric arc was changed, the scanning speed was changed and the single, overlapping remeltings were used. There was also the influence of conventional tempering defined, which was conducted after remelting on the tribological resistance <b>of</b> <b>hardened</b> steel. For the previously mentioned processing variants, the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> tribological wear was defined and the linear wear were presented, and the friction coefficients. The type of tribological wear was also given, present during the friction, technically dry, <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> steel. The lower <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> tribological wear was received for the single remelting by electric arc of 50 and 70 A. Using the overlapping remeltings for the strengening of the surface layer of the high speed steel HS 6 - 5 - 2 causes the increase <b>of</b> the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> tribological wear in comparison to the steel with the single remelting.

40|$|Abstract. The {{magnetic}} field of ferromagnetic components under service load and geo{{magnetic field}} increases is {{induced by the}} residual magnetic induction and spontaneous magnetization. The stress concentration positions can be determination by detecting the magnetic field and the fracture can be avoided. The magnetic <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> the demagnetized samples are tested by metal magnetic memory test method. By tensile test, {{the relationship between the}} magnetic memory signals and tensile load is studied, and the metal magnetic memory characteristics of the demagnetized samples under condition that the load keeps a fixed value are obtained. The test result indicates that the magnetic <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> the samples change greatly after demagnetized; the change <b>of</b> the magnetic <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> each test point are much different with different tensile displacement; in the later period <b>of</b> <b>hardening</b> phase and necking phase, the magnetic intensity about the side of the stress concentration positions increases along with the increasing of tensile displacement, however that of the other side decreases, that is the gradient of Fracture position increases obviously. Basing on this result by testing the parts of components emphatically where the fatigue failure and breakdown appear easily, the abrupt accident can be avoided...|$|R
