In this experiment laying performance of 10000 hen-housed Babcock- 380 brown commercial layers housed in Kelantan, Malaysia was assessed in mathematical model using hen-house and hen-day measurements. It revealed that hens reached at peak lay at 21 weeks of age and maintained a stability until 44 weeks. Birds egg laying performance gradually declined with progress in age till 80 weeks. Y= 35176. 99 – 397. 374 A + 5. 065 F gave the best fitted regression line (adj R² = 0. 905) for hen-housed egg production per week (A=age of hens in week and F= Kg feed consumed/day).

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{trials of}} 336 days each were run one year apart using a {{commercial}} strain of incrossbred pullets housed at 22 weeks with flock sizes of 7 and 10 birds per cage at a density of 290 cm 2 /bird. The toenails {{were removed from}} the front toes of half of each flock with a hotblade debeaker at 23 weeks of age. These trials were undertaken to learn if removing the toenails near the time of housing would prevent the onset of hysteria later. No hysteria developed in either trial among either the declawed or the intact birds. However, it was determined that declawing significantly improved livability (2. 0 %) in Trial 2, but not in Trial 1, and reflected a significant improvement (1. 7 %) <b>in</b> <b>hen-housed</b> production. The percent large eggs was significantly depressed by declawiing (2. 1 and 3. 7 % in Trials 1 and 2, respectively) while income per square foot (929 cm 2) was increased. Increasing the flock size per cage from 7 to 10 birds resulted in a depression of hen-housed production, percent large eggs, and income over feed and chick costs in both trials. Several highly significant interactions occurring between treatment and flock size changes are discussed...|$|R

There could be no doubt about it. And Reddy was glad of it. Yes, Sir, Reddy was glad of it. Unc' Billy Possum had made altogether too many friends in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows, and he had made Reddy the laughing-stock of them all by the way he had dared Reddy to meet Bowser the Hound, and actually had waited for Bowser while Reddy ran away.|$|R
60|$|Unc' Billy Possum {{did a lot}} of thinking. He was a {{prisoner}}, just as much {{a prisoner}} as if he were in a cage. Now Unc' Billy Possum wouldn't have minded being a prisoner <b>in</b> the <b>hen-house</b> but for two things; he was dreadfully afraid that his old friend and partner, Jimmy Skunk, would get hungry for eggs and would get caught in the traps, and he was still more afraid that Farmer Brown's boy would think to put his hand down under the hay in the last nest of the top row in the darkest corner.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{records of}} a {{population}} of White Leghorns at the Oregon State Agricultural Experiment Station, submitted to accelerated selection for hen-housed egg production on an individual and a family basis at 40 weeks of age for 18 years, were studied. An analysis was made to determine the relative efficiency of accelerated selection compared to direct selection for egg production based on annual records. When annual means of the production line were compared with control populations, accelerated selection proved {{to be effective in}} obtaining genetic gains <b>in</b> <b>hen-housed</b> annual production by increasing the part-year or egg production to February 1 while the residual production remained unchanged. Reliable estimates of genetic parameters obtained from the pooled analysis of the data demonstrated that accelerated selection on the basis of egg production to February 1 is justified and could provide 1. 8 times as much genetic gain per year as would direct selection based on annual records. The half-sib heritability estimates for hen-housed egg production were 14 percent for production to February 1 and 11 percent for annual production. Sexual maturity had an heritability of 27 percent and body weight one of 53 percent. The estimates of heritability for egg weight and egg specific gravity averaged 32 percent and 30 percent, respectively. The full-sib estimates of heritability were generally larger than those based on half-sib estimates, indicating the presence not only of additive genetic variance in the population, but also other sources of variation such as non-additive genetic variance and maternal variance. For this reason, half-sib estimates of heritability are more reliable. The high estimate of genetic correlation, 0. 86, between annual hen-housed egg production and that to February 1 justifies the use of accelerated selection. The positive correlation between residual egg production and that to February 1 indicates that there was no decline in residual production as a result of accelerated selection. Annual egg production seems to have plateaud in the last six generations, possibly due to a reduction in the additive genetic variance as indicated by the negative time trend of the heritability of hen-housed egg production to February 1. The progressive reduction in mortality indicates that the effect of inbreeding caused by restrictions in population number has not been important. Selection indices for annual and production to February 1 were derived from the estimates of genetic parameters. The results of this study demonstrate that accelerated selection for hen -housed egg production at 40 weeks of age or to February 1 has been more effective than direct selection on annual records would have been...|$|R

They were at first exceedingly common, and created terrible depredations among the hens. The girls were in despair, and called in their brothers to their assistance. The boys shot a good many, for the animals were very tame and fearless; but their number was so great that this method of destruction was of slight avail. They then prepared traps of various kinds--some made by an elastic stick bent down, with a noose at the end, placed at a small entrance left purposely <b>in</b> the <b>hen-house,</b> so that, when the skunk was about to enter, he touched a spring, and the stick released, flew into the air carrying the animal with it with the noose round its neck; other traps let fall a heavy piece of wood, which crushed the invader; and in these ways the skunks were pretty well got rid of, the most unpleasant work being the removal of the body from the trap. This had to be effected by taking hold of it with two pieces of wood, for the odor was so powerful that if the body was touched the smell would remain on the hands for days.|$|R

And it was revealed by AKIBA (1960) that Culicoides arakawae is the intermediate host of Leucocytozoon caulleryi. But the effective insecticide for C. arakawae is not yet discovered. In this study we have tested an insecticide named DA- 14 - 7. This insecticide was manufactured recently for trial by a pharmaceutical company. The procedure and the results obtained are as follows. Two hen-houses of nearly the same scale were used for this experiment. <b>In</b> the control <b>hen-house</b> no insecticide was sprayed. <b>In</b> the experimental <b>hen-house,</b> emulsion of DA- 14 - 7 (diluted 1 / 20 with water) was sprayed on the ceiling, the wall, the beam, the pillar, the droppings board and other parts except the feeder and watering installations, {{at the rate of}} 300 ml. per m 2. Oily solution of DA- 14 - 7 was also sprayed on the hen body at the rate of 7 ml. per hen. These sprayings were repeated 5 times. The first spraying was carried out on September the 14 th 1961. The second one on the next day. After the second spraying, the third, the fourth and the fifth spraying were carried out every four days. After spraying, the number of C. arakawae caught by light trap in the experimental hen house did not decrease, but the ratios of engorged female flies markedly declined. The ratios of engorged C, arakawae caught in the control hen house and the experimental hen house before spraying were between 83 % and 97 %. Seven hours after spraying, the ratios of engorged flies caught in the experimental hen house were from 6. 3 % to 1. 1 %, and 24 hours later 18. 8 %, and 72 hours later from 34. 4 % to 38. 4 %. We cannot be satisfied with the effect of DA- 14 - 7 as a repellent for C, arakawae. But, if the effective period of sprayed DA- 14 - 7 is made longer and sprayed in relatively short intervals, the DA- 14 - 7 is effective for protecting the chicken from suffering with C. arakawae, and consequently, the opportunity of the chicken to contact leucocytozoon infection and the degree of infection may be diminished considerably...|$|R

The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head: nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner-- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Whole {{wheat and}} a 1 to 1 mix of whole rye and wheat were {{supplemented}} with vita-mins and minerals via {{the drinking water}} and fed ad libitum as low-cost, low-protein grower rations to broiler breeder pullets in comparison with a 14 %-protein mash diet fed on alternate days (skip-a-day). Birds of two breeds were maintained on the experimental diets from 6 to 20 weeks of age and were subsequently fed identical mash layer rations. Birds fed whole-grain rations with supplemented drinking water had lower body weights with higher carcass fat content at 20 weeks of age than control birds, and they experienced a higher grower mortality and a 5 to 8 day delay <b>in</b> sexual maturity. <b>Hen-housed</b> egg production by grain-fed birds was lower {{during the first two}} 28 -day periods, but for one breed egg weight was greater. There was no significant difference, however, in total egg production, in number of settable eggs, or in fertility or hatchability over the entire 28 -week laying period. Responses of the two breeds to the nutritional treatments differed for body weight and fat content at 20 weeks, rearing mortality, and egg weight but not for other production parameters. Total feed costs per hen housed were lower for grain-reared birds. The applicability of whole-grain feeding as a management practice in rearing broiler breeders can be determined only by com-parisons based on the specific costs involved...|$|R
