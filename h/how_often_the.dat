5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battle arena, with {{characters}} and enemies moving according to their position on the grid. Four commands are available to the party: Attack (fight enemies), Contact (talk with an enemy), Analyze (check an enemy for its strength and weaknesses), and Form (rearrange the party on the grid). The character's main means of attack is their Persona, beings summoned into battle to cast a spell that can heal the party, and inflict physical or elemental damage on an enemy. Each Persona has access to up to eight skills, and each character can change their Persona during their turn. Personas earn experience points independent of the characters they are assigned to, and gain new abilities through extended use. Experience is awarded based on <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> player uses certain characters or Personas. Alongside their Personas, each character is able to attack with an equipped melee weapon or firearm, use an item, or attempt {{to talk with the}} demons that act as the game's standard enemies.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{incidence}} of second impact syndrome is unknown, the condition is rare; very few cases have been confirmed in medical literature. In the 13-year period from 1980–1993, 35 American football related cases of SIS were recorded, but only 17 of these were confirmed by necropsy or surgery and magnetic resonance imaging {{to be due to}} SIS, and 18cases were found to be probably SIS-related. Additionally, the initial trauma commonly goes unreported, adding to the confusion about <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> syndrome occurs.|$|E

25|$|The UCS {{explained}} that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid (PHEV) {{was not included in}} the evaluation even though the Volt could have been compared with the Chevrolet Cruze as the conventional similar. The reason for the exclusion is that PHEVs are affected by a variety of factors that affect their environmental performance, such as the type of fuel used (coal, wind, solar, etc.) for generating electricity to charge the vehicle, and also by the driving habits, including <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> vehicle is plugged in and the number of miles driven on electricity-only mode.|$|E
25|$|Aggression {{between groups}} is {{determined}} partly by willingness to fight, which {{depends on a}} number of factors including numerical advantage, distance from home territories, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> groups encounter each other, competitive abilities, differences in body size, and whose territory is being invaded. Also, an individual is more likely to become aggressive if other aggressive group members are nearby. One particular phenomenon– the formation of coordinated coalitions that raid neighbouring territories to kill conspecifics– has only been documented in two species in the animal kingdom: 'common' chimpanzees and humans.|$|E
25|$|Vasodilators – {{calcium channel}} blockers, {{such as the}} dihydropyridines {{nifedipine}} or amlodipine, preferably slow release preparations – are often first line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema; {{but these are not}} typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> attacks happen. Peoples whose RP is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to there being too much blood.|$|E

25|$|Web {{crawlers}} typically {{identify themselves}} to a Web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request. Web site administrators typically examine their Web servers' log and use the user agent field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server and <b>how</b> <b>often.</b> <b>The</b> user agent field may include a URL where the Web site administrator may find out {{more information about the}} crawler. Examining Web server log is tedious task, and therefore some administrators use tools to identify, track and verify Web crawlers. Spambots and other malicious Web crawlers are unlikely to place identifying information in the user agent field, or they may mask their identity as a browser or other well-known crawler.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} the infant {{to feel that the}} {{maternal}} figure is accessible and responsive, a certain amount of interaction must occur. Though the most research has been done on face-to-face interaction, studies have found that bodily interaction is also important in sensitivity and development. It is not <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> baby is held that reflects attachment, but how the baby is held and whether or not the baby desires to be held that matters in attachment development. Another factor that is important is sensitivity to the infant's feeding signals. There lies some controversy in whether infants who form insecure attachment relationships with their mothers do so because the mother is particularly insensitive to her child's needs or because of differences in their personality (i.e. their temperament) and due to life situations.|$|E
25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear {{can be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening {{can be caused by}} age or <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear. According to a study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology the frequency of rotator cuff tears can increase with age. The study shows the participants that were the ages of 70–90 years old had a rate of rotator cuff tears that were 1 to 5. The participants who were 90+ years old the frequency of a rotator cuff tear jumped to 1 to 3. This study shows that with an increase in age there is also an increase in the probability of a rotator cuff tear.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 2013, Modern Vampires of the City {{had been}} named the year's best album {{in a number of}} polls; {{according}} to Acclaimed Music, it was the highest ranked record on average in critics' year-end lists. AllMusic named it one of the year's 50 best records, and it was voted the second best album of 2013 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it first in his own list for The Barnes & Noble Review, writing in an accompanying essay that Vampire Weekend had made an art pop record that [...] "simulates predigital warmth by tinkering with a dizzying panoply of studio stratagems and divides the most emotional songs of the band’s career into distinct parts impossible to enumerate due to <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> arrangements change up gorgeous drum tracks, but I dare you to dance to them".
