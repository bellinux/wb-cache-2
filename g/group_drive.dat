5000|$|As some {{factories}} grew {{too large}} and complex {{to be powered}} by a single steam engine, a system of [...] "sub divided" [...] power came into use. This was also important when {{a wide range of}} speed control was necessary for a sensitive operation such as wire drawing or hammering iron. Under sub divided power, steam was piped from a central boiler to smaller steam engines located where needed. However, small steam engines were much less efficient than large ones. The Baldwin Locomotive Works 63 acre site changed to sub divided power, then because of the inefficiency converted to <b>group</b> <b>drive</b> with several large steam engines driving the line shafts. Eventually Baldwin converted to electric drive, with a substantial saving in labor and building space.|$|E

He reads him that a second highway exists next to Route 66 which leads faster to the California border. The road is Route 666 that was condemned after a prison road crew accident. Hearing the story, Jack has strange quick flashbacks of four prisoners digging a hole surrounded by law-enforcement. Meanwhile, Benny shoots a tourist and takes his Jeep. The marshals arrive at a deserted tourist attraction bordering Route 666 and see a restricted access sign. As Jack debates about using the road, he experiences more flashbacks and tells Steph that he was born around the area and his mother died when he was six and he hardly knew his father. Much to Rabbit's dismay, Jack kicks open the gates and the <b>group</b> <b>drive</b> onto it, Steph rides with Jack and Rabbit.|$|E

The study aims to {{evaluate}} the driving behavior of young drivers in the 19 – 24 age <b>group</b> <b>drive,</b> 3 – 4  years after licensure. The evaluation was done using two tools: In Vehicle Data Recorders (IVDR) technology and Self-Reported data (SR). More specifically, we focused on the relation between these two approaches and on the ability to use them in a complementary manner in order to improve the evaluation of driving behavior. Recent literature suggests the potential strength of combining both technology-based and traditional approaches (see, for example, [4, 30]).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} variation in vocal communication in animal species {{is that the}} complexity of the social group influences the group’s vocal complexity. This social-complexity hypothesis for communication is also central to recent arguments regarding the origins of human language, but experimental tests of the hypothesis are lacking. This study investigated whether group size, a fundamental component of social complexity, influences the complexity of a call functioning in the social organi-zation of Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis. In unmanipulated field settings, calls of individuals in larger groups had greater complexity (more information) than calls of individuals in smaller groups. In aviary settings manipulating group size, individuals in larger groups used calls with greater complexity than individuals in smaller groups. These results indicate that social complexity can influence communicative complexity in this species. Can the complexity of a social <b>group</b> <b>drive</b> the complexity of communicative signals used by members of the group? This social-complexity hypothesis is a major component in argu-ments regarding the origins of human language (Dunbar, 1998, 2003; Pinker, 2003) andmaymore generally explain variation in systems of vocal communication in animal species. Although some comparative and correlational evidence supports the hy...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic remodelling of intersubunit bridge B 2, a conserved RNA {{domain of}} the {{bacterial}} ribosome connecting helices 44 (h 44) and 69 (H 69) of the small and large subunit, respectively, impacts translation by controlling intersubunit rotation. Here we show that aminoglycosides chemically related to neomycin—paromomycin, ribostamycin and neamine—each bind to sites within h 44 and H 69 to perturb bridge B 2 and affect subunit rotation. Neomycin and paromomycin, which only differ by their ring-I 6 ′-polar <b>group,</b> <b>drive</b> subunit rotation in opposite directions. This suggests that their distinct actions hinge on the 6 ′-substituent and the drug's net positive charge. By solving the crystal structure of the paromomycin–ribosome complex, we observe specific contacts between the apical tip of H 69 and the 6 ′-hydroxyl on paromomycin from within the drug's canonical h 44 -binding site. These results indicate that aminoglycoside actions must be framed {{in the context of}} bridge B 2 and their regulation of subunit rotation. Ratchet-like rotation of the small ribosomal subunit relative to the large is essential to the translation mechanism. Here, the authors show that chemically related aminoglycoside antibiotics have distinct impacts on the nature and rate of the subunit rotation process within the intact ribosome...|$|E

40|$|How are {{religion}} and moral {{related to one}} another? Hardly any other question has been debated more than this one. Do faith and affiliation with a religious <b>group</b> <b>drive</b> moral? Are they even a indispensable prerequisite for morality, or are they irrelevant to morailty, if not detrimental? This study aims at investigating his relationship and therewith it contributes to a deeper insight of {{our understanding of the}} relationship of {{religion and}} moral on one hand and the role of reasoning or in other words ethical judgement. At the same time we attribute considerable important to the role of religious orientation. This is what has no been considered yet in most, if not all presently available studies on moral competency. It will have to be testes, whether teens do not orient themselves to religious dogma due to social connections. We investigate the question whether and how religious orientation influences religious thinking of young people – and therewith especially ‚religious logic‘ – as well as ethical judgment. Theoretical and empirical studies on adolescent religiosity are numerous. However, these studies focus mostly on developmental psychological terms and conditions of adolescent religiosity. Rarely considered is, however, an already developed, strengthened and publicly expressed religious youth. "Until today attention is paied only rarely to the free religious scene or the hidden phenomena of highly privatized, latent religiosity in definitional no man's land. " (Nipkow 1994, p. 112) The main concern of the present work is to capture this methodology, to measure its intensity and to determine its significance for the ethical judgment. A final chapter discusses the resulting consequences for the pedagogical-didactic mission of a school. Hereby it is especially emphasized on the special role and responsibility of philosophy lessons for the educational process in general and the strengthening of ethical judgment. In contrast to religion lessons which are focussed on binding, philosophy lessons carry the educational task to ensure a sustainable formation of the autonomous ethical judgment of pupils...|$|E
