5|$|Hiroshi Minami as Gihei Kasuga: {{formerly}} a ranked hitman {{who lost his}} nerve and took to drinking. After introducing Hanada to Yabuhara he joins the former in a dangerous chauffeur mission. <b>His</b> <b>nerves</b> {{get the better of}} him and he experiences a short-lived mental breakdown.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel in silence for {{extended}} periods of time, not praying, to calm <b>his</b> <b>nerves.</b> He also began to grow a mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would continue to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E
5|$|When Sorceress Edea {{becomes the}} Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is {{introduced}} as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall {{that he always}} chokes under pressure. In spite of <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> and under intense pressure, he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he {{and most of the}} other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.|$|E

5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
5|$|Rhys {{goes along}} to a cookery class that Vanessa is {{teaching}} and flirts with Tiffany Giles (Shaye Hopkins) to make Vanessa jealous. She invites him {{to dinner and}} he suffers an allergic reaction to the food. Vanessa and Rhys almost kiss, but are interrupted by Lucas. The following day, Rhys goes to Harold's Store and kisses Vanessa. Rhys opens up to her about his father and they arrange a date. When Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) is brought into the hospital, he tells Rhys that Jade attacked him. Rhys reports this {{to the police and}} when Jade finds out, she asks him to leave the house. Rhys applies for a three-month study tour in Japan and asks Vanessa to come with him. Rhys' mother later gives him a ring so that he can propose to Vanessa. Shortly before leaving for Japan, Rhys comes across a car accident involving the street's teenagers. He rings the emergency services, before assessing their injuries. Rhys cuts his hand on a piece of wreckage, which forces him to cancel the trip to Japan. He later learns that he has only a five per cent chance of making a full recovery. Following an EMG, Rhys learns that there has been no improvement to his hand. After altering the report to say that <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> are healing, Rhys is invited to assist Jessica in surgery.|$|E
5|$|Vanessa {{learns that}} Rhys altered his test results and he begs {{her to keep}} his secret. Jessica later asks Rhys to retake the EMG and informs him that <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> will never improve to the {{standard}} required for a surgeon. Realising Vanessa spoke to Jessica, Rhys breaks up with her. When Rhys learns that Vanessa is marrying Lucas, he urges her not {{to go through with}} it. Rhys attends the wedding and Vanessa struggles with her vows and leaves the church. Rhys then visits Vanessa and she berates him for ignoring her, before telling him she does not want his love. Both Elaine and Kate encourage Rhys to fight for Vanessa and he tries apologising to her. When Vanessa goes into labour, Rhys takes her to the hospital and stays by her side while her son is born. He tells her that he has never stopped loving her and when he proposes, Vanessa accepts. However, when Rhys discovers that her son, Patrick (Lucas MacFarlane) has ebstein's anomaly, Vanessa calls off the engagement to focus her attention on him. Rhys sets up a fund raising webpage for Patrick and sells his car to kick start the donations. He decides not to tell Vanessa, but she learns from Lucas that it was him and she tries to return Rhys' money.|$|E

25|$|When Laurence Olivier {{gave his}} {{acclaimed}} performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre (UK) in 1964, {{he had developed}} a case of stage fright that was so profound {{that when he was}} alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle <b>his</b> <b>nerves.</b> This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film — Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|One of the rioters {{sat in the}} Speaker's chair where Morin {{had been}} sitting {{only a few minutes}} before, and {{declared}} the dissolution of the House. The room was turned upside down while other men entered the room of the Legislative Council. The acts of vandalism that were reported included the destruction of the seats and desks, stamping on the portrait of Louis-Joseph Papineau, that had been hanging on the wall next to that of Queen Victoria. Perry claimed to have set fire to the room himself when he hit the gas chandelier suspended on the ceiling with a brick, aiming for the clock that was directly above the Speaker's chair. The clock, whose ticking apparently got on <b>his</b> <b>nerves,</b> was, according to his account, showing 9:40pm when it happened. Other sources, including newspapers of the time, believed the fire to have been started when rioters outside the building started throwing the torches that some of them had carried from the Champ-de-Mars meeting.|$|E
25|$|Nilsen {{confirmed}} that on four occasions, he had removed the accumulated bodies from beneath his floorboards and dissected the remains, and on {{three of these}} occasions, he had then disposed of the accumulated remains upon an assembled bonfire. On more than one occasion, he had removed the internal organs from the victims' bodies and placed them in bags, which he then typically dumped behind a fence to be eaten by wildlife. All {{the bodies of the}} victims killed at Melrose Avenue would be dismembered after several weeks or months of internment beneath the floorboards and Nilsen recalled that the putrefaction of these victims' bodies would make this task exceedingly vile; he recalled having to fortify <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> with whisky and his having to grab handfuls of salt with which to brush aside maggots from the remains. Often, he would vomit as he dissected the bodies, before wrapping the dismembered limbs inside plastic bags and carrying the remains to the bonfires. Nonetheless, immediately prior to his dissecting the victims' bodies, Nilsen would engage in masturbation as he knelt or sat alongside the corpse. This, he stated, was his symbolic gesture of saying goodbye to his victims.|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore {{said he had}} a {{great fear}} of heights, and to do the {{climbing}} in Greece, he resorted to moderate drinking to calm <b>his</b> <b>nerves.</b> Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling {{off the side of the}} cliff. The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> nearly got the better of him: [...] "From where we were , you could see the local cemetery; and the box [...] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots." [...] The stunt went off without a problem.|$|E
500|$|The actor, famously jittery {{on opening}} nights, is {{depicted}} {{both on and}} off stage in the biographical film, Topsy Turvy. [...] Hesketh Pearson wrote in 1935 that Grossmith injected himself with drugs (presumably morphine) to calm <b>his</b> <b>nerves.</b> and in the film he is shown injecting himself on the opening night of The Mikado. In his diary, Arthur Sullivan wrote afterwards, [...] "All went very well except Grossmith, whose nervousness nearly upset the piece". Grossmith spoke self-deprecatingly about his own vocal prowess (Sullivan and others disagreed): ...|$|E

He has described it as [...] "the most amazing experience I've ever witnessed." [...] Speaking of <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> {{on his first day}} on set, Chambers has commented that the experience was made worse by the fact it was also new co-star Luke Roberts' first day, and: [...] "we had rehearsals and all the top producers, executive producers and everyone from the script writers to the floor runners came on set and watched us. That's normal but I wasn't expecting such a big audience just for the rehearsals." ...|$|E

500|$|During this period, Ochs {{was taking}} drugs {{to get through}} performances.

Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, [...] "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. I'd never seen anything like that." [...] Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|In the early-21st century, the Greater London Authority {{commissioned}} {{a plan to}} improve {{the road from the}} architectural firm, Terry Farrell and Partners. The original study proposed removing the underpass (which was subsequently cancelled) and providing a pedestrian crossing and removing the gyratory system connecting Tottenham Court Road and Gower Street. The scheme was approved by the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone as [...] "the start of changing the Marylebone to Euston road from a highway into a series of linked public spaces." [...] The pedestrian crossing opened in March 2010. Livingstone's successor, Boris Johnson, favours keeping the Euston Road underpass and declared it to {{be a good place to}} test <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> when cycling around London.|$|E
500|$|While Soviet {{forces were}} {{initially}} successful in recapturing Kharkiv, {{they found themselves}} trapped by the German Army after the closing of Barvenkovo. On 18 May, Bagramyan asked Timoshenko to alter the plans but Timoshenko along with Stalin refused to approve his request. Soviet losses were heavy as the 6th, 9th and 57th armies (approximately 18–20 divisions) comprising {{a large portion of}} the Southwestern Front, were all destroyed and Bagramyan was removed from his post on 28 June by STAVKA. According to Khrushchev, Bagramyan was so devastated from the immense loss of men that after the operation was called off, [...] "he burst into tears. <b>His</b> <b>nerves</b> cracked...He was weeping for our army." [...] Held responsible for the failure of the operation and [...] "poor staff work", he was demoted to chief of staff of the Soviet 28th Army. Several days later, he wrote a letter to Stalin asking to [...] "serve at the front at any capacity, however modest." [...] British military historian John Erickson contends that Bagramyan was unfairly scapegoated by Stalin in his attempts to [...] "hunt for [...] culprits" [...] of the mismanagement of operations.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{return to}} No. 60 Squadron in France, Ball scored {{morning and evening}} {{victories}} on 15September, flying two different Nieuports. On the evening mission, he armed his aircraft with eight Le Prieur rockets, fitted to the outer struts and designed to fire electrically. He intended to use them on an observation balloon. As it happened, he spotted three German Roland C.IIs and broke their formation by salvoing his rockets at them, then picked {{off one of the}} pilots with machine-gun fire. After this he settled into an improved aeroplane, Nieuport 17 A213. He had it rigged to fly tail-heavy to facilitate his changing of ammunition drums in the machine-gun, and had a holster built into the cockpit for the Colt automatic pistol that he habitually carried. Three times during September he scored triple victories in a day, ending the month with his total score standing at 31, making him Britain's top-scoring ace. [...] By this time he had told his commanding officer that he had to have a rest and that he was taking unnecessary risks because of <b>his</b> <b>nerves.</b> On 3October, he was sent on leave, en route to a posting at the Home Establishment in England. A French semi-official report of Ball's successes was issued the same day; it was picked up and repeated in the British aviation journal Flight nine days later.|$|E
500|$|The magician, Prospero, {{rightful}} Duke of Milan, and his daughter, Miranda, {{have been}} stranded {{for twelve years}} on an island after Prospero's jealous brother Antonio (aided by Alonso, the King of Naples) deposed him and set him adrift with the 3-year-old Miranda. Gonzalo, Alonso's counsellor, had secretly supplied their boat with some food, fresh water, [...] "rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries", and [...] "volumes" [...] (books) that Prospero prizes. Possessing magic powers due to his great learning, Prospero is served by a spirit, Ariel, whom Prospero had rescued from a tree {{in which he had}} been trapped by the cruel witch, Sycorax, after he had refused to obey her. Prospero maintains Ariel's loyalty by repeatedly promising to release the [...] "airy spirit" [...] from servitude. Sycorax had been exiled from Algiers to the island for wreaking havoc with her magic, and had died before Prospero's arrival and without releasing Ariel. Sycorax's son, Caliban, a deformed monster and the only non-spiritual inhabitant before the arrival of Prospero, was initially adopted and raised by him. He taught Prospero how to survive on the island, while Prospero and Miranda taught Caliban religion and their own language. In slavery, Caliban has come to view Prospero as a usurper and has grown to resent him and his daughter. Prospero and Miranda in turn view Caliban with disappointment, contempt and disgust. Prospero only performs one act of magic himself directly on stage: he disarms Ferdinand, causing <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> to become [...] "in their infancy again". The rest of his magic is through controlling spirits (or mentioned as happening previously), which is how magicians of the time were believed to operate.|$|E
500|$|Along with {{approximately}} 25 other boys, Lee was invited {{for a trial}} at Lord's early in 1906, and bowled under the observation of Alfred Atfield and the head groundsman, Tom Hearne. Lee described his first over as [...] "six of the worst balls that anyone can ever have pitched", but as <b>his</b> <b>nerves</b> calmed, he improved, and was eventually selected {{as one of the}} five ground staff boys by Hearne. As a ground boy, Lee had numerous tasks; sweeping, dusting and cleaning the seats, preparing nets, marking the pitch, weeding and similar. On a match day, jobs included selling scorecards, operating the score-board or fielding in the practice nets. All of this left little time for the boys to practise their own game. No formal coaching was in place, but Lee was guided by a few different players; England internationals Teddy Wynyard and Albert Trott among them. In the 1909 and 1910 seasons, Lee started to gain some attention from Middlesex County Cricket Club: he scored 39 runs in a match for the Middlesex Colts in 1909, and 60 runs against Reading Cricket Club in 1910. He was making more appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), collecting runs and wickets regularly, but not prolifically. In 1911, when a number of the Middlesex side were missing due to trial matches for England selection, Lee was invited to join the team for [...] two County Championship matches in the south-west, against Somerset and Gloucestershire. Placed at number eleven in Middlesex's batting order, Lee batted once in a rain-affected match against Somerset, remaining four not out, and was not required to bowl. Lee did bowl against Gloucestershire, but remained wicketless from nine overs in the match.|$|E
