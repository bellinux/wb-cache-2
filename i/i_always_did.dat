500|$|Bowie knew he'd {{be taking}} this album on tour, and in early {{interviews}} said [...] "I'm {{going to do}} a stage thing this year, which I'm incredibly excited about, 'cause I'm gonna take a chance again", but when pressed for details, he refused to give up any, saying [...] "I'll just be doing what <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> which is keeping things interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparations for {{the tour}} began as early as 1986, when Bowie warned his band to [...] "be ready for next year." [...] Bowie was {{initially}} mum on his plans for his tour, saying only [...] "I'm {{going to do a}} stage thing this year, which I'm incredibly excited about, 'cause I'm gonna take a chance again." [...] When asked if he would elaborate on his plans, he replied [...] "No! [...] Too many other acts are goin' out. I'll just be doing what <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> which is keeping things interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Press {{framing of}} Reagan changed {{from that of}} just helpmate and {{protector}} to someone with hidden power. As {{the image of her}} as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do I apologize for it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> that for Ronnie, and I always will." ...|$|E

500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{contains}} {{allusions to}} many works, including those loved by Juster {{in his own}} upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including The Wind in the Willows, had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, {{going so far as}} to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of puns, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to radio serials helped inspire The Phantom Tollbooth, as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on sidekick Jim Fairfield from Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had synesthesia, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. [...] "One of the things <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> was think literally when I heard words. On the Lone Ranger [...] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' and I always had an image of engines, of train engines." ...|$|E
60|$|The whole inexplicable tangle {{seemed to}} {{straighten}} out before me. I wondered, as <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> how {{it had not been}} obvious to me before.|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. I was {{expected}} to, Juan. That is {{how things were}} arranged on earth. I was not a social reformer; and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> what it was customary for a gentleman to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wretch {{that you}} are! And {{do not be}} jealous if you catch me making love to Lady Brandon. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so; she expects it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> when <b>I</b> take pains," [...] said Colville. [...] "The {{trouble is}} that <b>I</b> don't <b>always</b> take pains. But I thought I would to-night, in upon a lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am not cross, Aunt Josey. I went on {{just the}} same as <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> If Uncle Michel wants {{anything}} else, that is his fault;--not mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where are they?" [...] asked he. [...] "I don't see any babies {{but those}} of Grandfather Frog, {{and if you ask}} me, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> think tadpoles about the homeliest things in th' world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Albe't," [...] she concluded; [...] "I {{wish we had}} her to {{live with}} us. Yes, I do! I wonder {{if we could get}} her to. You know <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> want to adopt a baby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a mean chap all the same," [...] {{said the}} footman, [...] "and it an't along {{of him that}} I says so. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> admire the missus's sister; and she'd well become the situation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{like your}} clothes, Tom," [...] {{returned}} the father thoughtfully, swinging his glasses, [...] "But I don't {{see how you}} can afford 'em, I can't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, you know, I was going to take off my tie. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> {{especially}} at night. It's a sort of habit I've got into.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit up, my Lord? bless you, no! I {{shall have}} {{half of our}} Cat's bed; as <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> when there's company." [...] And with this Mrs. Score curtseyed and retired.|$|R
6000|$|... "You conspirators! {{how dare}} you lay plots, and then exult over me when I can't find words to thank you? <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> think you were a set of angels, and now I'm quite sure of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} she could {{have told me that}} I did not know before," [...] he said, {{obviously}} to himself, but perfectly audible. [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> know it," [...] he added louder, as if in despair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I daresay you haven't {{had much}} practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> it for half-an-hour a day. Why, {{sometimes}} I've believed {{as many as}} six impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Imogene huskily, {{and she let}} an {{interval}} that was long to them both elapse before she said anything more. [...] "Have <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> what you thought best, Mrs. Bowen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I was angry," [...] {{admitted}} the King. [...] "When I am angry <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> something that <b>I</b> am sorry for afterward. So I have firmly resolved never {{to get angry}} again; unless--unless--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean my {{acting as}} I did; {{it was a}} theory of duty which I allowed to press me too much. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> Duty should be obvious; one shouldn't hunt round for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mind the}} sleeping, father, but the waking {{is not so}} pleasant. However, I shall soon get {{accustomed}} to it, I suppose. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> hate {{getting up in the}} dark, even when we were going out fishing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{expect to}} lay there. But I reckon it's all right. It won't {{be a great}} while, now, anyway. Jacob, I don't believe I'm a-goin' to live very long. I know it don't agree with me here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it!" [...] Burton interrupted, savagely. [...] "One must be {{a little}} human now and then. By Jove, old man, there are some ties, if you like! <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> think a yellow one would suit me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thinkin' of my wife, and wishin' she was here, {{bless her}} heart! set me rememberin' how I see her fust, and so I roared, as <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{when it comes}} into my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't get waxy, old feller," [...] {{said the}} {{performer}} in a youthful voice, [...] "I ain't a-goin' to charge you nothink for it. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> my music gratis; havin' a bee-nevolient turn o' mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean I didn’t know I was," [...] he replied, [...] "more than usual, <b>I</b> mean. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> look fairly cheerful—at least, I hope I do. There’s {{nothing to}} make me look the opposite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it is wrong," [...] said Jenny, {{in a low}} voice. [...] "I {{dare say}} I am not just. You know <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> think Mr. Moy could have cleared Archie if he would," [...] she added, with a {{slightly}} trembling tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Olly," [...] he said, {{taking her}} face in both hands, after his old fashion, [...] "ef {{anything}} at any time should happen to me, I want ye to think, my darling, ez <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> my best for you, Olly, for you. Wotever I did was always for the best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{hear about}} it," [...] cried Cornelia fiercely. [...] "And I won't have you {{thinking}} that it's because I ever did care for you. I didn't. And I was only too glad when you got married. And I don't hate you, for I despise you too much; and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> So!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{justice to}} {{everything}} of Wallingford's, you know. We were children together, and became so much attached in early life, that it's no wonder we remain so in these our later days." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{got rid of}} a {{touch of}} {{neuralgia}} in France (as <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> there), but <b>I</b> found no old friends in my voyages of discovery on that side, such as I have left on this.|$|R
