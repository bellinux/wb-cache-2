5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Line</b> B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E
25|$|The metro {{is mostly}} underground; surface {{sections}} include sections on viaduct in Paris (lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) {{and at the}} surface in the suburbs (lines 1, 5, 8 and 13). In most cases both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by <b>hand).</b> <b>Line</b> 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elysées and on other lines some stations (for example, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum curve radius by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of line 14.|$|E

500|$|The islanders also {{supported}} themselves through fishing, exploiting the high-quality catches {{that were to}} be made around the island's coasts. James Traill Calder wrote in his 1861 Sketch of the Civil and Traditional History of Caithness that [...] "The finest cod in the north is to be got in the Pentland Firth... Large and excellent lobsters are caught around the island [...]" [...] As well as trapping lobsters, the islanders practised <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> cod fishing {{in the waters of}} the Firth. This involved towing lengths of line with heavy weights and a metal rod or sprool at one end, from which hung a short length of hemp and hook baited with limpets. To encourage the fish to bite, the boats had to be held still by their rowers, which required great skill in the Firth's unpredictable currents. The island was noted for its native type of boat, the Stroma yole, which was a direct descendant of the old Norse longship.|$|E

2500|$|After the fire, Forest Service crews removed fire {{lines and}} {{restored}} the fire line areas. [...] This included rehabilitation of [...] of bulldozer lines and [...] of <b>hand</b> <b>line.</b> [...] Several temporary heliports and safety zones were also rehabilitated. Dangerous trees and snags {{were removed from}} approximately [...] of roadway including [...] along Route 242. [...] The large trees that were removed along roads were piled in decked for commercial sales while smaller diameter trees killed by the fire were left standing. [...] On steep slopes, some large trees were cut down and left lying across the hill side to help prevent soil erosion. [...] On slopes above roads, high stumps were left exposed to help prevent burned logs from rolling down onto roadways.|$|E

50|$|In manual rigging, a line set’s lift lines support weights {{opposite}} {{their connections}} to the batten in order to balance {{the weight of the}} batten and whatever it carries. The lift lines are reeved through a series of pulleys, known as blocks, that are mounted above the stage to fly loft structure. An operating line (a.k.a. <b>hand</b> <b>line</b> or purchase line) allows riggers on the fly crew to raise and lower the batten.|$|E
