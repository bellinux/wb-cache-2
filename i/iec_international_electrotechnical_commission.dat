Joomla is a very popular Content Management System (CMS) used for web page maintenance. This highly versatile software has found itself in both large corporate web portals, and simple web pages such as blogs. Such popularity increases its vulnerability to potential attacks and therefore needs an appropriate security management.

40|$|Common Information Model (CIM) is {{emerging}} as a standard for information modelling for power control centers. While, <b>IEC</b> 61850 by <b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>IEC)</b> {{is emerging}} as a standard for achieving interoperability and automation at the substation level. In future, once these two standards are well adopted, the issue of integration of these standards becomes imminent. Some efforts reported towards the integration of these standards have been surveyed. This paper describes a possible approach for the integration of IEC 61850 and CIM standards based on mapping between the representation of elements of these two standards. This enables seamless data transfer from one standard to the other. Mapping between the objects of IEC 61850 and CIM standards both in the static and dynamic models is discussed.

This paper proposes a new procedure {{based on an}} inferential neural network to evaluate and calibrate a neonatal incubator. The proposal presents significant advantages over the standard calibration process, i. e., the number of sensors is drastically reduced, and it runs with the incubator under operation. Since the sensors used in the new calibration process are already installed in the commercial incubator, no additional hardware is necessary; and the calibration necessity can be diagnosed in real time without the presence of technical professionals in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Experimental tests involving the aforementioned calibration system are carried out in a commercial incubator in order to validate the proposal...|$|E

Transfer function and scattering parameter S 11 of DSL loop are also measured on a real cable. The methodology is based on measurements of a 0. 4 mm, 10 pairs, balanced twisted-pair cable of 1400 m of length. In order to improve the analysis of results, we compared the measurements from real cable with results from wireline simulators. The measurement of parameters of xDSL copper loop is done in an infrastructure set up in the LABIT (Technological Innovation in Telecommunications Lab) at UFPA (Federal University of Para), that consist of a wireline simulators, a precision impedance analyzer, and a network analyzer. The results show a difference between the measurements performed with real cables and wireline simulators for transfer function parameter.

(1) Firstly, the {{quantitative}} accuracy of reconstructed 90 Y–PET data was evaluated using a cylindrical phantom and an <b>IEC</b> (<b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Commission)</b> body phantom {{for the assessment}} of recovery coefficients. Then, the PET camera’s ability to produce 90 Y quantitative data was validated using an anthropomorphic phantom with a liver cavity and a background compartment. A hollow cylindrical insert was fixed into the liver cavity of the anthropomorphic phantom with the intent to simulate a hepatic lesion. Acquisitions were performed using a General Electric (GE) Discovery ST PET/CT scanner with a 6 : 1 tumor to background activity concentration ratio. The anthropomorphic phantom was acquired at days 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12 post-phantom preparation down to an activity concentration of 0.31  ±  0.02  MBq mL− 1 for the lesion insert (initial activity concentration 5.5  ±  0.3  MBq mL− 1) and 50  ±  3  kBq mL− 1 for the liver background (initial activity concentration 0.89  ±  0.04  MBq mL− 1). In the present phantom study, activity measurements were performed using a well-type radionuclide calibrator available on site and traceable to the Italian National Institute of Ionizing Radiation Metrology for the geometry being measured (accuracy within ±[*] 5 % at k =  2 level, as recommended by AAPM report 181 [28]). PET images were reconstructed using the standard GE algorithm (full 3 D-OSEM VUEPoint HD two iterations, 15 subsets) and corrected for attenuation, scatter, random, and dead time using manufacturer software. Random and scatter corrections are incorporated into the iterative algorithm, with scatter correction performed using a fully 3 D approach that considers both the axial and trans-axial scatter components.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{dealt with}} {{developing}} a Finite Element (FE) model of railway bogie and performing the vibration {{analysis of this}} model within a multi body system environment. The main objective of this work is to check for compliance of the vibration analysis results with an <b>IEC</b> (<b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Commission)</b> standard for the testing of equipment assembled to a railway bogie. Among various equipment such as mechanical, pneumatic, etc., attached to a railway bogie, the requirement {{in this study was}} to test the functional stability of brakes. A flexible FE bogie model was designed using ANSYS and a corresponding parametric ANSYS APDL code was developed, which could be used or future modifications in bogie design. The finite element bogie model was reduced to a substructured model in ANSYS, so that FE data along with the lexible bogie frame model were imported in SIMPACK for a multibody simulation. In SIMPACK, a rigid body rail environment including carbody, rail-wheel air, tracks, primary and secondary suspensions and joints were assembled with he imported flexible bogie frame model. Acceleration sensors were placed at ppropriate locations on the brakes inorder to measure the Acceleration Spectral ensity (ASD) for an input of track excitations through random vibrations along different simulation scenarios. The rms values from such results were checked or compliance with the standard and the influencing factors were identified. The otivation for this model-based vibration analysis was to apply such a model for estin of rail brakes, which could be economical and less time consuming compared to real time testing...|$|E
40|$|<b>IEC</b> (<b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Commission)</b> is the {{authority}} that publishes different standards in the  fields  of  electrical  and  electronics  engineering,  to  be  used  internationally.   In  the  area  of manufacturing, it has demanded {{a new standard}} to fulfil better solutions of dynamic requirements. The  IEC  61499   redacted  by  IEC  offers  interoperability,  portability,  configurability  and  distributed control applications for manufacturing processes. However, this standard is not a replacement of IEC 61131 - 3,  one  of  the  most  used  standards  in  industry;  instead,  it  is  a  complement  of  it.   The  basic software units of IEC 61499 are named Function Blocks (FBs), which {{can be described as}} blocks that encapsulate functionality. By combining FBs together, it is possible to solve complex problems.    The  objective  of  this  project  (in  close  cooperation  with  another  project)   is  to  develop  a  software environment in Java language. It follows the requirements of IEC 61499, and implement a Function Block  designer  and  a  runtime  execution  environment,  as  a  part  of  an  existing  Wise-ShopFloor framework. The scope of this project covers:     FB  algorithm  editor:  Each  FB  has  one  or  more  algorithms,  which  can  be  defined  in  the algorithm editor using IEC 61131 - 3 or Java.     FB serialization: Opening and saving the configuration of FBs in Java Class file is one of the tasks  of  this  project.   As  soon  as  the  configuration  is  saved,  the  Java  code  of  FB  can  be generated. Java code is generated because compiled Java allows execution of FB. Saving in Java  Class  file  permits  portability,  i. e.   the  saved  configuration  can  be  opened  in  any  JVM system, and vice versa.      Case study: A simulation of an assembly station using an ABB IRB 140 robot is studied and implemented using the runtime simulator of the Java platform, in which some basic FBs have been also created in a library. This project also includes: (1) implementation of user interface and (2) FB serialization in XML. It  is  anticipated  that  the  developed  environment  will  be  able  to  save  and  open  FBs  configurations either in XML or in Java Class, following the specification of IEC 61499. It will allow portability and reusability.   Because  of  the  portability,  the  so-designed  FBs  can  be  validated  using  another  FB environment such as FBDK (Function Block Development Kit) ...|$|E
