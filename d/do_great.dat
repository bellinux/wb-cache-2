5|$|Owing {{to their}} wood-eating habits, many termite species can <b>do</b> <b>great</b> damage to {{unprotected}} buildings and other wooden structures. Their habit of remaining concealed {{often results in}} their presence being undetected until the timbers are severely damaged, leaving {{a thin layer of}} a wall that protects them from the environment. Of the 3,106 species known, only 183 species cause damage; 83 species cause significant damage to wooden structures. In North America, nine subterranean species are pests; in Australia, 16 species have an economic impact; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests, and in tropical Africa, 24. In Central America and the West Indies, there are 17 pest species. Among the termite genera, Coptotermes has the highest number of pest species of any genus, with 28 species known to cause damage. Less than 10% of drywood termites are pests, but they infect wooden structures and furniture in tropical, subtropical and other regions. Dampwood termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil.|$|E

25|$|Before {{a battle}} begins, the player usually has {{the choice to}} retreat, giving them time to prepare. For every battle, the player may choose only three combatants out of a {{possible}} five, and a positioning scheme for them. The player can either choose the Attack or Magic formation. The Attack formation allows Attack based moves a shorter recharge time, and there will be two characters in the front row, and a single character in the back row. In Magic formation, Magic users have a shorter recharge time and positioning is reversed. Following that decision the player must choose the items to bring. Only sixteen items can be held at any time, and there are no methods of storage. The player may only bring four of those sixteen items into battle for all three characters to use. However, for every item, each character has a different attack; where, with a staff, Cierra might <b>do</b> <b>great</b> damage with a magical attack, Fia would heal an ally.|$|E

He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring and he backed off as a precaution, but insisted that it was nothing serious.|$|E

Farr opined that the Inca costumes were drawn with [...] "a care and flamboyance that would <b>do</b> <b>great</b> credit to a major opera house production", while the Andean landscapes were [...] "worthy of a Cecil B.

In November 1945 she chaired an international conference in London that led to the establishment, a year later, of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).

500|$|... "Pokey Mom" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson {{as part of the}} twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–2001). According to then-showrunner Mike Scully, the story of this episode originated {{from the fact that the}} staff members of The Simpsons wanted to do an episode about Marge but felt they did not want it to revolve around her getting a new job, as that had been seen on the show [...] "too often". They decided to explore one of Marge's attributes that had been seen in earlier episodes, eventually choosing her interest in art. Martin conceived of the sub-plot surrounding Homer following a visit to a chiropractor. He has said that the [...] "heart" [...] of that story is that the chiropractors in Springfield become opposed to Homer's method of healing people and try to stop it after losing business, in reference to how chiropractors in real-life [...] "are a bit hated by the AMA (American Medical Association)" [...] and how the AMA has tried to restrict their businesses in the past. Martin has also noted that the episode shows how [...] "a lot of chiropractors are these great healers and they <b>do</b> <b>great</b> work, and then there's some that are crooked." ...|$|E
