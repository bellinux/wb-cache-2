Our results demonstrate that the method is capable of drastic dynamic range compression, while preserving fine details and avoiding common artifacts, such as halos, gradient reversals, or loss of local contrast.

40|$|In the type-I seesaw {{model the}} size of mixing between light and heavy neutrinos, nu and N, respectively, is of order the square root of their mass ratio, (m_nu/m_N) ^(1 / 2), with only one {{generation}} of the neutrinos. Since the light-neutrino mass must be less than an eV or so, the mixing would be very small, even for a heavy-neutrino mass of order a few hundred GeV. This would make it unlikely to test the model directly at the LHC, as the amplitude for producing the heavy neutrino {{is proportional to the}} mixing size. However, it has been realized for some time that, with more than one generation of light and heavy neutrinos, the mixing can be significantly larger in certain situations. In this paper we explore this possibility further and consider specific examples in detail in the context of type-I seesaw. We study its implications for the single production of the heavy neutrinos at the LHC via the main channel q qbar' -> W^* -> l N involving an <b>ordinary</b> <b>charged</b> lepton l. We then extend the discussion to the type-III seesaw model, which has richer phenomenology due to presence of the charged partners of the heavy neutrinos, and examine the implications for the single production of these heavy leptons at the LHC. In the latter model the new kinds of solutions that we find also make it possible to have sizable flavor-changing neutral-current effects in processes involving <b>ordinary</b> <b>charged</b> leptons.
