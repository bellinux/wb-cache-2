5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to dedicate <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again {{enabled her to}} combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed {{for the use of}} an exclusively Khmer cast and script. Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel.|$|E
5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture.

Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E

25|$|We see {{examples}} of this homesick imagination in her poem “Dialogue Between Old England and New” which emphasizes {{the relationship between the}} motherland and the colonies as parental; and gives assurance that the bond between the two countries will continue.

The poem often refers to England as “mother” and America as “Daughter”, which emphasizes the bond Bradstreet feels <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> home country.|$|E

On 12 August 1921, Lloyd failed to show for an appearance at the London Palladium, choosing instead to stay at home and write her will.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} {{known as}} Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601, or simply The Procession Picture [...] (see illustration), is now often accepted {{as the work}} of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it [...] "one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age". It {{is an example of the}} convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an icon, portraying her as much younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, [...] "his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> adoring subjects". George Vertue, the eighteenth-century antiquarian, called the painting [...] "not well nor ill done".|$|E
