The {{municipal}} loggia in Šibenik {{was built}} between 1534 and 1547 {{as a replacement}} for the old loggia which had been constructed in the early fourteenth century as more modest building. The new loggia was a two-storied structure built on an elongated rectangular ground plan with an arcaded portico on the ground floor and an open colonnade on the first floor which stretched along the entire north side of the main town square. There, it faced the north side of Šibenik Cathedral and, therefore, helped shape an architectural setting which, compared to the public spaces in other Dalmatian towns, could be described as a proper Renaissance square. Despite this, in contrast to the Cathedral which has been extensively studied by several generations of art-historians, the municipal loggia never attracted much scholarly attention and tends to be mentioned briefly in general overviews of sixteenth-century art and architecture in Dalmatia and/or Croatia. In fact, no significant contributions to the knowledge about the history of this building have been made for almost a century, that is, since it was last discussed by local historians. Moreover, the loggia as they knew it was completely destroyed in a 1943 bombing raid and subsequently rebuilt from 1949 to 1960. The aim {{of this article is to}} establish basic facts about the original sixteenth-century building, starting with how it was called and which purpose it fulfilled. From the early twentieth century onward – the time when one first comes across the suggestion that the Šibenik loggia originally served as the seat of the municipal council – it has often been referred to as the town hall, not only in everyday life but also in the scholarly literature. However, the evidence obtained from the primary sources such as the Šibenik municipal statute, archival documents and other historical records demonstrates that the meetings of the local Great Council were held in the nearby Municipal, that is, Rector’s palace and nowhere else. Moreover, the loggia could not suit the needs of a large assembly, especially considering that its ground floor was divided in (at least) seven separate rooms while the upper level was completely open towards the square across the entire width of the building. The latter is corroborated by the written testimonies of the early nineteenth century which pre-date the time when the <b>intercolumnations</b> were filled in so as to make a wall on the first floor. On the other hand, the use of the term loggia (or logia as it appears in the sources written in Latin) which is not just a generic name for a distinctive architectural type, is indicative enough, not just with relation to the original purpose and function of the building but with regard to the important role in had in the everyday life of the local community. Just like any other municipal logia magna found in the medieval Mediterranean world, the one at Šibenik served as a place for the dispensation of justice but also as a place where a number of activities connected to public affairs took place, for example, promulgations of legal decrees issued by the central or local government, announcements of sale of immovable property, public auctions and so on. With regard to the commissioning process, design and execution of the loggia, the study of the primary sources has not yielded any results. Nothing is known about its designer, builders, sculptors and stonemasons, and the same can be said for the role played by the municipal bodies in its construction. The only reliable source of information concerning the chronology of the building and the individuals connected to it are the texts of four all’antica inscriptions, which were not restored after the Second World War, and which praise the merits of two Venetian noblemen who served as rectors of Šibenik in the sixteenth-century. The building of the loggia begun during the office of conte et capitano Zuan Alvise Venier (1532 ‒ 1534) while the inscription of 1542 gives the credit for its completion to Francesco Diedo who was rector between 1541 and 1543. However, what seems to have been completed by 1542 was only the main construction because we learn from the last dated inscription, located on the bell-tower, that Zuan Alvise Venier not only started the project but brought it to an end in 1547, the final year of his second term in office as the rector of Šibenik (1545 - 1547). The concluding sections of the article deal with the loggia’s unique architectural and urbanistic qualities and provide a brief survey of the still open historical and art-historical questions surrounding it, particularly those concerning its place within the context of contemporary architecture in the Venetian province of Dalmatia...|$|R
5000|$|Longhena is {{considered}} a contemporary or near-contemporary {{of a number of}} prominent Italian architects of the 16th and 17th century such as Vincenzo Scamozzi and Andrea Palladio. As Branko Mitrovic states in his book on renaissance architecture: [...] "Scamozzi...adjusted the central <b>intercolumnation</b> of the main portico so that the edges of columns {{can be seen from the}} end of a circular hall. Visually, this is a way to suggest from inside that there is another formal space beyond the entrance door... Baldassare Longhena used a similar system of non-orthogonal axes in Santa Maria della Salute in Venice. As with Palladio, it is unclear whether Longhena intended to form such visual axes or whether they are a by-product of his complex geometries." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Ibis-headed god Thoth was, {{with his}} {{accompanying}} emblems, the Ibis and the Cynocephalus monkey, {{the most conspicuous}} among the sculptures upon the great portico of the temple of Hermopolis. His designation in inscriptions was [...] "The Lord of Eshmoon". This portico was a work of the Pharaonic era, but the erections of the Ptolemies at Hermopolis were {{on a scale of}} great extent and magnificence and, although raised by Greek monarchs, are essentially Egyptian in their conception and execution. The portico, the only remnant of the temple, consists of a double row of pillars, six in each row. The architraves are formed of five stones; each passes from the centre of one pillar to that of the next, according to a well-known usage with Egyptian builders. The <b>intercolumnation</b> of the centre pillars is wider than that of the others; and the stone over the centre is twenty-five feet and six inches long. These columns were painted yellow, red and blue in alternate bands. There is also a peculiarity in the pillars of the Hermopolitan portico peculiar to themselves, or at least discovered only again in the temple of Gournou. (Dénon, L'Egypte, plate 41.) Instead of being formed of large masses placed horizontally above each other, they are composed of irregular pieces, so artfully adjusted {{that it is difficult to}} detect the lines of junction. The bases of these columns represent the lower leaves of the lotus; next come a number of concentric rings, like the hoops of a cask; and above these the pillars appear like bunches of reeds held together by horizontal bonds. Including the capital, each column is about 40 feet high; the greatest circumference is about 28½ feet, about five feet from the ground, for they diminish in thickness both towards the base and towards the capital. The widest part of the <b>intercolumnation</b> is 17 feet; the other pillars are 13 feet apart.|$|E
50|$|The clock tower also follows {{this rule}} of threes. In {{elevation}} {{it has a}} heavy robust base that is taller {{than the rest of}} the building. This is topped with another section that is more ornate, yet lighter, detailed with two columns to make three bays, and finally the actual clock and roof. The clock tower is modeled after the Campanile of St. Mark’s in Venice, which had collapsed and was being rebuilt shortly before the construction of the station began. It is an interesting effect of the tower getting lighter with higher elevation. The bottom tier is mostly stone with only a vertical line of very narrow fenestration. The second tier becomes much lighter with the <b>intercolumnation</b> and having the stone wall set a distance behind the columns to give it the depth needed to create a sense of openness. The third tier completes the lightness by becoming narrower and employing a steep and slender roofline.|$|E
