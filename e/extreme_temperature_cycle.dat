40|$|On Earth sulfur "concrete" is an {{established}} construction material that has good mechanical properties, generally better than Portland cement, {{and can be}} used in corrosive environments. Troilite (FeS) has been found on the moon and raises the question of using extracted sulfur as a lunar construction material, an attractive alternative to conventional concrete as it does not require water. Troilite reduction to elemental sulfur and using it to make concrete in a lunar setting has been previously discussed. However, little has been experimentally done to evaluate its performance in the extreme lunar environment. This study subjected sets of sulfur concrete samples, prepared using JSC- 1 lunar simulant, to I) extended periods of high vacuum and 2) <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles.</b> Here an overview of sulfur concrete and experimentally assessed properties, put in context of the lunar environment, is presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|This {{strategy}} {{worked for}} Opportunity until Sol 654 (November 25, 2005), when the Joint-1 azimuth motor stalled {{because of increased}} electrical resistance. Rover operators responded by delivering higher-than-normal current to the motor. This approach also worked, though Joint 1 continued to stall periodically. Typically, the rover's handlers simply tried again the next sol and the joint worked. They determined that the Joint-1 motor stalls were most likely due to damage caused by the <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> the joint experienced during deep sleep. As a precaution, they started keeping the robotic arm {{out in front of}} the rover overnight, rather than stowing it underneath the rover deck, where it would be virtually unusable in the event of a Joint-1 motor failure. They stowed the arm only while driving and unstowed it immediately at the end of each drive.|$|R

The motor assembly must survive all ground operations, plus the nominal 670 Martian-day (or sol) mission that includes summer and winter seasons of the Mars environment. The motor assembly was tested and characterized under <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> conditions with reference to hardware requirements. The motor assembly has been proved to be remarkably robust and displayed no sign of degradation due to the 3 X (three times per JPL design principles) thermal environmental exposure to the punishing Mars surface operations cycles.

40|$|Abstract-Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} {{to develop an}} integrated technology for the prediction of aging behavior for space structural materials during service. This research will utilize state-of-the-art radiation experimental apparatus and analysis, updated codes and databases, and integrated mechanical and radiation testing techniques to investigate the suitability of numerous current and potential spacecraft structural materials. Also included are the effects on structural materials in surface modules and planetary landing craft, with or without fission power supplies. Spacecraft structural materials would also be in hostile radiation environments {{on the surface of}} the moon and planets without appreciable atmospheres and moons around planets with large intense magnetic and radiation fields (such as the Jovian moons).

This paper describes the integrated methodology in detail and shows that it will provide a significant technological advance for designing advanced spacecraft. This methodology will also allow for the development of advanced spacecraft materials through the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of material degradation in the space radiation environment.

In one part of the BOSS experiment three Chroococcidiopsis desert stains (CCMEE 057, CCMEE 029 and CCMEE 064), were exposed to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in the dried state either as biofilms or multilayered planktonic samples. Cells were exposed for 16 months to space and Mars-like conditions outside the International Space Station. Exposure parameters included temperature variations, ionizing radiation, vacuum or simulated Martian atmosphere and pressure, and Mars-like solar UV irradiation. In parallel to exposure in LEO, replicates of the experiment were performed on the ground: Some were kept in the dark under ambient conditions, while others were exposed to stressors (<b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles,</b> Mars-simulated atmosphere or vacuum, and UV ux) mimicking those undergone during the EXPOSE-R 2 space mission, based on data recorded in- ight. Cyanobacteria were analyzed post- ight using confocal microscopy, PCR-based assays and colony forming ability tests. Results are consistent with previous ground-based simulations of the mission 1, 2 and demonstrate an overall higher resistance of biofilms when compared to planktonic as suggested by their increased viability and lower amounts of DNA damage. 1.

40|$|In {{the past}} 25 years, the {{majority}} of interplanetary spacecraft have been powered by nuclear sources. However, as the emphasis on smaller, low cost missions gains momentum, {{the majority of}} missions now being planned will use photovoltaic solar arrays. This will present challenges to the solar array builders, inasmuch as planetary requirements usually differ from earth orbital requirements. In addition, these requirements often differ greatly, depending on the specific mission; for example, inner planets vs. outer planets, orbiters vs. flybys, spacecraft vs. landers, and so on. Also, the likelihood of electric propulsion missions will influence the requirements placed on solar array developers. The paper will discuss representative requirements {{for a range of}} planetary missions now in the planning stages. Insofar as inner planets are concerned, a Mercury orbiter is being studied with many special requirements. Solar arrays would be exposed to high temperatures and a potentially high radiation environment, and will need to be increasingly pointed off sun as the vehicle approaches Mercury. Identification and development of cell materials and arrays at high incidence angles will be critical to the design. Missions to the outer solar system that have been studied include a Galilean orbiter and a flight to the Kuiper belt. While onboard power requirements would be small (as low as 10 watts), the solar intensity will require relatively large array areas. As a result, such missions will demand extremely compact packaging and low mass structures to conform to launch vehicle constraints. In turn, the large are, low mass designs will impact allowable spacecraft loads. Inflatable array structures, with and without concentration, and multiband gap cells will be considered if available. In general, the highest efficiency cell technologies operable under low intensity, low temperature conditions are needed. Solar arrays will power missions requiring as little as approximately 100 watts, up to several kilowatts (at Earth) in the case of solar electric propulsion missions. Thus, mass and stowage volume minimization will be required over a range of array sizes. Concentrator designs, inflatable structures, and the combination of solar arrays with the telecommunications system have been proposed. Performance, launch vehicle constraints, an cost will be the principal parameters in the design trade space. Other special applications will also be discussed, including requirements relating to planetary landers and probes. In those cases, issues relating to shock loads on landing, operability in (possibly dusty) atmospheres, and <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> must be considered, in addition to performance, stowed volume, and costs...|$|R
40|$|A paper {{describes}} advanced ceramic column {{grid array}} (CCGA) packaging interconnects technology test objects that {{were subjected to}} <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> thermal <b>cycles.</b> CCGA interconnect electronic package printed wiring boards (PWBs) of polyimide were assembled, inspected nondestructively, and, subsequently, subjected to ex - treme-temperature thermal cycling to assess reliability for future deep-space, short- and long-term, extreme-temperature missions. The test hardware consisted of two CCGA 717 packages with each package divided into four daisy-chained sections, {{for a total of}} eight daisy chains to be monitored. The package is 33 33 mm with a 27 27 array of 80 %/ 20 % Pb/Sn columns on a 1. 27 -mm pitch. The change in resistance of the daisy-chained CCGA interconnects was measured {{as a function of the}} increasing number of thermal cycles. Several catastrophic failures were observed after 137 extreme-temperature thermal cycles, as per electrical resistance measurements, and then the tests were continued through 1, 058 thermal cycles to corroborate and understand the test results. X-ray and optical inspection have been made after thermal cycling. Optical inspections were also conducted on the CCGA vs. thermal cycles. The optical inspections were conclusive; the x-ray images were not. Process qualification and assembly is required to optimize the CCGA assembly, which is very clear from the x-rays. Six daisy chains were open out of seven daisy chains, as per experimental test data reported. The daisy chains are open during the cold cycle, and then recover during the hot cycle, though some of them also opened during the hot thermal cycle. ...|$|R
