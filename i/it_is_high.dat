5|$|The head is flattened, triangular, and {{distinct}} from the neck. The snout is blunt, rounded, and raised. The nostrils are large, each {{in the middle of}} a large, single nasal scale. The lower edge of the nasal touches the nasorostral. The supranasal has a strong crescent shape and separates the nasal from the nasorostral anteriorly. The rostral is as broad as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E
5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times as long as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>high.</b> There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E

5|$|Z. ferox is {{only known}} from small, {{wingless}} females. The head {{is similar to}} those of queens of Z. tonsora, but they can be separated by the lack of ocelli and rugose patches found on the vertex. Only a single row of denticles is present, and the vertexal margin (seen posterodorsally) is concave. The mesosoma is smooth and contains a single spine, fovea (a pit or depression in a structure) or carina (a keel-like elevation on the body-wall of an insect). The posterior portion of the propodeal surface is concave; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> and strongly angled. All legs have flattened femurs (the largest region of an insect's leg) and tibiae, and the tibiae are carinated both anteriorly and posteriorly. The gaster (the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma) has five known segments. Like the queen, Z. ferox has a large, retractable stinger, in which the external part is enclosed by the gonostyli (sting sheaths).|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} remaining {{among the}} ruins of ancient Rome appeared to respect a simple mathematical order {{in the way that}} Gothic buildings did not.

A Gothic pointed arch could be extended upwards or flattened to any proportion that suited the location. Arches of differing angles frequently occurred within the same structure.

25|$|Peridotite is a dense, {{coarse-grained}} {{igneous rock}} consisting mostly of the minerals olivine and pyroxene. Peridotite is ultramafic, as the rock contains less than 45% silica. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>high</b> in magnesium, reflecting the high proportions of magnesium-rich olivine, with appreciable iron. Peridotite {{is derived from}} the Earth's mantle, either as solid blocks and fragments, or as crystals accumulated from magmas that formed in the mantle. The compositions of peridotites from these layered igneous complexes vary widely, reflecting the relative proportions of pyroxenes, chromite, plagioclase, and amphibole.|$|E

It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I'd have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E
