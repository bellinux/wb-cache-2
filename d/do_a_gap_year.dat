40|$|This article {{reports on}} a number of higher {{education}} students 'perceptions of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} taking <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year,</b> and the effect of <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> on their personal development. <b>A</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> can be described as taking "time out" during any stage of one's life in order to undertake any of a number of activities. It may involve various combinations of paid and voluntary work locally or overseas, but in some instances <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> is spent travelling, <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> adventure course or a course in self-development. Sometimes young people devote <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> to religious studies or activities. <b>A</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> is usually taken before entering a higher education institution, between college/university and starting a career, or even before making a career change. It may last from three months to a year, but is often extended to two years and in some instances even continue for longer periods. This article deals only with the <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> students take immediately after their final school year, before entering a higher education institution. Matriculants mainly decide to take <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> because they are uncertain about whether (and what) they want to study, want to earn money or simply want to take a break from studying. In this research project a qualitative approach was followed. To gather data, the researcher conducted 25 individual, semi-structured interviews with higher education students who had taken <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> before entering university. The questions that were asked dealt inter alia with the reason why they took <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> year; what they did during their gap year; how the <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> influenced their social and academic adjustment at university; what life skills they acquired during their gap year; what they regard as the advantages and disadvantages of <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> year; what problems or challenges they experienced; and what the <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> meant for their personal development. Follow-up questions were asked when necessary. The findings identified a range of benefits enjoyed by students as the result of <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year.</b> These benefits can be divided into the following three categories: (1) They experience personal growth and develop a number of life skills during <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year.</b> This category can be subdivided into the following subcategories: growing up quickly; acquiring greater independence, responsibility and self-confidence; gaining life and work experience, self-knowledge and a better perspective on the future; learning to persevere, to work with money, to treat freedom with responsibility; and learning how to handle difficult situations in everyday life and in the workplace. (2) Their interpersonal and communication skills improve. These include making new acquaintances; improving interpersonal relationship and communication skills; and learning how to handle conflict in the workplace. (3) They acquire a broader world-view and a better perspective on life. Because they are confronted with the realities of life they gain a more objective perspective on life and learn to understand other cultures better. The investigation also revealed a number of disadvantages of <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Gap</b> <b>year</b> students have fallen behind their peer group and will start earning money at a later age. It takes time to adjust to academic studies after a year of non-academic activities. Many young people do not utilise their <b>gap</b> <b>year</b> to gain valuable experience and struggle to find their feet afterwards. Although there has been an increase in the gap-year phenomenon over the past decade, very little scientific research has previously been done on South African students' experiences of <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>year...</b>|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{adolescence}} is {{a stage of}} development between adolescence and adulthood when young people are most concerned with personal identity development. During this time of life, young people have several postsecondary education choices; such as attending college, entering the work force immediately, or embracing an alternative educational experience such as <b>a</b> <b>Gap</b> <b>Year.</b> The <b>Gap</b> <b>Year</b> originated in Great Britain and is gaining momentum in the United States. <b>A</b> <b>Gap</b> <b>Year</b> has {{potential to be a}} transformative educational experience for emerging adolescents, particularly related to identity development. The purpose of this research was to explore indicators of identity development in a set of 419 open-ended responses to a question in <b>a</b> national <b>Gap</b> <b>Year</b> alumni survey that asked, “What skills or knowledge did you acquire as a result of your Gap Year?” Chickering and Reisser’s framework of identity development provided the structure for the analysis, and Qualitative Content Analysis was employed as the method. Analysis showed indicators of alumni-perceived gains, affiliated primarily with initial stages of identity development. Analysis also indicated alumni-perceived gains in comprehensive stages of identity development that are dependent on development in initial stages. This study contributes to the limited research on <b>Gap</b> <b>Year</b> experiences by illuminating the identity development potential of <b>Gap</b> <b>Year</b> programming. It also indicates the need for further original research focused on the identity development potential of the <b>Gap</b> <b>Year...</b>|$|R
