It is inevitable that {{there exists a}} deviation or gap betweenforecasted values and actual values. Thus, project risk level of the proposal should be analyzedin the assessment phase. Simulation based project evaluation approaches enables to make more reliableinvestment decision since they permits including future uncertainty and risk in analyze process. Inaddition, many times, project proposals are evaluated {{with more than one}} conflicted criteria. The aimof this paper is to present a new approach that accounts for multiple objectives for evaluating riskyinvestment projects and <b>determining</b> <b>projects</b> risk level.

However, many Indonesian road infrastructure projects are still delivered using the traditional design-bid-build (DBB) {{project delivery}} system. This paper reviews the existing literature to explore factors that can influence the successful implementation of DB project delivery system in Indonesian road infrastructure projects. It founds the lack of clarification in existing legislations {{as well as the}} lack of experiences, knowledge and skill as the main obstacles in implementing DB systems in Indonesia. To overcome these obstacles, this paper proposes (1) A relook at existing legislation in term of providing more guidance on <b>determining</b> <b>projects</b> appropriate for the DB, procedures for implementing DB, and the structure of builder entity; (2) To develop the skills and knowledge of DB to all stakeholders through communications, knowledge sharing and training. The outcome of this review can serve as a guide to development a framework for the implementation of the design-build project delivery system in Indonesian road infrastructure projects. ...|$|E
40|$|Em 1931, Oswald de Andrade cria e publica O Homem do Povo, jornal em que manifesta seu ativismo comunista, e no qual satiriza a sociedade capitalista e burguesa no Brasil de seu tempo. Suas edições, no total de oito, foram publicadas em março e abril de 1931, contando com a participação de Patrícia Galvão (Pagu) e Queiroz Lima e com a parceria de importantes intelectuais como o crítico Astrojildo Pereira. O trabalho tem por objetivo analisar propriedades expressivas e críticas das construções do jornal, sobretudo nas formulações do ativista Oswald de Andrade. Para isso foram selecionados do jornal principalmente os editoriais escritos por Oswald de Andrade, vários artigos que levam a sua assinatura, e outros assinados por pseudônimos ou anônimos, evidenciados os traços peculiares de sua escrita e ideias. Por meio da pesquisa investigativa, leitura e análise do corpus, destacam-se três elementos substanciais presentes na sua escrita: o humor do jogo de espírito irreverente, a reflexão vinculada aos propósitos de sua própria formulação crítica a respeito da antropofagia, e a subversão, em que resume elementos de estética e política, cuja configuração se manifesta na própria organicidade do jornal. Tais ingredientes, em analogia com outros articulistas, dão sustentação à substância satírica que permeia o jornal O Homem do Povo. Assim, observa-se nas diferentes estratégias de sua linguagem, metafórica ou não, que Oswald de Andrade continuamente alia-se aos colaboradores para representar um mundo às avessas, alvejando a sociedade capitalista e suas elites. Neste sentido, interessa exibir que, por suas elaborações hiperbólicas, o jornal, provocativamente, serve de instrumento na procura de evidenciar, por diversos meios e modos, o destronamento do burguês e a entronização do povo. Nessa tarefa, Oswald de Andrade busca se reinventar criticamente, ao transpor pela atividade jornalística seu espaço legitimado na burguesia e balizar-se por projetos voltados para o povo. Nesse exercício desdobra-se em seus pseudônimos e se posiciona como líder de um grupo, fazendo da palavra e do humor escudo e arma, construindo paradoxos, trocadilhos, ironias e hipérboles. Com isso Oswald de Andrade aciona o potencial crítico dos recursos da linguagem expressiva e comunicativa que, no jornal O Homem do Povo, serve para denunciar, provocar e ridicularizar valores consagrados pela burguesia e pelo sistema capitalista que a sustenta, fundindo o embate político do articulista e o embate estético do escritor modernista. In 1931, Oswald de Andrade creates O Homem do Povo, a {{newspaper}} in which he publicly declares his communist activism, and in which he satirizes both, capitalism and the bourgeois society at the time. Its eight editions, were published in March and April of 1931 together with the participation of both Patricia Galvão (Pagu) and Queiroz Lima. Such a work intended to analyze both expressive and critical properties of Oswald de Andrades constructions at the journal and to put in evidence points of contact between the aesthetic and political aspects of the activists formulations. For doing it so, Oswald de Andrades editorials were selected such as articles signed by him and others which clearly evidence his writings and ideas. Through reading and corpus analyses it is detected three substantial elements such as: the irreverent spirit game, the reflection tied to purposes of his own critical formulation as far as anthropophagy is concerned and the subversion where he summarizes aesthetics and political elements; the configuration of which shows itself {{in the setting of}} the journal. Such ingredients, allied to comicality back up the satirical element that permeates O Homem do Povo. So, it can be observed in any of the different strategies of his vocabulary, either metaphoric or not, that Oswald de Andrade continually tries to represent an upside down world having the capitalist society and its elites as targets. In that way, it is interesting to show that, due to his hyperbolic elaborations, the writer-journalist in a teasing way tries to put in evidence the bourgeois decline and the ascension of the people through many different ways and methods. In such a work, Oswald de Andrade looks forward to reinvent himself critically, by transposing his legitimate space in bourgeoisie through journalist activity and <b>determining</b> <b>projects</b> which concerns the proletariat, that is to say, the lower social class. While doing so he creates many different pseudonyms and situate himself as a leader of the referred class, using words and humor as both shield and weapon, building paradoxes, puns, irony and hyperboles. By doing so, Oswald de Andrade turns on the critical power of his communicative and expressive language that at O Homem do Povo is used for denouncing, teasing and making ridicule consecrated values of the bourgeoisie and of the capitalist system that supports it linking both the political resistance of the journal´s editor and the aesthetic resistance of the modernist writer...|$|E

40|$|The {{building}} industry is always surrounded by many risks and uncertainties and their degree {{in a project}} results {{from a combination of}} factors which differ from one project to another. One of the attempts to handle risks is by allocating project contingency sum. Traditionally, construction professionals determine cost contingency simply by adding; say 10 % contingency onto the estimated cost of a project. However, this conventional method is arbitrary arrived at and difficult to justify or defend and coupled with so many associated weaknesses. The aim of the study is to investigate into methods of <b>determining</b> <b>project</b> cost contingency.

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to calculate the completion time of various network paths according to which project completion time could be calculated. Critical Path Method (CPM) is used to <b>determine</b> <b>project</b> completion time if the time to conduct activities is definite. But if time of conducting activities is probable, Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) method must be used and if occurring activities is possible, Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) method should be applied. The current project control software usually cannot perform calculations for the last two states. Moreover, using manual methods is impossible if the network is composed of several activities. Thus applying the simulation approach is an appropriate method in such states. Simulation is used as a strong tool to analyze systems because it has a close relationship with real systems and considers many complicated relations in them. It is intended to <b>determine</b> <b>project</b> completion time and critical path in this survey given that time of activities is probable and each activity is the prerequisite to another. ARENA software has been used to do so which is based on simulation method...|$|R
