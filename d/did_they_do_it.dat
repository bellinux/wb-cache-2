60|$|There {{were some}} grown-up children, others growing up, with others {{that were still}} quite small. The boys, I noticed, favoured their mother, and had commonplace faces; the girls took after their father, and though their {{features}} were not so perfect they were exceptionally good-looking. The eldest son--the disjointed, fly-away-looking {{young man who had}} conquered all his enemies--had a wife and child. The eldest daughter was also married, and had one child. Altogether the three families numbered about sixteen persons, each family having its separate set of rooms, but all dining at one table. How <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> It seemed easy enough to them. They were serious people in a sense, although always cheerful and sometimes hilarious when together of an evening, or at their meals. But they regarded life as a serious matter, a state of probation; they were non-smokers, total abstainers, diligent at their work, united, profoundly religious. A fresh wonder came to light when I found that this poor woodman, with so large a family to support, who spent ten or twelve hours every day at his outdoor work, had yet been able out of his small earnings to buy bricks and other materials, and, assisted by his sons, to build a chapel adjoining his house. Here he held religious services on Sundays, and once or twice of an evening during the week. These services consisted of extempore prayers, a short address, and hymns accompanied by a harmonium, which they all appeared able to play.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} {{capitalism}} from {{the industrial revolution}} onwards is one of increasing differences in productivity and living conditions across {{different parts of the}} globe.

However, in spite of this long run trends towards divergence in productivity and income, there are many examples of (initially) backward countries that – at different times – have managed to defy the trend by narrowing the gap in productivity and income between themselves and the frontier countries, that is, by “catching up”.
