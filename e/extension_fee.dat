Many more {{responsible}} and experienced brokers will intentionally price with a rebate that is either realized as an incentive for an efficient closing, or if the transaction becomes stressed, will usually lose it to lender <b>extension</b> <b>fees</b> or pay for exceptions to the loan file that would otherwise incur a denial.

6000|$|I {{am glad to}} {{hear from}} you of the {{conditions}} in which the New York Tribune representative thinks there will be no difficulty over the fee for the article. I have in point of fact during {{the last three or four}} days considerably written one--concerning which a question comes up which I hope you won't think too tiresome. Making up my mind that something as concrete and [...] "human" [...] as possible would be my best card to play, I have done something about the British soldier, his aspect, temper and tone, and the considerations he suggests, as I have seen him since the beginning of the war in Hospital; where I have in fact largely and constantly seen him. The theme lends itself, by my sense, much; and I dare say I should have it rather to myself--though of course there is no telling! But what I have been feeling in the connection--having now done upwards of 3000 words--is that I should be very grateful for leave to make them 4000 (without of course <b>extension</b> of <b>fee.)</b> I have never been good for the mere snippet, and there is so much to say and to feel! Would you mind asking her, in reporting to her of what my subject is, whether this extra thousand would incommode them. If she really objects to it I think I shall be then disposed to ask you to make some other application of my little paper (on the 4000 basis;) in which case I should propose to the Tribune another idea, keeping it down absolutely to the 3000. (I'm afraid I can't do less than that.) My motive would probably in that case be a quite different and less [...] "concrete" [...] thing; namely, the expression of my sense of the way the Briton in general feels about his insulation, and his being in it and of it, even through all this unprecedented stress. It would amount to a statement or picture of his sense of the way his sea-genius has always encircled and protected him, striking deep into his blood and his bones; so that any reconsideration of his position in a new light inevitably comes hard to him, and yet makes the process the effective development of which it is interesting to watch. I should call this thing something like [...] "The New Vision," [...] or, better still, simply [...] "Insulation": though I don't say exactly that. At all events I should be able to make something interesting of it, and it would of course inevitably take the sympathetic turn. But I would rather keep to the thing I have been trying, if I may have the small extra space....|$|R
