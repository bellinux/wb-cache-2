5|$|Værøy Airport {{was plagued}} by bad wind {{conditions}} and low regularity. The airport had {{the highest number of}} cancellations in the country, with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation. During some periods, regularity was as low as 50%. The navigational aids were moved in 1989 to increase safety, more runway lights were installed and an anemometer was installed on the mountain, costing NOK1 million. Widerøe introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at Værøy from 31 October 1988. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> came from 090°–240° (though south) <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed exceeded , including gusts. Additional restriction were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989. These were again modified on 1 November 1989.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear {{can also}} create wave. This occurs when an {{atmospheric}} inversion separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by thermals {{coming up from}} below, it will create significant shear waves {{that can be used}} for soaring.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|Total {{wind power}} could be {{captured}} only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> velocity {{is reduced to}} zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of stream tube, the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: Betz' law).|$|E

5|$|Within Orkney, {{the council}} {{operates}} airfields {{on most of}} the larger islands including Stronsay, Eday, North Ronaldsay, Westray, Papa Westray, and Sanday.

5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

25|$|The term {{marine energy}} {{encompasses}} both wave power i.e. power from surface waves, and tidal power i.e. {{obtained from the}} kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water.

25|$|While {{the weather}} {{on the eastern}} side of the {{mountain}} is generally better, rain or snow can quickly become widespread on that side as well <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> turns to the south or southeast.

The southward field causes magnetic reconnection of the dayside magnetopause, rapidly injecting magnetic and particle energy into the Earth's magnetosphere.|$|R

25|$|East coasts {{also receive}} heavy winter swells when {{low-pressure}} cells {{form in the}} sub-tropics, where slow moving highs inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however they can still generate heavy swells, since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels, since a wave reaching {{the end of a}} fetch behaves as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> died.|$|E
25|$|There are no railways, waterways, ports or {{harbours}} on the island. Loading jetties {{are located}} at Kingston and Cascade, but ships cannot {{get close to}} either of them. When a supply ship arrives, it is emptied by whaleboats towed by launches, five tonnes at a time. Which jetty is used depends on the prevailing weather of the day; the jetty on the leeward {{side of the island}} is often used. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> changes significantly during unloading/loading, the ship will move around to the other side. Visitors often gather to watch the activity when a supply ship arrives.|$|E
40|$|Proper <b>winding</b> of <b>the</b> {{steel rope}} around the winch drum is great importance, mostly for: prolonging the service {{life of the}} rope, {{reduction}} of deformations {{of the body and}} the sides of <b>the</b> drum <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of <b>the</b> rope is multilayered, increasing of the safety factors, easier unwinding of the rope while lowering the load, even running of the drive unit, etc. The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the friction which occurs in <b>the</b> process of <b>winding</b> and unwinding <b>the</b> rope around the winch drum. Friction force is in its highest intensity when the rope passes from one layer to another, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of <b>the</b> rope is multilayered. As the result of the research, certain mechanisms of <b>winding</b> of <b>the</b> rope from the aspects of the friction force were obtained, and the effects of the forces {{on the sides of the}} drum were analyzed...|$|R

25|$|During {{the course}} of a winding up, a company may make an {{estimate}} of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> date assumed for <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> up turns out to be before <b>the</b> actual <b>winding</b> up, then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> up, a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> up had started with that accounting period.|$|R
25|$|Landing {{the runway}} 13 {{approach}} was already difficult with normal crosswinds since even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> direction was constant, it was changing {{relative to the}} aircraft during the 47° visual right turn. The landing would become even more challenging when crosswinds from the northeast were strong and gusty during typhoons. The mountain range northeast of the airport also makes wind vary greatly in both speed and direction. From a spectator's point of view, watching large aircraft banking at low altitudes and taking big crab angles during their final approaches was quite thrilling. Despite the difficulty, the runway 13 approach was nonetheless used {{most of the time}} due to the prevailing wind direction in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|The first system {{employed}} {{for the mass}} delivery of gas involved releasing the gas cylinders in a favourable wind such that it was carried over the enemy's trenches. The Hague Convention of 1899 prohibited the use of poisons gasses delivered by projectiles. The main advantage of this method {{was that it was}} relatively simple and, in suitable atmospheric conditions, produced a concentrated cloud capable of overwhelming the gas mask defences. The disadvantages of cylinder releases were numerous. First and foremost, delivery was {{at the mercy of the}} wind. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> was fickle, as was the case at Loos, the gas could backfire, causing friendly casualties. Gas clouds gave plenty of warning, allowing the enemy time to protect themselves, though many soldiers found the sight of a creeping gas cloud unnerving. Also gas clouds had limited penetration, only capable of affecting the front-line trenches before dissipating.|$|E
25|$|Dartmouth {{is a small}} port on {{the west}} side of the natural harbour formed by the River Dart. In the 1860s the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway {{established}} more quays on the opposite bank at Kingswear. The RNLI approved that Dartmouth Lifeboat Station be established at Dartmouth in July 1876 but it was 1878 before a lifeboat arrived. During the summer the lifeboat was kept in a boat house at Sand Quay, but during the winter it was kept afloat in Warfleet Creek where it was quicker to respond to any ships in distress. It would prove difficult for the rowing lifeboat to leave the estuary of the Dart <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> was blowing from the sea unless a tug was able to help. The station was closed in 1896 and during all that time just one effective service was provided. That was on 20 September 1887 when the crew attended a trawler near Kingswear Castle. The boat house is now used by the Dartmouth Amateur Rowing Club.|$|E
