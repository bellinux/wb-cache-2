25|$|The first {{prototype}} Belvedere {{went to the}} Belvedere Trials Unit at RAF Odiham, {{which was}} subsequently reformed as No. 66 Squadron RAF in 1961. <b>Engine</b> <b>starter</b> problems caused trouble early on but operational deployment continued. The prototype saw service in Europe, Africa, Southern Arabia and Borneo. XG447 was broken up at Boscombe Down on 7 August 1966.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's design {{placed the}} wing behind {{the cabin and}} allowed easy entry via automobile-like doors {{on each side of}} the cabin. The {{propeller}} is well protected and provides safety on the ground in comparison to tractor configuration aircraft. The airfoil employed is a NACA 4418 giving high lift and a stable stall characteristics. The flaps are two-position and mechanically operated by a flap handle on the cabin floor between the seats. The <b>engine</b> <b>starter</b> is foot-actuated and the nose-wheel steering is connected to the control wheel.|$|E
25|$|Electric-motor-driven {{mechanical}} sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 volts (DC) when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate {{wiring and}} transient protection for engine control computers {{is a necessary}} part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the wiring to the vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>starter</b> motor. Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an electric brake, a solenoid that presses a friction pad against the siren rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop the siren.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} cold {{starting}} {{has been greatly}} reduced since the introduction of <b>engine</b> <b>starters,</b> which are now commonplace on all modern vehicles. The higher revs {{that can be achieved}} using electric starter motors improves the chance of successful ignition.|$|R
50|$|The seven-stage axial {{compressor}} Lyul'ka TR-3A (later AL-5) turbojet engines, with variable exhaust nozzles and petrol <b>engine</b> <b>starters,</b> were {{housed in the}} streamlined nacelles attached to pylons at 26% span. To boost takeoff performance, four '126-1' JATO rockets of 2,000 kg (4,410 lb)for 17s could {{be attached to the}} rear fuselage ('129-1' JATO bottles were used on the prototype).|$|R

25|$|The W.2B/23C engines {{upon which}} the Welland was based {{produced}} 1,700lbf (7.58kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417mph (670km/h) at 3,000m {{and a range of}} 1,006miles (1,610km). It incorporated a hydraulically driven <b>engine</b> <b>starter</b> developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit. The engines also drove hydraulic and vacuum pumps as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce compressor stalls early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds, the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.|$|E
2500|$|Chief {{among the}} changes was the {{upgraded}} [...] Merlin XII engine. This engine included a Coffman <b>engine</b> <b>starter,</b> {{instead of the}} electric system of earlier and some later versions of the Merlin, and it required a small [...] "teardrop" [...] blister on the forward starboard cowling. The Merlin XII was cooled by a 70% to 30% water glycol mix, rather than pure glycol used for earlier Merlin versions.|$|E
2500|$|The Robin ATL (Avion Très Léger, [...] "very light {{aircraft}}") is a French two-seat {{light aircraft}} designed by Avions Robin in the 1980s {{to meet a}} need for an economical two-seat aircraft to equip flying clubs. It is a single-engined monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage, conventional control stick, and is, unusually, fitted with a V-tail. Due to the large bubble canopy, visibility is [...] excellent. Its benign flight characteristics, moderate speeds and low fuel consumption, {{as well as some}} unique details, like an <b>engine</b> <b>starter</b> button which can only be pressed when the fuel selector switch is open, made the ATL a good trainer.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} layout was {{to carry}} two 110-gallon (500 litre) fuel tanks, one per engine. These were usually mounted within the gondola, but {{when using the}} non-standard engines, the tanks would sometimes have to be relocated to outside the gondola or even hung from the rigging. Other equipment carried in the gondola included the compressed-air tanks for the <b>engine</b> <b>starters,</b> the <b>engine</b> oil tanks and the sandbag ballast.|$|R

2500|$|The Insight’s IMA {{includes}} a high-efficiency, lightweight, low-friction 1.3-liter SOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine rated for [...] at 5800 rpm and [...] of torque from 1000–1700 rpm. The high torque at low rpm {{is made possible}} by the electric motor which contributes up to [...] at 1500 rpm and [...] of torque at 1000 rpm to the powertrain, assisting in acceleration and some steady state cruising situations at low-to-mid vehicle speeds. The motor acts as a generator during braking, steady cruising, gentle deceleration and coasting in order to recharge the IMA battery. The motor also serves as the <b>engine</b> <b>starter,</b> quickly spinning the engine to idle speed after Idle Stop and during normal vehicle starting. The system will automatically switch to a back-up, conventional 12-volt starter to start the engine if the IMA system is disabled or if the car is started at extreme cold temperatures. As an additional safety feature, Honda’s hybrid configuration allows the car to operate like a conventional, petrol-engine vehicle even if the IMA hybrid-electric motor system is completely disabled.|$|E

50|$|The Bristol Blenheim was a {{twin-engine}} {{high performance}} all-metal medium bomber aircraft, {{powered by a}} pair of Bristol Mercury VIII air-cooled radial engines, each capable of 860 hp (640 kW). Each engine drove a three-bladed controllable-pitch propeller, and were equipped with both hand-based and electric <b>engine</b> <b>starters.</b> To ease maintenance, the engine mountings were designed with a split-segment to facilitate rapid engine removal without disturbing the carburettors. A pair of fuel tanks, each containing up to 140 gallons, were housed within the center-section of the fuselage.|$|R

50|$|In-flight restarts are {{designated}} as either windmill or starter-assisted, depending {{where in the}} flight envelope the restart is attempted. The re-light envelope occupies {{the lower part of}} the flight envelope below about 30,000 ft (28,000 ft in the case of a Boeing 747, which experienced flameouts at 37,000 ft). When an appropriate initial altitude and forward speed are available, the mass airflow through the compressor blades can maintain sufficient rotational velocity for enough time to permit restart. If the aircraft's operating conditions are not sufficient for a windmill start, the <b>engine's</b> <b>starter</b> motor must be operated to increase the turbine velocity to the minimum required speed.|$|R

50|$|Meth lab {{waste is}} toxic and {{extremely}} hazardous, making cleanup {{a major problem}} for authorities and property owners. Common wastes include brake cleaner, ammonia, soda bottles, cat litter, lithium batteries, <b>engine</b> <b>starter,</b> matches and pseudoephedrine blister packs.|$|E
50|$|It {{is officially}} classed as safe to {{transport}} provided it is labelled as flammable. Although <b>engine</b> <b>starters</b> {{do not require}} an air supply for their basic operation, air was supplied to later designs, {{such as that of}} the English Electric Lightning, by an automatic scavenge pump simply to control these fumes. The history of AVPIN use on the Lightning demonstrated it was both safe and effective in use. The reduced availability of AVPIN is now a restriction on the continued operation of some preserved military aircraft, such as Lightnings in the UK and South Africa and some are thus being converted to electric starting.|$|R

50|$|Hence, {{the ill-fated}} diesel-engined R101 — which crashed in 1930 — was {{to fly to}} India, though her diesel <b>engines</b> had petrol <b>starter</b> <b>engines,</b> and there had only been time to replace one with a diesel starter engine.The R101 used the Beardmore Tornado aero diesel engine, {{with two of the}} five engines {{reversible}} by an adjustment to the camshaft.
