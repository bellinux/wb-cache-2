As <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> in the electric chair, it is suddenly revealed to Homer that he is on a new reality TV show, Frame Up that airs on Fox TV. The whole thing was just part of an elaborate hidden camera scheme, the [...] "man with the braces" [...] was the show's host, and Mrs. Bellamy is guest host Carmen Electra in disguise. Homer and Marge are reunited with the kids, and Homer is angry that he had to suffer so the show could get higher ratings. Carmen Electra tries to explain, but Homer is too busy looking at her breasts. Chief Wiggum, on the other hand, is irritated that the police department used was wasted on what turned out to not even be a real case, but he learns he will be in the show and Eddie and Lou will be given producer credits.|$|E

500|$|Michael Mitz—who portrayed {{one of the}} {{payphone}} occupants—would {{return in}} season five as a photographer in [...] "The Puffy Shirt". The maître d' was portrayed by actor James Hong; {{it is one of}} the actor's most famous roles in the United States. (In fact, he had a small part in a season one episode of The Bob Newhart Show in 1972, portraying a man who is mistaken for a maître d'.) [...] Judy Kain—known for a recurring role on Married... with Children—guest-starred as Lorraine Catalano, the receptionist of Jerry's uncle. David Tress guest-starred as Mr. Cohen, a guest who enters the restaurant and receives a table without reservation, as he is good friends with the maître d'. Larry David's voice can be heard among the group of elderly people Elaine offers money to for one of their egg-rolls. Norman Brenner—who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons—appears as an extra; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> by the door of the restaurant when George, Jerry, and Elaine enter, and is still at the same spot when they leave.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music videos}} for [...] "Deuces" [...] and [...] "No Bullshit" [...] premiered simultaneously online on May 24, 2010, {{and both were}} directed by Colin Tilley. The video was shot in black-and-white, and is set at the Los Angeles River. It begins with a woman walking down the river's culvert. As the song begins, Brown, wearing a dark sleeveless jacket, sunglasses, and light-colored pants, sings his verse while standing against a car with Tyga and Kevin McCall. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing alone at the culvert, wearing a hooded jumper and skinny jeans. During the chorus, Brown is seen dancing in an underground tunnel. As Tyga raps his verse, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> on a graffitied concrete barrier, while Brown appears in the background. This scene is intercut with scenes of Tyga, Brown and McCall walking down a street with a lowrider driving slowly behind them. As the second chorus begins, earlier scenes from the video are intercut with each other. McCall then begins to rap his verse while leaning against a wall, which is then intercut with scenes of him rapping from previous settings of the video. During the final chorus of the song, more scenes of Brown dancing in the underground tunnel are shown.|$|E
500|$|When Principal Skinner {{tells the}} {{children}} at school that Valentine's Day is not a joke (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback in which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, [...] "Sending your chick a Valentine?", to which Johnny replies [...] "Yep", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain." [...] After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent {{in a letter to}} the show that read, [...] "I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback. Do you really think this was funny, this horrible experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening—the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran—"loved" [...] the sequence as well as the episode.|$|E

She stands up and the scene transitions to the singer walking down the stairs in a mansion, wearing a gown. It continues with Beyoncé, sitting alone at an arranged table for dinner, waiting for her love interest to come home. As she waits for him, at one point she angrily sweeps the crystal, dinnerware and candles from the table with her hands as he does not show up.

Other proverbs indicate human foolishness. A man fills in a pond after his calf has died. Just above the central figure of the blue-cloaked man another man carries daylight in a basket. Some of the figures seem to represent more than one figure of speech (whether this was Bruegel's intention or not is unknown), such as the man shearing a sheep in the centre bottom left of the picture. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> next to a man shearing a pig, so represents the expression [...] "One shears sheep and one shears pigs", meaning that one has the advantage over the other, but may also represent the advice [...] "Shear them but don't skin them", meaning make the most of available assets.|$|E
