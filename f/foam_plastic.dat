40|$|Plastics {{are used}} {{extensively}} as manufacturing mate-rials throughout the world. In particular, <b>foamed</b> <b>plastics</b> products, with high cell density and uniform cell sizes, offer superior mechanical properties (e. g., toughness[1] and fatigue life[2]) and improved thermal insulation[3] {{in comparison with}} solid plastics products. Applications of <b>foamed</b> <b>plastics</b> range from household commodities such as packaging and insulation materials, to advanced engineering products such as airplane and automotive parts with high strength-to-weight ratio. Additionally, <b>foamed</b> <b>plastic</b> products reduce material usage, which typically accounts for 50 to 70 % of total production cost.

40|$|Three heat {{resistant}} cross-linked PVC <b>foam</b> <b>plastics</b> were prepared and their performances {{were compared with}} universal cross-linked PVC structural foam. The results show that these three {{heat resistant}} foams have higher glass transition temperatures (close to 100 &# 176;C) than universal structural foam (83. 2 &# 176;C). Compared with the universal structural foam, the three heat resistant foams show much higher decomposition temperature and better chemical stability due to the crosslinking of PVC macromolecular chains. The heat distortion temperature (HDT) values of the three heat resistant <b>foam</b> <b>plastics</b> are just a little {{higher than that of}} universal structural foam. The three heat resistant <b>foam</b> <b>plastics</b> have good dimensional stability at 140 &# 176;C, and when used as core material can closely adhere to the face plates in medium temperature curing processes. Compared with universal structural foam, the three heat resistant <b>foam</b> <b>plastics</b> have slightly better mechanical properties...|$|R

5000|$|The usual {{method of}} display is in a glass-covered box, with the insects mounted on {{specially}} made non corrosive insect pins stuck into suitable <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> or paper covered cork {{at the bottom}} of the box. Common pins are not used. Very small insects may be pinned on [...] "minuten" [...] (very tiny headless pins) stuck into a block of <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> on a standard insect pin. Alternatively they may be glued onto a small piece of card on the pin. There are specific procedures for proper mounting that are used to show off the insects' essential characteristics. Techniques and equipment may be varied to deal with various species or requirements. For example, one or both of the wings of a beetle or grasshopper can be pulled open and fanned out to show the wing structure that otherwise would be hidden. At least the date and place of capture should be written or computer printed onto a piece of paper or card transfixed by the pin. This is called a data label.|$|E

50|$|The {{insulator}} {{surrounding the}} inner conductor may be solid plastic, a <b>foam</b> <b>plastic,</b> or air with spacers supporting the inner wire. The {{properties of the}} dielectric insulator determine some of the electrical properties of the cable. A common choice is a solid polyethylene (PE) insulator, used in lower-loss cables. Solid Teflon (PTFE) is also used as an insulator. Some coaxial lines use air (or some other gas) and have spacers to keep the inner conductor from touching the shield.|$|E
