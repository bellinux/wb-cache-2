5|$|Yuke's {{studios in}} Yokohama, Japan worked with WWE writers to create storylines {{for the season}} modes of each game. When WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 was {{released}} {{for more than one}} console, Yuke's had to port their original game codes that make up each game mode and graphic designs to a new game engine that supported the new consoles. When new features are added to WWE 2K games, developers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> new gaming codes for the features. Along with the features, the developers have to test the game for any errors. An improvement done yearly by Yuke's with each release of a WWE 2K game is the polygon count for the 3D models of the superstars in each game. Technical limitations had occurred through the series which lead the developers to adjust custom characters while loading. Beginning with WWE '12, promotion render art photos were used up to WWE 2K16; from WWE 2K17 on, the promotion render art was replaced with in-game rendering to accommodate created characters to lessen loading times.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E

25|$|Missionary {{work began}} in 1550 with an Augustinian mission in Xilitla, San Luis Potosí. However, like {{military}} incursions, evangelism would occur {{from outside the}} heart of the region and gradually move inwards with many failures. However, the challenge to the Spanish was not only the hostility of the native peoples, but also this area lacked cities or towns, or the social hierarchy that was taken advantage of in other areas of Mesoamerica. In this region, the Spanish would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> population centers.|$|E
25|$|On 30 March, the Constitutional Council, {{the highest}} {{constitutional}} authority, validated {{most of the}} law, along with its 8th article instituting the First Employment Contract. The law was considered {{to abide by the}} Constitution of France; the Constitutional Council didn't pronounce on the question of conformity to international and European law, which it is not empowered to consider. The Socialist deputies and senators who had deposed the legal recourse before the Constitutional Council notably claimed that the law was superseded by article 24 of the European social charter, which states that the employer must give a juridical motive before firing an employee, and against the International Labour Convention (n°158). Labor courts would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> jurisprudence concerning this point.|$|E

While trying {{to dispose of}} Alejandro's car, Bree and Gabrielle inadvertently attract Chuck's attention and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a series of elaborate lies to avoid him finding out the truth. Later, Bree receives a note reading, [...] "I know what you did. It makes me sick. I'm going to tell." [...] This {{is the same as}} the letter Mary Alice received before killing herself.|$|E

500|$|Stone was not {{interested}} in making a film about Garrison's life, but rather the story behind the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. He also bought the film rights to Jim Marrs' book Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy. One of the filmmaker's primary goals with JFK was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission's report that he believed was [...] "a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> another one, a counter-myth." [...] Even though Marrs' book collected many theories, Stone was hungry for more and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent Yale University graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on Born on the Fourth of July. Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.|$|E
500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E
500|$|The {{scale of}} the project was enormous: By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their {{original}} home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps. This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, would clearly be too much to fit into the proposed 6 volumes. Gygax decided he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973 by amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes. However, neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans. Because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot, they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps. These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure their independent work would dovetail. All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year-old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece. Recreating the city too would be a challenge. [...] Although Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> most of the city from scratch while still maintaining the [...] "look and feel" [...] of his original.|$|E

2500|$|The source {{material}} for the two seasons of Nero Wolfe was written between 1939 (Over My Dead Body) and 1966 (Death of a Doxy), with most stories written in the 1950s. Jaffe said he chose {{to stick with the}} era for the adaptations [...] "because I thought there was so much style that people could identify with and that we could play off. Ultimately, {{the most important thing is}} that the audience remain removed from the show by three or four decades. You can't do what Paramount did and update it and make the language modern. The whole thing doesn't make sense, because the tonal idiom doesn't play in the modern world.

2500|$|Most {{philosophers}} {{that think}} goods <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> desirable mental states {{also say that}} goods are experiences of self-aware beings. These philosophers often distinguish the experience, which they call an intrinsic good, from the things that seem to cause the experience, which they call [...] "inherent" [...] goods. Failing to distinguish the two leads to a subject-object problem {{in which it is}} not clear who is evaluating what object.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{experience}} of a death, persons often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> new meaning of their loss. Interventions that promote meaning-making may be beneficial to grievers, as some interventions have been found to improve both mental health and physical health.

But what if we are a bit wrong in creating such impulses? Adding small perturbations to the equations and solving them numerically, it is possible to show that mono-dimensional solitons are stable. They are often referred as [...] solitons, meaning that they are limited in one dimension (x or t, as we have seen) and propagate in another one (z).|$|E

2500|$|Estriol {{was part}} of the United States Pharmacopeia before FDA {{approval}} was needed for its use. Its approval was grandfathered in by the FDA until 2008 when the agency banned its use, stating that manufacturers of estriol would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a new application and estriol would be treated as a new drug. [...] Its use is not approved by Health Canada; estriol is not available as a pharmaceutical preparation in Canada or the United States, but is a commonly prescribed conventional treatment in other countries and is available as a cream or vaginal suppository in the United Kingdom and the European Union.
