50|$|Jeppson {{was born}} on July 1, 1844 in Hoganas, Sweden. Jeppson’s father was a {{carpenter}} {{and several of his}} ancestors were mechanics. Jeppson went to school in his birthplace, but at the age of 12 went to work in a pottery and brick factory. At the age of 16 Jeppson learned how to manufacture architectural ornaments. He worked in the pottery and brick factory until the age of 24. Around the age of 25 he decided to try his luck to America. When he arrived in America he gained employment with Norton in Worcester, Ma, which at this time only produced pottery. Jeppson became very skilled at his profession and earned the highest salaries. In 1873 Jeppson managed to produce an artificial emery stone. He continued his experiments and in 1885 the Norton <b>Emery</b> <b>Wheel</b> Company was created with Jeppson as one of the creators. Jeppson became the company’s first plant manager. Jeppson then {{went on to become the}} Chief Engineer of the Norton <b>Emery</b> <b>Wheel</b> Company. He maintained this position until his death in 1920.|$|E
50|$|The Emory Wheel {{began in}} 1919 as a weekly {{newspaper}} with its offices {{located in the}} journalism department. The name is wordplay on an <b>emery</b> <b>wheel,</b> a sharpening device. An editorial published in {{the first issue of}} The Wheel explains that the newspaper will strive to sharpen the intellect of the University community. The newspaper, initially chartered by the Student Government Association, was originally meant to promote Emory's varsity level athletics and successfully lobbied to create an Emory track team.|$|E
5000|$|After {{working for}} the Seth Thomas Clock company in Thomaston, in 1886 Norton became Assistant Engineer with the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company at Providence, Rhode Island, {{redesigning}} their universal grinding machine. In 1890 he became {{a partner in the}} newly established Leland, Faulconer & Norton Company at Detroit, Michigan, designing and constructing machine tools. Returning to Brown & Sharpe in 1896, he designed a grinding machine with larger and heavier grinding wheels, capable of supplying machine parts for the emerging automobile industry. In 1900 he left Brown & Sharpe to found the Norton Grinding Company in Worcester, Massachusetts with support from the Norton <b>Emery</b> <b>Wheel</b> Company (founded by an unrelated Norton); the two firms merged in 1919, with Norton as their Chief Engineer until 1934, when he became their Consulting Engineer. On April 8, 1925, he was a recipient of The John Scott Medal and Premium for his invention of [...] "accurate grinding devices of high power".|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} was Lithodipyra (also called Coade stone), a ceramic created by Eleanor Coade (1733-1821), and produced from 1769 to 1833. Later, in 1844, Frederick Ransome created a Patent Siliceous Stone, which comprised sand and powdered flint in an alkaline solution. By heating it in an enclosed high temperature steam boiler the siliceous particles were bound together and could be moulded or worked into filtering slabs, vases, tombstones, decorative architectural work, <b>emery</b> <b>wheels</b> and grindstones.|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} is presented which {{allows us to}} measure total increases in epidermal wet weight {{on the back of}} a mouse during epidermal regeneration, thus for the first time permitting us to determine the kinetics of increase of epidermal mass during epidermal regeneration. Within 2 days after removal of the epidermis by abrasion with an <b>emery</b> <b>wheel,</b> in mice in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle, the epidermis begins to be regenerated from the cells of the underlying resting hair follicles. By Day 3 epidermal wet weight is 70 % of normal. By Day 4 it is 1. 97 times normal and reaches its peak of 3. 8 times normal by 5 days. Associated with this increase in epidermal wet weight is a two times increase in the number of epidermal cells per millimeter of interfollicular epidermis. However, the change in the number of cells is not uniform for all types of epidermal cells. Suprabasal cells increase 4. 6 times by 7 days, whereas the basal cells actually decrease to 60 % of normal levels. Colchicine mitotic count is increased almost 18 -fold by Day 3 and remains above control levels for the rest of the experimental period. Many mitoses appear in the suprabasal layers...|$|E
60|$|The Reeves Building was as {{fireproof}} as a {{rock and}} as efficient as a typewriter; fourteen stories of yellow pressed brick, with clean, upright, unornamented lines. It {{was filled with the}} offices of lawyers, doctors, agents for machinery, for <b>emery</b> <b>wheels,</b> for wire fencing, for mining-stock. Their gold signs shone on the windows. The entrance was too modern to be flamboyant with pillars; it was quiet, shrewd, neat. Along the Third Street side were a Western Union Telegraph Office, the Blue Delft Candy Shop, Shotwell's Stationery Shop, and the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company.|$|R
50|$|Finishing; Depending on the {{intended}} use of the piece a blacksmith, may finish it {{in a number of}} Ways. A simple jig that the smith might only use a few times in the shop it may get the minimum of finishing a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush. Files can be employed to bring a piece to final shape, remove burrs and sharp edges, and smooth the surface. Grinding stones abrasive paper and <b>emery</b> <b>wheels</b> can further shape, smooth and polish the surface. Finishes include {{but are not limited to}} paint, varnish, bluing, borrowing, oil and wax.|$|R
50|$|In 1844 Frederick invented an {{artificial}} sandstone, using sand and powdered flint in an alkaline solution. By heating {{it in an}} enclosed high temperature steam boiler the siliceous particles were bound together and could be moulded or worked. With properties equivalent to natural stone, it found applications as filtering slabs, vases, tombstones, decorative architectural work, <b>emery</b> <b>wheels</b> and grindstones. Ransome founded the Patent Siliceous Stone Company in 1852 {{in order to produce}} and sell the stone, with an illustrious group of backers that included Charles Darwin, and the Patent Concrete Stone Company in 1865. However, the stone fell out of use, in favour of Portland cement-based concrete, which could be more simply cast on-site.|$|R
25|$|In 1875 his {{attention}} {{was called to}} the dressing of fur skins, such as buffalo hides. Using existing processes, it took from two to {{two and a half}} days of hard labor to bring a large hide down to a flexiable state. When House claimed that he could make a machine that could dress four hides or more a day, they were astonished, as they claimed no tool could stand up to those dry hides for even ten minutes. To meet the challenge, House developed a rotary plane with a ring knife that could be fed as it moved, with a set of small <b>emery</b> <b>wheels</b> each side of the knife so that it was sharpened on every revolution. The plane was universally hung and counterbalanced so it weighed nothing in the hand of the operator, though it was driven by power from the engine. On a wager, the first operator finished fifty hides in ten hours.|$|R
