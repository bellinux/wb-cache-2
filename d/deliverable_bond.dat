40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a model for}} pricing the quality option embedded in the Treasury bond futures contract. Since the option value is set relative to a large family of <b>deliverable</b> <b>bond</b> prices, {{it is important for}} the theoretical bond prices to match up to the observed prices. Hence an arbitrage-based model is used where the forward rate process is initialized at its current observable value. A model for valuing the quality option in an otherwise identical forward contract is also established. This permits the quality option and marking to market costs to be separately quantified. Support is provided for the common practice of pricing Treasury bond futures contracts as forward contracts with an embedded forward quality option. Copyright 1992 Blackwell Publishers. ...|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} the cheapest bond {{in a basket}} of <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds</b> against a futures contract, implied repo rate is computed for each bond; the bond with the highest repo rate is the cheapest. It is the cheapest because it has the lowest initial value to yield a higher return provided it is delivered with the stated futures price.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{theoretical}} problem of evaluating the quality option embedded in interest rate futures contracts. We use the martingale properties of the prices of interest-rate contingent claims under different probability measures in order to derive solutions {{for the value of}} futures and options on futures, accounting for the quality option and assuming a square-root model for the short rate. The futures pricing formula boils down to a simple linear combination of the futures prices of the zero-coupon bonds which constitute the <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds.</b> A European call option on such a futures can be rewritten as an option on a single futures in which the strike price is 'curved', i. e. it is a decreasing function of the short rate. futures, options, quality option, term structure, martingale pricing Cherubini, Esposito,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} rise and fall of the first {{financial}} futures market in China. We compare the characteristics in the Chinese Government bond futures market with those in the US T-bond futures market. They differ in market design and structure, market governance, margin requirements, position limits, delivery process, and the way in which the settlement price is calculated. Furthermore, with a unique dataset, we show that prior to maturities of government bond futures, traders began to accumulate significant amounts of long positions for several selected contracts without the intention to offset, forcing short position holders to either purchase <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds</b> or offset futures at highly inflated prices, causing higher market volatility and price disequilibrium in both spot and futures markets. Arbitrage opportunity arises and the market eventually collapses. The lessons learned from the suspension of the Chinese Government bond futures market offer an invaluable learning experience.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three essays {{that study}} three distinct derivative contracts. The first essay proves, in a model-free framework, that early exercise of futures-style options on futures, whether calls or puts, is suboptimal. The result is robust to transaction costs, liquidity constraints and collateral requirements. Assuming a frictionless market, three additional model-free results are obtained: (i) put-call parity, (ii) equality of time values of puts and calls {{with the same}} strike and expiration, and (iii) positivity of time value before expiration. The second essay develops a new invoice price formula for Treasury bond futures contracts as a more effective alternative to the current conversion factor system. The equilibrium "cheapest to deliver" and futures price at expiration are identified. The empirical part of the essay documents that the new function dramatically improves {{the ability of the}} futures invoice price to approximate the market prices of the corresponding <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds.</b> The third essay offers a regression-based empirical study of the determinants of credit default swap premia. Leverage, volatility and interest rates are found to account for {{a large percentage of the}} variation of premia. A principal components analysis of the regression residuals finds no evidence of a missing factor. The results achieved for credit default premia more closely corroborate structural models of credit risk than those obtained by Collin-Dufresne et al. (2001) for corporate bond yield spreads...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the implicit delivery option in a bond futures contract {{and its effect}} on the contract's hedging effectiveness. Bond futures are widely used in hedging of government debt securities. In this thesis, the delivery option arises from the futures seller's right to choose which <b>bond,</b> among several <b>deliverable</b> <b>bonds,</b> will be delivered at the delivery date. To the extent this delivery option has value it should be reflected in a reduced futures price, because the buyer of futures must be compensated for the freedom of choice the seller has in choosing the asset to be delivered. The objective of the study is to price the futures contract and its delivery option in a theoretically consistent framework. In particular, the difference in valuing the option under constant interest rate and under stochastic term structure will be emphasized. Secondly, this paper studies whether the delivery option harms or helps the hedging effectiveness of the futures contract. Also, the effectiveness of the widely used conversion factor hedging method is questioned in the stochastic interest rate environment. The base for modelling the delivery option is the formula generating value for an exchange option. This formula was first introduced by Margrabe (1978) and is an extension of the Black-Scholes solution (1973) to option pricing problem. The delivery option will be modelled in the fixed interest rate environment (Hemler 1990) and under stochastic term structure (Lin and Paxson 1995). The stochastic term structure of interest rates will be represented with a term structure model by Heath, Jarrow and Morton (1992), although only the intuition of the HJM -model will be presented. The result of this paper is that the delivery option has to be included to the futures pricing formula and the theoretical equilibrium price of the futures contract with the delivery option can be obtained on a theoretically consistent basis. Secondly, there were no evidence that the delivery option would significantly harm the hedging effectiveness of the Euro-Bund futures contract. Theoretical drawbacks of the conversion factor hedging method appeared only, when hedging short-term bonds with the 10 -year Bund futures con-tract. Endast sammandrag.
