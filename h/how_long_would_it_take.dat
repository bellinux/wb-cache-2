2500|$|Carlton Blanchard: {{played by}} William Hickey, Carlton {{is an old}} man with a high-pitched nasal voice whose {{outwardly}} meek yet privately demanding behavior causes everyone who meets him to shudder at his coming. He is also known for asking bizarre questions such as [...] "If you were to carpet Florida, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to vacuum it?" [...] and [...] "If a monkey were to bite you, what kind of drugs do you suppose they'd give you?". He annoys Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he wins a charity contest sponsored by Sandpiper and demands to be flown to Las Cruces, New Mexico, far beyond the scope of Sandpiper's routes.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2014, Savant made {{an error}} in a word problem. [...] The {{question}} was: If two people could complete a project in six hours, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> each of them to do identical projects on their own, given that one took four hours longer than the other? Her answer was 10 hours and 14 hours, reasoning that if together it took them 6 hours to complete a project, then the total effort was 12 [...] "man hours". If they then each do a separate full project, the total effort needed would be 24 hours, so the answer (10+14) needed to add up to 24 with a difference of 4. However, this {{ignores the fact that}} the two people get different amounts of work done per hour: if they are working jointly on a project, they can maximize their combined productivity, but if they split the work in half, one person will finish sooner and can't fully contribute. This subtlety causes the problem to require solving a quadratic equation and thus to not have a rational solution, instead the answer is approximately 10.32 and 14.32 hours (or more precisely, [...] and [...] ). Savant later acknowledged the error.|$|E

6000|$|All were {{calculating the}} {{distance}} to the shore. Between them and the water was a slight hollow, overgrown with brushwood and vines. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to find a path through that hollow? ...|$|E

6000|$|In every fort and navy-yard all was activity; the {{hammering}} of iron went on {{by day and}} by night; {{but what}} was to be done when the great ironclads of England hammered upon our defences? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be before the American flag would be seen no more upon the high seas? ...|$|R
60|$|But Rosamund turned {{sick and}} faint, {{and even the}} brethren paled. This man was terrible indeed--if he were a man and not a devil--and they were in his power. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be, they wondered, before they also were bidden to walk that gulf? Only Wulf swore in his heart that if he went by this road Sinan should go with him.|$|R
60|$|Body--The {{ship was}} a new body for him. He had traded in the old dying body, {{withered}} and frail, for this hulking frame of metal and plastic, turbines and rocket jets. He was strong, now. Strong and big. The new body was more powerful than a thousand human bodies. But <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> last him? The average life of a cruiser was only ten years. With careful handling he might get twenty out of it, before some essential part failed {{and there was no}} way to replace it.|$|R

6000|$|Amyntas cowered {{down in the}} boat. He gave up hope of life, and {{lay there}} for long hours {{awaiting}} his end; the water carried the skiff along swiftly, silently. The darkness was so heavy that the columns were invisible, heavy drops fell into {{the water from the}} roof. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> last? <b>Would</b> the boat go on till he died, and then speed on for ever? He thought of the others who had gone into the cavern. Were there other boats hurrying eternally along the heavy waters, bearing cold skeletons? ...|$|R
6000|$|As regards Cetywayo himself, I cannot {{share the}} opinion of {{those who think that}} he would be {{personally}} dangerous. He has learnt his lesson, and would not be anxious to try conclusions with the English again; indeed, I believe he would prove a staunch ally. But supposing him re-established on the throne, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be before a revolution, or the hand of the assassin, {{to say nothing of the}} ordinary chances of nature, put an end to him, and how do we know that his successor in power would share his views? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> have lasted? The {{first moment}} that Daubeny got {{the upper hand}} I should have fallen lower than I have fallen now.

[...] To the very last, however, Mr. Monk {{continued}} to express his opinion that Phineas would come back, declaring that he had known no instance {{of a young man}} who had made himself useful in Parliament, and then had been allowed to leave it in early life.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Carnally. [...] "You want to {{remember}} that the moment you give us any cause for suspicion you get fired. Now what about your partners? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> them to make the cache?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} teacher, [...] "but here are {{fifteen or twenty}} boys tardy this morning; now <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> me to hear their excuses, and {{understand}} each case thoroughly, so that I could really tell whether they were tardy from good reasons or not?" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{conviction}} of this sad yet natural fact came to Mrs Jo with a pang, for she felt how utterly hopeless such a longing was; since light and darkness were not farther apart than snow-white Bess and sin-stained Dan. No dream {{of such a}} thing disturbed the young girl, as her entire unconsciousness plainly showed. But <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be before the eloquent eyes betrayed the truth? And then what disappointment for Dan, what dismay for Bess, who was as cool and high and pure as her own marbles, and shunned all thought of love with maidenly reserve.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not occur}} to her {{that there could be}} any {{possibility}} of the scheme for her rescue succeeding; as to that she felt no more hopeful than before, but it seemed to take away the sense of utter loneliness that she before felt that someone should be interesting himself in her fate. Perhaps there would be more than a mere verbal message next time; <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be before she heard again? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> a respite had she before that wretch came to see her? Doubtless he had heard that she was ill. She would remain so. She would starve herself. Her weakness seemed to her her best protection.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't stop {{to explain}} myself now," [...] Mr. Franklin went on. [...] "I {{can only tell}} you that the Indians have {{certainly}} stolen the Diamond. Give me a letter of introduction," [...] says he, addressing my lady, [...] "to one of the magistrates at Frizinghall--merely telling him that I represent your interests and wishes, and let me ride off with it instantly. Our chance of catching the thieves may depend on our not wasting one unnecessary minute." [...] (Nota bene: Whether it was the French side or the English, the right side of Mr. Franklin seemed to be uppermost now. The only question was, <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> last?) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] agreed Murray. [...] "And {{no doubt}} they've had that {{district}} searched. But {{you must remember}} we're dealing with remarkably clever people, who wouldn't {{go to work in}} the obvious way. Now, suppose some news was gathered about Rosyth, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> a powerful car to bring it here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that's good! Well, anyhow, {{that was}} in his mind. Let me see the three strips. No finger impressions--no! Well, he carried over this one first, and he copied it. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> him to do that, using every {{possible}} contraction? A quarter of an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and seized the next. He {{was in the midst}} of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat--VERY hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there. You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Northcott {{smiled at}} her fears. He {{maintained}} that the one fault of the book was that the style was too good--for a novel. It was not well, he said, to write too well. On the contrary, a certain roughness and carelessness had their advantage, especially with critical readers, and served to show {{the hand of the}} professed novelist who, sick or well, in the spirit or not, fills his twenty-four or thirty-six quarto pages per diem. A polished style, on the other hand, exhibited care and looked amateurish. He had no very great opinion of this kind of writing, and advised her {{to get rid of the}} delusion that when she wrote a novel she made literature. To clinch the argument, he proceeded to put a series of uncomfortable questions to her. Did she expect to live by novel-writing? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> her to write three volumes? How long could she maintain existence on the market price of a three-volume novel? It was clear that, unless she was prepared to live on bread-and-cheese, she could not afford to re-write anything. As for the reviewers, if they found her book tiresome, they would dismiss it in a couple of colourless or perhaps contemptuous paragraphs; if they found it interesting, they would recommend it; but about her religious opinions expressed in it they would not think it necessary to say anything.|$|E
60|$|Mackintosh {{shrugged his}} shoulders. He {{had given the}} man full warning. If he did not heed it that was his own lookout. Walker put on his hat and went out. Mackintosh began to read; but then he thought of something; perhaps <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be as well to have his own {{whereabouts}} quite clear. He crossed over to the kitchen and, inventing some pretext, talked {{for a few minutes}} with the cook. Then he got out the gramophone and put a record on it, but while it ground out its melancholy tune, some comic song of a London music-hall, his ear was strained for a sound away there in the night. At his elbow the record reeled out its loudness, the words were raucous, but notwithstanding he seemed to be surrounded by an unearthly silence. He heard the dull roar of the breakers against the reef. He heard the breeze sigh, far up, in the leaves of the coconut trees. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be? It was awful.|$|R
60|$|As {{he ended}} she sighed, {{wondering}} <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be before {{he told her}} what she knew was in his heart.|$|R

6000|$|Again: I {{will ask}} you, my friends, {{if you were}} elected members of the legislature, {{what would be the}} first thing you would have to do before {{entering}} upon your duties? Swear to support the Constitution of the United States. Suppose you believe as Judge Douglas does, that the Constitution of the United States guarantees to your neighbour the right to hold slaves in that Territory,--that they are his property,--how can you clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is necessary to enable him to enjoy that property? What do you understand by supporting the Constitution of a State or of the United States? Is it not to give such constitutional helps to the rights established by that Constitution as may be practically needed? Can you, if you swear to support the Constitution and believe that the Constitution establishes a right, clear your oath without giving it support? Do you support the Constitution if, knowing or believing there is a right established under it which needs specific legislation, you withhold that legislation? Do you not violate and disregard your oath? I can conceive of nothing plainer in the world. There can be nothing in the words [...] "support the Constitution," [...] if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any right established under the Constitution. And what I say here will hold with still more force against the Judge's doctrine of [...] "unfriendly legislation." [...] How could you, having sworn to support the Constitution, and believing that it guaranteed the right to hold slaves in the Territories, assist in legislation intended to defeat that right? That would be violating your own view of the Constitution. Not only so, but if you were to do so, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void? Not a moment.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} he {{returned}} and, as he was this time alone, he bestowed his conversation upon us with great liberality. He prided himself on his intelligence; asked us if we knew the school ma'am. HE didn't think much of her, anyway. He had tried her, he had. He had put a question to her. If a tree a hundred feet high were to fall a foot a day, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to fall right down? She {{had not been able}} to solve the problem. [...] "She don't know nothing," [...] he opined. He told us how a friend of his kept a school with a revolver, and chuckled mightily over that; his friend could teach school, he could. All the time he kept chewing gum and spitting. He would stand a while looking down; and then he would toss back his shock of hair, and laugh hoarsely, and spit, and bring forward a new subject. A man, he told us, who bore a grudge against him, had poisoned his dog. [...] "That was a low thing for a man to do now, wasn't it? It wasn't like a man, that, nohow. But I got even with him: I pisoned HIS dog." [...] His clumsy utterance, his rude embarrassed manner, set a fresh value on the stupidity of his remarks. I do not think I ever appreciated the meaning of two words until I knew Irvine--the verb, loaf, and the noun, oaf; between them, they complete his portrait. He could lounge, and wriggle, and rub himself against the wall, and grin, and be more in everybody's way than any other two people that I ever set my eyes on. Nothing that he did became him; and yet you were conscious that he was one of your own race, that his mind was cumbrously at work, revolving the problem of existence like a quid of gum, and in his own cloudy manner enjoying life, and passing judgment on his fellows. Above all things, he was delighted with himself. You would not have thought it, from his uneasy manners and troubled, struggling utterance; but he loved himself to the marrow, and was happy and proud like a peacock on a rail.|$|E
