Patents were granted in many countries, such as US Patent 2470307 and GB 617870. [...] Widespread use led to considerable royalty income.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Vibrotactile devices {{suffer from}} poor energy efficiency, arising from a {{mismatch}} between the device and {{the impedance of}} the human skin. This results in over-sized motors and excessive power consumption, and prevents development of more sophisticated, miniaturized and low-power mobile tactile devices. Herein, I investigate the feasibility of improving the energy transfer by placing a passive amplifier between the skin and the motor, dubbed an <b>impedance</b> <b>adapter.</b> I simulate {{the effects of this}} <b>impedance</b> <b>adapter</b> using a mathematical model, and evaluate its effect on skin displacement and a parameter I call skin stimulus. Skin stimulus is introduced as a measure of the perceptive effects of a haptic system, and is used to compare results between systems with an <b>impedance</b> <b>adapter</b> and those without. Functional prototypes are constructioned, and the design is experimentally verified. This system is able to quadruple the motion of the skin without increasing power consumption, and produce sensations equivalent to a standard system while consuming 1 / 2 of the power. By greatly reducing the size and power constraints of vibration motors, this technology offers a means to realize more sophisticated, smaller haptic devices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Line Impedance Stabilization Network (LISN) {{is mostly}} used in {{electromagnetic}} compatibility for conducted and radiated radio-frequency emission and susceptibility tests. The input impedance {{is one of}} the most important parameters in LISN calibration. To measure the input <b>impedance,</b> an <b>adapter</b> is required to connect the Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to the Equipment Under Test (EUT) port of the LISN. For test laboratories, it is of best interest to perform this calibration with high accuracy. Until now the impact of the adapter has not been clearly demonstrated theoretically. We present the design of an adapter and its associated modelling, a method for removing its impact from the measurement, the theoretical error on magnitude and phase input impedance. ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{continuous}} decrease {{of the cost}} of solar cells, there is an increasing interest in photovoltaic (PV) system applications. Electric motors powered by solar-cell generators {{are one of the most}} important applications, such as in water pumping systems. This paper investigates a photovoltaic-electro mechanic chain, composed of a PV generator, an <b>impedance</b> <b>adapter</b> DC-DC converter, a storage battery and a vector controlled induction machine. The PV generator is forced to operate at its maximum power point by using an appropriate search algorithm, and a balance between battery charge and motor supply is also ensured in all insolation conditions. Simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of such an approach. PV generator <b>Impedance</b> <b>adapter</b> Storage battery Vector control and induction machine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A PZT-type material, doped with niobium and lithium was {{prepared}} by the ceramic technique. The microstructure of the sintered material at 1280 oC was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy and by X-ray diffraction. Dielectric and piezoelectric properties were measured. The good planar properties of the material {{made it possible to}} obtain ceramic disks with a strong radial mode. Two such disks, glued together, with opposed polarisation constitute a bimorf element, which successfully converts the radial mode into a flexural one. At the center of the bimorf a conical acoustical <b>impedance</b> <b>adapter</b> is fixed in order to increase the frontal acoustical emission of the device. This ultrasonic device provides a broad â€“ band, high acoustical emission, and is suitable to work as a high efficiency ultrasonic siren. It can be used in intruder alarm devices, ultrasonic telemeters...|$|E
