40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the cosmic-ray flux is important in understanding the Interstellar Medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. This distribution can be analyzed by studying different molecular species along different sight lines whose abundances {{are sensitive to the}} cosmic-ray ionization rate. Recently several groups have reported an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse clouds compared to the standard value, zeta(average) = 2. 5 e- 17 s^- 1, measured toward dense molecular clouds. In an earlier work we reported an enhancement in the cosmic ray rate of 20 towards HD 185418. McCall et al. have reported enhancements of 48 towards zeta Persei based on the observed abundance of H$_{ 3 }^+ while Le Petit et al. found a cosmic ray enhancement of ~ 10 to be consistent with their models for this same sight line. Here we revisit zeta Persei and perform a detailed calculation using a self-consistent treatment of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chemistry,</b> grain physics, energy and ionization balance, and excitation physics. We show that the value of zeta deduced from the H$_{ 3 }^+$ column density in the diffuse region of the sightline depends strongly on the properties of the grains because they remove free electrons and change the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chemistry.</b> The observations are largely consistent with a cosmic ray enhancement of 40, with several diagnostics indicating higher values. This underscores the importance of a full treatment of grain physics in studies of interstellar chemistry. Comment: 25 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

We compare our results, which include a detailed cooling function, molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chemistry</b> and a limited C and O chemistry, with those previously obtained for decaying isothermal turbulence. After an initial phase of shock formation, power-law decay regimes are uncovered, as in the isothermal case. We find that the turbulence decays faster than in the isothermal case because the average Mach number remains higher, owing to the radiative cooling. The total thermal energy, initially raised {{by the introduction of}} turbulence, decays only a little more slowly than the kinetic energy. We discover that molecule reformation, as the fast turbulence decays, is several times faster than that predicted for a non-turbulent medium. This is caused by moderate speed shocks which sweep through a large fraction of the volume, compressing the gas and dust. Through reformation, the molecular density and molecular column appear as complex patterns of filaments, clumps and some diffuse structure.

We confirm that the mechanism of positive feedback of ionizing radiation on star formation in mini-galaxies proposed by Ricotti, Gnedin, & Shull (2002) can be efficient despite a significant flux of metagalactic photo-dissociating radiation. We derive critical fluxes for the Lyman-Werner background radiation sufficient to prevent the collapse of gas in mini-galaxies {{as a function of the}} virial mass of the halo and redshift. In our model, the formation of mini-galaxies in defunct HII regions is most efficient at large redshifts (z> 15) and/or for large local gas overdensity delta> 10.

CEMA is adopted to provide fundamental insights into the ignition process by identifying controlling species and elementary reactions at different locations and times. It is found that at the first ignition delay, low-temperature chemistry (LTC) represented by the isomerization of alkylperoxy radical, chain branching reactions of keto-hydroperoxide, and H-atom abstraction of n -heptane is predominant for both RCCI and SCCI combustion. In addition, explosion index and participation index analyses together with conditional means on temperature verify that low-temperature heat release (LTHR) from local mixtures with relatively-high n -heptane concentration occurs more intensively in RCCI combustion than in SCCI combustion, which ultimately advances the overall RCCI combustion and distributes its heat release rate over time.

40|$|MILD {{combustion}} {{is a new}} combustion technology which promises {{an enhanced}} efficiency and reduced emission of pollutants. It {{is characterized by a}} high degree of preheating and dilution of the reactants. Since the temperature of the reactants is higher than that of autoignition, a complex interplay between turbulent mixing, molecular transport and chemical kinetics occurs. In order to reveal the fundamental reaction structures of MILD combustion, the process of a cold methane–hydrogen fuel jet issuing in a hot diluted coflow and the subsequent ignition process is modeled by direct numerical simulation of autoigniting mixing layers using detailed chemistry and transport models. Detailed analysis of one-dimensional laminar mixing layers shows that the ignition process is dominated by <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chemistry</b> and that non-unity Lewis number effects are of the utmost importance for modeling of autoignition. High scalar dissipation rates in mixing layers delay the autoignition time, but have a negligible effect on the chemical pathway followed during ignition. This supports the idea of using homogeneous reactor simulations for the construction of chemistry look-up tables. Simulations of two-dimensional turbulent mixing layers confirm the effect of scalar dissipation rate on autoignition time. The turbulence–chemistry interaction is limited under the investigated conditions, because the reaction layer lies {{at the edge of the}} mixing layer due to the very small value of the stoichiometric mixture fraction. When the oxidizer stream is more diluted, the autoignition time is delayed, allowing the developing turbulence to interact more with the ignition chemistry.

40|$|Optically-based {{hydrogen}} sensors {{promise to}} deliver an added level of safety as hydrogen and fuel cell technologies enter the mainstream. More importantly, they offer reduced power consumption and lower cost, which are desirable for mass production {{applications such as}} automobiles and consumer appliances. This program addressed two of the major challenges previously identified in porous optrode-based optical hydrogen sensors: sensitivity to moisture (ambient humidity), and interference from the oxygen in air. Polymer coatings to inhibit moisture and oxygen were developed in conjunction with newer and novel <b>hydrogen</b> sensing <b>chemistries.</b> The results showed {{that it is possible}} to achieve sensitive hydrogen detection and rapid response with minimal interference from oxygen and humidity. As a result of this work, a new and more exciting avenue of investigation was developed: the elimination of the porous optrode and deposition of the sensor chemistry directly into the polymer film. Initial results have been promising, and open up a wider range of potential applications from extended optical fiber sensing networks, to simple plastic "stickers" for use around the home and office...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the origin of}} metabolism and biopolymer synthesis we investigated the energy sources that drive anabolic metabolism. We found that biosynthesis of amino acids and lipids from sugars is driven bz the free energy of redox disproportionation of carbon (see discussion or next page). The indispensable role of sugar disproportionation in the biosynthesis of amino acids and lipids suggests that {{the origin of life}} uses the same chemical engine, and was therefore based on nonenzymatic redox disproportionation reactions of sugars that occurred in the presence o ammonia and <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide. The <b>chemistry</b> of this 'metabolic' model of the origin of life is described...|$|R
50|$|HDDA-derived benzynes {{have also}} been shown to dehydrogenate {{saturated}} alkanes to form alkenes. In the absence of external trapping reagents, the benzyne intermediate can abstract vicinal (<b>chemistry)</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atoms from a suitable donor, often the reaction solvent (such as tetrahydrofuran or cyclooctane). This desaturates the donor alkane, forming an alkene, and traps the benzyne to a dihydrobenzenoid product. Isotopic labelling and computational studies suggest that the double hydrogen transfer mechanism occurs by a concerted pathway and that the rate of reaction is highly dependent on the conformation of the alkane donor. This reaction can be used to access 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted aromatic rings, a substitution pattern that can be difficult to access through other synthetic methodology.|$|R
