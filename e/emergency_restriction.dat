In {{order to}} deal with the urgent public {{security}} incidents timely, to meet the requirements of the shortest emergency time, to consume the least emergency resources and rescue points, it’s necessary to achieve a compromised site selection scheme that reflects a decision maker’s preference on time and cost, in the decision about a city’s layout of fire station is to probe into the site selection of safe emergency station under the <b>emergency</b> <b>restrictions.</b> This research used an improved heuristics to explore the solving of combination model about multi-rescue points under the limitation of time and resource, provided the <b>emergency</b> <b>restrictions</b> and a cost model about establishment of the safety emergency facilities, and proved the correctness of the model solution method theoretically. In a limited emergency time, this paper analyzed and obtained selection method on emergency service facility points.

40|$|Urban {{bulk water}} systems supply water with high {{reliability}} and, {{in the event}} of extreme drought, must avoid catastrophic economic and social collapse. In view of the deep uncertainty about future climate change, it is vital that robust solutions be found that secure urban bulk water systems against extreme drought. To tackle this challenge an approach was developed integrating: 1) a stochastic model of multi-site streamflow conditioned on future climate change scenarios.; 2) Monte Carlo simulation of the urban bulk water system incorporated into a robust optimization framework and solved using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.; and 3) a comprehensive decision space including operating rules, investment in new sources and source substitution and a drought contingency plan with multiple actions with increasingly severe economic and social impact. A case study demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for a complex urban bulk water supply system. The primary objective was to minimize the expected present worth cost arising from infrastructure investment, system operation and the social cost of "normal" and <b>emergency</b> <b>restrictions.</b> By introducing a second objective which minimizes either the difference in present worth cost between the driest and wettest future climate change scenarios or the present worth cost for driest climate scenario, the trade-off between efficiency and robustness was identified. The results show that a significant change in investment and operating strategy can occur when the decision maker expresses a stronger preference for robustness and that this depends on the adopted robustness measure. Moreover, solutions are not only impacted by the degree of uncertainty about future climate change but also by the stress imposed on the system and the range of available options...|$|R

40|$|In the Aveyron {{watershed}} (South-Western France), {{where the}} agricultural economy mainly relies on irrigated productions (maize and fruits), engaging changes in quantitative water management is socially challenging. The watershed {{suffers from a}} structural misbalance between the water demand and the water offer, and recurring crises in the low-flow period lead to <b>emergency</b> <b>restrictions</b> of use. This situation tenses competing stakeholder positions and erodes the social-ecological system’s resilience. Characterizing and valuing options for change can support decision-making. Nonetheless, the various expert assessments that flourished as answers to political incentives for a better management of watershed {{did not succeed in}} bringing out socially-accepted solutions. We hypothesize that expert judgments (alone) cannot frame problems that also arise from colliding values and interests. Hence we built a spatialized multi-actor multi-criteria assessment method in order to map out matches and mismatches between the people involved and between the stakes relevant to them. This method proceeds through various steps: 1) Problem structuring: relevant stakeholders are identified; criteria and scenarios are defined following a bottom-up approach; 2) Definition and evaluation of a set of indicators for each scenario, using mainly model simulations of water management; 3) Mapping out stakeholder judgments; 4) Collective deliberation over the sociallyrelevant option(s) for change. A specificity of the method lies in the way stakeholder judgments are elicited and represented (step 3). Indicators constitute arguments that stakeholders can combine to express their judgments. Stakeholders map out where one scenario is acceptable to them and where it is not (spatialized judgments). In addition, they can define places of special importance for each criterion (spatialized weights). Integrating those maps would help change the focus from “which scenario is the best” to “where does a scenario bring out conflicts and where is it consensual option”. We expect such a transformation to favour social learning and the design of new technical and organizational solutions for watershed management...|$|R

40|$|In-service rails {{can develop}} {{several types of}} {{structural}} defects due to fatigue and wear caused by rolling stock passing over them. Most rail defects will develop gradually over time thus permitting inspection engineers to detect them in time before final failure occurs. In the UK, certain types of severe rail defects such as tache ovales, require the fitting of emergency clamps and the imposure of an <b>Emergency</b> Speed <b>Restriction</b> (ESR) until the defects are removed. Acoustic emission (AE) techniques can be applied for the detection and continuous monitoring of defect growth therefore removing the need of imposing strict ESRs.

40|$|Proceedings of the 1995 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11 and 12, 1995, Athens, Georgia. Water {{consumption}} in the Flint River Basin depends upon seasonal irrigation of the major row crops — corn, peanut, cotton, and soybean. Knowledge of each crop's water use pattern, water retention by major soil types, and probable weather patterns is essential for comprehensive water management in the basin. Crop model prediction of yield and water use under weather patterns of the past 58 years showed that irrigation water withdrawals can exceed 1200 million gal/day during peak use periods in drought years. If <b>emergency</b> irrigation <b>restrictions</b> that eliminated irrigation for 30 - to 60 -day periods were imposed to curtail irrigation water consumption, water savings could amount to 6 to 60 billion gallons annually in the Flint River Basin. However, in-season curtailment of irrigation for 30 - to 60 -days would cause direct economic losses to growers of $ 4 to $ 148 million, depending on timing and duration of restrictions. Alternative water management strategies should be developed for reducing irrigation demands in drought years. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

5000|$|To {{maintain}} their control, the British tried {{to construct a}} narrative of communist insurgencies and militarism which could be potentially threatening {{to the security of}} the region. On the premise of containing communist activities, emergency regulations were implemented in 1948. These <b>emergency</b> regulations increased <b>restriction</b> on civil society meetings in Singapore. A turning point came as the Rendel Constitution was accepted by the British government and resulted in elections that brought David Marshall and the Labour Front party into power. This new constitution led to the provisional easing of <b>restrictions</b> under <b>Emergency</b> regulations, which in its turn sparked off much interest in politics among the people living in Singapore. This renewed liberalisation led to the establishment of many trade unions during this period which would have alarmed many employers that were worried about their business interests. Oppressive colonial educational and labour policies discriminated against Chinese students and workers. Perceived unjust colonial policies led to various episodes of labour unrests in 1954 and 1955. In 1954 there was The May 13 National Service Ordinance. And in 1955, there were three notable strikes namely the Hock Lee Bus workers’ strike, the Singapore Traction Company strike and the Singapore Harbour Board strike.|$|R
500|$|Relations between Indians and British were {{strained}} in 1919 {{when the}} Imperial Legislative Council extended <b>emergency</b> wartime <b>restrictions</b> on civil liberties; Jinnah resigned from {{it when it}} did. There was unrest across India, which worsened after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, in which British troops fired upon a protest meeting, killing hundreds. [...] In the wake of Amritsar, Gandhi, who had returned to India and become a widely respected leader and highly influential in the Congress, called for satyagraha against the British. Gandhi's proposal gained broad Hindu support, and was also attractive to many Muslims of the Khilafat faction. These Muslims, supported by Gandhi, sought retention of the Ottoman caliphate, which supplied spiritual leadership to many Muslims. [...] The caliph was the Ottoman Emperor, who would be deprived of both offices following his nation's defeat in the First World War. Gandhi had achieved considerable popularity among Muslims because of his work during the war on behalf of killed or imprisoned Muslims. Unlike Jinnah and other leaders of the Congress, Gandhi did not wear western-style clothing, {{did his best to}} use an Indian language instead of English, and was deeply rooted in Indian culture. Gandhi's local style of leadership gained great popularity with the Indian people. Jinnah criticised Gandhi's Khilafat advocacy, which he saw as an endorsement of religious zealotry. [...] Jinnah regarded Gandhi's proposed satyagraha campaign as political anarchy, and believed that self-government should be secured through constitutional means. He opposed Gandhi, but the tide of Indian opinion was against him. [...] At the 1920 session of the Congress in Nagpur, Jinnah was shouted down by the delegates, who passed Gandhi's proposal, pledging satyagraha until India was independent. Jinnah did not attend the subsequent League meeting, held in the same city, which passed a similar resolution. Because of the action of the Congress in endorsing Gandhi's campaign, Jinnah resigned from it, leaving all positions except in the Muslim League.|$|R
