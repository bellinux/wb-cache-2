5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E

25|$|The axiom schema of {{collection}} {{is closely related}} to and frequently confused with the axiom schema of replacement.

In other words, the resulting set, , is not required to be minimal.|$|E

25|$|Body <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> person's {{perception}} of the aesthetics or sexual attractiveness of their own body. The phrase body image was first coined by the Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Paul Schilder in his book The Image and Appearance of the Human Body (1935). Human society has at all times placed great value on beauty of the human body, but a person's {{perception of}} their own body may not correspond to society's standards.|$|E
25|$|For more {{difficult}} examples, a similar proof may always be given, but may imply a difficult computation: first a Gröbner basis computation {{to compute the}} dimension, followed by a random linear change of variables (not always needed); then a Gröbner basis computation for another monomial ordering to compute the projection and {{to prove that it}} is generically injective and that its <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hypersurface, and finally a polynomial factorization to prove the irreducibility of the image.|$|E
25|$|Generally, if in doubt, {{the side}} of a coin with the larger-scale image will be called the obverse (especially if the <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single head) and, if that does not serve to {{distinguish}} them, the side that is more typical {{of a wide range of}} coins from that location will be called the obverse. A convention now exists typically to display the obverse to the left (or above) and the reverse to the right (or below) in photographs and museum displays, but this is not invariably observed.|$|E

25|$|Shrines {{can also}} be found in the back of all kinds of stores and gas stations. As veneration of Santa Muerte becomes more accepted, stores specializing in {{religious}} articles, such as botánicas, are carrying more and more paraphernalia related to the cult. Historian R. Andrew Chesnut has discovered that many botanicas in both Mexico and the U.S. are kept in business by sales of Santa Muerte paraphernalia, with numerous shops earning up to half of their profits on Santa Muerte items. This is true even of stores in very well known locations such as Pasaje Catedral behind the Mexico City Cathedral, which is mostly dedicated to store selling Catholic liturgical items. Her <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> staple in esoterica shops.|$|E
25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative. The first <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The {{same goes for the}} experience of reading a single line of Homer. If you wish to explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E

25|$|Tactile imaging is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} that translates the sense of touch into a digital image. The tactile <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> function of P(x,y,z), where P is the pressure on soft tissue surface under applied deformation and x,y,z are coordinates where pressure P was measured. Tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation, since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination, slightly deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern. Figure on the right presents an experiment on a composite tissue phantom examined by a tactile imaging probe illustrating the ability of tactile imaging to visualize in 3D {{the structure of the}} object.|$|E
25|$|Father Time, a Saturn-like <b>image,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{reminder}} of the tragedy of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, bringing with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, evil is external (the devil). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shāh Fereydūn's two eldest sons feel greed and envy toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, we encounter a series of flawed shahs. There is a Phaedra-like story of Shāh Kay Kāvus, his wife Sūdābeh, and her passion for and rejection by her stepson, Sīyāvash.|$|E
25|$|The reverse {{features}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, reflecting {{the contributions of}} Canada in conflicts throughout its military history. The memorial was erected on the highest point of Vimy Ridge on land permanently granted to Canada by the Government of France in 1922 to honour Canadian military service during World War I. The <b>image</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rendering based on a photograph commissioned by the Bank of Canada. The reverse also features an artistic rendition of poppies and a Canadian flag waving. A report of the focus group study stated that most Canadians either did not recognize or were unaware of the Vimy Memorial, and thought the image represented the twin towers of the World Trade Center, though most Canadians recognized the name Vimy. Other focus group members stated concerns about nudity and pornography, both concerns {{in relation to the}} sculptures of nude women atop the memorial structure representing peace (Pax) and Lady Justice.|$|E
