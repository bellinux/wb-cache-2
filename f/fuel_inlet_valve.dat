5000|$|A severe form {{of engine}} {{flooding}} occurs when excessive liquid fuel enters the combustion chamber. This reduces the dead {{volume of the}} combustion chamber and thus places a heavy load on the starter motor, such that it fails to turn the engine. Damage (due to excessive compression and even dilution of the lubricating oil with fuel) can also occur. This condition {{is known as the}} engine [...] "flooding out." [...] Possible causes of too much liquid fuel in the engine include a defective carburetor float that is not closing the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> needle <b>valve,</b> or debris caught in the needle valve preventing it from sealing.|$|R
40|$|This work {{involved}} {{study of}} the effects of alcohol blends on combustion, fuel economy and emissions in a single cylinder research engine equipped with a mechanical fully variable valvetrain on the <b>inlet</b> and variable <b>valve</b> timing on the exhaust. A number of splash blends of gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol were examined during port <b>fuel</b> injected early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing operation, both with and without variable valve timing. Under low valve overlap conditions, it was apparent that the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> durations/lifts required for full unthrottled operation were remarkably similar for the wide range of blends studied. However, with high valve overlap differences in burning velocities and internal EGR tolerances warranted changes in these valve settings. In turn, it was concluded that high ethanol content blends facilitated minimum throttling at the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> itself and the largest relative savings in terms of fuel consumption, engine-out emissions of NOx and (corrected) unburned hydrocarbons.
