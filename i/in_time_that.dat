He makes a cameo appearance at the end of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, where he is shown with Xion and Axel eating sea-salt ice cream in Twilight Town, as well as in , where Roxas contacts both Axel and Sora through dreams. He also appears in Shiro Amano's manga and Tomoko Kanemaki's novels, where he reprises his role from the video games. The book Kingdom Hearts: Another Report includes a novel called Roxas–Somewhere <b>in</b> <b>Time</b> <b>that</b> retells Roxas' days in the Organization with the exception of his befriending Xion.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{the mysterious}} {{character}} River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome {{being in the}} whole universe. However, it is discovered that the Doctor has been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from cracks <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence {{from one of the}} cracks in the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness.|$|E

This results in Brian becoming active as Captain Britain again and the formation of a new Excalibur, along with Peter Wisdom, Sage, Juggernaut, Dazzler, and Nocturne. Captain Britain also believes his sister Psylocke to be dead, unaware that she has joined the Exiles.|$|E

25|$|For Metzinger, the {{classical}} vision {{had been an}} incomplete representation of real things, based on an incomplete set of laws, postulates and theorems. He believed the world was dynamic and changing <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> it appeared different depending {{on the point of}} view of the observer. Each of these viewpoints were equally valid according to underlying symmetries inherent in nature. For inspiration, Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist and one of the principle founders of quantum mechanics, hung in his office a large painting by Metzinger, La Femme au Cheval, a conspicuous early example of 'mobile perspective' implementation (also called simultaneity).|$|E
25|$|Traditional stories {{handed down}} by the ancient Romans {{themselves}} explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, {{and perhaps the most}} famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC. This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{levels are}} {{snapshot}} pictures <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> omits the transitional dynamics between levels. Mobility statistics supply {{additional information about}} the fraction who leave the poverty level. For example, one study finds that in a sixteen-year period (1975 to 1991 in the U.S.) only 5% {{of those in the}} lower fifth of the income level were still at that level, while 95% transitioned to a higher income category. Poverty levels can remain the same while those who rise out of poverty are replaced by others. The transient poor and chronic poor differ in each society. In a nine-year period ending in 2005 for the U.S., 50% of the poorest quintile transitioned to a higher quintile.|$|E

25|$|In a story arc {{stretching}} {{through several}} of the Eighth Doctor Adventures, sometime in the Doctor's future, a war is fought between the Time Lords and an unnamed Enemy, the Eighth Doctor becoming involved in {{the events of the}} war during the events of Alien Bodies, when he unintentionally becomes involved in an auction for the body of his future self due to his biodata codes being the only means of accessing dangerous Time Lord secrets, and The Taking of Planet 5, where he must stop a group of future Time Lords from releasing the monstrous Fendahl in an attempt {{to use it as a}} weapon. In this story arc, Gallifrey is also destroyed as a result of the Eighth Doctor attempting to prevent the war from beginning as the Enemy begin their first assault in, having learned that he unintentionally provoked the War, believing that it would be better for the Time Lords to die now rather than experience a war that would dehumanise them to the point of becoming monsters which all evidence suggests they could not win. This cataclysm also creates an event horizon <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> prevents anyone from entering Gallifrey's relative past or travelling from it to the present or future. The last Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Gallifrey Chronicles, establishes that the Doctor has the ability to restore the planet and its inhabitants, having downloaded the contents of the Matrix into his subconscious mind in the minutes before Gallifrey's destruction, albeit at the cost of his own memories. The novel ends without revealing if he does indeed do this.|$|E

Pro Wrestling Illustrated and Wrestling Observer Newsletter named it 1987's Match of the Year. IGN ranked it at number 6 in their Top 20 Matches in WrestleMania History. Steamboat described the match as [...] "the moment <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> defined me as a wrestler."

500|$|Paul Gray {{wrote in}} a review <b>in</b> <b>Time</b> <b>that</b> the {{documents}} that make up Shikasta allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective [...] "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute". He said that the book's cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her [...] "grand designs" [...] and [...] "configurations of enormous powers" [...] with [...] "passages of aching poignancy". Gray said that Shikasta is closer to Gulliver's Travels and the Old Testament {{than it is to}} Buck Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her [...] "space fiction" [...] as [...] "science fiction". He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans [...] "could not... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little [...] "unsatisfying", but added that even if you do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, [...] "even furiously engaging on every page". Gray called Shikasta [...] "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".|$|E

500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story." ...|$|E
