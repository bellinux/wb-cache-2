50|$|Correction: I {{have the}} {{original}} 10 inch {{as well as}} the Verve reissue. The concert was put out about 8 years after it was recorded. It was all done on one night in LA. You can see that in the reference to the Downbeat review. The liner notes were written by Norman Granz. I'm not sure where the musicians info above was received from, I'm holding the album (10") as I speak and the musicians listed are Milt Raskin piano, Willie Smith alto, Red Callender bass and Dave Coleman drums. I'm Dave Coleman's son and I have the letter from Norman Granz telling my dad he was putting the album out with a check stub for $60 if I remember correctly. A lot of these tunes were done with lots of musicians, but the ones on the 10 inch album are as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>listed</b> above done in one night. I think the cover is a favorite as it has been used on a few compilations. In fact the Verve reissue I have has the 10 inch tunes {{on one side and a}} whole bunch of others on the 2nd side with the same cover and liner notes as the 10 inch. Go figure. Tim Coleman.|$|E
