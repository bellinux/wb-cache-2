5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{can use the}} Lebanese Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money from the bank or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. It is <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks are confident {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|Since it is <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> snake's {{tongue to}} fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short {{compared to that of}} terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E

25|$|Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must {{convert to}} Islam to marry Muslim women. Christian and Jewish women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim women are {{prohibited}} from marrying Christian men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide for all family members who require assistance; however, this assistance is not always provided. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, provided that she is willing to forgo alimony {{and the return of}} her dowry. However, an earlier provision of the draft law that would have made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman to travel without her husband's consent, was rejected.|$|E

25|$|During Bolger's term as Speaker he {{achieved}} bipartisan support for education reform. Since 2011, the Michigan House of Representatives have passed numerous education reforms including tenure reform, expansion of cyber and charter school choices, teacher benefit reforms and early childhood development investment. During Bolger's {{first year as}} Speaker, the House passed tenure reform. Tenure reform in Michigan guaranteed students would not be left with an underperforming teacher or lose a teacher who is exceeding. Tenure reform made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> school district to fire ineffective teachers, and banned the {{last in first out}} approach previously utilized.|$|E
25|$|SBML can encode models {{consisting}} of entities (called species in SBML) acted upon by processes (called reactions). An important principle is that models are decomposed into explicitly-labeled constituent elements, {{the set of}} which resembles a verbose rendition of chemical reaction equations (if the model uses reactions) together with optional explicit equations (again, if the model uses these); the SBML representation deliberately does not cast the model directly into a set of differential equations or other specific interpretation of the model. This explicit, modeling-framework-agnostic decomposition makes it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> software tool to interpret the model and translate the SBML form into whatever internal form the tool actually uses.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was able}} to put his ideas into practice, and the {{technique}} was soon adopted by the military. However, it was less popular when commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, mostly due to the need for an extra tube (for the oscillator), the generally higher cost of the receiver, and the level of technical skill required to operate it. For early domestic radios, tuned radio frequency receivers (TRF) were more popular because they were cheaper, <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> non-technical owner to use, and less costly to operate. Armstrong eventually sold his superheterodyne patent to Westinghouse, who then sold it to RCA, the latter monopolizing the market for superheterodyne receivers until 1930.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{individuals}} with SP, {{there is almost}} no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> stimulus to arouse the individual. There may also be a problem with the regulation of melatonin, which under normal circumstances regulates the serotonergic neural populations. Melatonin is typically at its lowest point during REM sleep. Inhibition of melatonin at an inappropriate time would make it impossible for the sleep off neural populations to depolarize when presented with a stimulus that would normally lead to complete arousal. The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep. According to this hypothesis, vestibular-motor disorientation, unlike hallucinations, arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.|$|E
25|$|A {{ball that}} bounces {{a little way}} before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen {{is said to be}} short pitched or {{described}} as a long hop and is <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> batsman to hit as he will have had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing. A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking pull shot. A ball that bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a bouncer and can be an effective delivery. Any ball short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called wide by the Umpire. Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.|$|E
25|$|The Court buttressed its {{determination}} {{based upon}} the underlying premises of the directness requirement. First, the Court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions. For example, in this case, National could have lowered its prices for numerous reasons unrelated to the asserted fraud. Conversely, Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than National's alleged RICO violation. Secondly, the direct causal connection requirement is especially warranted where the direct victims of the RICO violation can pursue their own claim. Here, the State of New York could file suit and in that situation, {{it would be much}} <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> court to calculate New York's damages. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court reversed the Second Circuit's holding that Ideal had satisfied the proximate cause requirement under its section 1962(c) claim.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the late}} 2000s recession, the 2009 Yukon Quest purse was reduced to $151,000 from a planned total of $200,000. As a result, the first prize was reduced to $30,000 from the planned $35,000. Partly because of this, Mackey withdrew before the race, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{newcomer}} to win.
