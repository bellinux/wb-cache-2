5|$|Among the 15 known {{isotopes}} of mendelevium (mass {{numbers from}} 245 to 260), the most studied is 256Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (α-radiation is ≈10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha <b>emitter,</b> 258Md, has a half-life of 53 days. Both these isotopes are produced from rare einsteinium (253Es and 255Es respectively), that therefore limits their availability.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from stable}} lutetium, its {{radioactive}} isotopes have several specific uses. The suitable half-life and decay mode made lutetium-176 {{used as a}} pure beta <b>emitter,</b> using lutetium which has been exposed to neutron activation, and in lutetium–hafnium dating to date meteorites. The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E
30|$|The {{uncertainty}} in {{the location of the}} robot increases as the interval between <b>emitters</b> becomes larger. In an environment in which only unique ID encoding <b>emitters</b> are used, attempts to improve the accuracy by decreasing the interval between the <b>emitters</b> causes the quantity of required IDs to increase rapidly. The proposed system, which combines unique ID encoding <b>emitters</b> with repeated ID encoding <b>emitters,</b> can reduce the interval without consuming new IDs. We verified the real-time self-localization performance of the proposed system by allowing the robot to move along fixed trajectories. This enabled us to statistically assess the real-time localization performance. The evaluation included four configurations: the combination of 3 unique ID and 8 repeated ID encoding <b>emitters,</b> the use of 11 unique ID encoding <b>emitters,</b> the use of 3 unique ID encoding <b>emitters,</b> and the use of no <b>emitters.</b> The performance assessment of self-localization under the no-emitter configuration is based only on odometry. The robot traversed the fixed trajectory three times at a set speed of 200 mm/s.|$|R

5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong <b>emitter</b> of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Gallium-68, a {{positron}} <b>emitter</b> with a half-life of 68 min, is {{now used}} as a diagnostic radionuclide in PET-CT when linked to pharmaceutical preparations such as DOTATOC, a somatostatin analogue used for neuroendocrine tumors investigation, and DOTA-TATE, a newer one, used for neuroendocrine metastasis and lung neuroendocrine cancer, such as certain types of microcytoma. Gallium-68's preparation as a pharmaceutical is chemical and the radionuclide is extracted by elution from germanium-68, a synthetic radioisotope of germanium, in gallium-68 generators.|$|E

40|$|Artificial atomic {{systems in}} solids such as single photon <b>emitters</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly important building blocks in quantum information processing and scalable quantum nanophotonic networks. Here, we report on a controllable way to engineer <b>emitters</b> in two-dimensional (2 D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals using plasma processing. The method is robust, and yields a 7 -fold increase in the density of <b>emitters</b> in hBN, which is promising for their deployment in practical devices. While as-fabricated <b>emitters</b> suffer from blinking and bleaching, a subsequent annealing step yields photo-stable <b>emitters.</b> The presented process {{is the first step}} towards controllable placement of quantum <b>emitters</b> in hBN for integrated on-chip quantum nanophotonics based on 2 D materials.

5|$|The isotope plutonium-238 has a {{half-life}} of 87.74years. It emits a {{large amount}} of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays/photons and spontaneous neutron rays/particles. Being an alpha <b>emitter,</b> it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238. One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} isotope is astatine-210, {{which has a}} {{half-life}} of 8.1hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha <b>emitter</b> polonium-210. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long-lived bismuth-209.|$|E
40|$|Rayleigh {{criterion}} {{has been}} continuously broken through with modern detecting instruments, many methods on resolving two <b>emitters</b> below the classical diffraction limit has been developed, {{one of these}} methods is detecting high order correlation functions of the <b>emitters.</b> We propose a method to resolve the single-photon <b>emitters</b> with only detecting the highest order correlation functions. We find that the variables that characterize the <b>emitters</b> are contained in the highest order correlation functions. Especially when {{there are more than}} two <b>emitters,</b> the spatial distribution of the <b>emitters</b> can be deduced only from the highest order correlation functions, which gives a new vision and a new method on beating classical diffraction limit using high order correlation functions.

For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells.

While the III-Nitride semiconductor system has the band gap region necessary for ultraviolet emission, achieving efficient ultraviolet solid state <b>emitters</b> remains a challenge due to the low p-type conductivity and high contact resistance in wide band gap AlGaN-based ultra-violet light <b>emitters.</b> In this work, we show that efficient interband tunneling can be used for non-equilibrium injection of holes into ultraviolet <b>emitters.</b> Polarization-engineered tunnel junctions were used to enhance tunneling probability by several orders of magnitude over a PN homojunction, leading to highly efficient tunnel injection of holes to ultraviolet light <b>emitters.</b> This demonstration of efficient interband tunneling introduces a new paradigm for design of ultra-violet light emitting diodes and diode lasers, and enables higher efficiency and lower cost ultra-violet <b>emitters.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, Submitte...|$|R

5|$|Technetium-99 decays {{almost entirely}} by beta decay, {{emitting}} beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard beta <b>emitter,</b> and is used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.|$|E

Compared with pure silicon field <b>emitters,</b> Mo-silicide field <b>emitters</b> exhibited significant improvement in both emission current and stability. On the other hand, Ti- and Co-silicide field <b>emitters</b> showed higher turn-on voltage and reduced emission current fluctuation.

5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron <b>emitter,</b> and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus.

Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant.
