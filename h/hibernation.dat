5|$|The {{species is}} cold-adapted and {{hibernate}}s in the winter. In Great Britain, {{males and females}} hibernate for about 150 and 180 days respectively. In northern Sweden <b>hibernation</b> lasts 8–9 months. On mild winter days, they may emerge to bask where the snow has melted and will often travel across snow. About 15% of adults and 30–40% of juveniles die during <b>hibernation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During <b>hibernation,</b> the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their <b>hibernation,</b> and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the <b>hibernation</b> period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep <b>hibernation</b> (May through September). Before and after this deep <b>hibernation,</b> there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E
5|$|George Orwell in {{his essay}} Some Thoughts on the Common Toad {{described}} {{the emergence of the}} common toad from <b>hibernation</b> {{as one of the most}} moving signs of spring.|$|E

5|$|Upon death, the Slugcat {{returns to}} the last <b>hibernation</b> save point and loses any map {{progress}} made since. The player also loses a karma point, which are indicated {{at the bottom of}} the screen. The player needs to meet a karmic threshold to reach specific areas of the game. Karma is restored upon reaching a new <b>hibernation</b> area, and the player can shield their current karma level by eating a yellow flower. The flower appears at the start of each area and is re-planted wherever the Slugcat dies.|$|E
5|$|About 170 {{species of}} birds visit the park each year, {{including}} swifts and swallows. Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay. In winter, the mule deer, cougars, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations. Ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in <b>hibernation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{plant and}} animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are <b>hibernation,</b> insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in <b>hibernation</b> {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During <b>hibernation,</b> it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Since {{the final}} {{servicing}} mission in 2009, the four active instruments have been ACS, COS, STIS and WFC3. NICMOS {{is kept in}} <b>hibernation,</b> but may be revived if WFC3 were to fail in the future.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears between Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway (Svalbard), the United States, and the Soviet Union outlawed the {{unregulated}} {{hunting of}} polar bears from aircraft and icebreakers, {{as well as}} protecting migration, feeding, and <b>hibernation</b> sites.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised the game's art design and criticized {{the harshness of}} its gameplay mechanics, particularly its unpredictable deaths, ruthless enemies, and time-consuming <b>hibernation</b> requirements. Eurogamer compared its savage, survival elements to the 2012 Tokyo Jungle.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (<b>hibernation).</b> A study of <b>hibernation</b> in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as <b>hibernation.</b> The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E
5|$|Brown bats do {{not claim}} feeding areas like a territory, however {{individuals}} frequently {{return to the}} same feeding sites where they have previously made successful catches. When hunting swarms, brown bats usually select {{no more than two}} species. They feed on more species when they are scattered. If they do not catch any food, they will enter a torpor similar to <b>hibernation</b> that day, awakening at night to hunt again.|$|E
5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms. The wood turtle can also be found in forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from flowing water. It is diurnal and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in <b>hibernation</b> and the hottest parts of the summer in estivation.|$|E
5|$|The player's character, the part-slug and {{part-cat}} Slugcat, uses {{spears and}} rocks {{to survive a}} hostile, ruined, and obtuse 2D world {{in search of the}} family from whom it was separated. The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world in any direction via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens, each with randomized enemies. The Slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food, which is used to hibernate in scarce, designated safe rooms. <b>Hibernation</b> resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. The player can move between regions by having the Slugcat hibernate multiple times without dying. If the player does not reach the <b>hibernation</b> point quickly, a crushing rain will pour, both flooding the world and possibly pummeling the Slugcat to death.|$|E
5|$|The snake is nocturnal, {{and may be}} more {{defensive}} at night. It is, however, a timid and placid {{species of}} snake. In the daytime, it hides under stones or in holes. The snake appears from April and retreats into <b>hibernation</b> in November. It {{is considered to be}} more defensive than the Banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus), thrashing about as it is handled.|$|E
5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter <b>hibernation.</b> Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in <b>hibernation</b> colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E
5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime <b>hibernation)</b> until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} on the skeleton reveals bite marks matching Tooms' teeth. When the old couple watching Tooms depart and Tooms is visited by Monte, he kills him and consumes the final liver he needs before his thirty-year <b>hibernation.</b> After discovering Monte's body, Mulder and Scully head to Tooms' former residence at 66 Exeter Street, which has been demolished and replaced with a shopping mall. Inside, Mulder crawls below an escalator and finds Tooms' nest. Tooms bursts out, covered in bile, and pursues Mulder, who {{makes it to the}} surface and activates the escalator, trapping and killing Tooms.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and <b>hibernation),</b> small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to {{have given rise to}} three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer <b>hibernation</b> {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter <b>hibernation</b> dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their <b>hibernation</b> and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
5|$|Rain World {{setting is}} {{destroyed}} by ecological catastrophe and illustrated in pixel art. Its story is communicated through {{details in the}} environment, images during <b>hibernation,</b> and holograms from a worm that monitors the Slugcat. The game offers little to guide the player, apart from the worm, who gives some hints about where to go and what to collect towards {{the beginning of the}} game. The player can view a map to check their progress through the large in-game world, and this can help to reach the game's multiple endings.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the biology of M.escalerai. Females begin to form {{reproductive}} colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.escalerai from M.nattereri as well as M.sp.A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed {{in a variety of}} structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, <b>hibernation</b> colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located in caves or basements. M.escalerai is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and <b>hibernation</b> colonies. Rabies has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.escalerai.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} emerges from <b>hibernation</b> {{in spring and}} there is a mass {{migration}} towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were spawned. They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices {{have been found to be}} able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).|$|E
5|$|The game's story {{takes place}} {{five hundred years}} after the {{previous}} game's ending. Lightning, the main protagonist of the first game and a key character in the second, awakes from a self-imposed <b>hibernation</b> 13 days before the world's end, and is chosen by the deity Bhunivelze to save {{the people of the}} dying world, including former friends and allies who have developed heavy emotional burdens. As she travels, she learns the full truth behind both the world's fate and Bhunivelze's true agenda.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-8 on 5 September 1989 marked the {{beginning}} of the longest human presence in space, until 23 October 2010, when this record was surpassed by the ISS. It also {{marked the beginning}} of Mir's second expansion. The Kvant-2 and Kristall modules were now ready for launch. Alexander Viktorenko and Aleksandr Serebrov docked with Mir and brought the station out of its five-month <b>hibernation.</b> On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in the docking system in preparation for the arrival of Kvant-2, the first of the 20tonne add-on modules based on the TKS spacecraft from the Almaz programme.|$|E
5|$|After Samus {{retrieves}} {{three pieces}} of the Light of Aether, she enters the Ing's Sky Temple and faces the Emperor Ing, the strongest Ing who guards the remaining Light of Aether. Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically unstable and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is blocked by a horribly altered and unstable Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her. Returning to U-Mos, she finds that the Luminoth were {{in a state of}} <b>hibernation</b> but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.|$|E
5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and <b>hibernation</b> states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of <b>hibernation</b> during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals <b>hibernation.</b> Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, <b>hibernation</b> may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E
