25|$|Nevertheless, Wagner and Minna parted, Wagner {{to travel}} to Venice and Minna to take the waters at Brestenberg {{in an attempt to}} improve her {{worsening}} heart condition. Minna wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> with a bleeding heart that you have succeeded in separating my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that in Mauritania, {{freedom is}} total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – {{of all men}} and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: [...] "An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me." [...] He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that their liberty and freedom consists in having government... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things." [...] He continued, [...] "I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 9, {{two days}} before the Iraq {{commanding}} General David Petraeus addressed the Senate, Biden stated that, [...] "I really respect him, and I think he's dead flat wrong [...] ". He criticized the president, arguing, [...] "This president has no plan – how to win and/or how to leave". During the September 11 testimony by the General, Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was [...] "Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago?" [...] He answered his own question by stating [...] "In my judgment, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> based on my experience and my observation here, as well as in-country, the answer to... questions is no." [...] After the testimony concluded, Biden and other Democrats were criticized for their conduct during the deliberations. In the following weeks Biden would continue with these arguments while campaigning.|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I {{never had}} a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1944, {{all of the}} Resistance governments {{agreed to}} accept the {{authority}} of the Free French government based in Algiers (until 1962 Algeria was considered to be part of France) and the Resistance was renamed FFI (Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur-Forces of the Interior). The Germans refused to accept the resistance as legitimate opponents and any résistant captured faced the prospect of torture and/or execution as the Germans maintained that the Hague and Geneva conventions did not apply to the resistance. By designating the resistance as part of the French armed forces was intended to provide the Resistance with legal protection and allow the French to threaten the Germans with the possibility of prosecution for war crimes. The designation did not help. For example, the résistante Sindermans was arrested in Paris on 24 February 1944 after she was found to be carrying forged papers. As she recalled: [...] "Immediately, they handcuffed me and took me to be interrogated. Getting no reply, they slapped in the face with such force that I fell from the chair. Then they whipped me with a rubber hose, full in the face. The interrogation began at 10 o'clock in the morning and ended at 11 o'clock that night. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I had been pregnant for three months".|$|E
