5|$|Nikki is {{manipulative}} of Paulo {{and appears}} to care more about the diamonds than her relationship. After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is <b>just</b> <b>using</b> {{him to get the}} diamonds. The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Benzoquinone is {{actually}} not a necessary component for this reaction; its {{role is to}} regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by <b>just</b> <b>using</b> excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while {{at a much higher}} cost. Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some {{progress has been made in}} the development of catalytic variants. Despite this shortcoming, the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is <b>just</b> <b>using</b> the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

This new CPU cycle-based thread scheduling gives a greater fairness and more deterministic app behavior. Many kernel data structures and algorithms have been rewritten.

25|$|Multi-Resolution {{reconstruction}} using single 2D File: High-quality 3D imaging may be {{an ultimate}} solution for revealing the complexities of any porous media, but acquiring them is costly and time consuming. High-quality 2D SEM images, on the other hand, are widely available. Recently, a novel three-step, multiscale, multiresolution reconstruction method is presented that directly uses 2D images {{in order to develop}} 3D models. This method, based on a Shannon Entropy and conditional simulation, can be used for most of the available stationary materials and can build various stochastic 3D models <b>just</b> <b>using</b> a few thin sections.|$|E
25|$|In this study, {{participants}} {{were assigned to}} one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or <b>just</b> <b>using</b> the computer as a resource). Finally, the {{participants were}} allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.|$|E

500|$|After {{years of}} not having a relationship, Jill has a brief romance with {{district}} attorney William Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) in 2007, which ends when Gloria Abbott (Judith Chapman) schemes to have him for herself. She later has a relationship with businessman Ji Min Kim (Eric Steinberg), who became her fiancé, however, he was murdered before {{they were able to}} marry. Jill's most recent relationship was with Cane Ashby's (Daniel Goddard) father, Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers). He had a criminal past, angering Katherine, who was protective of Jill. Allison Waldman of AOL TV wrote: [...] "Is he sincere, or is Colin <b>just</b> <b>using</b> Jill to get to Cane?" [...] Jill accepted his [...] "insane marriage offer" [...] and considered eloping. Walton said that Colin was a [...] "good match" [...] for Jill and she hoped that she could [...] "reform" [...] him.

I really believe there's a real love between those two, and we're playing it like there is."

500|$|In {{research}} on classifier systems, and Chinese classifiers in particular, {{it has been}} asked why count-classifiers (as opposed to mass-classifiers) exist at all. Mass-classifiers are present in all languages since {{they are the only}} way to [...] "count" [...] mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units (as, for example, [...] "three [...] of mud" [...] in English; *"three muds" [...] is ungrammatical). On the other hand, count-classifiers are not inherently mandatory, and are absent from most languages. Furthermore, count-classifiers are used with an [...] "unexpectedly low frequency"; in many settings, speakers avoid specific classifiers by <b>just</b> <b>using</b> a bare noun (without a number or demonstrative) or using the general classifier gè. Linguists and typologists such as Joseph Greenberg have suggested that specific count-classifiers are semantically [...] "redundant", repeating information present within the noun. Count-classifiers can be used stylistically, though, and {{can also be used to}} clarify or limit a speaker's intended meaning when using a vague or ambiguous noun; for example, the noun kè [...] "class" [...] can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day, depending on whether the classifier (...) mén or (...) jié is used.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season episode [...] "Duets", she asks Santana to be her partner for the duet {{competition}} while they are making out. Santana rejects her, so Brittany attempts to make her jealous by dating fellow glee club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale). She sleeps with Artie, but Santana tells him that Brittany was <b>just</b> <b>using</b> him for his voice, so he breaks up with her, to Brittany's dismay. Brittany's relationship with Artie continues to develop; in [...] "Never Been Kissed", he gets her {{to go out with}} him again. As of [...] "Furt", they are officially dating. In [...] "Sexy", following her performance of [...] "Landslide" [...] with Santana and Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), Santana admits her true feelings for Brittany. Although Santana fears being ostracized by the McKinley High student body for being in a same-sex relationship, she confesses her romantic love to Brittany, feelings which are reciprocated. However, Brittany states that she loves Artie too, and would never do anything to hurt him, even if it means not being able to be with Santana. She says that if she and Artie ever break up, she would be Santana's, proudly so.|$|E
500|$|The actress went on {{to explain}} that the storyline showed how Toyah regretted her actions and that young female viewers could learn from her mistake.

[...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her {{to go to the doctor}} for the morning-after pill.
