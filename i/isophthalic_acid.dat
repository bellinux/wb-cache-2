25|$|One way to {{alleviate}} {{this is to}} use a copolymer. Comonomers such as CHDM or <b>isophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> lower the melting temperature and reduce the degree of crystallinity of PET (especially important when the material is used for bottle manufacturing). Thus, the resin can be plastically formed at lower temperatures and/or with lower force. This helps to prevent degradation, reducing the acetaldehyde content of the finished product to an acceptable (that is, unnoticeable) level. See copolymers, above. Another way to improve the stability of the polymer is to use stabilizers, mainly antioxidants such as phosphites. Recently, molecular level stabilization of the material using nanostructured chemicals has also been considered.|$|E
25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as thermoforming, {{which is used}} for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet.

For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of <b>isophthalic</b> <b>acid,</b> CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.|$|E

40|$|Thesis {{presented}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Technology (MTech) at Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Applied Science, Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2011 Aromatic polyamides (PAs) are widely used as high-performance polymers in technical applications due to their unique combination of outstanding thermal, optical, mechanical and chemical properties. Although PAs are mostly utilized where strength or heat resistance is of primary concern, they also find use in other important applications such as in NOMEX membranes for desalination of brackish water or seawater. PAs do however have some disadvantages such as high melting points, high glass transition temperatures (T 9) and a limited solubility in most organic solvents, wh. ich makes their processing difficult. Polyureas (PUs) are generally known for their excellent thermal stability and high chemical resistance due {{to the presence of}} thermally stable bonds of aromatic or heterocyclic ring systems along their backbone. Both polymer systems are poorly researched when it comes*' the introduction of furan units into the chains. The same is valid for cases where two or more different diacids or diamines are incorporated. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of furan units in the polymer chains and the change in properties if the composition of starting materials is varied further. Nineteen PAs were prepared via the interfacial polymerization method and the homogeneous phase polymerization method. These polymers were prepared either with furan- or <b>isophthalic</b> <b>acids</b> in their chains and then compared with the copolymers, containing both diacids in different ratios. Products were characterized by various analytical techniques. Furanoyl- 2, 5 -dichloride (FDC) and different amounts of isophthaloyl chloride (IPDC) - 0, 10, 30 and 50 % - as the basic starting monomers were reacted individually with four diamines: m-phenylen diamine (MPD), 4, 4 '-diamino diphenylsulfone (DDS), 4, 4 '-diamino diphenylether (ODE) and 2, 4 -bis(4 -aminophenyl) - 6 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4, 6 -triamine (BAT) by interfacial or homogeneous polycondensation reactions. Two polyureas, starting with furanoyl- 2, 5 -diazide (FDZ) and transformed into the diisocyanate were prepared by reaction with two diamines, namely MPD and DDS in homogeneous solution. The PAs and PUs were characterized by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Proton NMR CH), Carbon NMR C 3 C), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The water up-take per polymer unit (mol water I repeat unit of the polymer) was measured.

40|$|The {{background}} of our studies in hydrothermal crystallization of organic compounds {{and in particular}} the ideas of organic crystal-engineering based on supramolecular principles is presented in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 - 5 then describe the application of hydrothermal conditions to the preparation of organic co-crystals of aromatic acids and bases. In general when comparing hydrothermal and ambient crystallization for these systems, hydrothermal conditions appear advantageous in producing higher yield, higher phase purity products, readily isolated and frequently with enhanced crystal size up to several mm in dimension. They also appear to more readily allow the thermodynamic control of co-crystal stoichiometry. This topic is commenced in Chapter 2, which describes the synthesis and structures of eleven new co-crystals of bipyridines with isopththalic and terephthalic acids. Through appropriate variations of conditions co-crystal of 1 : 1 or 1 : 2 stoichiometry can be formed for the isophthalic system. In the 1 : 1 adducts linear zig-zag chains are found though they can occur with different polymorphic forms, as found for each of the 1 : 1 co-crystals [Bipy] [IPA-H 2] and [BPEA] [IPA-H 2]. The 1 : 2 stoichiometry compounds involve association of the <b>isophthalic</b> <b>acids</b> with the pyridines through O-H [...] . N hydrogen bonds and themselves through O-H [...] . O H-bonding. By contrast in the terephthalic acid system the strong tendency to simple linear chain formation through O-H [...] . N hydrogen bonding of the carboxylic acid and pyridines means that only 1 : 1 co-crystals are formed. Chapter 3 describes the related chemistry of the co-crystals formed between bipyridines (bipy), (BPEA) and (BPEE) and phthalic acid (PHA-H 2). Once again crystal of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 stoichiometry may be formed. The 1 : 1 compounds are neutral molecular adducts with O-H [...] . N hydrogen bonding, and several polymorphic forms are found, for bipy, BPEA and BPEE. The 1 : 2 compounds are different in having proton transfer have bipyridinium dications and the hydrogen-phthalate mono-anions [Bipy-H 2][PHA-H] 2. Whist the phthalate anion is typically simple planar entity with intramolecular O-H [...] . O hydrogen bond, one polymorph of [BPEA-H 2] [PHA-H] 2 has chains of hydrogen phthalate ions, which form supramolecular cavities for the BPEA-H 2 ions. Chapter 4 describes the co-crystals of various bipyridines with hemi-mellitic acid [HEM-H 3]. Again different stoichiometries co-crystals are found along with polymorphs. The hem-mellitates have strong tendency to segregate hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. This has led to novel structures in which N-H [...] . N bonded chains of monopyridinium [BPEE-H] ions have formed to separate out from the hemi-mellitate layers. Chapter 5 discusses the co-crystals of bipyridines with benzene-l, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid, trimesic acid (TMA-H 3) and compares with those from 3, 5 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid (PDA). These lead to a number of open 'chick-wire' hydrogen bond networks, with varying stoichiometry. In the bipy-PDA-H 2 system three different stoichiometries are found along with 'molecular-slip' type poly-polymrphic forms. Finally in Chapter 6 we explore some other themes of organic hydrothermal crystallization through the results of a number of case studies, in which the technique can be applied to grow large organic crystals and examine issues of natural product and drug identification, stability and chiral resolution. The artemisinin familiy of anti-malarial compounds, hydrothermal crystallization of artemisinin itself can lead to large bar of 2 mm dimension. In general though these organic peroxides are unstable in solution at temperature above 110 °C and sub-hydrothermal condition 70 - 80 °C have used to explore crystallization of compounds, high temperature polymorphs and examine the hydrolytic decomposition of some of these compounds. Other cases studies involve the case of optimal crystal growth and stoichiometric control found in the 4, 4 '-bipyridine-squaric acid system, the co-crystallization of a chiral salt of 1 -tetrahydropalmatine through use of D-tartaric acid. Hydrothermal crystal growth up to 5 mm allowed study by neutron diffraction of the single well N-H-O and N-D-O hydrogen bonds found in 3, 5 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid (PDA-H 2 or dinicotinic acid) and its deuterated analogue which was crystallized hydrothermally using deuterium oxide as solvent...|$|R
40|$|Two-component super-hydrogelation {{triggered}} by the acid-base interaction of a L-histidine appended pyrenyl derivative (PyHis) and phthalic acid (PA) was reported. The use of isomeric <b>isophthalic</b> or terephthalic <b>acid</b> or other comparable acids in place of PA {{does not lead to}} salt formation and therefore hydrogelation is not observed. Excimer formation of the pyrenyl unit has not been detected although the PyHis : PA = 1 : 1 system undergoes extensive self-assembly in aqueous solution. The synergistic effect of intermolecular H-bonding forces, pi-pi stacking, electrostatic interactions, etc. is found to be responsible for robust hydrogel formation. Development of chiral supramotecular assemblies has been verified through circular dichroism spectroscopy. Morphological investigations involving the PyHis : PA = 1 : 1 system show vesicular nano-structures with a definite bilayer width at relatively low concentrations. The latter fuses to construct coiled-coil left-handed helical fibers upon increase in the concentrations of the gelators. The intertwining of the resultant helical fibers eventually results in hydrogel formation. The probable bilayer packing in the self-assembled structures has been probed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies and lanthanide sensitization, which suggests that the polar imidazolium hydrogen phthalate unit of the gelator forms the head group and faces the hydrophilic water environment while the hydrophobic pyrenyl units sit inside the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. The hydrogel exhibits multi-stimuli responsiveness including thixotropic behavior. In addition, shape-persistent as well as rapid self-healing behaviour of the hydrogel was established. Furthermore load-bearing characteristics of the hydrogel have also been demonstrated...|$|R

In short-chain dicarboxylic acids, {{a limited number of}} hydrocarbons between the two carboxylic groups are thought to form a V- or U-shaped structure and interact with phospholipids in the RBC membrane. In benzene dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic acids, a part of benzene nucleus between the two carboxylic groups is thought to enter the plasma membrane and act on acyl-chain in phospholipids in the RBC membrane. For dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic acids, limited numbers of hydrocarbons in molecules are speculated to enter the RBC membrane with the hydrophilic carboxylic groups remaining outside, stabilizing the structure of the cell membrane and resulting in an increase in osmotic resistance in rat RBCs...|$|R

Samples (n = 20) collected at urban locations in New Delhi, i. e., at Employees' State Insurance (ESI) hospital and National Physical Laboratory (NPL) also show high abundances of these metals in the particles. Filter samples are also analyzed for water-soluble dicarboxylic acids (C- 2 -C- 12) and related compounds (oxo-carboxylic acids and alpha-dicarbonyls). Terephthalic acid (tPh) was found to {{account for more than}} 77 % of total diacids determined in OWB aerosols.

40|$|Products of {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) from aromatic {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) – 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid, dicarboxylic acids, nitromonoaromatics, and furandiones – were evaluated for their potential to serve as anthropogenic SOA tracers {{with respect to their}} (1)  ambient concentrations and detectability in PM 2. 5 in Iowa City, IA, USA; (2)  gas–particle partitioning behaviour; and (3)  source specificity by way of correlations with primary and secondary source tracers and literature review. A widely used tracer for toluene-derived SOA, 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid was only detected in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 1) at low but consistently measurable ambient concentrations (averaging 0. 3  ng m − 3). Four aromatic dicarboxylic acids were detected at relatively higher concentrations (9. 1 – 34. 5  ng m − 3), of which phthalic acid was the most abundant. Phthalic acid had a low particle-phase fraction (F p [*]=[*]  0. 26) likely due to quantitation interferences from phthalic anhydride, while 4 -methylphthalic acid was predominantly in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 0. 82). Phthalic acid and 4 -methylphthalic acid were both highly correlated with 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid (r s [*]=[*] 0. 73, p [*]=[*] 0. 003; r s [*]=[*] 0. 80, p [*]<[*] 0. 001, respectively), suggesting that they were derived from aromatic VOCs. <b>Isophthalic</b> and terephthalic <b>acids,</b> however, were detected only in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 1), and correlations suggested association with primary emission sources. Nitromonoaromatics were dominated by particle-phase concentrations of 4 -nitrocatechol (1. 6  ng m − 3) and 4 -methyl- 5 -nitrocatechol (1. 6  ng m − 3) that were associated with biomass burning. Meanwhile, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrobenzyl alcohol was detected in a lower concentration (0. 06  ng m − 3) in the particle phase only (F p [*]=[*] 1) and is known as a product of toluene photooxidation. Furandiones in the atmosphere have only been attributed to the photooxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons; however the substantial partitioning toward the gas phase (F p  [*]≤[*]  0. 16) and their water sensitivity limit their application as tracers. The outcome of this study is the demonstration that 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid, phthalic acid, 4 -methylphthalic acid, and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrobenzyl alcohol are good candidates for tracing SOA from aromatic VOCs...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the use of}} electron spin resonance spectroscopy in investigations of the reduction {{of a number of}} organic compounds by solutions of sodium in liquid ammonia. Solutions of alkali metals in ammonia contain the ammoniated electron, in all its possible forms, and essentially this species is the effective reducing agent. The simple reduction step is the one-electron addition to a suitable substrate molecule, which may then undergo a number of successive reactions before a stable product is formed. The nature of the metal-ammonia solutions, and the paths the reductions may take are discussed in Chapter 2. The simple one-electron reduction product, a radical-anion, is often too short-lived to allow observation by normal static methods, and therefore a relatively high concentration of radicals must be artificially maintained to permit their detection. Basically two different approaches have been utilised: i. 	Stabilising the radicals either by direct production or trapping in solid matrix, therefore preventing the radicals from reacting, and ii. 	Production of a high steady state concentration of radicals in solution by either continuous electrolysis or buy use of a flow system, A brief discussion of the methods used in the study of transient radicals is given in Chapter 1. Generally the e. s. r spectra are less well-resolved in solid matrices than in solutions, and for species showing a large amount of hyperfine structure, production of the radicals in solution is preferred. A rapid mixing device has been developed to allow observation of transient intermediates by e. s. r. spectroscopy. The mixer was designed particularly for the type of system and experimental technique under consideration here, and is based on a design used in biological kinetic studies. Observations 2 - 5 msec. after mixing are possible, and this represents a considerable advantage over the widely used aqueous solution mixing device, where observations are made on a 10 - 2 sec. time scale. The mixing chamber and experimental technique are presented in Chapter 3. Analysis of the e. s. r. spectrum of a compound allows the calculation of its unpaired electron distribution, the coupling constants being related to the unpaired electron spin density. Spin densities have been calculated theoretically, and it has been found that simple Hückel calculations of pi-electron spin densities show good agreement with “experimentally” determined values. Accordingly, both Hückel and McLachlan spin densities have been calculated for most of the substrates used, and in general it is found that the McLachlan treatment gives better agreement with experiment than the simple Hückel model. A brief discussion of the relevant molecular orbital theory is presented in Chapter 1, and the computer programme used to perform the theoretical calculations is given in Appendix 3. Analysis of the e. s. r. spectra I sometimes very difficult if a large number of lines are present, and two computer programmes used for the simulation of single and mixed e. s. r. spectra are given in Appendices 2 and 3 respectively. In Chapter 4 is described the reduction of a number of aryl halides. With the exception of fluoro-substituted compounds, the halo-pyridines, pyrimidines, benzenes, biphenyls, and naphthalene, all give the e. s. r. spectrum of the radical-anions of the parent compounds on reduction. On the other hand, fluorine is retained as is evident from the spectra, for a much longer period, as shown by observation 0. 1 and 1. 0 sec. after mixing, while static experiments show some products to be stable {{for longer periods of time}} in this system. Mechanisms have been proposed to account for these reductions. Halobenzonitriles have also been studies and the results are in agreement with the proposed reduction mechanisms. Reduction of pyridine, pyrimidine and some simple ring-substituted compounds has been investigated, and their e. s. r. spectra characterised in most cases. Previous attempts to observe the pyridine radical-anion had failed, the spectrum of the 4, 4 ’-bipyridyl being obtained instead. Observations 0. 1, 1. 0 sec. and 1 min. after mixing allow the reduction path of these nitrogen heterocyclics to be followed, and it is shown that pyridine, pyrimidine and simple alkyl- and alkoxy-substituted pyridines undergo dimerization to give exclusively the respective 4, 4 ’-dimers, unless the 4 -position is blocked. Pyridine-N-oxide undergoes a more complex reduction, giving pyridine-N-oxide, pyridine and finally 2, 2 ’-bipridyl radical-anions. Pyridine- 2 -carboxylic acid gives a spectrum suggesting some form of nitrogen-hydrogen bonded species. Pyridine dicarboxylic acids all have on feature in common, a splitting from an extra proton which arises through a protonated nitrogen atom. Reduction of pyridine in the presence of excess ethanol also shows this feature, and its spectrum is due to C 5 H 5 NH. Calculation of the nitrogen sigma-pi interaction parameters gives values of QNN=+ 28. 5 oe. And QCNN=-O. 5 oe., in good agreement with results obtained previously. Theoretical calculations have been performed, and comparison with experiment has enabled the assignment of coupling constants to particular positions, and also gives the best set of parameter values required for the calculations, providing a check with values used for comparison with other measurements. The results are presented in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 is described the reduction of benzoic acid and some of its simple ring-substituted derivate. Ionisation occurs initially, followed by reduction to give the corresponding radical-anions. These species are short-lived, as no spectra are obtained when observations are performed 0. 1 sec. after mixing. No further paramagnetic products are found. Molecular orbital calculations have been performed for each compound, and excellent agreement with experiment obtained using the parameter values kC’-C= 1, 2, kC-O- 1, 6, hO- 2. 0 for the ionised carboxyl group. Reduction of nitro-substituted <b>isophthalic</b> and terephthalic <b>acids</b> shows the presence of two distinct species, one being unstable while the other is stable for more than one hour, in both cases. The unstable species show a large splitting from an extra proton which is thought to be attached to the nitrogen atom. This proton is lost to give the stable radicals, experimental evidence and comparison with computer calculations suggesting them to be the nitro-substituted radical-anions. ...|$|R
