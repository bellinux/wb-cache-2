40|$|Milk fat {{products}} (MFP), including {{butter and}} low-fat dairy spreads, are {{a specific type}} of ready-to-eat food known as water-in-fat emulsions, in which the behavior of microbial foodborne pathogens such as Listeria onocytogenes is not clearly known. This study investigated the growth and survival of L. monocytogenes, and of Listeria innocua as a surrogate for L. monocytogenes, in these foods using challenge testing. Three commercial MFPs with various fat contents (butter, <b>half</b> <b>butter</b> and low-fat dairy spread) and two samples of traditional churned butter with various water droplet sizes were artificially contaminated with Listeria. Total mesophilic microflora including lactic acid bacteria, pH and Listeria were monitored throughout the shelf life. The growth potential of Listeria was calculated {{in the course of the}} shelf life and remains below the limit value of 0. 5 log cfu/g during the whole shelf life in any of thebutter. However, the concentration of Listeria remained stable during the shelf life in the tested MFPs (commercial and churned) except in the commercial low-fat dairy spread in which Listeria decreased gradually...|$|E

50|$|Both lye {{rolls and}} {{pretzels}} are typically covered with salt, preferably pretzel salt, a large-grained salt made from compressed smaller salt particles, which reduces moisture absorption and the hardness {{of the salt}} grain. As a snack, lye rolls may also be sold covered with baked cheese, although this is more recent and less common. Typically they are cut in <b>half</b> and <b>buttered,</b> as large soft pretzels often are in Germany and Switzerland as well. Other toppings for lye rolls nowadays also include poppyseed, sesame, and other seeds {{as an alternative to}} salt.|$|R
5000|$|A {{butterfly}} cake is {{a variant}} of cupcake, also called fairy cake for its fairy-like [...] "wings". They {{can be made from}} any flavor of cake. The top of the fairy cake is cut off or carved out with a spoon, and cut in <b>half.</b> Then, <b>butter</b> cream, whipped cream or other sweet filling (e.g. jam) is spread into the hole. Finally, the two cut halves are stuck into the butter cream to resemble butterfly wings. The wings of the cake are often decorated using icing to form various patterns.|$|R

25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of butter was made by hand, on farms. The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal cream separator was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval. This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than <b>half</b> the <b>butter</b> produced in the United States was factory made; Europe followed suit shortly after.|$|R
50|$|While Kingaroy's supply benefited in {{the short}} term from Wondai's closure, {{ultimately}} it was not enough to sustain the business. In May 1977 it was announced that both Nanango and the Kingaroy butter factories would close and that all cream supplies would be diverted to Murgon. With a large number of suppliers leaving the industry, and manufacturing and other costs dramatically increasing, it was no longer economically viable for the factories to stay open. By the time of Kingaroy Butter Factory's closure, there were only 38 suppliers and only one and a <b>half</b> tonnes of <b>butter</b> produced a week, a far cry from its interwar heyday.|$|R

Halfway through the challenge, another prop was added; a red cape and hood. None of the other usual props from the [...] "Iconography Room" [...] were allowed. The guest judge is iJustine, better known as iJustine. The second part of this episode received negative reactions from viewers, quickly garnering more [...] "dislikes" [...] than [...] "likes" [...] on the video, due to the elimination of Joule Thief, something which Goyette spoke about in his Q&A presented by The YOMYOMF Network.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other kind}} of [...] "cup cake" [...] {{referred}} to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup, instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as 1234 cakes or quarter cakes, so called because they {{are made up of}} four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs. They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake, due to using about <b>half</b> as much <b>butter</b> and eggs compared to pound cake. The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker; [...] "cup cake" [...] uses a volume measurement, and [...] "pound cake" [...] uses a weight measurement.|$|R

40|$|Citation: Nystrom, Amer B. The {{effect of}} {{percentage}} of water, salt and acidity of butter to its keeping qualities. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: With {{the advance of}} civilization {{there seems to be}} an increase in the demand for more fancy as well as more wholesome articles of food. This is not only in the line of delicacies but in staple articles as well. This increase in demand is very marked in the products of the dairy and creamery. Milk has been a very important article of food for ages back, but it was almost solely used as a beverage, and no attempt was made to find its composition or to learn what could be made of it. Butter, as we all know is made from the fat in milk. It is one of the oldest of foods. Even as far back as 2000 years B. C. we learn that the Hindoos were interested in cattle raising and valued their cows according to their yeild of butter. We know nothing of the quality of the butter made at that time, however,expect that it must have contained about as much casein as fat, judging from the Greek derivation of the word "butter" which means, cow cheese. Butter was first used as an ointment for injuries to the skin, later it was used to enrich cooked foods, and only the rich could afford to use it. It was seldom eaten fresh, the common practice was to melt it and store it underground, leaving it there for years, sometimes as long as a <b>half</b> century. <b>Butter</b> -making as we know it today has been in practice for a number of generations, but it has been only within the last twenty years that any attempt has been made to improve the product or make investigations concerning it. Even with the advanced learning on the dairy line, that we have today, there are many points that we are not clear on or indeed know nothing about. We know that bacteria...|$|R
5000|$|The crisis {{prompted}} {{a variety of}} responses from individuals and organisations in Norway and neighbouring countries. A Norwegian newspaper sought to attract new subscribers by offering them a <b>half</b> kilo of <b>butter,</b> while students auctioned butter on the Internet {{in a bid to}} raise funds for graduation parties. A number of individuals were apprehended by the authorities for attempting to smuggle butter across the border, while Swedes posted online adverts offering to drive butter to Norwegians at prices of up to NOK 460 (€59; £50; $77) per packet. Danish dairy businessman Karl Christian Lund sought to drum up demand for his own butter by handing out thousands of packs in Kristiansand and Oslo, while Swedish supermarkets offered free butter to Norwegian customers to entice them to do their shopping across the border. On the Swedish side of the southeastern border at the Svinesund, stores reported selling twenty times as much butter as normal, with nine out of ten buyers being Norwegians. A Danish television show broadcast an [...] "emergency appeal" [...] for viewers to send butter and gathered 4,000 packs to be distributed to butter-starved Norwegians. Danish airports and ferries crossing the straits between the two countries kept a stock of butter in their duty-free stores.|$|R
