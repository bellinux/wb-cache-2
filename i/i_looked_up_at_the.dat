60|$|The {{rest of his}} remark was {{drowned out}} in a clap of thunder. Somewhat startled, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little noise she made. [...] "TWICE!" [...] she said, smiling indulgently, [...] "to-day!" [...] (Even {{the smile}} was Altiora's.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> big stone {{buildings}} before us. My {{father was}} behind those walls. I glanced at Kate. The poor girl was in tears.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon, [...] There was {{in their}} tiny tune A dying fetch like broken words, When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon.|$|R
5000|$|... "Miagete Goran Yoru no Hoshi o" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Up</b> <b>at</b> the Stars of the Night) (Kyu Sakamoto cover) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him to {{read the}} signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, Mannion {{stepped back}} a few paces, and pointed in the {{direction}} of the fishing-hamlet from which I had departed.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Thark, a smile upon my own lips, {{for here}} in truth was greater {{need for a}} smiling face than a {{trembling}} chin.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. I couldn't say, but in {{any case}} I was too clever for him. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars, and yawned loud at them as if I was {{tremendous}} sleepy.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Miss Haldin in {{sympathetic}} consternation, but Miss Haldin {{was looking}} down calmly at her mother. The latter said-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and he was}} as calm as when he had joked with me {{a quarter}} of an hour since.|$|R
60|$|Again we paused. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} an inextricable medley of {{emotions}} struggling together in my mind, and shook my head.|$|R
6000|$|Judge Hoover {{stepped into}} a dingy, small shop. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sign, and saw [...] "Mike O'Bader, Boot and Shoe Maker," [...] on it. Some wild geese passed above, honking clearly. I {{scratched}} my ear and frowned, and then trailed into the shop.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{opened my}} eyes. The hills were still there, dark and solid. It had not been, then, a volcano or an earthquake. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky {{and saw a}} comet-like trail {{crossing}} the zenith and extending westward--a fiery trail waning fainter and narrower each moment.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> balcony. There was a face {{hanging over}} the red plush rail. It looked {{to me as if}} it had some hidden sorrow. I'd noticed it before, when we were dancing around, and I had {{wondered}} what the trouble was. Now I began to see.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. His good, homely {{face was}} close to mine, and in his eyes was an unmistakable look of love and tenderness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Cavalcanti, baffled, {{and sick}} with sudden dismay. I saw Cavalcanti's eye, which had grown dull, kindle anew. He stooped over the {{prostrate}} man.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her wrung {{and bitter}} face. [...] "I haven't hated it," [...] I lied, my voice near {{breaking}} {{with the pain}} of it all. [...] "Have you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ten days," [...] I said; [...] "that leaves--" [...] <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun for a moment, {{and then}} {{saw that it}} was halfway from the zenith to the western edge of things. [...] "Four days! ... Cavor, we mustn't sit here and dream. How do you think we may begin?" ...|$|E
60|$|He paused: {{the birds}} went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I almost {{wondered}} {{they did not}} check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended revelation; but {{they would have had}} to wait many minutes--so long was the silence protracted. At last <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} I {{lay in the}} open starlight among the stones and brush, out where Steele and I always met. He lay there with me, but while <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars he had his face covered with his hands. For I had given him my proofs of the guilt of Diane Sampson's father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Strong!--of {{course it}} is, {{unnecessarily}} strong," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> its edge, {{over which the}} water, rendered muddy by the rains, flowed in a considerable volume. [...] "What think you, Lumley?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} used to him, papa. He seemed {{exceedingly}} tall to me at first--like a tower when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; but, on the whole, I would rather not have him otherwise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, granny," [...] said I, with a flutter at my heart, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her thin}} careworn face, {{and began to}} break the ice with caution, [...] "I've come--I--there's a little piece of--of--" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{light in}} the sky had gone out. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl before me as she stood gazing into the flame, her {{features}} in strong relief, her lips parted, her hair red-gold, and the rounded outlines of her figure softened. I wondered why I had never before known her beauty. Perchance it was because, until that night, I {{had never seen her}} heart.|$|E
60|$|As I rang at the gate-bell, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house. Sure enough all the top {{windows in}} front were closed with {{shutters}} and barred. I was let in {{by a man}} in livery; who, however, in manners and appearance, looked much more like a workman in disguise than a footman. He had a very suspicious eye, and he fixed it on me unpleasantly when I handed him my card.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> serene, winged, sightless face, and {{a whisper}} sounded {{on and on}} in my mind in its mute presence, [...] "I know more than Apollo; I know more than Apollo." [...] How strange that this mere deaf-and-dumbness should seem more real, more human even, than {{anything}} or any one else in Lady Pollacke's elegant drawing-room. But self-possession was creeping back. [...] "Who," [...] I asked, [...] "is he? And who sculped him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. [...] "Oh, if {{you have}} any notion of being married I wish you would right off," [...] I said eagerly. [...] "Any wedding would do just as well as Pamelia's. Please do." ...|$|R
60|$|No wonder if, {{with such}} facts on my memory since my childhood, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> that Souffriere with awe, as at a giant, obedient though clumsy, beneficent though terrible, reposing aloft among the clouds when his {{appointed}} work was done.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Nye, [...] And {{he gazed}} upon me; [...] And he rose with a sigh, [...] And said, [...] "Can this be? [...] We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor,"-- [...] And {{he went for}} that heathen Chinee.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, {{he was a}} {{thoroughbred}} tramp, burly, dirty, generally unkempt, but, {{unlike most}} tramps, he looked very much frightened. His position, on a high crotch of an apple-tree, was not altogether comfortable, and although, for the present, it was safe, the fellow {{seemed to have a}} wavering faith in the strength of apple-tree branches, and the moment he saw me, he earnestly besought me to take that dog away, and let him down.|$|E
6000|$|At last {{there came}} {{a time when it}} was evident that the patient was sinking fast. He might die at any moment. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke, [...] "There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives. I have been {{thinking}} so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake! We shall operate just above the ear." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{first glance}} I did not {{recognise}} the speaker; but then as I cleared my mind I {{saw it was}} Ercole Piacentini. What was he doing here? Then I remembered that {{it was on the}} road to Forli. I supposed he had received orders to leave Castello and {{was on his way to}} his old haunts. However, I did not want to speak to him; I bent down, and again clasped my head in my hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her; {{she did not}} ask me what I {{had been}} {{thinking}} about nor remark upon my silence. She, too, had been wrapped in revery; her face was grave. She raised her arms from the wall and stood up.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her in surprise. I {{was in my}} own room, seated by the dressing-table, late at night, when we'd gone up to bed; and Minnie {{was beside}} me, {{standing}} up, with her bedroom candle in that pretty white little hand of hers.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her again, when I {{had read}} it. She lifted her hand once more, {{and pointed to}} the {{handkerchief}} round her neck. As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it, the fair white silk changed horribly in color--the fair white silk became darkened and drenched in blood.|$|R
