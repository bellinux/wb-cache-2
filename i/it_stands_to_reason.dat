25|$|In August 1932 the {{announced}} Internordic Catholic rally {{finally took}} place in Copenhagen {{in the form of}} a Eucharistic Congress. All five countries were represented. Bishop Smit, who had resigned in 1927, was replaced by Bishop-elect Mgr. Jacques Mangers, S.M. (1889-1972), Vicar of South Norway, that country having in 1931 been divided into three jurisdictions. Among the many foreign dignitaries present for the occasion we find, once more, Cardinal van Rossum (who died only some weeks later) and Cardinal August Hlond of Gniezno and Poznań. <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that the busy programme of a Eucharistic Congress did not allow time for a formal Conference meeting.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{disclosure}} {{that the}} judge may be biased, {{the parties to the}} suit may choose to request {{that the judge}} recuse himself and have the proceedings started before another judge. If the parties choose to proceed on with the claim without any objections to the judge, <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that a court will infer a waiver to the accusation of bias if either party had not raised an objection to bias at the commencement of a suit or at any time during it, following the approach taken by Locabail which was applied by the Federal Court of Malaysia in M. G. G. Pillai v. Tan Sri Dato' Vincent Tan Chee Yioun (2002).|$|E
500|$|Many {{people have}} accused Steorn of {{engaging}} in a publicity stunt although Steorn denied such accusations. Eric Berger, writing on the Houston Chronicle website, commented: [...] "Steorn is a former e-business company that saw its market vanish during the dot.com bust. <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that Steorn has retooled as a Web marketing company and is using the [...] "free energy" [...] promotion as a platform to show future clients how it can leverage print advertising and a slick Web site to promote their products and ideas". Thomas Ricker at Engadget suggested that Steorn's free-energy claim was a ruse to improve brand recognition {{and to help them}} sell Hall probes, while Josh Catone, features editor for Mashable, believes that it was merely an elaborate hoax.|$|E

2500|$|... "Indeed, many {{must have}} {{reacted to the}} {{catastrophe}} with despair and total abandonment of Judaism. Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals {{are known to have}} turned pagan before the war, and <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion. It is impossible to determine the number who joined the budding Christian movement and the number who disappeared into the polytheist majority." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dancing," [...] she said, [...] "was exercise, {{regulated}} and timed by music; and <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason,</b> that <b>it</b> must be {{the best}} of all exercise for a delicate person, especially as it could be taken within doors, and in all states of the weather." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{like the}} look o' things, Mr. Charles," [...] Tim Kelly said. [...] "There's nothing but boys altogether, white and black.

2500|$|Art {{historian}} Ronald Pickvance {{says that}} with [...] "its arbitrary collage of separate motifs," [...] The Starry Night [...] "is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'." [...] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes {{them with the}} village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination. Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east, as does Jirat-Wasiutyński. Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh [...] "telescoped" [...] the view in certain of {{the pictures of the}} view from his window, and <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the morning star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of planet.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, José Mourinho again {{found himself}} causing {{controversy}} after commenting that Muntari, a practicing Muslim, was lacking fitness and energy due to fasting {{during the month}} of Ramadan. He was reported to have said [...] "Muntari had some problems related to Ramadan, perhaps with this heat it's not good for him to be doing this fasting. Ramadan has not arrived at the ideal moment for a player to play a football match." [...] However, since these comments, many Muslims and non-Muslims have come out in defence of Mourinho, saying that no offense was meant towards the player, but while the manager could have been more tactful in his treatment of the issue <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that a lack of food and water will affect a player's stamina and energy level.|$|E
2500|$|The Muralitharan Report {{produced}} by the University of Western Australia's study has considered the Richards study done in 1999 to evaluate the error margin. University of South Australia's study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama argued that the Richards study which was presented by the University of Western Australia's study has used a rigid aluminium bar that only rotated in the horizontal plane to introduce such error margin. Pathegama's report stated that [...] "in view of the system used in the test itself yielding considerable error even with a rigid aluminum bar (an accuracy level of approximately 4 degrees {{as stated in the}} Murali Report), <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that the error margin would be considerably larger when tracking skin markers on a spin bowler's moving upper limb by this same system".|$|E

"I didn't {{have to wait}} so {{very long}} before Mr. Towser got tired of scratching, and then I crept out, {{counting}} on going straight home, for <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that Mrs. Bunny and Sonny Bunny would be worried because I'd been away so long; but before I'd taken half a dozen hops whom should I hear calling me but Cheeko's oldest boy.|$|R

[...] "Don't <b>it</b> <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> {{that the}} enemy must be between us an' Suakim? and that's the same as sayin' they're between us an' our friends.

2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, {{the money that we}} found in our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] surely it would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah," [...] and thus surely <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason,</b> [...] "How much more then if we go to Keilah?" [...] (7) Also in [...] the prophet asked, [...] "And if in a land of Peace where you are secure" [...] you are overcome, is it not logical to ask, [...] "How will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?" [...] (8) [...] reasoned, [...] "Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth," [...] and does it not follow, [...] "How much more the wicked and the sinner?" [...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus surely it is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Burke assured Mrs. Cliff and his {{passengers}} {{that although}} their chase after the steamer might reasonably suggest a needle and a haystack, still, if the Dunkery Beacon kept {{down the coast}} in as straight a line as she could for Cape St. Roque, and if the Summer Shelter also kept the same line, and if the yacht steamed a great deal faster than the other vessel, <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>it</b> could not be very long before the Summer Shelter overhauled the Dunkery Beacon.|$|R

60|$|Ah Cho {{had done}} nothing of which to be afraid. He had had no hand in the killing.

Chung Ga had been stabbed only twice. <b>It</b> <b>stood</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> that five or six men could not inflict two stab wounds.
