40|$|A liquid impregnated, {{plastic film}} (wet) {{capacitor}} was developed that {{is thought to}} be the most reliable and space efficient capacitor of any type ever produced for high voltage, pulse discharge service. The initial design stores five times the energy of a premium quality <b>dry</b> <b>capacitor</b> of equivalent energy and reliability. The technology, as well as a production capacitor design using this technology are described...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{parallel}} LC resonance type Fault Current Limiter (FCL). This structure has low cast because of using <b>dry</b> <b>capacitor</b> and non-superconducting inductor and fast operation. The proposed FCL {{is able to}} limit fault current in constant value near to pre-fault condition value against series resonance type FCL. In this way, the voltage of {{point of common coupling}} (PCC) will not change during fault. Analytical analysis is presented in detail and simulation results are involved to validate the effectiveness of this structure...|$|E
50|$|With over 100 inventions {{credited}} to him personally, {{one of the}} most important was the <b>dry</b> electrolytic aluminum <b>capacitor,</b> the solid-state magnesium/cupric sulfide rectifier (a device that converted regular household electric current for use in radios), and the vacuum tube relay, the quick heater vacuum tube, and the concept of a balanced-cell mercury battery.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{electronic}} components are stressed by the hot, cramped conditions inside a cabinet. Electrolytic <b>capacitors</b> <b>dry</b> out over time, {{and in many}} classic arcade cabinets their service life is nearing the end. If a game has its original raster monitor, it will usually need to be [...] "re-capped"—that is, some capacitors {{will need to be}} replaced so the monitor will deliver a proper image. Due {{to the size of the}} capacitors and the voltages present inside a video monitor, this can be a dangerous activity and should only be attempted by experienced hobbyists or professionals. If a monitor is broken, a replacement can usually be obtained via coin-op distributors or parts suppliers.|$|R
40|$|A 40 mu m {{multilayer}} bi-axially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film, was fabricated by the tenter {{process and}} its dielectric response was investigated after applying combined action of UV, humidity and heat. Dissipation factor (tan delta) and {{relative dielectric constant}} measurements were performed via the capacitance method for frequencies 20 Hz- 1 GHz. These {{results show that the}} relative dielectric constant (kappa') reduces towards ultra low values (1. 8) with an increasing number of applied UV-condensation cycles without any subsequent increase in the dielectric loss. Having no added physical porosity and absence of fluorine atoms, the irradiated BOPP structures offer significant advantages over poly(tetrafluoroethylene) PTFE due to reduced polarization effects, lower dielectric constant values and chemical stability to the adjacent copper or aluminium conductors. Possible application fields are <b>dry</b> type high-voltage <b>capacitors</b> and insulation within electronic components...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of ceramic}} {{materials}} is critical for new and improved electronic applications. Herein, the J-E response of Y 2 NiMnO 6 (YNMO) ceramics composited by a solid state reaction method was investigated. Sintering temperature and time {{were found to have}} significant influence on the ceramics electrical properties. In particular, higher temperatures and longer sintering times resulted in more favourable dielectric properties of the YNMO ceramics. A current of 40 mA/cm 2 at 20, 000 mV/cm was obtained by sintering at 1300 °C for 12 hours, whereas a current of 9 mA/cm 2 at 4000 mV/cm can be achieved by sintering at 1400 °C for 24 hours. These results will be useful for identifying applications for YNMO ceramics. The electrical properties of the YNMO ceramics can be tuned for different electronic components such as <b>dry</b> batteries and <b>capacitors.</b> Department of Electronic and Information Engineering 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcm...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of feeding a solid propellant into the {{discharge from the}} sides of the discharge was evaluated. The thrust/power ratio could be significantly effected by the included angle of V-shaped propellants and by the electrode length. This result implies that when results are compared at the same specific impulse it is possible to obtain higher thrust efficiencies. In particular, it was found that for a given discharge energy the thrust/power ratio correlated with propellant mass. Increasing the integral simultaneously increases both the gas dynamic and electromagnetic thrust. An analytic expression was formulated for ablated mass which comprehensively describes experimental data in terms of geometry and electrical parameters. The correlation of the product impulse x specific impulse with discharge energy was also described. It is suggested that the reliability of <b>dry</b> energy storage <b>capacitors</b> does not equal the reliability of liquid impregnated units when the comparison is made at the same joules/Kg rating...|$|R
