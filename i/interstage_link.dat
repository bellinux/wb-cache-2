40|$|Abstract-The {{well-known}} Clos {{network has}} been extensively used for telephone switching, multiprocessor interconnection and data communications. Much {{work has been done}} to develop analytical models for understanding the routing blocking probability of the Clos network. However, none of the analytical models for estimating the blocking probability of this type of network have taken into account the very real possibility of the interstage links in the network failing. In this paper, we consider the routing between arbitrary network inputs and outputs in the Clos network in the presence of <b>interstage</b> <b>link</b> faults. In particular, we present an analytical model for the routing blocking probability of the Clos network which incorporates the probability of <b>interstage</b> <b>link</b> failure to allow for a more realistic and useful determination of the approximation of blocking probabiliiy. We also conduct extensive Simulations to validate the model. Our analytical and simulation results demonstrate that for a relatively small <b>interstage</b> <b>link</b> failure probability, the blocking behavior of the Clos network {{is similar to that of}} a fault-free network, and indicate that the Clos network has a good fault-tolerant capability, The new integrated analytical model can guide network designers in the determination of the effects of network failure on the overall connecting capability of the network and allows for the examination of the relationship between network utilization and network failure.

40|$|Abstract â€” High-speed {{interconnects}} {{are frequently}} {{used to provide}} scalable communication on increasingly large high-end computing systems. Often, these networks are nonblock-ing, where there exist independent paths between all pairs of nodes in the system allowing for simultaneous communication with zero network contention. This performance comes at a heavy cost, however, {{as the number of}} components needed (and hence cost) increases superlinearly with the number of nodes in the system. In this paper, we study the behavior of real and synthetic supercomputer workloads to understand the impact of net-work structure on overall performance. Starting from a fully nonblocking network, we begin by assessing the worse-case performance degradation caused by removing <b>interstage</b> communication <b>links,</b> potentially resulting in blocking in the communication network. We also study the impact of several factors on this behavior, including system workloads, multi-core processors, and switch crossbar sizes. Our observations show that a significant {{reduction in the number of}} <b>interstage</b> <b>links</b> can be tolerated very on all of the workloads analyzed, causing less than 5 % overall loss of performance in the worst case.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{non-blocking}} properties of the Generalized Parallel Delta Networks and their application to the photonic switching environment. The peculiar characteristics of GPDNs well suit the constraints arising from this new application area In particular, these characteristics consist in a low number of stages and a high fault tolerance due to the stacking of identical Delta networks. Moreover, it is here demonstrated that the crosstalk due to the switch crossover can be completely avoided {{by means of a}} proper dimensioning of the network parameters. A new classification of the non-blocking properties is proposed. In particular, a new non-blocking condition, named as strong, has been defined. It establishes that two paths are not in conflict if they do not share any switching element. The strong non-blocking condition has been considered together with the traditional one. This second condition is normally applied in the electronic environment; as {{it is based on the}} unshareability of the <b>interstage</b> <b>links,</b> here, it is named as weak. The conditions which have to be satisfied so that a Generalized Parallel Delta Network can be weakly and/or strongly non-blocking have been found and demonstrated...|$|R

For example, for the Delta IV that carried the Wideband Global SATCOM satellite (WGS-6) into orbit for the U.S. Air Force, ATK supplied the <b>interstage</b> connector that <b>linked</b> the Common Booster Core and the cryogenic second stage, a centerbody that connects the liquid oxygen tank to liquid hydrogen tanks, a thermal shield for the RS-68 engine, the composite payload fairing, and numerous pieces of hardware for securing the payload.|$|R
