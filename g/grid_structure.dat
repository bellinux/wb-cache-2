40|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>structures</b> are {{intended}} to aid graphic designers by providing a foundation for consistent communication; however, the usage of <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> is rapidly descending. Numerous designers have expressed concern regarding habitual layouts produced by traditional grid design, and many have discarded the grid altogether. Because the grid is an organizational device, which allows for easy collaboration and faster communication, {{it is important that}} it not be abandoned. Not only does this thesis examine the evolution of grid design, it also discusses its potential future. By establishing a methodological approach to create conceptually dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>structures,</b> non-traditional alternative <b>grid</b> solutions are created. Pushing the boundaries of <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> allows the designer to regain interest through the design of the conceptual grid. Experimentation was conducted on a series of posters for ActionAid to demonstrate the methodological process and support the study of conceptual <b>grid</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

The People of Britain pavilion was partially constructed under the vaults of the railway viaduct. The visitors' route looped past a pool of water containing a sculpture of Orpheus by Heinz Henghes before ending at a two-storey building containing information about the Romans, Saxons and Iron Age. Cadbury-Brown described this building as Miesian in design with its <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> and sliding doors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Grids</b> <b>structures</b> {{which form}} {{the main body}} of the score {{immediately}} project unique notational environments within which performers may operate. The paper aims to understand how and why <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> are used in contemporary notational practice, to discover differences in the approach to their employment, and how they can influence composer’s decision making. Some of the first instances of <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> in western experimental music scores are seen in Morton Feldman’s graph pieces from the Projection and Intersection series (1951 - 3). Feldman’s notions of framing material (in his own words, he is not “creating music, it’s already there”) underpin his use of grids, and this provides an analytical approach for the study of scores by more recent composers. Examples from scores by Michael Pisaro, Phill Niblock, John Lely, and the author’s own recent music are reviewed for their individual use of <b>grid</b> <b>structures.</b> In particular, the manner in which <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> can be used to encompass many parameters, or to focus on one specific parametric variation, is considered. From this, the paper explores what can be conveyed by the use of a grid in {{the main body of}} the score. By including what the composers themselves say about their own use of grids, and related comments from performers, the paper establishes a scholarly insight into the interpretive decisions of musicians prompted by the use of <b>grid</b> <b>structures.</b> To understand further the communicative aspects of <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> and their use in creative formats, the nature of grids in the visual arts will be discussed. The work of artists such as Agnes Martin, François Morollet, James Hugonin and Hanne Darboven will be presented to identify connections with the use of grids in music notation, and how these are interpreted by the observer. The viewpoints of graphic designers such as Mark Boulton are also included to consider the wide-ranging capabilities of <b>grid</b> <b>structures,</b> providing avenues for further creativity in all areas of musical activity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} main trends in the development of space <b>grid</b> <b>structures.</b> In order to reach the purpose it is necessary to conduct a review of the known structural concepts, nodal connections and specifics of the space <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> and to make conclusions on feasibility improvement of the considered structural concepts that make it possible to develop new solutions without disadvantages residing in the analogues. Analysis of papers written by foreign and national scientists and devoted to theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of stress-strain state, influence of different factors on it and geometrical optimization and designing of space <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> has been conducted in order to achieve the objectives. Space <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> and, in particular, flat double-layer grid and most frequent nodes have been studied in the paper. The paper contains a short review of the history on development of space <b>grid</b> <b>structures.</b> It has been found that a rapid development of structural designs was caused by scientific and technical progress and, in particular, improvement of physical and mechanical properties of materials, development of calculation methods, application of software systems for simulating behavior of the structure under load, which significantly increased the calculation accuracy and reduced complexity of design. It has been also established that main parameters that have influence on effectiveness of a structural design are geometric dimensions of its modular elements, ratio of its depth to the span. The world experience on development of connection components has been studied in the paper. The paper presents general classification of nodal connections. Main advantages and disadvantages of existing space <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> are highlighted and it allows to determine possible methods for their improvement. Theoretical research has permitted to establish that the main direction of spatial <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> improvement consists in development of new node connection types. Several methods for node improvement have been proposed while taking into account the obtained results. </p...|$|R

Ultra-thin Au films with varying thickness were investigated in terms of sheet resistance and transmittance. The optimal thickness was achieved via simulation of organic solar cells. Finally, we present a comparison of inverted solar cells with an active area of about 1 cm 2 both with Au films and Au <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> as front contact in terms of photovoltaic performance, reproducibility, and degradation.

Art historian Christopher Green writes that the [...] "deformations of lines" [...] allowed by mobile perspective in the head of Metzinger's Tea-time and Gleizes's Portrait of Jacques Nayral [...] "have seemed tentative to historians of Cubism.

While Metzinger's distillation is noticeable during the latter half of 1915 and early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918.|$|E
