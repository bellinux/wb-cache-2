5|$|The lack of {{maternal}} health contributes to future economic disparities <b>for</b> <b>mothers</b> and their children. Poor maternal health often affects a child’s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman’s ability {{to participate in}} economic activities. Therefore, national health programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the maternal health care needs of women across India.|$|E
5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility <b>for</b> <b>mothers</b> who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E
