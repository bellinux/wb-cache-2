40|$|Process-oriented IT {{management}} has gained {{more and more}} significance due {{to the need to}} specify and control IT infrastructures and services. An indicator for this circumstance is the success of the IT Infrastructure Library and the enhanced Telecom Operations Map. A process-oriented view allows administrators to specify management tasks and to decompose complex tasks into process chains and hierarchies. Policy based management is a promising candidate for implementation of processes, as it delivers a powerful concept for the implementation of management tasks. Policies are well suited for large scale systems, as the distributed execution in heterogeneous environments is one of the important features of policy architectures. In this paper we introduce patterns for the automated generation of policies from process specifications. To achieve the translation between process and policy specification, we leverage common characteristics of processes and policies and define mappings that serve as generic translation patterns. The use of these patterns allows automated translation of process definitions to policies. The approach enables high-level, <b>intuitive</b> <b>management</b> specification, while taking a step towards augmented automation and integration at the operational level. We derive requirements imposed by the translation and present ProPolis, a policy language incorporating those requirements...|$|E

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the circumstantial aspects of human-like interaction. Its purpose is {{in the first place}} to design and develop a {{general-purpose}} situation model, which would enhance any natural interaction system by providing knowledge on the interaction context, and secondly to implement an <b>intuitive</b> <b>management</b> tool to edit the knowledge base of this situation model. The development of both the model and the edition tool has followed the usual processes of software engineering: requirements elicitation and specification, problem analysis, design of a solution, system implementation and validation. In more specific terms, an spiral lifecyle composed of three phases was followed, which is a convenient approach in research projects as all the system requirements might not be known from the very beginning. After the implementation was completed, an evaluation was carried out for observing the advantages of the edition tool over the manual edition of the model knowledge. The results of this evaluation showed that the tool provides a mechanism for the model management which is significantly faster and more accurate than the manual edition. Moreover, a subjective survey also revealed that the experiment subjects preferred the edition tool, as they considered it to be more comfortable, more intuitive, more reliable and more agile. The resulting general-purpose situation model and the edition tool are a significant contribution to the state of the art, as the previously existing situation models were ad-hoc models, i. e., models implemented for supporting an specific system, and their knowledge bases were edited manually. Finally, this work will be applied in a research project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Industry (CADOOH, TSI- 020302 - 2011 - 21), and for this reason some of the future works observed in this document will be executed in the coming months.

Secondly, using the questionnaire method as a research method, the objective of this paper is to provide some empirical evidences designed to assess the factors determining the Romanian company competitiveness on the competitive market. By using an initial dataset of 300 companies, which are part of the 14 fields of activity provided in the activity classification of the national economy, Reviewed NACE 2, we have made their classification on size classes, taking into account as classification criteria the number of employees, the annual net turnover and the value of the total assets held, then testing the opinions of the managers from the selected sample concerning the factors determining the competitiveness of the companies they manage.
