40|$|As an {{alternative}} and appealing approach to providing information security in wireless communication systems, secret key generation at physical layer has demonstrated its potential {{in terms of}} efficiency and reliability over traditional cryptographic methods. Without {{the necessity of a}} management centre for key distribution or reliance on computational complexity, physical layer key generation protocols enable two wireless entities to extract identical and dynamic keys from the randomness of the wireless channels associated with them. In this thesis, the reliability of secret key generation at the physical layer is examined in practical wireless channels with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Theoretical analyses are provided to relate <b>key</b> <b>match</b> rate with channel 2 ̆ 7 s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), degrees of channel reciprocity, and iterations of information reconciliation. In order to increase <b>key</b> <b>match</b> rate of physical layer secret key generation, improved schemes in the steps of channel estimation and sample quantization are proposed respectively. In the channel estimation step, multiple observations of the wireless channels are integrated with a linear processor to provide a synthesized and more accurate estimation of the wireless channel. In the sample quantization step, a magnitude based quantization method with two thresholds is proposed to quantize partial samples, where specific quantization areas are selected to reduce cross-over errors. Significant improvements in <b>key</b> <b>match</b> rate are proven for both schemes in theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. <b>Key</b> <b>match</b> rate can even achieve 100...|$|R

5000|$|In 1995, {{the game}} was decided by a [...] "Super Round," [...] a race that {{encompassed}} all abilities from the previous rounds. At {{the start of the}} round, players were shown five coloured circles, each with a letter or number, and the players had to memorize the sequence before making a parachute jump down 50 feet to the floor. They then entered the Kryptic Rings, a three-dimensional maze of interlocking rings with numbered and lettered junctions where following and correctly interpreting the sequence (by following the circles clockwise, starting with the circle of their colour) would lead each player to their correct exit. Each exit was marked with a letter, which they would memorize {{on their way to the}} next part of the race, the Laser Matrix, preceded by a computer where each player had to log in by hitting the letter <b>key</b> <b>matching</b> their exit. Each player then had to type in four words with a common thread, however each key corresponded to a different letter according to a code (such as each key giving the preceding letter). After cracking the code and typing in the four words, each player had to cross a corridor of shifting laser beams, where breaking each beam resulted in a seven-second penalty. Once out, the players entered the Response Revolve, a rotating cylinder where each player had to collect six batons of their colour from their holds, however, each baton could only be removed when a light by the baton flashed, and all lights flashed according to a sequence. Once all six batons were out and placed in the player's pedestal, each player had to run to the Krypton Mountain, where they first had to build a four-piece ladder, which they ascended before making a vertical climb up the Krypton Mountain, completing the race by grabbing a letter K of their colour at the top of the Krypton Mountain.|$|E

In this paper we support range queries {{by way of a}} tree algorithm, Decentralized Balanced Tree, that runs over any DHT system. Our algorithm is based on the B+ tree design that efficiently stores clustered data while maintaining a balanced load on hosts. The internal structure of the balanced tree is suited for range queries operations over many data distributions since it easily handles clustered data without losing performance. We analysed, and evaluated our algorithm under a simulated environment, to show it’s operation scalability for both insertions and queries. We will show that the system design imposes a fixed penalty over the DHT access cost, and thus inherits the scalability properties of the chosen underlying DHT. ...|$|E
30|$|In PKIS-II, group search keys ik and dk are unchanging {{irrespectively}} of session-changes. GM keeps a <b>key</b> <b>matching</b> information for groups, where group search keys ik and dk are matched to the dynamic group's session keys. When group members query GM with some data, the data should be encrypted with the group's session key, whereby a group member can be authenticated as a valid group member. Once a member passes the authentication, most processes are implemented by GM {{instead of the}} member. Receiving some data from a group member or a server, GM decrypts and re-encrypts the received data, so that GM gets to know all {{of the contents of}} documents and trapdoors every query time. However, only one trapdoor is sufficient for one keyword due to unchanging group search keys independently of session-changes.

Flexibility is essential to capture the multi-organizational and state-based nature of these systems, efficiency is necessary to cope with limitations of hardware resources.

Our protection model associates a password system with each object; the password system features a password for each access privilege defined for this object. A subject can access the object if it holds a <b>key</b> <b>matching</b> one of the passwords in the password system, and the access privilege corresponding to this password permits to accomplish the access.

Unfortunately, the derivations in [1] are incorrect, invalidating the results of the paper, in particular, Proposition 1. To explain the problems encountered in [1], in the present note we first re-derive the closed-loop dynamics of a system controlled using the IDA-PBC method in the case when the matching condition is not satisfied, that is, Eq.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{specialized}} memory structure called CA-RAM (Content Addressable Random Access Memory) to accelerate search operations present in many important real-world applications. Search operations can occupy {{a significant portion}} of total execution time and energy consumption, while posing a difficult performance problem to tackle using traditional memory hierarchy concepts. In essence, CA-RAM is a direct hardware implementation of the well-known hashing technique. Searchable records are stored in CA-RAM at a location determined by a hash function, defined on their search key. After a database has been built, looking up a record in CA-RAM typically involves a single memory access followed by a parallel <b>key</b> <b>matching</b> operation. Compared with a conventional CAM (Content Addressable Memory) solution, CA-RAM capitalizes on dense SRAM and DRAM designs, and achieves comparable search performance while occupying much smaller area and consuming significantly less power. This paper presents detailed design aspects of CA-RAM, to be integrated in future general-purpose and application-specific processors and systems. To further motivate and justify our approach, we present two real examples of using CA-RAM to build a high-performance search accelerator targeting: IP address lookup in core routers and trigram lookup in a large speech recognition system. ...|$|E

As a case study we present an image retrieval application implemented on top of FuzzyPeer. Users provide sample images whose sets of features are propagated through the peers. The answer consists of the top-k most similar images within the query horizon. In our system the participation of peers is ad-hoc and dynamic, their functionality is symmetric and there is no centralized index. In order to avoid flooding the network with messages, we develop a technique that takes advantage of the fuzzy nature of the queries. Specifically, some queries are “frozen ” inside the network, and are satisfied by the streaming results of similar queries that are already running. We describe several optimization techniques for single and multiple-attribute queries, and study their tradeoffs. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms by a prototype implementation on our P 2 P platform and a simulated large-scale network. Our results suggest that by reusing the existing streams, the scalability of the system improves both in terms of number of nodes and query throughput...|$|E
