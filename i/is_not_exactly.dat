5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> {{the same as the}} S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> {{known how}} many Jews were helped by Żegota, but {{at one point}} in 1943 it had 2,500 Jewish {{children}} under its care in Warsaw alone. At the end of the war, Sendler attempted to locate their parents but nearly all of them had died at Treblinka. It is estimated that about half of the Jews who survived the war (thus over 50,000) were aided in some shape or form by Żegota.|$|E
5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai {{is built}} on what was once an {{archipelago}} of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> known when these islands were first inhabited. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age. Perhaps {{at the beginning of}} the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.|$|E
5|$|The Forbidden City remains {{important}} in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are {{considered}} to be the most primitive within the family Formicidae. The body presents a wasp-like structure but with several ant-like characteristics. These ant-like characteristics, however, are primitive compared to more modern ants, and thus it is intermediate with other primitive ants and aculeate wasps. The presence of the metapleural gland, the nodiform (a structure resembling a node, which is a segment found between the mesosoma and gaster, the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma), the structure of the petiole and its general physical appearance of an ant concludes Sphecomyrma species are ants rather than wasps; the absence of the metapleural gland would mean that it is most likely a wasp instead of an ant. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> known which group of wasps are the descendants of Sphecomyrma, but members of the family Tiphiidae, particularly those in the genus Methocha are strikingly similar with Sphecomyrma. Wilson placed the genus closest to the Tiphiidae among extant wasps, but a later study published in 1975 derives the ants from a later clade and not to the Tiphiidae.|$|E

5|$|Following its May 1943 {{debut in}} action, {{during the second}} half of 1943, Schnaufer and his crew began experimenting with {{upward-firing}} autocannons, dubbed Schräge Musik. This allowed the night fighter to approach and attack the bombers from below—outside the enemy crew's usual field of view. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped night fighter typically came as a complete surprise to the bomber crew, who realised a night fighter was close by only when they came under fire. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> known when Schnaufer's Bf 110 was equipped with Schräge Musik. Rumpelhardt stated that the weapons system was installed prior to his return from officer training. It is also not exactly known how many of his victories had been claimed using the upwards firing cannons. According to Fritz Engau, who had known Schnaufer since Flugzeugführerschule C 3, 20 to 30 of Schnaufer's aerial victories had been claimed using upwards firing guns.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E

25|$|The mode {{of action}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> known at present, but {{experimental}} evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.|$|E
25|$|In Helycobacter pylori, a spriral-shaped Gram-negative bacterium, the filamentation {{mechanism}} {{are regulated}} by two mechanisms: the peptidases that cause peptidoglycan relaxation and the coiled-coil-rich proteins (Ccrp) {{that are responsible}} for the helical cell shape in vitro as well as in vivo.
