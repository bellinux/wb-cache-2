40|$|In this paper, {{we intend}} to discuss a topic of {{particular}} importance, given that it addresses the imperatives of international political and legal order, as they appear {{in the light of}} current international law. It is an issue of great complexity, of very wide current interest because the international law that establishes and maintains an international legal order is a real energetic factor of organization of international community life. So viewed, the rules of international nature respond to the current acute need of founding the relations in this field and of meeting the common needs of the members of international society. We considered that by comparison with the <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> reflecting the health inscribed in this order, the international legal order is influenced by the structuring and training of the mondial community. Therefore we shall insist on the principal model of organizing international life – the state – to be viewed and analyzed in a double perspective: as an internal sovereign authority and as an actor on the scene of international life. In both instances, the state provides the foundation of legal order (domestic or international) for that law has always been the expression of the state wish...|$|E
40|$|The European Union has {{maintained}} that the obligations incumbent upon it {{in the area of}} human rights stem from its own <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> Under this limited approach, the EU is merely under an obligation not to violate human rights when it acts (i. e. a negative obligation to respect human rights) and effectively only to respect those rights enumerated in the European Convention on Human Rights. This article explores how the EU may be subject to more extensive human rights obligations, incumbent on it by virtue of international law. As an intergovernmental organization and subject to international law, the EU can be said to be bound by customary international law, treaties to which it is a party, and human rights treaties entered into individually by Member States through the principle of succession or substitution. This would extend the range of applicable rights far beyond those in the ECHR to other obligations in, for instance, UN human rights treaties. It also implies that the EU must not merely refrain from violating human rights, but also that, within its spheres of competence, it should take positive measures to protect and fulfill human rights...|$|E

40|$|From our perspective, the {{administrative}} procedure represents {{in a simple}} way the rules that apply to the activities of public administration structures (even if it concerns the drafting, the execution or the control of administrative acts or the realization of administrative operations). In the context represented by the need for reform and modernization in the public sector, {{the administrative}} procedure has to systemize, simplify and unify public administration activity eliminating the contradictions between the administrative actions. The reform and modernization of public administration needs in our opinion to state and establish in a clear and prescriptive way the rules concerning the general administrative procedure, in other words – the rules that guide the decision making process, that assures openness and transparency, the respect of citizens’ rights and interests, the efficiency of public administration.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} that the Union is under an obligation to respect the rule of law when it acts externally, and second, to map out the outline of a research agenda on what exactly the rule of law might mean when operationalised in one field of EU external relations characterised by a wide variety of administrative activities i. e. the EU wider neighbourhood (Stabilisation and Association Process and European Neighbourhood Policy). Furthermore, the paper – throughout its development – will try to highlight that the power exercised by the administration in these two policies is significant and often carried out in an unregulated manner; thus the need to research the operationalisation of the rule of law in guiding the Union’s administrative power in these two policies. The paper will proceed as follows. First, it will analyse the obligation to respect the rule of law when the Union acts externally. Secondly, it will provide the reader with a very brief definition of what it means to respect the rule of law in the EU <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> Thirdly, it will explain the choice of the case study.

40|$|The essay {{analyses}} {{an ongoing}} tendency that is transforming a traditional cornerstone of constitutional and administrative law in Italy, {{such as the}} principle of legality. This progressive makeover is given by the reflections in the <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> of the joint effect of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, together with the integration in the European Union, that are producing a progressive shift to a more substantial and comprehensive concept of the “rule of law”. The main reason for this seems to derive from the so-called “democratic disconnect” that affects the supranational legal orders and weakens the preference traditionally acknowledged to parliamentary legislation. Due also to the low quality of the internal legislation, the Italian Highest Courts are following the hints coming from the outside and both the Court of Cassation and the Constitutional court are slowly embracing a more comprehensive idea of what “law” is, closer to the idea typical of the “common law” systems. The results of this evolution are a progressive decline of the formal categories that dominated the literature in the past decades as well as, at the same time, {{the risk of losing}} also the democratic meaning of legality, represented by the necessary linkage between the system of sources of law and the form of government. In other words, relocating the role of parliamentary legislation means rethinking the role of Parliaments vis-à- vis both the Government and the courts in the contemporary State.

40|$|The {{right of}} labor {{disconnection}} underlies on a constitutional and fundamental prerogative {{of the entire}} working class. Rest periods from the laboring environment are protected by law and have the objective to provide workers with recovery of their physical and mental energies. They also assure moments of delight, of family, communitarian and political insertion, for the fulfillment of personal plans. The violation of these disconnection periods can jeopardize projects or life habits, {{as well as social}} relations, resulting in existential damage. From these premises, this article aims to analyze the characterizing elements of existential damage in order to evince its peculiarities in relation to moral damage and to defend the accumulation of damages to provide just atonement to the victims and to their dignity as human beings. Thus, this research supports itself on legal dogmatic principles, since it considers that the <b>internal</b> elements of <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> are sufficient to establish a distinction between moral and existential injuries. The main problem relies on the typifying elements of existential damage. Due to their extra-patrimonial nature and relationship to personal rights, they are mistakenly considered by labor courts as moral damages, and, therefore, given limited possibilities of indemnification to the victim. Under this perspective, the contextual complexity above presented is overcome through deductive reasoning, as it indicates in the open norms of the national legal system the possibility of an interdisciplinary and comparative investigation which attests the specificities of moral and existential damages...|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} online 23 May 2016. This {{article provides}} a critical view of Judgment No. 238 of 2014 handed {{down by the}} Italian Constitutional Court. By and large the comments presented below pertain to the single issue {{of the relationship between}} different <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> ç between the <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> of two states, or between the <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> of one state and the <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> of international law. The following comments are based on a postulate that law is pluralist in its structure. Law is about officially enforced normativity between human beings. As there are multiple sources of law and multiple enforcers, there are also multiple legal systems. These legal systems may choose to yield to each other, they may seek to coordinate between themselves, but they may also conflict and collide. As a matter of principle, a <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> can proclaim the primacy of another <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> in respect of its own norms, including within the proclaiming <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> itself. However, a <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> cannot proclaim the primacy of its own norms within another <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> This is why Judgment No. 238 represents what this author terms a ‘category error’ when the ruling seeks to determine the content of international law through a methodology that leans heavily upon the primacy of the Constitution of Italy...|$|R
40|$|By {{recognizing}} to {{the treaties}} and agreements ratified or approved a "superior authority on the laws", the 1958 Constitution has solemnly affirmed the primacy of international norms on the <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> But {{in the absence of}} any precision as to the judicial organ in charge of insuring this principle, it was the constitutional judge to decide. The key decision "Interruption volontaire de grossesse" of the 15 th January 1975, where this organ declined its competence is the cornerstone of a stable jurisprudence according to which ordinary tribunals are implicitly but incontestably charged with what has been named the "control of conventionality". However, if for the Constitutional Council, the article 55 does not create a condition of the conformity of laws to international treaties, it does lay a principle of hierarchy, which may be enforced within the framework of constitutionality control Thus, the analysis of article 55 of the Constitution reveals that the prescriptions there contained are aggregated in a double normative content, which leads, under the impetus of the constitutional jurisprudence, to double jurisdictional competence : the Constitutional Council, judge of constitutionality, is in charge of the direct constitutionality prescriptions contained in the article 55 while the ordinary judge, judge of conventionality, insures the enforcement of the indirect conventionality prescriptions implied by this article. The study, which aims to give a complete balance sheet of article 55 of the Constitution in the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Council, will in a first time focus the theoretical issue of jurisdiction, and in a second time, the judicial enforcement of this provision at the Constitutional Council...|$|E
40|$|These {{relationships}} concern {{primarily the}} binding force {{and application of}} international law in the State, including the respect for that law by State organs and individuals. Municipal law can also {{have a place in}} the international legal order, and international organs occasionally apply that law. While the latter problem is more restricted in its weight and dimensions, the impact of one law on another and their interactions are considerable. Parliamentary democracy and its workings have brought the domestic implementation of international law to a head, especially in view of the possibility of legislating internally through the medium of treaties. Penetration of the <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> by international law meets with various obstacles: gaps in the regulation of the procedural aspect by municipal law; inertia of the domestic organs; supremacy of municipal laws (statutes) for State courts; ignorance of international law; difficulties in identifying the relevant rule of that law. The choice of method to be adopted to implement international law inside a State is left to that State's legal order and practice. There is a variety of procedures. Some consist of the reception by the domestic law of various rules of international law whereby the latter are made {{part and parcel of the}} body of municipal Jaw. One such method is transformation of an international legal rule into a municipal one; transformation can be either particular or general. Other procedures result in the direct applicability of the international legal rule in the domestic system: the rule operates as an international on in the internal legal system. In case, of conflict between an international rule and a municipal rule primacy of the former is absolute on the international legal plane. On the other hand, in the domestic sphere various solutions have been adopted, and it is not unfrequent that in practice the municipal law will prevail. This undesirable effect of a certain autonomy of municipal law does not free the State from international responsibility for violation of its international obligations.

40|$|The author’s main {{objective}} was to present principles concerning the status of foreign military forces on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Poland which constitute, in its shape, realization (materialization) of the provision (resolution) included in article 117 of the Republic of Poland’s Constitution dated 2 nd April, 1997. Complex formulation of solutions in this matter created a need to indicate principles included in an Agreement of a significant priority between the Countries-Parties of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization concerning the status of their military forces, signed on 19 June, 1951 (NATO-SOFA). Besides the principles decreed in NATO-SOFA, the author also discussed the principles concerning foreign military forces stay and translocations on the territory of the Republic of Poland. The scope of regulations in the said legal acts is very vast and the subject matter differentiated. Principles (rules) concerning performance of jurisdiction and rules regarding claims of civil charactrer are of the greatest importance. Moreover, the regulations refer, among other things, to border crossing principles, uniforms, weapons, customs and taxation issues. The state’s participation in structures of the community involves the neccessity to respect rules and principles constituted for its members. The importance of these rules acceptance as legally binding {{on the basis of the}} international agreements ratification should also be emphasized. Vast spectrum of the rules regulation means considerable changes in national law to which they have been „incorporated”. Expanding memberships in alliances and executing international treaties denotes univocally the intensive impact of the international law that exerts direct influence on <b>internal,</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> of states. The natural consequence of these proceses is expressed in the acquisition of particular rights by the state, and also in undertaking obligations, the realization of which leads to more or less severe restrictions of the state’s sovereignty.

Priorities of the international policy are changable whereas passiveness and isolation are not to be tolerated.

40|$|When {{activities}} of a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operation cause damage to third {{parties and the}} tort claim cannot be settled amicably, the injured third party does {{not have access to}} any remedies that could give effect to the recognized right to compensation. The thesis identifies and analyzes the content of the rules and practices of public international law and the internal law of the UN that give rise to this remedy gap. Further, based on the normative analysis, the thesis constructs and analyzes policy-oriented solutions to how the gap should be closed in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of both the UN and the injured party. Two recent cases related to the cholera epidemic in Haiti and the massacre in Srebrenica are used as case studies. The thesis identifies two principal factors that contribute to the emergence of the remedy gap: inadequacies related to the dispute settlement mechanism of third-party claims in the UN peacekeeping context and the organization's insurmountable immunity from suit before national courts. With regard to the former, the thesis distinguishes between problems related to the devised and actual mechanisms available for settling claims on the one hand, and inadequacies related to the determination of admissibility of tort claims on the other hand. It is submitted that the existing mechanism is inadequate as it leaves outside contentious claims without a legal justification. Further, the determination of admissibility based on the notion 'private-law claims' is uninformative on the international plane. An alternative and more precise model for testing admissibility based on the notion of justiciability is offered: if the standard principles of liability in tort can be determined by the adjudicative forum without having to review political decisions of the UN, tort claims should be receivable. With regard to the latter, the thesis distinguishes between the scope of UN immunity and human rights related arguments commonly used to overcome the bar of unqualified immunity. As regards the former, the thesis argues that lex lata the UN enjoys unqualified immunity due to the impossibility of finding a practicable test for 'functionality', and this immunity can only be lifted by express waiver that cannot be deduced from a commitment to settle disputes. The justification for comprehensive immunities is however greatly diminished where the organization fails to establish alternative modes of dispute settlement. As regards the human rights approach, the thesis analyzes whether the UN can be bound by duties for human rights vis-à-vis the claimants in a peacekeeping context; whether the claimants' right of access to court vis-à-vis the forum state can limit UN immunity; and finally whether a jus cogens hierarchy between immunity and human rights can solve the conflict to the latter's benefit. By applying institutional human rights theory and analyzing relevant case law, the thesis answers all three questions in the negative, and argues that human rights can only play the role of a policy imperative in UN peacekeeping. Linking the conflict between the <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> of the UN and the right of access to court to fragmentation, the thesis concludes that the former should accommodate the human rights regime by ensuring the availability of alternative modes of dispute settlement for third party tort claims arising in peacekeeping contexts. Based on the normative analysis, the thesis offers concrete policy recommendations for how the remedy gap should be closed. As for the dispute settlement mechanism, it is submitted that since the majority of tort claims in peacekeeping contexts are settled amicably, a new mechanism is not called for, and the UN should instead incur an obligation to arbitrate contentious cases. It is further submitted that the UN should devise an illustrative list of legal criteria to be applied by the selected adjudicatory forum in determining the admissibility of claims, taking into account the justiciability perspective offered in the study. The legal criteria should also comprehensively set out the applicable law, including internal customary law and general principles of tort law, to be applied to the merits of the claim. The recommendations would effectively remove the remedy gap, avoid the appearance of arbitrariness in the practice related to contentious tort claims, and promote the rule of law within the UN system...|$|E

The idealization of the state-reason in modernity, as theoretical {{justification for}} the preservation of the community and the achievement of common good, is strongly influenced in the belief about the legitimacy of the orders and commands laid down in law and by individuals who are appointed to exercise domination. The implementation of social welfare state is not consistent with the exercise of citizenship in liberal-individualist fragmentary and maintainer of social inequalities. The difficulties of the semi-peripheral countries such as Brazil, to conduct an effective social state of law should be reviewed from the correct insertion of the <b>internal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> in a complex system of economic globalization and political domination of developed countries. The imposition of an overarching rationality inherent in the international brings a metaphysical conception of universal interests, hiding the locations of the singularities appear as a way to correct the course of exploitation of national law to the true aspirations. Even in the first implementation of universal criminal jurisdiction of the history of mankind, created to protect universally recognized human rights, the ruling states have stuck to their respective sovereignty and institutionalized the selectivity of international criminal justice and the relativization of sanctions against violators of human rights. In the legal procedure, the rationalist paradigm transported from the sciences to the legal sciences guided the search for truth ontologically unattainable idealized as one of the axioms of instrumentation (inauthentic) of Brazilian law. The proposed research assumes that all knowledge is really of interest for the social and social, even if viewed from an individual perspective, because science does not cease to be a social practice, to the extent that scientific knowledge is held by an effort for understanding complex social dynamics of action of social actors in a given time and in particular social space. In this respect, to achieve the goals set by a social democratic agenda, the analysis of the factors that legitimize the right, or how to do right, becomes based on the Habermasian concept of communicative action as a step necessary for dialogic the scope of democracy material.

40|$|Foreword The Max Weber post-doctoral Programme is {{a unique}} programme. In 2007 – 2008, there were forty Fellows on the Programme, {{covering}} {{a wide range of}} research interests within the Social Sciences and Humanities, and representing twenty-three nationalities. Among the different activities of the academic year, the conference on “European integration without membership: models, experiences, perspectives” {{is a good example of}} Fellows’ initiative and their concern for relevant issues. Encouraged by Professor Marise Cremona of the Law Department of the EUI, three Max Weber Fellows, Francesco Maiani, Roman Petrov and Ekaterina Mouliarova, took the initiative to organize the conference, invite the participants, actively participate in its development and, finally, act as editors of the proceedings which follow. The Max Weber Programme, in collaboration with the Law Department, fully supported their initiative, but the credit is theirs and that of the participants who contributed to the conference. Since its foundation more than thirty years ago, “European Integration” has been a recurrent theme in the research agenda of the European University Institute – specially within the Law Department. The conference built on this long tradition, but also took from the new perspectives that young postdoctoral Fellows, with different national experiences, can bring to the discussion, a discussion that brings forward new issues, when the EU 27 must reassess its relationships with neighbouring countries that form part of the broader European area without aiming at becoming EU members in the years to come. A fruitful discussion on this relevant issue needs academic reflection, as well as practical legal and political experience, it needs understanding of the EU perspective, as well as that of neighbouring countries. It is again to the credit of the organizers that in the panels of the conference all these perspectives were present in open discussion. The proceedings that follow bring together the papers presented in this conference that took place at our beloved Villa La Fonte on May 23 - 24, 2008. Ramon Marimon Director of the Max Weber ProgrammeAt the beginning of the 1990 s, the concept of “European integration” could still be said to be fairly unambiguous. Nowadays, it has become plural and complex almost to the point of unintelligibility. This is due, of course, to the internal differentiation of EU membership, with several Member States pulling out of key integrative projects such as establishing an area without frontiers, the “Schengen” area, and a common currency. But this is also due to the differentiated extension of key integrative projects to European non-EU countries – Schengen is again a case in point. Such processes of “integration without membership”, the focus of the present publication, are acquiring an ever-growing topicality both in the political arena and in academia. International relations between the EU and its neighbouring countries are crucial for both, and their development through new agreements features prominently on the continent’s political agenda. Over and above this aspect, the dissemination of EU values and standards beyond the Union’s borders raises a whole host of theoretical and methodological questions, unsettling in some cases traditional conceptions of the autonomy and separation of national legal orders. This publication brings together the papers presented at the Integration without EU Membership workshop held in May 2008 at the EUI (Max Weber Programme and Department of Law). It aims to compare different models and experiences of integration between the EU, on the one hand, and those European countries that do not currently have an accession perspective on the other hand. In delimiting the geographical scope of the inquiry, so as to scale it down to manageable proportions, the guiding principles have been to include both the “Eastern” and “Western” neighbours of the EU, and to examine both structured frameworks of cooperation, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European Economic Area, and bilateral relations developing on a more ad hoc basis. These principles are reflected in the arrangement of the papers, which consider in turn the positions of Ukraine, Russia, Norway, and Switzerland in European integration – current standing, perspectives for evolution, consequences in terms of the EU-ization of their respective legal orders 1. These subjects are examined from several perspectives. We had the privilege of receiving contributions from leading practitioners and scholars from the countries concerned, from EU highranking officials, from prominent specialists in EU external relations law, and from young and talented researchers. We wish to thank them all here for their invaluable insights. We are moreover deeply indebted to Marise Cremona (EUI, Law Department, EUI) for her inspiring advice and encouragement, as well as to Ramon Marimon, Karin Tilmans, Lotte Holm, Alyson Price and Susan Garvin (Max Weber Programme, EUI) for their unflinching support throughout this project. A word is perhaps needed on the propriety and usefulness of the research concept embodied in this publication. Does it make sense to compare the integration models and experiences of countries as different as Norway, Russia, Switzerland, and Ukraine? Needless to say, this list of four evokes a staggering diversity of political, social, cultural, and economic conditions, and at least as great a diversity of approaches to European integration. Still, we would argue that such diversity only makes comparisons more meaningful. Indeed, while the particularities and idiosyncratic elements of each “model” of integration are fully displayed in the present volume, common themes and preoccupations run through the pages of every contribution: the difficulty in conceptualizing the finalité and essence of integration, which is evident in the EU today but which is greatly amplified for non-EU countries; the asymmetries and tradeoffs between integration and autonomy that are inherent in any attempt to participate in European integration from outside; the alteration of deeply seated legal concepts, and concepts about the law, that are already observable in the most integrated of the non-EU countries concerned. These issues are not transient or coincidental: they are inextricably bound up with the integration of non-EU countries in the EU project. By publishing this collection, we make no claim to have dealt with them in an exhaustive, still less in a definitive manner. Our ambition is more modest: to highlight the relevance of these themes, to place them more firmly on the scientific agenda, and to provide a stimulating basis for future research and reflection.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{constitutional}} linkages between national <b>legal</b> <b>orders,</b> the EU <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> and the ECHR Convention system. The first, and the main, question the article addresses is how these intertwined constitutional structures can be described. This article shows that the interrelationship of these <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> could be best described as heterarchical as opposed to hierarchical. The article also tries to tentatively examine the meaning and influence of these heterarchical constitutional structures. The concept of heterarchy is used to illustrate the tension between constitutionalism and pluralism. Where constitutionalism builds a pre-set foundation and framework for governance, pluralism challenges hierarchical constitutional structures and highlights tension at the interfaces between different <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> The concept of heterarchical constitutional structures is used to describe those structures pertaining between <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> which enable those <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> to flexibly function together without predetermining any hierarchical relation between the orders. Thus heterarchical constitutional structures {{can be described as}} communicative in nature. The structures could also be described soft by their nature since they describe, but do not determine relations between different <b>legal</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

40|$|While the {{government}} presents the MSC as {{the embodiment of}} the future, structurally it bears remarkable resemblance to the colonial <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> The enclave nature of the MSC is reminiscent of the colonial dual <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> At the same time, the international <b>legal</b> and economic <b>orders</b> have undergone profound changes. The international <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> is now premised on sovereign absolutism and equality among nation-states. The reigning economic paradigm is high technology rather than manufacturing or the spice trade. Discussion of the continuities and discontinuities between colonial and present day transnational <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> must thus attend to a number of variables. Further, to the extent possible, rhetoric must be distinguished from practice...|$|R
40|$|Eurasian {{integration}} {{has created}} a new <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> – the so-called “Union law” of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). This <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> has its own narrative, principles, hierarchy of rules, and innovations such as the direct applicability of decisions of its regulatory body. Russian <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> is generally accommodating towards international law, which is equally applicable to Union law. However, the recent practice of the Russian Constitutional Court has claimed that Russia can set aside international obligations based on national constitution, which indirectly targets the viability of the EAEU <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> This is further complicated by the Eurasian judiciary, which, as the main interpretative authority within the integration, has tried to take on an activist role, somewhat borrowing approaches from the European Union. In its turn, the Russian Constitutional Court has voiced its differences in certain approaches. This variability of practices and approaches clearly undermines the “unity” of the EAEU <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> and the interweaving of national and regional legal frameworks. This article analyses the relationship of the two <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> to assess the possibilities for tensions between them. It points out the sources of such tensions, which lie in certain indeterminacies within the EAEU <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> temptations to assert power, and recent far-reaching practices of the Russian Constitutional Court. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{multifaceted}} {{character of}} globalization constantly confuses {{our understanding of}} the theoretical foundations of the global <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> One of the most common answers to the complexity of any such undertaking has been provided by international constitutionalists, who have advocated a conception of the global <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> that corresponds to a table of global values which echo the similar objective standards of domestic law. Liberals and neo-liberals have also floated value-based representations of the foundations of the global order. This article is an attempt to challenge such Kantian or Grotian conceptions of the global <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> with a view of laying out a neo Hobbesian understanding of the common denominators of the global <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> that is an international <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> based on (individual and common) interests rather than global values. Such a conception, as will be demonstrated, inevitably leads to relativism and entails an inextricable and continuous discussion about what constitutes the public good. Additionally, besides playing down the understandings of international law as a normative project, the interest-based conception of the international <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> defended in this article fosters the transformation-capacity of international law, as it strips the latter of the imperialistic and hegemonic overtones that are inherent to any value-based understanding of the foundations of the global <b>legal</b> <b>order...</b>|$|R
40|$|Does the Community <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> {{constitute}} a closed ‘self-contained regime’ {{or will it}} be an ‘open system’? While founded on the basis of an international treaty, the European Community still had to determine – not unlike national <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> – the effects of public international law in its ‘domestic’ sphere. Has the Community <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> thus assumed an ‘autonomous’ position vis-à-vis general international law? And if so, what is the status and effect of international norms in the Community <b>legal</b> <b>order?</b> This chapter discusses these issues by analysing the constitutional regime developed for international treaties concluded by the Community and customary international law. The second part changes perspective and investigates when the Community has considered itself materially bound by international agreements concluded by its Member States via the doctrine of functional succession. In general, the Community’s constitutional choice vis-à-vis public international law has a federal dimension: placed on systemic ‘middle ground’, the EC <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> may potentially operate as a conduit for the incorporation of international law in the national <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> of its Member States...|$|R
40|$|The current article {{provides}} a critical {{overview of the}} CJEU’s role as the main ‘architect’ {{of the relationship between}} the EU <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> and the international <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> The activities of the CJEU are assessed in light of four parameters: the protection of fundamental rights, the protection of the internal division of competences within the EU, issues of primacy and review of legality when international agreements are present, and the relationship between the CJEU and other international tribunals. It is argued that the CJEU in the last decade is increasingly acting in a fashion similar to federal constitutional courts that seek to protect the ‘federal’ level <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> from the intrusions of the international <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> and those of the sub-federal level. In its quest to protect the autonomy of the EU <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> and its own exclusive jurisdiction in a multilevel, pluralistic legal system, the CJEU might have caused more harm than good, affecting legal certainty, and the dialogue between it and the international <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> or international tribunals...|$|R
40|$|Globalization causes {{convergence}} of <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> Or {{so it is}} argued. Law and economics scholars predict that <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> will move towards the same efficient end state. They argue that the requirements of globalization will pressure <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> to converge {{on the level of}} economic efficiency, because regulatory competition between <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> makes it impossible for individual legal systems to maintain suboptimal solutions. Many comparative lawyers predict a similar convergence. In particular traditional functionalist comparatists have long held that unification of law was both desirable and unavoidable. Their basic argument is based on functional equivalence and can be summarized as follows: legal systems may look different because they have different doctrines and institutions; these differences, however, are only superficial, because the institutions fulfill the same functions and are therefore actually similar. Realizing that <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> are already similar in substance should make it easy to unify the law formally as well...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 8133 The Study {{conducted}} here {{examines the}} evolving {{nature of the}} dynamic that {{is the relationship between}} the Irish and European <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> from two perspectives: that of Article 234 of the EC Treaty and Article 29. 4. 10 of the Irish Constitution, the respective meeting points of two <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> The author considers the evolving operation and significance of the preliminary reference mechanism, pursuant to Article 234 EC, {{and the extent to which}} it constitutes a tool for "court- centric" or judicially-focussed theories of integration through law in the European Union within the context of the Irish <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> over a period of 30 years. The study conducted here identifies major constitutional difficulties attaching to the manner in which European Union law implemented in the domestic <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> is constitutionally immunised from challenge where "necessitated", pursuant to Article 29. 4. 10, that in turn affects the operation of European Union law in the Irish <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> in light of the evolving constitutional framework at national and European level. The operation of European Union law in the domestic <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> is affected significantly by both clauses and so an understanding of their operation demonstrates how the use and significance of European Union law in the Irish <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> is a complex interplay of many evolving variables...|$|R
