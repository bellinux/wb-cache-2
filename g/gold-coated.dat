25|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of the chamber floor has suggested {{the presence of a}} body in the south-western corner. The goods found included fragments of a blue glass cup with a trailed decoration, similar to the recent find from the Prittlewell tomb in Essex. There were two gilt-bronze discs with animal interlace ornament, a bronze brooch, a silver buckle, and a <b>gold-coated</b> stud from a buckle. Four objects had a special kinship with the Mound 1 finds: the tip of a sword blade showed elaborate pattern welding; silver-gilt drinking horn-mounts (struck from the same dies as those in Mound 1); and the similarity of two fragments of dragon-like mounts or plaques. Although the rituals were not identical, the association of the contents of the grave shows a connection between the two burials.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} by which heat may be delivered. Some {{of the most}} common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU), microwave heating, induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including <b>gold-coated</b> nanoshells and nanorods that exhibit certain degrees of 'tunability' of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an 'optical window' in which biological tissue (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a 'window' exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, get hot and are killed.|$|E
500|$|The Recopa Sudamericana trophy has not {{undergone}} {{many changes}} in its history. The trophy consists of a <b>gold-coated</b> body with a pedestal. The body consists of an Adidas Tango ball, a successful family and brand of association footballs. It was first introduced as the Tango Durlast in 1978 for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. The ball is hoisted by a golden, cylindrical body with four quadrilateral edges {{sticking out of the}} body at 45 degrees from each other. The pedestal is separated into two parts; the top part of the pedestal consists of the CONMEBOL emblem. The bottom part of the pedestal contains a gold badge underneath the CONMEBOL emblem with the phrase, [...] "RECOPA", imprinted into it. To the left and right, badges of previous winners are placed.|$|E
2500|$|Goldwork {{is the art}} of {{embroidery}} using metal threads. It {{is particularly}} prized for the way light plays on it. The term [...] "goldwork" [...] is used even when the threads are imitation gold, silver, or copper. The metal wires used to make the threads have never been entirely gold; they have always been <b>gold-coated</b> silver (silver-gilt) or cheaper metals, and even then the [...] "gold" [...] often contains a very low percent of real gold. Most metal threads are available in silver and sometimes copper as well as gold; some are available in colors as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{telescope}} has {{an expected}} mass {{about half of}} Hubble Space Telescope's, but its primary mirror (a 6.5 meter diameter <b>gold-coated</b> beryllium reflector) will have a collecting area about five times as large ( [...] vs. [...] ). The JWST is oriented toward near-infrared astronomy, but can also see orange and red visible light, {{as well as the}} mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument. The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for three main reasons: High-redshift objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, cold objects such as debris disks and planets emit most strongly in the infrared, and this band is difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble.|$|E
2500|$|JWST's {{primary mirror}} is a 6.5-meter-diameter <b>gold-coated</b> {{beryllium}} reflector with a collecting area of 25m2. [...] This {{is too large}} for existing launch vehicles, so the mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, which will unfold after the telescope is launched. Image plane wavefront sensing through phase retrieval {{will be used to}} position the mirror segments in the correct location using very precise micro-motors. [...] Subsequent to this initial configuration they will only need occasional updates every few days to retain optimal focus. This is unlike terrestrial telescopes like the Keck which continually adjust their mirror segments using active optics to overcome the effects of gravitational and wind loading, and is made possible {{because of the lack of}} environmental disturbances of a telescope in space.|$|E
2500|$|The Hall of Independence (...) is {{situated}} inside the goblet or [...] "cup" [...] part of Monas (...)

The original text of the Proclamation of Independence is stored in a glass case inside the bronze golden door. On {{the west side of the}} inner wall. Mechanized bronze doors weigh 4 tons and are coated with goldleaf adorned with the image of a Wijaya Kusuma flower, symbolizing eternity, and a lotus flower, symbolizing purity. The doors, known as Gerbang Kemerdekaan or the Gate of Independence, open slowly while the nationalist Padamu Negeri song plays followed by a recording of Soekarno reading the text of the Proclamation. On the southern wall there is a large bronze <b>gold-coated</b> statue of the coat of arms of Indonesiaweighing 3.5 tons. On the eastern side is the text of the proclamation in bronze lettering. Originally the eastern side displayed the most sacred Indonesian flag, Sang Saka Merah Putih, originally raised on 17 August 1945. However, because it is fragile and in poor condition it is no longer displayed. The wall on the northern side displays a map of the Indonesian archipelago coated in gold.|$|E

50|$|In 2016 the {{pathfinder}} {{was used}} for the Pathfinder Thermal Test at Johnson Space Center in Texas. At this time it had two spare beryllium mirror, one <b>gold-coated,</b> and also ten non-flight <b>gold-coated</b> aluminum test segments functioning as thermal simulators. The ten <b>gold-coated</b> aluminum segments (not beryllium like the flight mirrors) are thermal simulator segments. In 2016 the pathfinder underwent thermal and vacuum tests that the actual JWST was planned to also go through in 2017. The test chamber was originally built to test Apollo program (NASA moon-shot), but was refurbished for testing in the JWST program. The thermal test will take similar hardware on cool down time line, which allows heat flow to be studied. The flight JWST primary mirror is designed to be cooled down to 55 kelvin for operation, and the thermal tests on the pathfinder support this goal. The pathfinder had to be modified for the thermal tests, including the thermal simulators to stand in for the mirrors, but also insulation. There is also an Aft Optical Subsystem Geometry Simulator and an ISIM Electronics Compartment Simulator. The thermal test also demonstrates the Space Vehicle Thermal Simulator (SVTS) and the Deep Space Edge Radiation Sinks (DSERS).|$|E

Shah Tahmasp I began to repair and gild the minaret near the dome and in 932/1525, precious tiles covering the dome were changed into <b>gold-coated</b> bricks. After they were plundered during Abd al-Mu'min Khan Uzbeg invasion, the <b>gold-coated</b> bricks were rebuilt by Shah 'Abbas in 1010/1601, the details of which was written on an enamelled inscription by Ali Reza Abbasi. Shah Abbas also began to establish northern porch, rooms, chambers, facades, as well eastern and western porches. It is said that Mullah Muhsin Fayd Kashani ordered to establish Tawhid Khanah portico in {{the north side of the}} Shrine.

50|$|The hill fort Bojná I was {{protected}} by multiple walls as high as 6 meters with ditches and gates. In the 9th century, the hill fort was intensely populated. Several craft workshops (mostly smithies) and thousands of artifacts were unearthed on the place. Along with artisanal and agricultural tools, {{a large amount of}} weapons including typical battle axes, large knives, fragments of swords and seaxes. The presence of elite warriors can be documented by spurs, chain armors, gold-plated parts of military equipment, <b>gold-coated</b> and silver-coated adornments and other luxury objects. The religious articles belong to the oldest Christian articles in Slovakia. The most important findings are a bronze bell of Canino type, fragments of other three bells and six <b>gold-coated</b> plaquettes with angels and Christ dated to 780-820, dozen years before the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius.
