He has an {{intelligent}} piercing gaze, {{although it may be}} interpreted as hostile glance towards the viewer. The toll of age wears heavily on the old man's gaunt features. His fleshy cheeks are heavily folded, his lips thin and his hair wispy and in disarray. His skin is heavily wrinkled, and his eyes are narrow and give a weary appearance. By comparison to the 1490 Albrecht Dürer the Elder with a Rosary, his hands, though visible, are inactive, possibly due to arthritis.|$|E
40|$|Assessment of {{stent strut}} {{coverage}} by {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) is not standardized. The methodology most commonly used {{is based on a}} visual binary qualitative assessment (strut covered or not). However, the influence of magnification (zoom setting) to the inter- and intra-observer agreements has not yet been evaluated. Aim of our study was therefore to evaluate the agreements of this approach, taking into account various zoom settings. 126 struts from 10 selected frames were independently evaluated by four observers using a stepwise approach increasing the zoom setting as following: (1) full view of the lumen (FV), (2) <b>half</b> <b>view</b> of the lumen (HV) and (3) a quarter view of the lumen (QV). Intra- and inter-observer agreements (κ) were assessed. The rate of uncoverage was determined for each strut as the number of times it was defined as uncovered divided {{by the total number of}} observations (maximum 12 = 3 zoom settings × 4 analysts) and expressed as percentage. The inter-observer κ values (mean [range]) were 0. 32 [0. 07 - 0. 63], 0. 40 [0. 18 - 0. 69] and 0. 33 [0. 09 - 0. 6], within FV, HV and QV respectively. The intra-observer κ values were 0. 60 [0. 50 - 0. 70], 0. 75 [0. 75 - 0. 76] and 0. 60 [0. 50 - 0. 70], within FV, HV and QV respectively. By increasing zoom setting the κ value of intra-observer agreement was 0. 74 [0. 58 - 0. 83] (from FV to HV), 0. 70 [0. 56 - 0. 83] (from HV to QV) and 0. 70 [0. 37 - 0. 86] (from FV to QV). Overall, the rate of uncoverage was 15. 5 % [8. 3 - 100 %]. The OCT qualitative evaluation of strut coverage has wide inter and intra-observer agreements and is dependent of the zoom setting used during the analysis. A more reproducible approach would be needed to eventually increase the probability to link uncovered struts with clinical events...|$|E

50|$|Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) {{emphasized}} {{ruling out}} the possibility that mnemic neglect occurs due to incompatibility with expectancies. It was suspected that mnemic neglect might be an issue of self-verification rather than self-protection or self-enhancement. Self-verification and self-protection are difficult concepts to separate because most people tend to think of themselves favorably. Green and Sedikides (2004) attempted to address this concern by conducting two experiments. In one experiment, the participants were pre-selected. <b>Half</b> <b>viewed</b> themselves positively on certain dimensions and <b>half</b> <b>viewed</b> themselves negatively. All participants had better recall for positive dimensions. In another experiment, a stranger Chris was described to participants before they read the behaviors. Chris was described as a superhuman, incredibly kind and trustworthy, in an attempt to establish expectancies about Chris. Other participants in the same study were asked to imagine the traits described a close friend whom the participants hold in high regard. In comparison to these two cases, recall for positive traits was still better when these traits were self-referent rather than directed at another.|$|R
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the impact of the order in which {{information}} about a performer is received and the influence of observer experience and mode of responding. Method Male athletes (40 qualified soccer coaches, 40 soccer players and 40 non-soccer players) viewed a video of two soccer players (a control and target player) each performing a passing task eight times. For the control player, all participants saw the same footage in the same order. For the target player, participants viewed the same footage with <b>half</b> <b>viewing</b> a declining (successful to unsuccessful) performance pattern and <b>half</b> <b>viewing</b> an ascending pattern. Participants then rated the players on a range of descriptors. Results Multivariate analyses of variance indicated no differences in the ratings of the control player but did show primacy effects in the judgement of the target player's ability, control, attitude, speed of thought and athleticism. Primacy effects were observed regardless of the soccer experience of the participants and the judgement mode (end-of-sequence versus step-by-step). Conclusion The study supports the contention that the order in which performance information is received influences the overall attribution of ability...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether a message informing readers about digital alteration read before exposure to thin ideal advertisements would enhance the effectiveness of disclaimer labels. Participants were 280 female undergraduate students who viewed eleven thin ideal fashion magazine advertisements. <b>Half</b> <b>viewed</b> the advertisements in their original format, and <b>half</b> <b>viewed</b> the same advertisements with a digital alteration disclaimer label. Prior to viewing the advertisements, participants read either a brief message informing them that advertisements are commonly digitally altered, or a control message. Irrespective of experimental condition, exposure to the thin ideal advertisements led to increased body dissatisfaction, with social comparison predicting this increase. Neither the disclaimer label nor the pre-exposure message, nor their combination, led to reductions in perceived realism, social comparison, or body dissatisfaction. However, trait appearance comparison moderated the effect of pre-exposure message on perceived realism, such that women high on trait appearance comparison in the digital alteration pre exposure message condition rated the models as relatively more realistic than did women low on this trait. It was concluded that {{more research is needed}} to identify brief and easy-to-implement universal prevention strategies that can reduce the negative effects of thin ideal media imagery on women's body image...|$|R

30|$|In Experiment 1, {{we tested}} {{the extent to which}} {{accuracy}} and proclivity to choose on the LST predict accuracy and proclivity to choose on CA and CP lineups. Participants first viewed a series of crime videos, completed the LST, and then judged a lineup pertaining to each of the videos viewed earlier. To gain more stable estimates of individual decision tendencies on lineups while not including so many lineups that participants would confuse which lineups were associated with which crime videos, we presented five videos during the initial phase of the experiment and the five corresponding lineups at the end. To maximize the number of observations of each type of lineup for a given participant, the presence of the culprit was manipulated between subjects. Thus, <b>half</b> of participants <b>viewed</b> five CA lineups (CA condition), while the other <b>half</b> <b>viewed</b> five CP lineups (CP condition).|$|R

50|$|Christopher Jones (born 1976) is an American {{innovator}} with {{a strong}} interest in health economics, particularly as it applies to improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. In early 2003, he presented a report, first to then-British Chancellor Gordon Brown and then in the House of Commons, that led to policy changes to the maximum allowable number of transferred embryos {{during the course of a}} woman's in vitro fertilisation treatment. The Times in London reported that Jones' report induced immediate action by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority but divided fertility doctors: <b>half</b> <b>viewed</b> this as a good policy from a public health vantage point, the other <b>half</b> <b>viewed</b> the move as over-regulation in personal affairs. Regardless, Jones showed in a co-authored letter that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine that twins are six-times more likely to occur following in vitro fertilisation, compared with natural conceptions, even when only one embryo was implanted. This led to cost-reductions to the National Health Services of GBP 60 million per year that would otherwise have been spent on ineffective treatments or neonatal intensive care due to excessive numbers of multiple births. He was appointed director of bilateral collaborations at the Center for Study of Multiple Birth, a non-profit devoted entirely to research into the health of multiples. Although few had heard of such a trend in 2003, Jones predicted and found that medical tourism and more particularly reproductive tourism away from the United Kingdom, along with an epidemic of multiple births, would be the likely results of fertility regulation.|$|R

The presence of an intermediary improved perceptions of the interview, with no effect on perceptions of the child. There were differences between participant groups and significant interactions on various measures. These findings have important implications for the intermediary scheme and justice for child victims...|$|R

40|$|Research (e. g. McKelvie, 1990) {{has shown}} that order of {{information}} can influence judgments. In light of equivocal findings in this research, Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) developed their belief-adjustment model to present a more detailed approach to predicting order effects. Greenlees, Dicks, Thelwell and Holder (2007) {{were the first to}} test the predictions of the belief-adjustment model in sport. The aim of this thesis was to extend Greenlees et al. 's work through a more systematic examination of order effects in sport. Specifically, the aims were to examine the generalisability of Greenlees et al. 's findings, to examine the impact of differing processing strategies on order effects, to investigate the influence of personality traits, and to consider variables that might offset order effects. To achieve these aims, four experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, ultimate frisbee players watched DVD footage of two players (a control and target player) performing a catching and throwing drill, and assessed the ability of each target player. Participants viewed the same footage for the control player. For the target player, participants viewed the same footage, with <b>half</b> <b>viewing</b> a declining (successful to unsuccessful) performance pattern, and <b>half</b> <b>viewing</b> an ascending pattern. Study I found primacy effects when participants made one end-of-sequence (EoS) judgment. In addition, step-by-step (SbS) judgments eliminated primacy effects. Study I also controlled for the time delay inherent in making the SbS judgments, and found that SbS processing, rather than the time delays, eliminated order effects. Study 2 examined the effect of individual differences on order effects. Using the same methodology as in Study I, the impact of participants' theory of learning, level of motivation to think, and level of experience were examined.
