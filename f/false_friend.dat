25|$|Bareḳet (בָּרֶקֶת = in the masoretic text) / Smaragdos (in the Septuagint) - Bareketh {{etymologically}} means ‘lightning flash’, whence shimmering or shiny. Smaragdos is cognate with Emerald, {{and literally}} means green stone, but is {{somewhat of a}} <b>false</b> <b>friend</b> as the Greek term could apply {{to a number of}} different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. Smaragdos was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the proper sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty, 1900s BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are heliodor (taking into account the implication of Smaragdos that it was green) and rock crystal (ignoring the literal meaning of Smaragdos, since the masoretic text doesn't appear to specify colour); there is much to be said for Smaragdos being either of those. Although “emerald” is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, bareḳet, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezek. 28:13), the word bareḳet is rendered as “onyx.” Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes בָרקָן = barḳan, for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), the stone called bareḳet had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as “agate.” In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, baḳarani (believed to be a corruption of barḳan) was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen's Hexapla, has also written κεραύνιος (=onyx) for the stone known in Hebrew as bareḳet in Exo. 28:17.|$|E
500|$|During the {{war years}} 1914–18, {{with the issue of}} women's {{suffrage}} quiescent, [...] Cobden became increasingly involved in South African affairs. She supported Solomon Plaatje's campaign against the segregationist Natives' Land Act of 1913, a stance that led, in 1917, to her removal from the committee of the Anti-Slavery Society. The Society's line was to support the Botha government's land reform policy; Cobden denounced Sir John Harris, the Society's parliamentary representative, for being a <b>false</b> <b>friend</b> to the native people by secretly working against them. Cobden maintained her commitment to the cause of Irish freedom, and offered personal help to victims of the Black and Tans during the Irish War of Independence, 1919–21.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "false cognate" [...] is {{sometimes}} misused {{to refer to}} <b>false</b> <b>friends,</b> but the two phenomena are distinct. <b>False</b> <b>friends</b> occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings. While some <b>false</b> <b>friends</b> are also <b>false</b> cognates, many are genuine cognates (see <b>False</b> <b>friends</b> § Causes). For example, English pretend and French prétendre are <b>false</b> <b>friends,</b> but not <b>false</b> cognates, as {{they have the same}} origin.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of phraseology covers {{a wide variety}} of topics relating to the structure and usage of phraseological units. These units of language carry cultural meanings which are reproduced within their own cultural context. Among the different types of phraseological units are <b>false</b> <b>friends.</b> <b>False</b> <b>friends</b> are lexical or phraseological units that take a similar or identical form in two or more languages, but which vary semantically. <b>False</b> <b>friends</b> are deeply intertwined with the context in which they are created. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate the importance of the relationship between text and context in the study of phraseological <b>false</b> <b>friends</b> using an emic approach. The findings outline the need for context to be emphasised in the production of dictionaries containing phraseological <b>false</b> <b>friends.</b> The study of these deceptive phraseological units has implications for contrastive analysts, curriculum designers, foreign language teachers and students, philologists,translation theorists, translators, as well as phraseographers and phraseologists.

500|$|The {{plot was}} adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel St. Elmo. The actual {{production}} was greatly shortened {{for the purposes of}} conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The <b>false</b> <b>friend</b> loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake." ...|$|E
