25|$|It {{was through}} his musical {{interests}} that White met his future wife, Jane Felix (1869-1943), sometime in 1891-92. She was a schoolteacher, and his diaries contain notes about his taking her on dates to concerts in at nearby Denison University and in Columbus, Ohio. White recorded no other love interests in his diaries, and on June 14, 1893 he married Felix in Newark at the unusual hour of 6 am. Family records offer {{no indication of}} why the ceremony was held at that time, but within an hour after they exchanged vows White and his bride boarded a train bound for Chicago where they attended the World's Columbian Exposition. The Exposition was the single largest architectural, artistic, musical, and technological attraction of its time, with more than 26 million visitors, and it attracted {{people from all walks}} of life. It was there that he first encountered photography as a public medium. Not only were there multiple very large exhibits showing photographers from around the world, there were many camera and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers displaying and selling their latest goods, dozens of portrait studios and even on-the-spot documentation of the Exposition itself. It was a non-stop immersion course into the world of photography at the turn of the century.|$|E
500|$|Hindley {{began to}} change her {{appearance}} further, wearing clothing considered risqué such as high boots, short skirts and leather jackets, and the two became less sociable to their colleagues. The couple were regulars at the library, borrowing books on philosophy, as well as crime and torture. They also read works by the Marquis de Sade, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Although Hindley was not a qualified driver (she passed her test on the third attempt, late in 1963), she often hired a van, {{in which the two}} planned bank robberies. Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a [...]22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a Webley [...]45 and a Smith & Wesson [...]38 from other members of the club. Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a Box Brownie, which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment.</b> The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit. For Hindley, this demonstrated a marked change from her earlier, more shy and prudish nature.|$|E

50|$|In 1976 a {{need was}} felt for {{updating}} and extending {{the statute of}} the Society. A new statute was voted in April of that year. Minor revisions were made in 1982 and in 1983 with respect to classes of membership, and again in 1984 {{with respect to the}} use of the <b>darkroom</b> and <b>equipment.</b> In 1990 further changes were made with respect {{to the use of the}} Society’s equipment and premises, and lastly in 1994 with respect of classes of membership once again.|$|R

After {{several years of}} manufacturing <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment,</b> in 1955 the company bought the rights to Kodak's Master View 4x5 camera, enabling Kodak to leave the view camera business. In the 1960s, the company innovated the Caltar large format lens line, the C-2 roll film holder and the nitrogen burst film and print processors.|$|E
50|$|Wolin is the {{youngest}} of five children born into a Jewish family in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her father, Morris Aaron Wolin (ne Wolinsky) immigrated there as a child, directly from the Russian town of Grodno, later to become a businessman. Her mother, Helen Sobol Wolin, came from Denver, Colorado, and was an artist. At age 10, Penny began using a Kodak Brownie Hawkeye. At age 16, her brother Michael Wolin gave her a high quality rangefinder camera and the necessary <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> to begin a career.|$|E
40|$|Some {{classical}} old-fashioned instruments (such as the Wood-Anderson seismometers), {{as well as}} some modern instruments (like the all-quartz made Verbaandert-Melchior tiltmeters), conventionally {{require an}} impractical recording system obtained by a photographic drum recorder in a <b>darkroom.</b> Simple electronic <b>equipment</b> (made by readily available, low cost electronics) may help in using such kind of instruments allowing a useful digital recording.

40|$|Two {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} of measuring offshore ground-water spring discharge {{that have been}} studied are: (i) multispectral photography, and (ii) infrared thermometry. During the summer of 1967, exposure factors for filter-film-camera combinations extending outside the visible spectra were experimentally determined and tabulated. One spectral series of simulated aerial photography was obtained. <b>Darkroom</b> procedures and <b>equipment</b> for multispectral enhancement of the suspected color differences between sea water and offshore spring water in these photographs {{have not yet been}} precisely defined. Helicopter flights with an infrared thermometer have demonstrated that offshore springs can be identified by their temperatures. Due to the irregular shape, size, and location of these fresh water outflows, a synoptic technique is needed. An infrared scanner is desirable but the present costs are prohibitive. U. S.

50|$|At {{the age of}} 23, Haybi married Rumiya Hamdi. As {{customary}} in Yemen, {{they lived}} at his parents home. He worked at the doctor's clinic as a right-hand man and was responsible for ordering materials and medical supplies. He also served as an interpreter between the doctor and the hospital. Over the years, he learned to administer injections and assist in treating patients. The doctor, who had brought photography and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> with him, taught Haybi how to take photographs and develop them {{at a time when}} photography was illegal in Yemen.|$|E
50|$|Concurrent {{with this}} change was the {{development}} of national and international commercial enterprises to meet the new demand for cameras, films and prints. At the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which attracted more than 27 million people, photography for amateurs was marketed at an unprecedented scale. There were multiple large exhibits displaying photographs from around the world, many camera and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers showing and selling their latest goods, dozens of portrait studios and even on-the-spot documentation of the Exposition itself. Suddenly photography and photographers were household commodities.|$|E
50|$|The former spectroscopic {{laboratory}} of the McClean telescope was {{converted into a}} museum in 1987, retaining the original 19th-century fittings. The building still contains the original hydraulic apparatus for raising the observing floor and a darkroom which contains specimens of <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> taken from various domes after photography went out of use. Items on display include telescope models, measuring machines, altazimuth instruments by Dollond (1820) and Bamberg (ca 1900), calculating machines, early office equipment, early electronic devices, lenses from early telescopes including the photographic telescopes of Gill, a clockwork telescope drive, a signal pistol, chemistry equipment etc.|$|E
5000|$|By 1975, Renaissance {{operated}} a dozen businesses downtown. These reportedly included a 24-hour grocery, Cucumber Grocery, Dan Pritchet Audio, a record store, and a stylized pizza parlor, Zapmia Pizza. The Noble Feast restaurant featured diversely innovative cuisine. Rocket’s Silver Train provided luxury-modeled tour buses for rock musicians including the Rolling Stones and Linda Ronstadt. Silver Screen Design and Renaissance Greeting Cards were founded at this time. These businesses used start-up funds from working Renaissance members and two went to become successful national enterprises. These were coupled with contracting crews specializing in high-level industrial and residential painting, paving and excavating, carpentry and plumbing. The recording studio, video lab, <b>darkroom</b> and media <b>equipment</b> were made freely available to members {{to engage in}} creative enterprises. The Choir, an all-women chorus, was created at this time and performed both at church services and at outside concerts. A [...] "Renaissance Radio Show" [...] was syndicated nationally. Outreach to the local community was made {{through a series of}} free public events culminating in a Renaissance Faire street festival (not associated with the better-known Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California) that attracted about 3,000.|$|R
40|$|Introduction and purpose: The growing use of {{ionizing}} radiation in disease diagnosis necessitaes the {{appropriate use of}} devices and awareness regarding the principles of radiation protection. With appropriate adoption of personal protection equipment and compliance with the existing regulations in relation to protection of the buildings where sources of {{ionizing radiation}} are located in, the adverse effects of radiation can be curtailed to a great extent. Methods: In this descriptive, analytical, cross-sectional study, we investigated the rate of compliance with radiation protection standards of 45 radiography rooms in 32 diagnostic imaging centers in Khuzestan Province, Iran, 2015. The centers were chosen through random cluster sampling method. The data were obtained using open-ended interview and a checklist designed based on the recommendations of the International Commission for Radiation Protection and Atomic Energy Organization of Iran.  Results: The compliance rates with regard to radiology room, radiology equipment, darkroom, and radiographer’s protection were 80. 76 %, 80. 47 %, 69. 28 %, and  93. 12 %, respectively. Maximum and minimum rates of compliance with the standards were related to performance of the cassette tray (100 %) and hopper status (25 %), respectively. Comparison {{of public and private}} imaging centers in terms of safety standards showed no significant differences (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: The observance of the radiation protection standards in Khuzestan Province was in a relativly desirable condition. However, there are some shortcomings in compliance with the principles of protection in the darkroom.  In this regard, with recommend adopting protection measures such as timelyreplacement of processing solution, appropriate ventilation of <b>darkroom,</b> provisionof protection <b>equipment</b> and appliances, and protection training required for entering the darkroom...|$|R
50|$|Hamblin {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Alberton, South Africa and was a keen photographer from an early age. He says that he bought his first camera and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> with what he earned photographing athletic schoolboys and selling the photographs to schoolgirls. He speaks often of having grown up with an awareness of alienation and otherness through witnessing his father’s attempt {{to deal with the}} stigma of being homosexual in pre-1994, apartheid-free, South Africa. Hamblin spent his commercial career as an independent photographer (from the age of 21 onwards) immersed in the film, television and theatre industry, giving him access {{to a wide range of}} creative input.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, Bell {{traveled}} to the United States to study the medical principles of homeopathy in St. Louis. In the United States, he joined an expedition undertaken by the Union Pacific Railroad Eastern Division (later Kansas Pacific Railway) to identify and map a southern route for a railroad connection between Kansas and California. Although Bell had no experience in photography, he was recommended for the post of expedition photographer by the expedition's geologist, John Lawrence LeConte. Accordingly, he undertook a two-week crash course in photography, purchased a camera and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment,</b> and joined the expedition in western Kansas, in a region near the Colorado state line that {{was the scene of}} active fighting between local Indians and United States military forces.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1938 as Ponder and Best by Max Ponder and John Best. Max Ponder headed the sales department, while John Best ran the {{operations}} side of the company. Ponder and Best first imported German-made photo equipment. After World War II, the partnership began to import cameras and photographic equipment from Japan. They were instrumental in the introduction of many brands into the American market, including Mamiya/Sekor 35mm cameras, Kobena 8mm movie cameras, Sankyo/Komura wide/tele adapter lenses and a full line of photographic <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> imported from many manufacturers throughout Japan and later Taiwan. Ponder and Best {{were the first to}} gain acceptance for lenses with interchangeable mounts allowing customers to use the same lens on different manufacturers' camera bodies.|$|E

5000|$|Despite his {{leadership}} roles, Fawcett was uncommonly solitary {{in his work}} and private in his personal life. Goodenough describes him as [...] "fair, generous, and austere," [...] recounting how Fawcett encouraged his early interest in black-and-white photography {{at a time when}} Goodenough was a graduate student and couldn't even dream of purchasing good equipment. Fawcett unhesitatingly lent him his fine cameras, lenses, and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment.</b> Yet, Fawcett never failed to greet a young faculty member to Harvard with the admonition that they had not a prayer of being asked to stay on the senior faculty. Similarly, in later years, though Fawcett was clearly devoted to his and Dorothy's four children (Robert, Mary, Dona, and Joseph) his colleagues cannot recall ever meeting them. A contributing factor may have been that Fawcett suffered profoundly from migraine headaches, which he did not reveal to his colleagues and for which he delayed seeking treatment for many decades—a choice that may have caused him to withdraw for hours of silent endurance—until he finally agreed to seek medical attention.|$|E

5000|$|Both circumstantial and DNA {{evidence}} {{relating to}} some of Kraft's murders have caused many to strongly suspect {{that not all of}} the murders attributed to Kraft were committed by one person. The prosecution believed these inconsistencies could only be explained by the fact Kraft did not act alone in several murders. It is contended that Kraft would have had difficulty moving around 200-pound (90 kg) corpses; dumping them from moving vehicles while alone would also be difficult to do unnoticed. Abrasions and debris found at the crime scenes of some of Kraft's victims, whose bodies had been discarded upon or alongside freeways, indicated that the bodies had been discarded from vehicles traveling at more than 50 miles per hour, and for one individual to perform this act without compromising his driving would be very difficult. Moreover, footprints in the sand close to where the body of John Leras was found at Sunset Beach in 1975 unequivocally indicate two people had carried the youth's body to where it was discarded. In the case of Eric Church, semen samples found on the youth's body were inconsistent with Kraft's blood type, and, while the photographs of the victims found in Kraft's car had to have been processed somewhere, no photo developer ever reported Kraft's morbid images to the police. (Kraft himself had no darkroom expertise or <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Bout {{gradually}} {{found that}} the images he presented played {{an essential role in}} his projects. With just a few images and hardly any explanation, the proposals he submitted were met with enthusiasm wherever he went, even by people he had never met before. He created new buildings - new installations - and in that way, also new images. Some projects existed for only 24 hours, while others seem to stay forever.Images have always played an essential role in his work and in his contacts with others. They still do. After accomplishing large scale international projects for more than 25 years, Bout now concentrates on images themselves as a solo artist. Photography always fascinated Bout. In his youth he used simple camera's and homebuilt <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> set up in his parent's converted bathroom. Now he likes to use old fashioned large format camera's and modern digital camera's and printers to produce his work. While in the old days of his career he would invite other people to photograph for him, more and more he has begun documenting everything himself. His attention went from photography as a medium for documentation to photography as an independent way of creating images.In other words, employing combinations of old-fashioned large format cameras and digital cameras, Bout focuses today on photographic images as ideas and their effects: from body landscapes to anemones and the effect of light over water. Bout clearly plays with texture and light and their effects; he creates an imagery that is as diverse, experimental and captivating, as much so as his previous enterprises were.|$|E

5000|$|On a trip in New Mexico in 1941, Adams shot a {{scene of}} the Moon rising above a modest village with snow-covered {{mountains}} in the background, under a dominating black sky. The photograph {{is one of his}} most famous and is named Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico. Adams's description in his later books of how it was made probably enhanced the photograph's fame: the light on the crosses in the foreground was rapidly fading, and he could not find his exposure meter; however, he remembered the luminance of the Moon and used it to calculate the proper exposure. Adams's earlier account was less dramatic, stating simply that the photograph was made after sunset, with exposure determined using his Weston Master meter.However the exposure was actually determined, the foreground was underexposed, the highlights in the clouds were quite dense, and the negative proved difficult to print.The initial publication of Moonrise was in U.S. Camera 1943 annual, after being selected by the [...] "photo judge" [...] for U.S. Camera, Edward Steichen. This gave Moonrise an audience before its first formal exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1944.Over nearly 40 years, Adams re-interpreted the image, his most popular by far, using the latest <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment</b> at his disposal, making over 1,300 unique prints, most in 16″ by 20″ format. Many of the prints were made in the 1970s, finally giving Adams financial independence from commercial projects. The total value of these original prints exceeds $25,000,000; the highest price paid for a single print of Moonrise reached $609,600 at Sotheby's New York auction in 2006.|$|E
40|$|Merely rhetorically and {{answering}} in the negative, Kendall Walton has asked: "Isn't photography just another method people have of making pictures, one that merely uses different tools and materials; cameras, photosensitive paper, and <b>darkroom</b> <b>equipment,</b> rather than canvas, paint, and brushes? And don't the results differ only contingently and in degree, not fundamentally, from pictures of other kinds?" Contrary to Walton and others, I answer with a resounding "Yes" to Walton’s questions in this article. It {{is a widely}} shared view that photographs are somehow special and that they fundamentally differ from hand-made pictures such as paintings, both from a phenomenological point of view (in the way we experience them) and an epistemic point of view (since {{they are supposed to}} have a different that is, greater, epistemic value from paintings that gives us a privileged access to the world). I almost reject the totality of these claims and, as a consequence, there remains little difference between photographs and paintings. As we shall see, “photographs are always partly paintings,” a claim that is true not only of retouched digital photographs but of all photographs, including traditional ones made using photosensitive film and development techniques...|$|E
