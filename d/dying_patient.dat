Materials and Methods: The present study enjoys a quasi-experimental method with using one-group pre-test/post-test design conducted in Bam in southeast of Iran. The attitude of nursing students was measured using Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying (FATCOD) scale before and after an educational intervention. Data were analyzed using non-parametric tests in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 18 software. Results: Of 32 students, 30 participated in this study (response rate of 94 %).

The study used a quantitative causal-comparative research design using two administered questionnaires, the Frommelt’s Attitudes Towards Care of the Dying (FATCOD B) and the Duke University Religion Index (DUREL). A convenience sample of 417 residential undergraduate nursing students were used in this study. The sample consisted of 137 sophomore, 142 junior, and 138 senior pre-licensure nursing students who attended a large Christian university located in the southeastern region of the United States. Using data that were collected from the questionnaires, the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was utilized to analyze research data. The null hypothesis was rejected indicating that a statistically significant difference does exist in attitudes towards care of <b>dying</b> <b>patients</b> between sophomore, junior, and senior nursing students at a Christian university while controlling for religiosity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} process of care of <b>dying</b> <b>patients</b> in general hospitals. DESIGN [...] Non-participant {{observer}} (MM) carried out regular periods of continuous comprehensive observation in wards where there were <b>dying</b> <b>patients,</b> recording {{the quantity and quality}} of care given. Observations were made in 1983. SETTING [...] 13 wards (six surgical, six medical, and one specialist unit) in four large teaching hospitals (bed capacity 504 - 796) in west of Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 50 <b>dying</b> <b>patients</b> (29 female, 21 male) with mean age of 66 (range 40 - 89); 29 were dying from cancer and 21 from non-malignant disease. RESULTS [...] Final period of hospitalisation ranged from 6 hours to 24 weeks. More than half of all patients retained consciousness until shortly before death. Basic interventions to maintain patients' comfort were often not provided: oral hygiene was often poor, thirst remained unquenched, and little assistance was given to encourage eating. Contact between nurses and the <b>dying</b> <b>patients</b> was minimal; distancing and isolation of patients by most medical and nursing staff were evident; this isolation increased as death approached. CONCLUSIONS [...] Care of many of the <b>dying</b> <b>patients</b> observed in these hospitals was poor. We need to identify and implement practical steps to facilitate high quality care of the dying.

But these stories had two marks of {{suspicion}} that always attended them, which caused me always to slight them and to look on them as mere stories that people continually frighted one another with. First, that wherever it was that we heard it, they always placed the scene at the farther end of the town, opposite or most remote from where you were to hear it. If you heard it in Whitechappel, it had happened at St Giles's, or at Westminster, or Holborn, or that end of the town. If you heard of it at that end of the town, then it was done in Whitechappel, or the Minories, or about Cripplegate parish.

6000|$|In the {{collection}} of 1735 there appeared a letter to Digby, which is dated September 10, 1724, and is compounded from two letters, to Caryll of November 23 and December 25, 1725. In the letter of November 23, Pope says to Caryll, [...] "My time has been spent in a trembling attendance upon death, which has at last seized one of our family,--my poor old nurse." [...] This sentence was inserted in the letter to Digby, but as the nurse did not die till November 5, 1725, the information {{could not have been}} communicated to him in September, 1724. The motive of the poet in altering the dates of his letters when he assigned a fanciful address to them was probably to adapt the chronology to the circumstances of his new dramatis personæ. His earliest letter to Edward Blount is dated August, 1714, and when he transferred the moonlight reverie from 1713 to 1716, he may have been influenced by the consideration that in the former year his correspondence with Blount had not commenced. The letter to Caryll of November 23, and the letter to Digby of September 10, both open with the same compliment on their return from the Continent, and the date may have been altered from 1725 to 1724 to make it harmonise with Digby's travels abroad. In remedying one inconsistency, Pope fell into another. A new use was found for the letter in the quarto of 1737. Arbuthnot died in February, 1735, at the very time when there is reason to suppose that the poet printed the P. T. collection. The final letter in the volume is from the Doctor, and it was apparently added at the last moment. It was then too late to be thinking of a re-distribution of the materials, and the idea was not executed, or perhaps conceived till 1737, when the address, which had been changed from Caryll to Digby, was once more changed from Digby to Arbuthnot. In the interval Pope appears to have detected the anachronism. He retained the day of the month, but struck out the year. He preserved the announcement, [...] "death has seized one of our family," [...] but dropped the words [...] "my poor old nurse." [...] Her death nevertheless could alone have been meant; for in the letters to Caryll, as in the letter to Digby, several contemporaneous particulars are mentioned, which being repeated in the letter to Arbuthnot, limit its date to the period of the poor old nurse's decease. In both cases Pope's time had been spent in attending upon the <b>dying</b> <b>patient,</b> in both cases he and his mother had been ill together, in both cases these incidents had hindered his writing, in both cases he had been questioned respecting the effect produced upon his mind by the attacks upon his translation of the [...] "Odyssey," [...] and in both cases he had been less troubled by the criticisms upon his writings than by the imputations upon his morals, in consequence of some reports which had been spread of his intrigues with Martha Blount. It follows that the letter to Arbuthnot, though dated September 10, must have been written subsequent to the death of the nurse on November 5. But there is unanswerable evidence that at that time, and for weeks and months afterwards, he had constant personal intercourse with the poet. He was at his elbow, and not on the Continent,[165] and the event could not have been communicated to him as news upon his return from any journey he ever made to France. The year was omitted by Pope exactly because he could fix upon none which would bear the test of examination.[166] When it is plain that the letter could not have been addressed to Arbuthnot, it is superfluous to dwell upon the improbability that he and Caryll should have put the same question with regard to the [...] "railing papers about the 'Odyssey,'" [...] or to enumerate the other coincidences which are beyond the range of belief. The letter in all its shapes contains a passage which forms a strange comment upon Pope's proceedings, and is the bitterest sentence that will ever be pronounced upon them: [...] "Falsehood is folly, says Homer, and liars and calumniators at last hurt none but themselves, even in this world. In the next, it is charity to say, God have mercy on them. They were the devil's vice-regents upon earth, who is the father of lies, and, I fear, has a right to dispose of his children." ...|$|E

Given the propensity for becoming 'first responders' in dealing with <b>dying</b> <b>patients,</b> attitude towards care of <b>dying</b> <b>patients</b> is an important expertise for nurses which is hypothetically sculpted by various personal and professional experiences. Design and Methods. This cross-sectional correlational study targeted nurses (N= 246) from 11 acute care units of Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. The data were collected using a self-reported survey involving a demographic questionnaire, FA TCOD, Form B© and SHALOM© scales. The response rate was greater than 90 % (N= 228). Hypotheses were tested by Pearson r correlation tests (95 % CI), whereas secondary analyses were performed utilising independent ttests and one-way ANOVA tests. Results. A weak relationship was demonstrated between nurses' SWB and attitudes towards care of <b>dying</b> <b>patients</b> (r= 0. 243, 95 % C/ 0. 117, 0. 36 l;p< 0. 001).
