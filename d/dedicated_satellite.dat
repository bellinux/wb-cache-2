30|$|The {{knowledge}} of position is ubiquitous in many applications and services, playing an important role. The widely diffused Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) offers a worldwide service coverage {{due to a}} network of <b>dedicated</b> <b>satellites</b> [1]. GNSS is recognized to be the de facto system in outdoor environments when it is available. Under the assumption that its reception is not obstructed or jammed [2 – 4], {{there is no doubt}} that GNSS is the main enabler for location-based services (LBS). One of such situations is indoor positioning and tracking, where satellite signals are hardly useful (unless extremely large integration times are considered). In indoor scenarios, a plethora of alternative and complementary technologies can be considered [1, 5, 6].|$|R
