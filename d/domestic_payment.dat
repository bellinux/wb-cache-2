40|$|This paper {{shows how}} a disorderly-working bank-based payment system {{negatively}} affects monetary stability. This occurs when firms invest their profits in production {{with the aim}} of forming and accumulating (fixed) capital, {{while at the same time}} banks carry out the payment of workers’ wages and enter the corresponding payment order in the architecture for <b>domestic</b> <b>payments.</b> In fact, if the payment of wages is financed with profits, this payment operation corresponds to an emission of (empty) money without it being endowed with value, to wit, purchasing power. It follows that the existing value of money is “diluted” in a greater amount of money units, so much so that the current purchasing power of each unit of money is reduced. This monetary phenomenon can be defined as inflation, which, in turn, exerts an upward pressure on the general price level. A structural reform of the bank-based payment system, as suggested in this paper, may consequently improve the defective architecture for <b>domestic</b> <b>payments</b> and thereby promote long-run monetary stability...|$|R

50|$|This {{was also}} a time of {{increasing}} use of technology in retail banking. In 1959, banks agreed on a standard for machine readable characters (MICR) that was patented in the United States for use with cheques, {{which led to the}} first automated reader-sorter machines. In the 1960s, the first Automated Teller Machines (ATM) or Cash machines were developed and first machines started to appear {{by the end of the}} decade. Banks started to become heavy investors in computer technology to automate much of the manual processing, which began a shift by banks from large clerical staffs to new automated systems. By the 1970s the first payment systems started to develop that would lead to electronic payment systems for both international and domestic payments. The international SWIFT payment network was established in 1973 and <b>domestic</b> <b>payment</b> systems were developed around the world by banks working together with governments.|$|E

40|$|In {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market, where average daily turnover is in {{trillions of dollars}} and trades span time zones, legal systems, and <b>domestic</b> <b>payments</b> systems, participants take on various risks. The most serious risk is credit risk - the risk that one party will fail to pay. Central banks, private sector financial institutions, and <b>domestic</b> <b>payments</b> systems operators laboured {{for more than a}} decade to develop a multi-currency settlement system to deal with these risks. The result, the CLS Bank, began operations in September 2002. It virtually eliminates the credit risk inherent in foreign exchange transactions by providing a payment-versus-payment arrangement for settlement. The CLS Bank is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the central banks that have currencies settling through its system. At present there are seven currencies, including the Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada acts as banker for the CLS Bank, providing it with a settlement account and making and receiving payments on its behalf through the Large Value Transfer System. With the participation and support of the world's largest foreign-exchange-dealing institutions, and growing membership, the CLS Bank has the potential to become the dominant global mechanism for settling foreign exchange transactions. ...|$|R

40|$|Payment {{systems in}} Malaysia have been {{undergoing}} changes in recent years. Among the notable changes is {{the emergence of}} electronic-based payment systems. The central bank has been playing an active role in shaping the development of payment systems, particularly in the gradual introduction of electronic-based payment schemes, in the belief that these have the potential to increase efficiency in the economy as whole. The active introduction of e-payment instruments has increased both the value and volume of transactions per capita use of e-payment instruments in recent years. Checks continue to be the major payment instrument, however. Small- and medium-sized enterprises could benefit tremendously from the use of e-payment schemes through more efficient business operations, cost reductions, enhanced security and wider payment channel choice. Noted improvements have also resulted from the introduction of large-value payment systems, such as the payment versus payment infrastructure for the settlement of Malaysian ringgit (RM) -United States (US) dollar (US$) foreign exchange trades and the delivery versus payment settlement for US dollar securities that are issued, deposited and traded in Malaysia. The development of the <b>domestic</b> <b>payment</b> system is becoming more important {{in the development of a}} deep and active domestic financial market that promotes financial market stability and the reinvestment of savings in the country.

The addition of central bank intraday credit to the statistical collection allows for an analysis of liquidity needs in payment systems. JEL classification: E 51, E 58, G 2. Among the least well known of the BIS statistics are the {{statistics on}} payments and settlements. They include data on the use of payment instruments, payment systems, and securities trading, clearing and settlement systems. They have been collected yearly since 1988 for the G 10 countries, being expanded over time to include {{all the members of the}} Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS). 2 They are published in the so-called “Red Book ” on Statistics on payment and settlement systems in selected countries. 3 A methodology and a glossary were added to the publication in 1998. The methodology and representation of the data have changed as from the 2004 data for payment instruments and payment systems, and will be revised as from the 2006 data for securities. The revisions have been coordinated with the ECB, which publishes a similar report for the European Union (the Blue Book). This special feature provides an overview of the payment and settlement statistics collected by the BIS, focusing on recent and planned enhancements. 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS. I would like to thank Stephan Arthur for excellent research assistance. 2 The CPSS is responsible for the collection of these statistics.
