25|$|At {{a meeting}} in February 1851, Brunel {{informed}} the directors that if the scheme were reduced to a single line, the whole route could be constructed for £800,000, including the Tamar crossing and all stations. In April 1852 the directors proposed a capital reconstruction that reduced the commitment of subscribers. Many subscribers defaulted on their commitment nonetheless, but the <b>financial</b> <b>reconstruction</b> enabled the directors to proceed with construction between Truro (from the West Cornwall Railway near Penwithers Junction) and St Austell, and shortly after to Liskeard, about 37 miles in total, as well as, in January 1853, the letting of a £162,000 contract for construction of the bridge over the Tamar.|$|E

25|$|The 12th Earl of Eglinton {{developed}} Ardrossan Harbour in {{the early}} years of the nineteenth century, at a cost of more than £100,000: he intended it as a sea port to serve the City of Glasgow, as the River Clyde was not navigable for large vessels at the time. In 1806 he obtained Parliamentary authority to construct the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal. He hoped that other businessmen would subscribe to his scheme, but in fact only £44,342 was forthcoming. Work started at the Glasgow end, but the canal only reached Johnstone, by which time all of the money had been spent, and debts of £71,209 had been accumulated. As part of a <b>financial</b> <b>reconstruction,</b> the canal's name was changed to the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal.|$|E
25|$|From the {{initiation}} of reparations, German coal deliveries were below the level agreed. In an attempt to rectify this situation, the Spa Conference was held in July 1920. At this conference {{it was decided that}} Germany would be paid five marks per coal ton delivered to facilitate coal shipments and help feed the miners. Despite this, Germany continued to default on her obligations. By late 1922, the German defaults on payments had grown so serious and regular that a crisis engulfed the Reparations Commission. French and Belgian delegates urged the seizure of the Ruhr to encourage the Germans to make more effort to pay, while the British supported postponing payments to facilitate the <b>financial</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of Germany. On 26 December 1922, Germany defaulted on timber deliveries. The timber quota was based upon a German proposal and the default was massive. The Allies were unanimous that the default was in bad faith. In January 1923, despite quota reductions, the German Government defaulted on coal deliveries for the 34th time in three years following the loss of the Upper Silesian coal fields containing 11 per cent of German coal resources, which had been transferred to Poland.|$|E
50|$|The Chillagoe Company {{experienced}} considerable difficulties, undergoing several <b>financial</b> <b>reconstructions.</b> Although {{it was not}} profitable, it nevertheless survived until 1923, and had {{an important}} influence on the mining and railway industries of North Queensland. There is evidence of its operations in the ruined smelter at Chillagoe, and abandoned mine sites at Mungana, Einasleigh, Mount Mulligan and elsewhere. However, the railway lines built by the company from the government railhead at Mareeba to Mungana in 1901, and to Forsayth in 1910, have survived in use. When constructed, {{they were part of}} the longest privately owned railway network in Australia, but were incorporated into the Queensland Government rail system in June 1919 when most of the Chillagoe Company's assets were purchased by the Queensland Government.|$|R
5000|$|The Atlas Diesel merger {{experienced}} significant growth {{during the}} First World War and {{towards the end}} of the war, export dominated 40-50 % of production. The depression years caused significant losses for the company, which led to several <b>financial</b> <b>reconstructions</b> in the 1920s and 1930s. The economy began recovering, demand started growing again in the mid-1930s, and Atlas Diesel experienced a boom in sales, where compressed air operations was the most expansive area.The Second World War remained an active period for the firm and a time when strategic planning for development played a principal role. Manufacturing capabilities were embellished and the purchasing along with the acquisition of manufacturing subsidiaries in Sweden and other countries, was a key component to Atlas Diesel's continued growth after WWII. The [...] "Swedish method" [...] was another war period strategy that strongly influenced the firm's pneumatic program, consisting of lightweight rock drills and drill bits with carbide tips. In 1948 the company terminated its diesel manufacturing and the name [...] "Atlas Diesel" [...] was no longer pertinent. The name Atlas Copco became official in 1955 and was inspired by the Belgian subsidiary Compagnie Pneumatique.|$|R

At this time Forsayth railway station became a Queensland Railways station. The Station Master was withdrawn after floods closed the line in early 1927. When the line reopened for rail motor traffic (hauling one or two goods wagons for freight) a Porter in Charge was appointed. This remained the position until the 1990s when the Porter was withdrawn and a local agent appointed to handle the small remaining railway business for QR. The line is now chiefly a tourist attraction running the Savannahlander from Cairns. Queensland Rail subdivided the land and sold the house as a private residence in 1991.|$|R

50|$|In 1864, Charleston was {{in ruins}} {{following}} federal bombardment of the city. The {{future of the}} college was in doubt {{due to a lack}} of funds and the destruction of many buildings. Ephraim M. Baynard of Edisto Island gave $161,200 to save the College of Charleston. The Ephraim M. Baynard plaque in Harrison Randolph Hall at the College of Charleston commemorates this gift, without which it may have been impossible to continue. Classes resumed on February 1, 1866, and over the next four decades, the college weathered several <b>financial</b> crises, <b>Reconstruction,</b> hurricanes and the devastating earthquake of 1886. Until the 20th century, students who attended the college were primarily Charlestonians.|$|R

50|$|Ultimately, Reconstruction was {{discounted}} as 'Socialism' by moderates {{committed to}} free-market transformation, a popular {{new line of}} political attack levied against the likes of Boss Tweed and Benjamin F. Butler alike. Radicals began to fall even earlier, with the failure of Johnson’s impeachment. Liberal Republicans, eroding the era's political landscape, called for an immediate end to “black barbarism”. White supremacist violence and <b>financial</b> panic weakened <b>Reconstruction</b> to the breaking point. With the Compromise of 1877, it was finished.|$|R
50|$|St. Clara Church on Woodlawn Avenue in Chicago {{became the}} first home of the National Shrine of St. Thérèse in the 1920s.

In 1975, a fire destroyed St. Clara and the Carmelites were faced with the <b>financial</b> challenge of <b>reconstruction</b> of the Shrine.

40|$|From the mid- 19 th Century {{until the}} Great Depression, banks, {{insurance}} companies and other large institutional investors supplied railways with external capital that supported their rise to near hegemony over transport in the U. S. This regime ended in the 1930 ’s, when widespread rail bankruptcies threatened broader credit markets. The federal government intervened via a powerful, new, public <b>financial</b> intermediary—the <b>Reconstruction</b> Finance Corporation—to socialize devalued rail debt, which largely removed private institutional investors from rail capital markets. At this defining moment, the Roosevelt Administration could have used its financial and political leverage to rationalize structural weaknesses in the rail industry. It did not. Thus {{by the time the}} Depression ended, railways were significantly weakened vis a vis their increasingly successful competitors in highway-based transport. Thus, the decline of American railways was caused more by financial factors than, as existing historiography suggests, by either excessive government regulation or failures of railway management. ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{as noted}} above {{the whole idea of}} <b>financial</b> <b>reconstruction</b> was fatally flawed, because the lack of any living WHLR Company directors, meant that there was nobody who could {{validate}} the share/debenture transfers to TCL/WestCo - even if the court was to order it. Thus a take-over and <b>financial</b> <b>reconstruction</b> was impossible. However it was a moot point which would eventually be settled at the High Court. For the time being, having failed to gain the required 75% majority and with little or no prospect of being able to persuade the three local authorities to sell any of their debentures; TCL and WestCo had little choice, but to suspend their attempt at <b>financial</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> This would then allow the OR to continue in his intention of applying to the High Court for permission to sell the assets of the WHLR Company to GCC.|$|E
