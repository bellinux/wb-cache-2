The threshold value in detection of the OFDM symbol is predetermined by considering the trade-off between the probability of false alarming and missed detection. The exact boundary of the FFT window for each OFDM symbol is estimated by a maximum likelihood metric and choosing the argument of the peak value. Verifying the estimated timing offset is the last step to locate {{the start of the}} FFT window.

Moreover, the article presents mistakes in the interpretation of ultrasound images of normal pancreas {{as well as its}} inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. The errors and mistakes in question were divided into three categories: 1) mistakes related to the anatomical structure of the pancreas (anatomical variants, echostructure and echogenicity, course of the splenic artery); 2) mistakes related to anatomical structures localized in the vicinity of the pancreas (caudate lobe of the liver, other organs and intestinal loops surrounding the head of the pancreas, vessels and bile ducts, lymph nodes in the region of the pancreas or duodenal diverticula and tumors); 3) mistakes related to the pathologies of the pancreas (inflammatory and neoplastic lesions including differentiation between inflammatory tumors and malignant masses).

40|$|In this research, double-command {{control of}} a {{nonlinear}} chemical system is addressed. The system includes a stirred tank; two flows of liquid with different concentrations are entering the system through two valves and another flow is exiting the tank with a concentration between two input concentrations. The outlet concentration is usually regulated by the control {{of one of the}} valves and the flow rate of the second valve is fixed. The authors have already accomplished the single-command control of this system using neuro-predictive technique. Although, this problem is known as a good example for neuro-predicitve control, but this technique was found both ineffective (in terms of offering <b>improper</b> <b>performance)</b> and inefficient (in terms of needing heavy computations) when it is tried for double-command control (the control of both valves). Therefore, a fuzzy controller is designed to double-command control this system in the simulation environment. In order to avoid output chattering and frequent change of control command (leading frequent closing-opening of control valves, in practice) a damper rule is added to the fuzzy control system. A steady state control law is also derived from nonlinear mathematical model of the system to be added to transient control command whose increments are generated by fuzzy controller. The hybrid control system leads a very smooth change of control input which is suitable for real applications. The designed control systems offer lower error integral, control command change and processing time in comparison to single-command neuro-predictive controllers. Mohammadzaheri, M. and Lei Che...|$|R

40|$|Staplers have {{improved}} {{the results of}} esophageal surgery, in our experience and in others experience, as esophago-enteric anastomoses have become safer and faster than when manual suturing is used. Probably {{one of the last}} problems in the stapler technique, especially in the thoracic area, is the performance of on adequate esophageal purse-string suture: an <b>improper</b> <b>performance</b> of this suture can cause a dangerous leak of the anastomosis. So, many surgeons, {{to reduce the risk of}} esophageal dehiscence connected with the esophageal purse-string, use either purse-string devices or alternative methods such as a second handsewn purse-string, U stitches of the esophagus, etc. We think that the risk of improper anastomoses after esophageal resection can be reduced if the need for the esophageal purse-string can be eliminated. This work shows our personal technique for performing esophagoenterostomy, especially in the thoracic area, using the new CEEA stapler (Autosuture) without esophageal purse-string sutures. According to the modified procedure the stapler anvil and the mini rod are introduced in the esophagectomy and a 2 - 0 thread is knotted around the CEEA mini rod. Then the esophageal mutilated part is closed by a linear stapler keeping a syringe needle, which contains the thread, through the linear suture. Then, using the thread as a pulling system, the surgeon makes the needle and the tip of the mini rod slide out of the esophageal suture. Now the surgeon can reassemble the CEEA and perform the anastomosis. There are many clinical reports that cite no leaks following circular stapled anastomoses across linear stapled closures...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, liposuction is {{the most}} {{frequently}} performed aesthetic surgery procedure in Western Countries. This technique has had rapid development since the 1970 s, when it was experimented {{for the first time}} by A. and G. Fischer. It is currently widely used in clinical practice for many different situations in aesthetic, reconstructive and functional fields. Materials and methods: This review aims to describe the historical evolution of liposuction by analyzing the transformation of the method in function of the introduction of innovative ideas or instruments. We have also focused on reporting the major clinical applications of this surgical technique, applicable to almost the entire body surface. We finally analyzed the complications, both major and minor, associated with this surgical technique. Results: Liposuction is mainly used to correct deep and superficial fat accumulations and remodel the body contour. It has become an essential complementary technique to enhance the aesthetic result of many other aesthetic procedures such as reduction mammoplasty, abdominoplasty, brachioplasty, thigh lift and post bariatric body contouring. However, it can be largely used for the treatment of innumerable pathologies in reconstructive surgery such as lipomas, lipedema, lipodystrophies, pneudogynecomastia and gynecomastia, macromastia e gigantomastia, lymphedema and many others. The complication rate is very low, especially when compared with conventional excisional surgery and the major, complications are generally associated with <b>improper</b> <b>performance</b> of the technique and poor patient management before and after surgery. Conclusion: Liposuction is a safe, simple and effective method of body contouring. It has enormous potential for its application in ablative and reconstructive surgery, far from the most common aesthetic processes with a very low complication rate...|$|R

To {{better understand the}} causes and outcomes of lawsuits involving salivary gland surgery by analyzing mal-practice litigation trends to prevent future litigation and improve physician education. Study Design. Analysis of a national database. Setting. All US civil trials. Subjects and Methods. The WESTLAW database was reviewed from January 1987 to March 2011. Data were compiled on {{the demographics of the}} defendant, anatomic site of injury, initial pathology, nature of injury, legal allegations, verdicts, and indemnities. Results. Twenty-six cases met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Verdicts/settlements for the plaintiffs predominated (58 %), and the average sum of the plaintiff ’s monetary award was $ 933, 235. Sixteen cases (62 %) involved injury to the parotid gland/duct, with 10 cases involving injury to the facial nerve. No cases were filed on the grounds of failure to use facial nerve monitoring. Nine cases (35 %) involved injury to the submandibular gland/ duct. The most common legal allegations listed were <b>improper</b> <b>performance</b> followed by unnecessary proce-dures. If failure or inadequate consent was a component of the legal allegations, the verdict outcome significantly favored the defendants. Conclusion. Our study reveals that the plaintiffs in litigations involving salivary gland surgery have a slight advantage in outcomes with a fairly substantial award. Our litigation review reiterates the importance of detailed anatomic knowledge of the lingual and facial nerve to avoid the pitfalls of surgical error and consequent litigation. In addition, thor-ough preoperative evaluation of salivary gland pathology, including radiographic studies and needle biopsy, may help avoid errors in diagnosis and subsequent litigations.

Understanding this unique action-perception linkage would help us to assess the brain function connecting automatic motor controls and the conscious awareness of action. Here we directly pose a question: Does the odd sensation emerge because of the unfamiliar motor behavior itself toward the irregular step-height of a stopped escalator or as a consequence of an automatic habitual motor program cued by the escalator itself. We compared the properties of motor behavior toward a stopped escalator (SE) with those toward moving escalator and toward a wooden stairs (WS) that mimicked the stopped escalator, and analyzed the subjective feeling of the odd sensation in the SE and WS conditions. The results show that moving escalator-specific motor actions emerged after participants had stepped onto the stopped escalator despite their full awareness that it was stopped, as if the motor behavior was guided by a "phantom" of a moving escalator. Additionally, statistical analysis reveals that postural forward sway that occurred after the stepping action is directly linked with the odd sensation. The results suggest a dissociation between conscious awareness and subconscious motor control: the former makes us perfectly aware of the current environmental situation, but the latter automatically emerges as a result of highly habituated visual input no matter how unsuitable the motor control is. This dissociation appears to yield an attribution conflict, resulting in the odd sensation...|$|R

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} bridges currently {{account for}} 45 % of bridges {{built in the}} last five years in the United States. This has resulted in an increase in the number of deficient bridges composed of prestressed concrete, which requires a better understanding of the on-site performance of this building material. The use of new materials, such as high performance concrete, in conjunction with prestressing provides additional motivation for the creation of structural health monitoring (SHM) methods for prestressed concrete. This paper identifies two parameters relevant to prestressed concrete, along with methods for their evaluation. The parameters evaluated are the prestressing force value at transfer and the width of pre-release cracks, both of which are indicators of structural <b>performance.</b> <b>Improper</b> transfer of the prestressing force can result in tensile stresses in the concrete that exceed capacity and result in cracks and/or excessive deflections. Pre-release cracks occur in the concrete prior to transfer of the prestressing force and are mainly caused by autogenous shrinkage and thermal gradients. Closure of the cracks is expected by virtue of prestressing force transfer. However, the extent of crack closure is important in order to guarantee durability and structural integrity. This paper presents an integral overview of two novel methods for the statistical evaluation of the two monitored parameters: prestressing forces and the width of pre-release cracks. Validation of the methods is performed through application to two structures, both of which are components of Streicker Bridge on the Princeton University campus.

40|$|Whether {{a person}} is under a duty to make any effort to control the conduct of another to avoid harm to a third person {{presents}} {{a problem in the}} law of Torts which is generally treated as one of affirmative obligation. The distinction between misfeasance and mere non-feasance is an old one and, while the line is recognized as shadowy in places, it still affords a practical basis for analysis. Whether given conduct is to be described as the <b>improper</b> <b>performance</b> of proper acts or a failure to perform acts which should have been performed is the orthodox touch-stone for deciding many tort cases. To be sure, this formula is capable of manipulation, and any given set of facts can be compressed to come within the concept of non-feasance or expanded to fit the mould of misfeasance. The trick is a simple one of selecting that point in the series of happenings from which the analysis is to start. An accident at a level crossing, for example, may be logically regarded {{as the result of the}} mere failure of the engineer to sound a warning or make timely application of his brakes; on the other hand, it can be regarded as the improper operation of the locomotive. In the former description, the logic is the one of non-feasance; the latter is that of misfeasance. Actually, the formula is superficial and inexact. The basic principles, however, for determining duty are the same in all cases. A sounder basis for analysis is the relationship of the parties. If the conduct of the actor has brought him into a human relationship with another, of such character that sound social policy requires either some affirmative action or precautions in action on his part to avoid harm, the duty to act or take the precautions is imposed by the law. 2 ̆ 2 Given a relation, 2 ̆ 2 says Justice Cardozo with characteristic insight, 2 ̆ 2 involving in its existence a duty of care..., a tort may result as well from acts of omission as of commission in the fulfillment of duty thus required by law. What we need to know is not so much the conduct to be avoided when the relation and its attendant duty are established as existing. What we need to know is the conduct that engenders the relation. It is here that the formula, however incomplete, has its value and significance. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|The {{uniformity}} {{and accuracy}} of chemical fertilizer and seed broadcasting on field surface are significant parameters of broadcaster <b>performance.</b> <b>Improper</b> and inaccurate broadcasting causes abnormal and nonhomogeneous soil fertility which is against to the purposes of sustainable agriculture. Broadcasters also are used for planting seeds like wheat, barley etc.,soit’s appropriate performance effect on crop production. The {{results of this study}} help us to analyze broadcaster performance parameters and choose suitable device for best fitting to our purposes. In this research, the uniformity performance of oscillating and centrifugal broadcaster was studied. The research was done using factorial experiment in form of randomized complete block design with three factors and three replications. Three factors were used: 1 - broadcaster type including oscillating and centrifugal, 2 -Material types to be broadcasted including a) urea fertilizer, b) ammonium phosphate fertilizer and c) wheat seed with different mass and density were used and 3 - broadcasters gate opening rates(two levels including fully open and semi-open outlet gate). All treatments were applied according to ASAE S 341. 2, 1999 test code. The EXCEL datasheet was used to provide histogram of broadcasting pattern. The performance parameters used were the uniformity of each broadcaster that was measured by using broadcasting pattern and astatistical index, coefficient of variation. The analysis was done with the 99 % level of confidence which showed that oscillating broadcaster had higher broadcasting uniformity than centrifugal broadcaster. Also results showed that increasing the average of particles mass would increase the uniformity of broadcasting. Results indicated that increasing broadcasting rate due to increasing output flow rate of particles, would decrease uniformity of broadcasting...|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} {{discretionary}} powers of authorities and officials {{of local government}} has been developed, and possible dangers associated with their implementation {{in the context of}} the local government development in Ukraine have been outlined. The study attempts to specify the nature of these powers with due regard to the specific features of local government and outline approaches for improving the regulation of relations in the exercise of discretionary powers. The need for further researches in this area in the field of public administration, in particular, regarding the practice­oriented research support to activities of authorities and officials of local government in this area, has been substantiated. The article focuses on the importance of not only reducing the number of discretionary powers, but also ensuring the proper monitoring of the exercise of such powers on the basis of law, justice, and expediency. The article emphasizes the need to strengthen accountability of authorities and officials of local government, including the social and political accountability and development of practices of public control over the decision­making in the field of local government. The research results confirm the relevance of an issue of the formation of competence of officials on the matters of the exercise of discretionary powers. It is recommended to develop the techniques of making decisions or actions during the implementation of discretionary powers as methodological support. This methodology is based on the requirements of the Administrative Court Procedure Code of Ukraine and existing methodologies with anti­corruption expertise. It has been noted that discretionary powers of authorities and officials of local government make it possible to increase the level of their freedom in the activities concerning the functions of local government. It gains in particular importance in the absence of decision­making opportunities otherwise. However, these powers necessitate ensuring a high level of legal culture, accountability and efficient control mechanisms, protection of citizens from harm caused as a result of the exercise of such powers. Introduction of prefects has been considered as opportunities for monitoring the implementation of discretionary power in local government, especially, regarding the observation of law. Regulation of the performance of a significant amount of powers related to the regulation of relations between a local government authority and individuals and legal entities in different spheres of life is revealed as a means of reducing the corruption factor in their performance. The focus of this regulation, as concluded by the study, should be given to the determination of basic conditions, terms of decisions or actions, accountability for their failure or <b>improper</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R
