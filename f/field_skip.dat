40|$|Reliable {{quantitative}} analysis of white matter connectivity {{in the brain}} is an open problem in neuroimaging, with common solutions requiring tools for fiber tracking, tractography segmentation and estimation of intersubject correspondence. This paper proposes a novel, template matching approach to the problem. In the proposed method, a deformable fiber-bundle model is aligned directly with the subject tensor <b>field,</b> <b>skipping</b> the fiber tracking step. Furthermore, {{the use of a}} common template eliminates the need for tractography segmentation and defines intersubject shape correspondence. The method is validated using phantom DTI data and applications are presented, including automatic fiber-bundle reconstruction and tract-based morphometry. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

50|$|Al Kaline {{gave the}} Tigers a 2-1 {{lead in the}} {{eleventh}} with a solo homer off Fingers and looked like a hero at that point. In {{the bottom of the}} eleventh, Lolich gave up back-to-back singles to Sal Bando and Mike Epstein. Chuck Seelbach relieved Lolich. Gene Tenace attempted a sacrifice bunt, but third baseman Aurelio Rodríguez pounced on it and forced Blue Moon Odom, running for Bando, at third. Tigers shortstop Ed Brinkman then fired to first, his throw pulling Dick McAuliffe covering first off the bag. McAuliffe appeared to tag Tenace out, but he was called safe. Gonzalo Marquez pinch hit for Dal Maxvill and grounded a base hit to right, scoring Mike Hegan, running for Epstein, and tying the game.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>skipping</b> is a {{variable}} technique for reducing drastically the bit rate necessary to transmit a television signal. All fields {{have to be}} reconstructed at the receiver end, but nearest-neighbor or linear interpolations give poor performances when significant scene activity is present; therefore, some motion compensation scheme is mandatory. Although any of the algorithms proposed for motion estimation {{can be used for}} motion compensated interpolation, in this paper only the pel-recursive algorithm is considered. Past experience is briefly summarized and, based on criticism, improvements to the basic algorithm are proposed that seem to lead to an estimated motion field that is accurate enough. Multiple recursions and appropriate selection rules are proposed to counteract streaking effects of the recursive algorithm when it crosses image boundaries. The estimation of a forward and a backward motion field is used to identify image areas where occlusion effects are present. Experimental results are presented that seem to indicate that the proposed interpolation scheme has good performanc...|$|R

40|$|Transverse {{electron}} focusing in {{a two-dimensional}} electron gas is investigated experimentally and theoretically for the first time. A split Schottky gate {{on top of a}} GaAs-AlxGa 1 –xAs heterostructure defines two point contacts of variable width, which are used as injector and collector of ballistic electrons. As evidenced by their quantized conductance, these are quantum point contacts with a width comparable to the Fermi wavelength. At low magnetic <b>fields,</b> <b>skipping</b> orbits at the electron-gas boundary are directly observed, thereby establishing that boundary scattering is highly specular. Large additional oscillatory structure in the focusing spectra is observed at low temperatures and for small point-contact size. This new phenomenon is interpreted in terms of interference of coherently excited magnetic edge states in a {{two-dimensional electron gas}}. A theory for this effect is given, and the relation with nonlocal resistance measurements in quantum ballistic transport is discussed. It is pointed out, and experimentally demonstrated, that four-terminal transport measurements in the electron-focusing geometry constitute a determination of either a generalized longitudinal resistance or a Hall resistance. At high magnetic fields the electron-focusing peaks are suppressed, and a transition is observed to the quantum Hall regime. The anomalous quantum Hall effect in this geometry is discussed in light of a four-terminal resistance formula. ...|$|R

50|$|The VCR format was {{introduced}} in 1972, just after the Sony U-matic format in 1971. Although at first glance the two might {{appear to have been}} competing formats, they were aimed at very different markets. After failing as a consumer format, U-matic was marketed as a professional television production format, whilst VCR was targeted particularly at educational but also domestic users.

50|$|In video, <b>skip</b> <b>field</b> {{recording}} is {{a process}} in which only one field (one half of a frame) of video is recorded in order to conserve recording media space. For some kinds of recording, the quality loss of not using both fields of video is fairly negligible, it results in the loss of half of possible vertical video resolution and temporal resolution. It was a common method used in early telerecording systems, as well as early and current non-professional/industrial videotape formats such as CV-2000 and Cartrivision.|$|R

50|$|The CV-2000 was {{developed}} by Sony engineer Nobutoshi Kihara. On its release, each machine cost US$695. It used 1/2 in video tape in a reel-to-reel format, meaning the tape had to be manually threaded around the helical scan video head drum. The CV-2000 was one-tenth the weight and price of other analog video recording products of its era. It recorded television programs {{in black and white}} using the <b>skip</b> <b>field</b> process, which produced a maximum 200-lines resolution. The tape moved at a speed of 7.5 inches per second.

5000|$|This {{brought a}} {{struggling}} Dave Winfield to the plate. Winfield, {{to this point}} in the series, was hitting below [...]250 and was hitless in his four previous at-bats in the game. He had also struggled in his only other appearance in the World Series, when {{he was a member of}} the 1981 New York Yankees team that lost that year's World Series. Leibrandt was worked to a full count by the 41-year-old veteran outfielder, and on the sixth pitch of the at-bat Winfield connected on a line drive down the left field line. White scored from second and after the ball took a bad hop off the left <b>field</b> corner and <b>skipped</b> away from Gant, Alomar scored without a play. Winfield's hit was his first career World Series extra-base hit, and at 41 he was the oldest player in baseball history to record one in the World Series. Leibrandt managed to retire Maldonado to end the inning, but as he had done in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series, he gave up a run-scoring extra base hit to give the opposing team the lead; in that game he allowed a solo home run by Kirby Puckett which cost the Braves the game.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Traditionally, {{clinical}} research studies rely on collecting data with case report forms, which are subsequently {{entered into a}} database to create electronic records. Although well established, this method is time-consuming and error-prone. This study compares four electronic data capture (EDC) methods with the conventional approach with respect to duration of data capture and accuracy. It was performed in a West African setting, where clinical trials involve data collection from urban, rural and often remote locations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three types of commonly available EDC tools were assessed in face-to-face interviews; netbook, PDA, and tablet PC. EDC performance during telephone interviews via mobile phone was evaluated as a fourth method. The Graeco Latin square study design allowed comparison of all four methods to standard paper-based recording followed by data double entry while controlling simultaneously for possible confounding factors such as interview order, interviewer and interviewee. Over a study period of three weeks the error rates decreased considerably for all EDC methods. In {{the last week of}} the study the data accuracy for the netbook (5. 1 %, CI 95 %: 3. 5 - 7. 2 %) and the tablet PC (5. 2 %, CI 95 %: 3. 7 - 7. 4 %) was not significantly different from the accuracy of the conventional paper-based method (3. 6 %, CI 95 %: 2. 2 - 5. 5 %), but error rates for the PDA (7. 9 %, CI 95 %: 6. 0 - 10. 5 %) and telephone (6. 3 %, CI 95 % 4. 6 - 8. 6 %) remained significantly higher. While EDC-interviews take slightly longer, data become readily available after download, making EDC more time effective. Free text and date fields were associated with higher error rates than numerical, single select and <b>skip</b> <b>fields.</b> CONCLUSIONS: EDC solutions have the potential to produce similar data accuracy compared to paper-based methods. Given the considerable reduction in the time from data collection to database lock, EDC holds the promise to reduce research-associated costs. However, the successful implementation of EDC requires adjustment of work processes and reallocation of resources...|$|R
