A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E
25|$|In the West Bank, {{collection}} of rainwater {{is a very}} limited resource in addition to tanker truck water for Palestinians who lack connection to the water grid, notably in rural areas. However, Israeli authorities control even the {{collection of}} small quantities of rainwater. According to the 2009 report Troubled Waters by Amnesty International, some 180,000–200,000 Palestinians living in rural communities <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> running water and the Israeli army often prevents them from even collecting rainwater.

25|$|Katsav was Israel Prison Service inmate #1418989. His cell {{was located}} in the prison's Torani cellblock, a special bloc for {{religious}} prisoners.

25|$|While many Palestinians {{living in}} rural {{communities}} <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> running water, Israeli settlers who export their products have irrigated farms, lush gardens and swimming pools. The 450,000 settlers use as much or even more water than all 2.3 million Palestinians together. Many Palestinians have to buy water from Israel, of often dubious quality, delivered with tanker trucks at very high prices. Water tankers are forced to take long detours to avoid Israeli military checkpoints and roads which are out of bounds to Palestinians, resulting in steep increases {{in the price of}} water.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{simplest}} methods of prevention and treatment focus on preventing infestation of body lice. Complete change of clothing, washing the infested clothing in hot water, {{and in some cases}} also treating recently used bedsheets all help to prevent typhus by removing potentially infected lice. Clothes also left unworn and unwashed for 7 days also cause both lice and their eggs to die, as they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> their human host. Another form of lice prevention requires dusting infested clothing with a powder consisting of 10% DDT, 1% malathion, or 1% permethrin, which kill lice and their eggs.|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, {{schools have}} been {{reported}} to have gained the improved sanitation facility. Given the existing socio-cultural norms and situation of sanitation in schools, girl students are forced not to relieve themselves in the open unlike boys. Lack of facilities in home forces women to wait for the night to relieve themselves and avoid being seen by others. Access to sanitation in some parts of northern India is very poor: about 85% of the rural households in Bihar <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a toilet; and this creates a dangerous situation for women and girls who are followed, attacked and raped in the fields.|$|E

25|$|Although Malagasy {{women have}} {{increasingly}} begun to use contraceptives, both oral and injected, those used are not enough; only 1.5 {{percent of women}} use implanted contraceptives. The abortion rate is estimated at 1 in 10, with 24 percent of women having undergone an abortion. Fifteen percent of married women wishing to use contraceptives <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> family planning initiatives.

25|$|Concerning affordability, an {{analysis}} of the 2007 household budget survey shows that the wealthiest quintile of Tanzanians spends more than 4000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$3.10) per month for water, corresponding to about 1 percent of their income. Those in the poorest quintile spend only about 1000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$0.77) per month for water, but this represents 4.5 percent of their income. One of the reasons why the poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams. The data are not differentiated between rural and urban areas, although {{it is likely that the}} urban poor who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> free water sources pay much more for water than those in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{domestic}} partnership option under Belarussian law, although co-habitation outside of marriage, even by heterosexual couples, is common. Domestic partnership {{is not a}} legal basis for one partner’s changing his or her surname. It {{does not lead to}} spousal material commonwealth between the partners. Among the responsibilities taken on by the partners in their life together, the only ones legally enforced are those listed in the civil law. When they have a common business, their relations are regulated by the rules of commercial law. If they break up, the partners <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the legally recognized rights of a spouse in a divorce.

25|$|However {{oral hygiene}} is {{probably}} more effective at preventing gum disease (periodontal disease) than tooth decay. Food is forced inside pits and fissures under chewing pressure, leading to carbohydrate-fueled acid demineralisation where the brush, fluoride toothpaste, and saliva <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> remove trapped food, neutralise acid, or remineralise demineralised tooth like on other more accessible tooth surfaces. (Occlusal caries accounts for between 80 and 90% of caries in children (Weintraub, 2001).) Chewing fibre like celery after eating forces saliva inside trapped food to dilute any carbohydrate like sugar, neutralise acid and remineralise demineralised tooth. The teeth at highest risk for carious lesions are the permanent first and second molars due to length of time in oral cavity and presence of complex surface anatomy.|$|E
25|$|Churches {{such as the}} Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches {{practice}} closed communion {{under normal}} circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Church of the East) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the Holy See judges to be sacramentally {{in the same position}} as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a minister of their own community. Some Protestant communities exclude non-members from Communion.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{recognition}} of same-sex unions in Australia takes {{a variety of}} forms depending on the jurisdiction. Under Australian federal law, same-sex couples can be recognised as de facto relationships, but <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> marriage, civil unions or other federal relationship registration. Australian states and territories are entitled to create their own laws with respect to same-sex relationship registers and same-sex partnership schemes, with most offering civil unions or other forms of domestic partnership to same-sex couples. Same-sex couples are prevented from marrying by amendments to the Marriage Act 1961, passed in 2004 by the Howard Government and Mark Latham-led Australian Labor Party. Additionally, same-sex couples who are married in countries where same-sex marriage is legal cannot divorce within Australia when they come back due to the same-sex marriage ban.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{the need}} for secrecy during the two months of filming, all {{candidates}} are made to sign a confidentiality agreement which prohibits all, but a few confidants nominated by them, to be told of where they will be during that time, which remains active after filming until the series has started broadcast, with all {{contact with the outside world}} restricted to a high level; each candidate gets a limited phone call once a week, and all <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> newspapers, television or internet, while any electronic communication equipment they have (i.e. mobiles) is handed in before they begin. In addition, all candidates are made to remain in their accommodation throughout filming except when they must head out for a task, and can only take a day off if they are supervised by a chaperone from the production crew. As a result, the persistent presence of the cameras, the closeness of rivals in the competition and the lack of contact with families & friends, can cause considerable pressure and stress for a candidate between entering the process, to leaving it.|$|E
