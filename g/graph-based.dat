5|$|Another medical {{study as}} part of the MetaHit (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract) project {{consisted}} of 124 individuals from Denmark and Spain consisting of healthy, overweight, and irritable bowel disease patients. The study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria. Using Illumina GA sequence data and SOAPdenovo, a de Bruijn <b>graph-based</b> tool specifically designed for assembly short reads, they were able to generate 6.58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total contig length of 10.3 Gb and a N50 length of 2.2 kb.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, Edith Clarke {{invented the}} [...] "Clarke {{calculator}}", a simple <b>graph-based</b> calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions. This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for inductance and capacitance in power transmission lines.|$|E
2500|$|Developing {{computational}} {{tools for}} identification of cell populations {{has been an}} area of active research only since 2008. Many individual clustering approaches have recently been developed, including model-based algorithms (e.g., flowClust and FLAME), density based algorithms (e.g. FLOCK and SWIFT, <b>graph-based</b> approaches (e.g. SamSPECTRAL) and most recently, hybrids of several approaches (flowMeans and flowPeaks). [...] These algorithms are different in terms of memory and time complexity, their software requirements, their ability to automatically determine the required number of cell populations, and their sensitivity and specificity. The FlowCAP (Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods) project, with active participation from most academic groups with research efforts in the area, is providing a way to objectively cross-compare state-of-the-art automated analysis approaches.|$|E
2500|$|For some {{versions}} of the algorithm, {{it is possible to}} prove that it is convergent (i.e., it is able to find the global optimum in finite time). The first evidence of a convergence ant colony algorithm was made in 2000, the <b>graph-based</b> ant system algorithm, and then algorithms for ACS and MMAS. Like most metaheuristics, {{it is very difficult to}} estimate the theoretical speed of convergence. In 2004, Zlochin and his colleagues showed that COA-type algorithms could be assimilated methods of stochastic gradient descent, on the cross-entropy and estimation of distribution algorithm. They proposed these metaheuristics as a [...] "research-based model". A performance analysis of continuous ant colony algorithm based on its various parameter suggest its sensitivity of convergence on parameter tuning.|$|E
