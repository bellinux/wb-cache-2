5|$|The Destroying Angel and <b>Daemons</b> of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, {{also known}} as The Destroying Angel and <b>Daemons</b> Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate and The Destruction of the Temple of Vice, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for nude paintings, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency {{and a lack of}} creativity. With The Destroying Angel he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8cm by 101.9cm (50in by 40in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of <b>daemons.</b> Some of the human occupants are dead or unconscious, others flee in terror or struggle helplessly against the <b>daemons.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the painting, <b>daemons</b> drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right hand corner turns to see flames {{reflected}} {{in the eyes of the}} daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the <b>daemons</b> or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was The Destroying Angel and <b>Daemons</b> of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate.|$|E
5000|$|In {{multitasking}} computer operating systems, a <b>daemon</b> ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a computer}} program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a <b>daemon</b> end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is, in fact, a <b>daemon,</b> and for differentiation between a <b>daemon</b> and a normal computer program. For example, syslogd is the <b>daemon</b> that implements the system logging facility, and sshd is a <b>daemon</b> that serves incoming SSH connections.|$|R
5000|$|The CRS {{service has}} four components, each {{handling}} {{a variety of}} functions: Cluster Ready Services <b>daemon</b> (CRSd), Oracle Cluster Synchronization Service <b>Daemon</b> (OCSSd), Event Volume Manager <b>Daemon</b> (EVMd), and Oracle Process Clusterware <b>Daemon</b> (OPROCd). Failure or death of the CRS <b>daemon</b> can cause node failure, which triggers automatic reboots of the nodes to avoid the corruption of data (due to the possible failure of communication between the nodes), also known as fencing. The CRS <b>daemon</b> runs as [...] "root" [...] (super user) on UNIX platforms and runs as a service on Windows platforms.|$|R
50|$|Applications {{wanting to}} contact the ESD <b>daemon</b> do so using the libesd library. Much like with file i/o, a ESD {{connection}} is first opened. The ESD <b>daemon</b> will be spawned automatically by libesd if a <b>daemon</b> is not already present. Data is then either read or written to the ESD <b>daemon.</b> For an ESD client local to the machine that the ESD <b>daemon</b> is running on, the data is transferred through a local socket, then written to the sound device by the ESD <b>daemon.</b> For a client on a remote machine, the data is sent by libesd on the remote machine over the network to the ESD <b>daemon.</b> The process is completely transparent to the application using ESD.|$|R
5|$|On the {{left-hand}} {{side of the}} painting, in the background, {{the structure of the}} temple crumbles and burns {{in the wake of the}} angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching <b>daemons.</b> In the foreground a drunken man mimics the pose of the Barberini Faun as he clutches his head, alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.|$|E
5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour signal from these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white signal from the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The <b>Dæmons.</b> Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E
5|$|Regis {{agrees to}} deploy the Kingsglaive, {{although}} their commander Drautos has disappeared. While Nyx succeeds in rescuing Lunafreya, {{many of the}} Kingsglaive turn on him; all but Nyx, Lunafreya and rebel leader Luche Lazarus perish in the ensuing battle. At the treaty-signing ceremony, the Niflheim delegation springs a surprise attack and kills the ruling council, while their army enters by destroying the Wall {{with help from the}} rebels, who are subsequently massacred. Lunafreya and Nyx reach the Citadel just as Regis is battling Glauca. During the fight, Glauca cuts the Ring of the Lucii from Regis's hand. Ravus attempts to put on the Ring and claim its power, but it rejects him and destroys his arm before he can remove it. Nyx, Lunafreya and Regis retrieve the Ring and flee with Glauca in pursuit. Regis forces the two to go on without him, dying in his ensuing battle with Glauca. Aldercapt and Ardyn—having successfully stolen the Crystal—leave Insomnia to be destroyed by Niflheim's <b>Daemons.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The [...]MDX suffix {{also appears}} on CD and DVD image files, Media Data Extended, {{apparently}} native to <b>Daemon</b> Tools. Newer versions of <b>Daemon</b> Tools support it (e.g. <b>Daemon</b> Tools Lite v4.48.1).|$|R
50|$|In Warhammer Fantasy, a {{powerful}} warrior {{may be given}} the gift of possession by a <b>daemon.</b> As with the Possessed Chaos Space Marines, this grants him extraordinary power; but, because the <b>daemon</b> must expend {{a great deal of}} energy maintaining its presence within the warrior, the Exalted <b>Daemon</b> is not quite as powerful as a <b>Daemon</b> Prince. Like a Prince, the daemonic nature of the Exalted <b>Daemon</b> can render it vulnerable to anti-daemon weapons and powers, despite the mortal body.|$|R
5|$|Twelve years later, the Kingsglaive {{fight to}} protect Lucis's borders from attacks by Niflheim's Magitek army and <b>Daemons,</b> unnatural monsters tamed for {{military}} use. During one such operation, Nyx Ulric defies his orders to withdraw to rescue his friend Libertus from a Daemon. Regis, whose magic powers the Wall and is growing weaker due to advancing age, accepts Imperial Chancellor Ardyn Izunia's offer of peace. This causes dissension among the Kingsglaive, who feel Regis is abandoning their families. Two {{days before the}} treaty is to be signed, Kingsglaive member Crowe is sent {{on a mission to}} escort Lunafreya to Lucis, but is killed en route. Her death causes Libertus to leave the Kingsglaive and join a group of Lucian rebels. At a party dedicated to the signing of the treaty, attended by both Regis and Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, Lunafreya meets with Nyx before being secretly abducted by Glauca. Nyx discovers this and finds that Niflheim has stationed their army outside Insomnia.|$|E

50|$|Port {{knocking}} {{is totally}} {{dependent on the}} robustness of the port knocking <b>daemon.</b> The failure of the <b>daemon</b> will deny port access to all users and from a usability and security perspective, this is an undesirable single point of failure. Modern port knocking implementations mitigate this issue by providing a process monitoring <b>daemon</b> that will restart a failed or stalled port knocking <b>daemon</b> process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Daemon</b> Engines {{are similar}} in nature to <b>Daemon</b> Weapons; they are special tank-like {{machines}} which are forged {{in the realm of}} the Dark Gods, and controlled by an imprisoned <b>daemon.</b> They frequently carry powerful cannons which make them useful in sieges. The most common type of <b>daemon</b> engine is the Defiler of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, a large spider-like machine mounting the battlecannon typical of Imperial Guard tanks. Another example is the Hellcannon from Warhammer Fantasy, a barely controllable, part <b>daemon,</b> part machine creation, crewed by the Chaos Dwarfs.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two ways}} to use Commons Daemon: by {{implementing}} the <b>daemon</b> interface or by calling a class that provides the required methods for <b>daemon.</b> For example, Tomcat-4.1.x uses the <b>daemon</b> interface and Tomcat-5.0.x provides a class whose methods are called by JSVC directly.|$|R

25|$|Pantalaimon is Lyra's dæmon. Like all <b>dæmons</b> of children, {{he changes}} from one {{creature}} to another constantly. When Lyra reaches puberty he assumes the permanent {{form of a}} pine marten. Pantalaimon and Lyra follow her father, Lord Asriel, when he travels to the newly discovered world of Cittagazze.|$|E
25|$|The party {{eventually}} {{arrives in}} Altissia, where Lunafreya {{has taken up}} sanctuary. Lunafreya awakens the Astral Leviathan so Noctis can obtain her power, only for Leviathan {{to go on a}} rampage when Niflheim attacks. Ardyn reveals his true colors by mortally wounding Lunafreya, disrupting the ritual; however, she succeeds in awakening Noctis’ powers, allowing him to defeat Leviathan. While unconscious, he is visited in a dream by Lunafreya's spirit, who gives him the Ring of the Lucii. Noctis wakes to find Altissia in chaos, and that Ignis was blinded during the battle. The party continues towards Niflheim's capital of Gralea by train, while Ignis' blindness and Noctis’ prolonged mourning of Lunafreya cause friction between Noctis and Gladiolus until Ignis forces a reconciliation. Ardyn tricks Noctis into throwing Prompto from the train, and holds Prompto and the Crystal captive in Gralea's main fortress, revealing that the Crystal's power can destroy the <b>Daemons.</b> Noctis continues to Graleareceiving the Astral Shiva's blessing from Gentiana, who reveals herself to be Shiva's human formwhere the party finds that it has been overrun by Ardyn's <b>Daemons.</b> Noctis’ powers are suppressed, forcing him to don the Ring of the Lucii. After rescuing Prompto, who is revealed to be from Niflheim, the party continues to fight their way through the fortress, encountering Lunafreya's brother Ravus and Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, who have been transformed into <b>Daemons</b> by Ardyn.|$|E
5000|$|Normally, {{a person}} and their <b>dæmon</b> must stay within a few yards of each other; for example, Lyra Belacqua shows {{significant}} discomfort when her <b>dæmon</b> flies {{up to the second}} story window of a tower while she is standing outside the building. Another character expresses surprise when a shaman's <b>dæmon</b> is able to travel over forty feet from him. Such separation from one's <b>dæmon</b> - sometimes called [...] "pulling" [...] - causes extreme pain and distress for both human and <b>dæmon,</b> and, given enough distance, results in death. A permanent separation between human and <b>dæmon</b> kills both and releases a huge burst of energy, which, for instance, is harnessed by Lord Asriel to blast a hole between two overlapping universes at the end of Northern Lights.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{distributed}} <b>daemon</b> model {{introduced by}} Burns in 1987 {{is a natural}} generalization of the central <b>daemon</b> model introduced by Dijkstra in 1974. In this paper, we show that a well-known shortest path algorithm is self-stabilizing under the distributed <b>daemon</b> model. Although this result has been proven only recently, the correctness proof provided here is from {{a different point of}} view and is much more concise. We also show that Bruell et al. ’s center-finding algorithm is actually self-stabilizing under the distributed <b>daemon</b> model. Finally, we compute the worst-case stabilization times of the two algorithms under the distributed <b>daemon</b> model...|$|R

25|$|Atlantis {{had also}} been {{mentioned}} in the Jon Pertwee serial The <b>Dæmons</b> (1971), with the godlike being Azal citing its destruction as a warning of an experiment gone wrong. Some have argued that The Underwater Menace and The Time Monster depict the flooding and collapse, respectively, of different parts of Atlantis, not {{the destruction of the}} whole, so that all three accounts may fit into one coherent narrative. Alternatively, and since the geographical and temporal locations seem to be at odds, the name 'Atlantis' may be taken as a translation convention – via the Time Lord gift that always translates local languages for the Doctor and his companions (and viewers) – referring to different lost prehistoric civilisations. The novel The Quantum Archangel suggests that the <b>Daemons</b> gave the Kronos crystal to the Atlanteans as a test, which they failed.|$|E
25|$|Forced to {{separate}} from the party, Noctis finally reaches the Crystal, only to be slowly pulled into it. Ardyn then appears and reveals himself to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, a former healer and king of Lucis who was chosen by the Crystal two thousand years ago. Ardyn had saved Eos by absorbing the <b>Daemons</b> into himself, only to be demonized by Noctis’ ancestors. Rendered immortal by the Daemons' power and denied ascension by the Astrals, Ardyn has since sought revenge on the royal bloodline and the Crystal, hastening {{the onset of the}} Starscourge while waiting for the True King to appear so he could destroy them both. Within the Crystal, Noctis encounters the Astral Bahamut; he learns that he is the True King of prophecy, who will cleanse the Starscourge and restore light to Eos. Noctis prepares himself to fulfill his destiny, knowing that it will cost him his life; upon his return to the mortal realm, he finds that ten years have passed. He reunites with his friends, who have been keeping the <b>Daemons</b> at bay since Eos’ descent into eternal darkness, before heading to the ruins of Insomnia. After the party defeats the rogue Astral Ifrit, Noctis confronts Ardyn alone and kills him in single combat. Noctis then ascends the throne, and using the power of the Lucii and the Crystal's light sacrifices his life to purge the Starscourge and the <b>Daemons</b> from the world. In the spirit realm, Noctis—with the aid of Lunafreya and the Lucii—destroys Ardyn's spirit.|$|E
25|$|The Hordes of Chaos are Humans {{from the}} Northlands, {{corrupted}} by {{the gods of}} Chaos by their ambition, lust or the other base instincts and emotions of humanity. In addition to human warriors and Marauders they also have access to supernatural creatures such as <b>Daemons</b> and Spawns of Chaos. The 3 playable factions are the cults of the chaos gods Nurgle, Khorne and the pantheon Chaos Undivided.|$|E
5000|$|The GVfs model {{differs from}} e.g. GnomeVFS, which it replaces, in that file systems must be mounted {{before they are}} used. There is a master <b>daemon</b> (...) that handles {{coordinating}} mounts, and then each mount is (typically) in its own <b>daemon</b> process (although mounts can share <b>daemon</b> process).|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to these}} are daemonically possessed {{vehicles}} in Warhammer 40,000, which are normal tanks and other vehicles which are sealed and a <b>daemon</b> is imprisoned within, {{allowing it to}} control the vehicle; this is advantageous because the <b>daemon,</b> unlike a normal crew, cannot be killed or stunned by enemy attacks. The difference between a possessed vehicle and a <b>daemon</b> engine is in the crafting - a possessed vehicle has already been built when the <b>daemon</b> is imprisoned; a <b>daemon</b> engine has the <b>daemon</b> imprisoned {{as part of the}} vehicle's creation. Possession also comes in two forms: a normal <b>daemon</b> possession like that of a Possessed Marine, and a possession that is more akin to a parasite. Where the former receives direct control of the vehicle the latter will become the vehicle. With a Parasitic possession the vehicle becomes a living being, able to regenerate lost armaments or treads just as a living creature regenerates a wound.|$|R

25|$|To travel between worlds, the Old Ones used portals {{to another}} {{dimension}} ("warp gates"), which they {{built at the}} north and south poles of the Warhammer World. Eventually, however, these gates collapsed, allowing raw magical energy and the daemonic forces of Chaos to pour forth into the Warhammer world. At this point, the Old Ones disappeared. Before leaving however, they had established the Lizard men (ruled over by the Slann) as their servants. In addition they had created the races of Elves, Dwarfs, Humans, Ogres and Halflings. Orcs and Goblins were not created by the Old Ones, or part of their plan, and their origin is not made clear in the setting. Beastmen and Skaven were the result of mutation from raw magical energy at this time. Eventually the Chaos <b>Daemons</b> were driven back by Lizardmen and Elves, with the Elves performing a great ritual to drain out the raw magic that was flowing into the world and sustaining the <b>Daemons.</b> Some creatures, such as Dragons and Dragon-Ogres, are stated to have existed prior to the arrival of the Old Ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{story was}} {{repeated}} on BBC One as a condensed omnibus edition over Christmas 1971 (28/12/71 at 4.20pm). The omnibus's opening credits gave the title as Doctor Who and the <b>Dæmons.</b> The closing credits used were {{for those of}} episode 5, necessitating the BBC1 continuity announcer naming {{the cast and crew}} from earlier episodes. The omnibus repeat achieved higher ratings than the original broadcast, with 10.5 million viewers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Dæmons</b> is {{the fifth}} and final serial of the eighth season of the British science fiction {{television}} series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast in five weekly parts from 22 May to 19 June 1971.
