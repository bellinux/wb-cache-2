40|$|The {{concept of}} a Test Article Building Block (TABB) is described. The TABB is a ground test article that is {{representative}} of a future building block {{that can be used}} to construct LEO and GEO deployable space platforms for communications and scientific payloads. This building block contains a main housing within which the entire structure, utilities, and deployment/retraction mechanism are stowed during launch. The <b>end</b> <b>adapter</b> secures the foregoing components to the housing during launch. The main housing and adapter provide the necessary building-block-to-building-block attachments for automatically deployable platforms. Removal from the shuttle cargo bay can be accomplished with the remote manipulator system (RMS) and/or the handling and positioning aid (HAPA). In this concept, all the electrical connections are in place prior to launch with automatic latches for payload attachment provided on either the end adapters or housings. The housings also can contain orbiter docking ports for payload installation and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Deep {{sequencing}} is {{a powerful}} tool for novel small RNA discovery. Illumina small RNA sequencing library preparation requires a pre-adenylated 3 ’ <b>end</b> <b>adapter</b> containing a 5 ’, 5 ’-adenyl pyrophosphoryl moiety. In the absence of ATP, this adapter can be ligated to the 3 ’ hydroxyl group of small RNA, while RNA self-ligation and concatenation are repressed. Pre-adenylated adapters {{are one of the most}} essential and costly components required for library preparation, and few are commercially available. Results We demonstrate that DNA oligo with 5 ’ phosphate and 3 ’ amine groups can be enzymatically adenylated by T 4 RNA ligase 1 to generate customized pre-adenylated adapters. We have constructed and sequenced a small RNA library for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) using the T 4 RNA ligase 1 adenylated adapter. Conclusion We provide an efficient and low-cost method for small RNA sequencing library preparation, which takes two days to complete and costs around $ 20 per library. This protocol has been tested in several plant species for small RNA sequencing including sweet potato, pepper, watermelon, and cowpea, and could be readily applied to any RNA samples. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Connecting {{an older}} device {{to a host}} with a USB-C {{receptacle}} requires a cable or adapter with a USB-A or USB-B plug or receptacle on one end and a USB-C plug on the other <b>end.</b> Legacy <b>adapters</b> with a USB-C receptacle are [...] "not defined or allowed" [...] by the specification because they can create [...] "many invalid and potentially unsafe" [...] cable combinations.|$|R
50|$|Both the {{standard}} and Para models {{come with a}} rear sight, adjustable for windage and elevation, that provides a peep aperture for ranges from 300 to 1000 m in 100 m increments. The hooded front sight is installed in a post on the gas block and is also adjustable for elevation and windage. Early models of the Minimi had the rear sight mounted forward of the feed cover and the front post secured to the barrel, closer to the muzzle <b>end.</b> An <b>adapter</b> {{can also be used}} that allows the use of standard NATO night and day sights.|$|R
50|$|The G&C/A section {{consisted}} of two separate portions, the G&C and the adapter connected by a manufactured splice. At the forward end of the G&C there was a quick access splice for attachment to the warhead section. At the aft <b>end,</b> the <b>adapter</b> was grooved to accept the V-band that spliced the propulsion section to the G&C section. The RV separation system {{consisted of}} a linear shaped charge ring assembly bolted to the G&C section so that separation occurred just forward of the G&C manufactured splice. A protective collar on the outer surface of the adapter, mounted over the linear shaped charge, provided personnel protection during G&C/A handling operations.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, {{the host}} adapter {{would have a}} similar header-style connection. In some cases, though, the host <b>adapter</b> <b>end</b> of the cable would use a {{different}} connector. For example, in the Sun 260 series chassis (used for the Sun 3/260 and Sun 4/260 computers), the connector was the same 3-row 96-pin connector used to attach peripheral cards to the VMEbus backplane.|$|R
40|$|A {{concentration}} cell electrode {{was installed in}} a fritted glass surface and {{was used to measure}} the surface KCl concentration while water was being transpired through the surface into a mixed tank of 0. 1 M KCl. The results from the first Fluorox run made with crude UF/sub 4 / showed that 85. 3 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / was accounted for, with 17. 9 % being collected in cold traps and the remainder being consumed in various side reactions. Installation was completed of apparatus to study the electrolytic removal of nickel on an engineering scale from concentrated HRT fuel solution. An extremely low yield stress of 0. 02 lb/sq ft was measured for a thoria-urania slurry containing 2. 5 wt. % Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / and spherical particles of 1. 7 micron mean diameter. Preliminary data on the rate of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K from sulfate solutions were correlated with a simple spherical diffusion model. Laboratory scale studies to determine the effect of reflux time, HNO/sub 3 / concentration, and air sparge on chloride removal from APPR-type Darex dissolver product showed that an air sparge is definitely beneficial in chloride removal. Preliminary cyclic cleaning tests showed that boiling 25 % caustic solution was adequate for cleaning type F (20 micron) porous metal filter elements fouled in the absence of filter aid with siliceous sludge from Darex solvent extraction feed solutions. Sections of unirradiated stainless steel-clad UO/sub 2 /, sheared into lengths of 1 / 2 in., 1 in., 2 in., and 2 3 / 4 in., were leached free of UO/sub 2 / with 10 M HNO/sub 3 / in 30, 45, 60, and 75 min, respectively. The abrasive blade cost for the removal of inert <b>end</b> <b>adapters</b> from selected reactor assemblies ranges from 12 for the Gas-Cooled Reactor to 19 for Consolidated Edison. A zirconium dissolution was carried to completion at 600 ction prod- C in a NaF-LiF salt mixture containing initially 23 mol per cent ZrF/sub 4 / at an average rate of 1. 3 mg/(cm/sup 2 /) (min) with an HF feed rate of 2 lb/hr. The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity at the center of an 8 -in. diameter cake of Darex waste calcined at about 900 ction prod- C were determined as a function of temperature.

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of the installation, Fossum moved {{to the front of}} the Zarya module and freed a wire stuck in one latch door at a data grapple fixture. The fixture had been installed during STS-134, the previous shuttle mission. The grapple fixture serves as a base for Canadarm2, considerably extending its range of operation on the Russian segment of the ISS. Garan also deployed a materials experiment (MISSE-8) that focuses on optical reflector materials, also installed during STS-134, on the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC-2) FRAM-3 site on the station's starboard truss. Back together again, Fossum and Garan moved on to the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-3) on the Tranquility node. They installed an insulating cover on the <b>end</b> of the <b>adapter,</b> an area exposed to considerable sunshine.|$|R
50|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{was also}} {{equipped with a}} hypergolic Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System, which made it the first manned spacecraft with translation as well as rotation capability. In-orbit attitude control was achieved by firing pairs of eight 25 lbf N thrusters located around the circumference of its adapter module at the extreme aft end. Lateral translation control was provided by four 100 lbf N thrusters around the circumference at the forward end of the adaptor module (close to the spacecraft's center of mass). Two forward-pointing 85 lbf N thrusters at the same location, provided aft translation, and two 100 lbf N thrusters located in the aft <b>end</b> of the <b>adapter</b> module provided forward thrust, {{which could be used}} to change the craft's orbit.|$|R

30|$|Total DNA of an {{overnight}} culture of SJP-SNU was extracted using a DNeasy® Blood & tissue kit (QIAGEN), and PacBio RS II single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing of SJP-SNU was performed (Theragen ETS, Seongnam, Korea). Briefly, 10 μg of yeast genomic DNA was sheared with a Covaris® g-TUBE® device and size-selection for 15 – 50  kb was performed with a BluePippin system (0.75 % DF Marker S 1 high-pass 15 – 20  kb), both done {{according to the}} manufacturer’s protocols. SMRTbell template libraries were subsequently prepared using the commercial Template Preparation Kit from Pacific Biosciences Inc. and involved the sequential steps of DNA <b>end</b> repair, <b>adapter</b> ligation and exonuclease digestion of incompletely ligated products. Next, 0.83 [*]nM of the libraries were later annealed to the sequencing primers followed by binding to 50  nM of P 4 DNA polymerase, provided in the Template Binding Kit from Pacific Biosciences Inc. For enhanced loading efficiency, 15  pM of the bound complexes were immobilized onto Magbeads (Pacific Biosciences Inc.) prior to loading into the sequencing zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs). The duration for the sequence collection was set at 180  min using the stage start option. Reads with a length of less than 50  bp were filtered out upon acquisition of the sequencing data, and the minimum polymerase read quality was set at 0.75. The SMRT sequencing data were assembled de novo using the FALCON and HGAP 3 software pipelines, {{and the results were}} merged and reconciled with GARM metaassembler.|$|R
30|$|Most of the non-weld {{connectors}} are {{supplied by}} offshore oil-gas service companies from America and Europe, such as Oil states industries Inc, Cameron, FMC Technologies, Oceaneering International Inc, Quality Connector LLC and Hydratight. Static metal seal based Connectors include tapping connector and method of using same [5], swivel ring flange, external hydraulic tieback connector [6], subsea tool for tie in of pipeline <b>ends</b> [7] and <b>adapter</b> sleeve for wellhead housing [8]. Rubber sealed connectors include pipeline joint [9], over 2000 morgrip connector and coupling device [10]. The other connectors with metal and rubber seal include griplock end connector, smart flange plus connector, quick flange morgrip pipeline connector and hydraulic smart flange connector. The above typical connectors are reliable to connect subsea pipelines, but their design is too complicated. Too many bolts {{have to be}} pre-tightened and operation tools have {{to be used for}} connection, which result in a long lead time and high cost. Gottfried [11] presented a simple metal sealing connector for the connection of water supply and drainage pipelines with diameter less than 168.3 mm under low or zero pressure on land. This paper presents an improved design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector (SPMC) {{that can be used for}} a bigger diameter and a higher pressure in the complicated subsea environment.|$|R
40|$|Background: Cytosine {{methylation}} {{in plant}} genomes {{is important for}} the regulation of gene transcription and transposon activity. Genome-wide methylomes are studied upon mutation of the DNA methyltransferases, adaptation to environmental stresses or during development. However, from basic biology to breeding programs, {{there is a need to}} monitor multiple samples to determine transgenerational methylation inheritance or differential cytosine methylation. Methylome data obtained by sodium hydrogen sulfite (bisulfite) -conversion and next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide genome- wide information on cytosine methylation. However, a profiling method that detects cytosine methylation state dispersed over the genome would allow high-throughput analysis of multiple plant samples with distinct epigenetic signatures. We use specific restriction endonucleases to enrich for cytosine coverage in a bisulfite and NGS-based profiling method, which was compared to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of the same plant material. Methods: We established an effective methylome profiling method in plants, termed plant-reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (plant-RRBS), using optimized double restriction endonuclease digestion, fragment <b>end</b> repair, <b>adapter</b> ligation, followed by bisulfite conversion, PCR amplification and NGS. We report a performant laboratory protocol and a straightforward bioinformatics data analysis pipeline for plant-RRBS, applicable for any reference-sequenced plant species. Results: As a proof of concept, methylome profiling was performed using an Oryza sativa ssp. indica pure breeding line and a derived epigenetically altered line (epiline). Plant-RRBS detects methylation levels at tens of millions of cytosine positions deduced from bisulfite conversion in multiple samples. To evaluate the method, the coverage of cytosine positions, the intra-line similarity and the differential cytosine methylation levels between the pure breeding line and the epiline were determined. Plant-RRBS reproducibly covers commonly up to one fourth of the cytosine positions in the rice genome when using MspI-DpnII within a group of five biological replicates of a line. The method predominantly detects cytosine methylation in putative promoter regions and not-annotated regions in rice. Conclusions: Plant-RRBS offers high-throughput and broad, genome- dispersed methylation detection by effective read number generation obtained from reproducibly covered genome fractions using optimized endonuclease combinations, facilitating comparative analyses of multi-sample studies for cytosine methylation and transgenerational stability in experimental material and plant breeding populations...|$|R
5000|$|In March 1973 {{a team of}} Matra {{engineers}} led by Georges Pinardaud {{completed the}} initial design for project M560, {{which was to be}} a more powerful Bagheera. A key part of the project was the creation of a unique [...] "U engine" [...] out of two existing Simca straight-4 engines. The blocks came from two different Simca applications and rotated in opposite directions but shared the same 1294 cc displacement. One block was from the 1100Ti and was adapted to transverse mounting while the other was from the Simca 1000 Rallye II in which it had been mounted longitudinally. The two blocks were joined at an 82° angle using a common cast-aluminum sump that also carried a common oil supply for the engine. At the non-drive end another aluminum casting assured the alignment of the blocks while at the drive <b>end</b> a steel <b>adapter</b> fit the <b>ends</b> of both crankshafts. A sprocket and Morse chain from each crankshaft were connected to a 0.9 in shaft running {{down the middle of the}} sump that transmitted power from the left-hand crank to the right. Each block retained its own crankshaft, distributor, and water pump. The clutch and bell-housing of the engine from the Rallye II engine provided the transaxle mounting while a flywheel was only mounted to the 1100Ti crankshaft. The resulting [...] 8-cylinder assembly was fitted with four Weber 36 DCNF carburetors and, with a 9.8:1 compression ratio, produced [...] @ 6200 rpm and 216 Nm @ 4000 rpm.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of transcriptome, which {{was over the}} past decade based mostly on microarray technologies, is now being superseded by so-called next generation sequencing (NGS) systems that changed the way to explore entire transcriptome. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), one application of NGS, is a powerful tool, providing information not only about the expression level of genes but also further about the structure of transcripts as it enables to unequivocally identify splicing events, RNA editing products, and mutations in expressed coding sequences within a single experiment. Herein, we describe step by step the deoxy-UTP (dUTP) strand-marking protocol [Parkhomchuk, D., Borodina, T., Amstislavskiy, V., Banaru, M., Hallen, L., Krobitsch, S., Lehrach, H., Soldatov, A. (2009). Transcriptome analysis by strand-specific sequencing of complementary DNA. Nucleic Acids Res. 37 (18), e 123], which has been recently reviewed as the leading protocol for strand-specific RNA-Seq library preparation [Levin, J. Z., Yassour, M., Adiconis, X., Nusbaum, C., Thompson, D. A., Friedman, N., Gnirke, A., Regev, A. (2009). Comprehensive comparative {{analysis of}} strand-specific RNA sequencing methods. Nat. Methods 7 (9), 709 - 715]. The procedure starts with the isolation of the polyA fraction (mRNA) within a pool of total RNA, followed by its fragmentation. Then double-stranded (ds) cDNA synthesis is performed with the incorporation of dUTP in the second strand. The ds cDNA fragments are further processed following a standard sequencing library preparation scheme tailored for the Illumina sequencing platform: <b>end</b> polishing, A-tailing, <b>adapter</b> ligation, and size selection. Prior to final amplification, the dUTP-marked strand is selectively degraded by Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase (UDG). The remaining strand is amplified to generate a cDNA library suitable for sequencing...|$|R
40|$|The Beothuk Indians were an extinct {{group of}} Amerinds who {{were among the}} {{earliest}} founders of Newfoundland. In literature, the Beothuk were described as perhaps being phenotypically more similar to Europeans than Asians (Gatschet 1890, Lloyd 1875, 1876 a, Marshall 1996). In this research, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis was performed on a Beothuk individual {{in order to determine}} his haplotype and, perhaps, shed light on the origins of the Beothuk. For this analysis, a tooth of Nonosabasut, a Beothuk chief who did in 1819 was loaned from the Royal Museum of Scotland. Ancient DNA was extracted from 172 mg of dentin from the tooth. The DNA was cut with two blunt-end restriction enzymes, RsaI and HaeIII. Double-stranded DNA adapters were ligated to the blunt <b>ends.</b> A single <b>adapter</b> was used to amplify the resulting fragments using PCR. In this manner, two libraries of DNA were created that could be readily reamplified using a small amount of the PCR product. mtDNA type was determined by amplifying specific regions and performing Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis and sequencing. It was determined that the Beothuk individual had a 9 -bp deletion at nucleotide position (np) 8272, an AluI restriction site at np 5176, an heteroplasmy for a HincII restriction site at np 13, 529, indicating that the Beothuk individual falls into the Native American Haplogroup B. Haplogroup B is not present in modern Siberian populations, whereas the remaining Native American mtDNA haplogroups are. It has been hypothesized that Haplogroup B arrived in the Americas at a different time than haplogroups A, C, D, and X, about 16, 000 - 13, 000 YBP (Years Before Present) (Strikovskaya et al. 1998). Haplogroup B can be found in some modern Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean, Evenk, and other Asian populations. Sequencing of the D-Loop region revealed a G to A transition at np 16303. To our knowledge, this transition was never previously reported in a Native American. This transition has been reported in Tibetans, Koreans, Hans, and Japanese, all considered to be southeast Asian Causacoids (Torroni et al. 1993 b, 1994 b). This transition, also frequently described in the Caucasian Haplogroup H, is especially prevalent in Spain and the Basque. It is described as a root haplotype of Haplogroup H whose expansion was estimated to be between 12, 300 - 13, 200 YBP (Torroni et al. 1998). This time estimate coincides with the expansion of Haplogroup B. One possible explanation for this transition may be some admixture of the Beothuk was a Caucasian population.
