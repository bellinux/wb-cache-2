They were examined in the electron microscope, mainly as negatively or positively stained preparations, and in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The polyribosomes consist of up to twelve or more ribosomes linked by a <b>fine</b> <b>strand,</b> 10 to 15 A in diameter, probably of RNA. The ribosomes are approximately spherical with diameters of 250 to 300 A, and are estimated to be about 50 per cent porous. Possibly because of their high protein content, whole ribosomes show no cleavage furrows. Ribosomes were dissociated in phosphate buffer and the subunits separated on sucrose density gradients containing 10 per cent formalin. Three classes of subunit were obtained with sedimentation coefficients of 71 S, 50 S, and 31 S respectively. The smallest, 31 S subunit is about 250 A long by 100 A wide. The largest subunits appear to be clusters of smaller particles. It is estimated from their linear dimensions in electron micrographs that the whole 83 S ribosome could contain up to six 31 S subunits, or their equivalent.

The natural evolution of this design to the CERN 70 mm aperture quadrupole results in the following: a) a reduction in operational temperature (4. 8 K- 1. 9 K), b) improvement of Jc(10 T, 2. 0 K) > 2 kA/mm 2 and c) a higher aspect ratio cable> 13 / 1 and d) <b>finer</b> <b>strand</b> (0. 48 mm diameter).

The lamina densa is secured to the stroma through a complex of type VII collagen containing anchoring fibrils and anchoring plaques. We have identified what we believe is a novel antigen unique to this tissue region.

When liposomes were aggregated by calpactin, quick-freeze, deep-etching revealed <b>fine</b> thin <b>strands</b> (6. 5 +/- 1. 9 [SD] nm long) cross-linking opposing membranes in addition to the globules on the surface of liposomes.

In cultured chromaffin cells, similar cross-linking short strands (6 - 10 nm) were found between chromaffin vesicles and the plasma membrane after stimulation with acetylcholine. Plasma membranes also revealed numerous globular structures approximately 10 nm in diameter on their cytoplasmic surface. Immunoelectron microscopy on frozen ultrathin sections showed that calpactin I was closely associated with the inner face of the plasma membranes and was especially conspicuous between plasma membranes and adjacent vesicles in chromaffin cells.

40|$|The heat-induced {{structure}} formation by the globular protein, b- lactoglobulin, {{has been}} studied {{over a wide range}} of solution conditions and heating regimes. The results are split into two main categories corresponding to the regimes in which b -lactoglobulin forms <b>fine</b> <b>stranded</b> and particulate gels. In the <b>fine</b> <b>stranded</b> regime (non-isoelectric pH), b- lactoglobulin was found to form highly ordered structures which bound the amyloid specific dyes Congo red and Thioflavin T. In the case of the pH 2. 5 and no added NaCl, the X-ray fibre diffraction pattern was found to correspond well to that of amyloid. Higher order structures in the form of spherulites composed of assemblies of amyloid fibrils were also investigated. The kinetics of fibril formation in b -lactoglobulin was investigated and modelled using a theory based on a slow forwards reaction, generating an active species followed by a critical stable nucleus size dependent nucleation and growth. In the particulate regime (isoelectric pH), the gel structures were investigated using Environmental SEM, confocal microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. The gels were found to comprise densely packed particles with fractal surfaces. The effects of ionic strength, pH, protein concentration and heating regime {{on the size of the}} particles were investigated. Increasing heating rate and holding temperature were found to decrease the particle size, with ionic strength increasing particle size. A peak in particle size was found as a function of pH as the isoelectric point was approached. These results were described in terms of two models. The first model, based on a temperature imposed equilibrium size, accounts well for the decrease in particle size with holding temperature. The second model based on a nucleation rate which is dependent on the temperature via the unfolding transition, was more successful at describing the heating rate dependence.

Detailed treatments of the photospheric radiative transfer and the equation of states allow us to model realistic thermal convection near the solar surface, which excites various MHD waves and produces chromospheric jets in the simulation. A tall chromospheric jet with a maximum height of 10 [...] 11 Mm and lifetime of 8 [...] 10 min is formed above a strong magnetic field concentration. The magnetic field lines are strongly entangled in the chromosphere, which helps the chromospheric jet {{to be driven by}} the Lorentz force.
