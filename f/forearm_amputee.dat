40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel method of pattern {{classification}} for user motions to create input signals for human-machine interfaces from electromyograms (EMGs) based on muscle synergy theory. The method can be adopted to represent non-trained combined motions (e. g., wrist flexion during hand grasping) using a recurrent neural network by combining syn-ergy patterns of EMG signals preprocessed by the network. This approach allows combined motions (i. e., unlearned motions) {{to be classified}} through learning of individual motions (such as hand grasping and wrist flexion) only, meaning {{that the number of}} motions can be increased without increasing the number of learning samples or the learning time needed to control devices such as prosthetic hands. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through motion classification tests and prosthetic hand control experiments with six subjects (including a <b>forearm</b> <b>amputee).</b> The results showed that 18 motions (12 combined and 6 single) could be classified sufficiently with learning for just 6 single motions (average rate: 89. 2 ± 6. 33 %), and the amputee was able to control a prosthetic hand using single and combined motions at will.

40|$|Background:   It {{has become}} more {{ordinary}} to use computer in society today. This can affectthe old {{as well as the}} disabled people, which can have problems {{with the use of the}} computer. There are not many studies that have been conducted about computer aid for arm amputees. Aim:   The goal was to get a better view of unilateral <b>forearms</b> <b>amputee’s</b> situation concerningcomputer use, to find out if there is a need for computer aid for unilateral <b>forearms</b> <b>amputees.</b> There are few studies about how the situation for use of the computer is for unilateral <b>forearms</b> <b>amputees</b> and what needs they have. Method:   Three right unilateral <b>forearms</b> <b>amputees</b> were interviewed about how theirsituation is when using the computer. Interviews were transcribed, condensed and coded. Categorizes were created of the codes and presented as findings Findings:   The amputees in the study had no need of computer aid. They used their left handand sometimes the prosthesis to help with writing. There was no problem except for writing speed. Own design of a computer aid:   The design off the computer aid was an endoskeletetart. Ithas a cable, out to two fingers that creates a flexions moment, so the finger can do a muse click. One of the fingers will be able to get in a position to use for typing. Discussion:   The group of respondents included in this study was not optimal. The youngergenerations have maybe a greater need of computer aid and inclusion of younger respondents may have given a different result. The need of computer aid maybe is not that great because it already works to work at the computer. Conclusion:   Unilateral <b>forearms</b> <b>amputees</b> use their remaining limb to operate the computer...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{test whether}} the phantom limb {{awareness}} could be altered by observing mirror reflection-induced visual feedback (MVF) in unilateral <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees.</b> Methods: Ten unilateral <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees</b> {{were asked to}} perform bilateral (intact and phantom) synchronous wrist motions with and without MVF. During wrist motion, electromyographic activities in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and flexor carpi radialis muscles (FCR) were recorded with bipolar electrodes. Degree of wrist range of motion (ROM) was also recorded by electrogoniometry attached to the wrist joint of intact side. Subjects were asked to answer the degree of attainment of phantom limb motion using a visual analog scale (VAS: ranging from 0 (hard) to 10 (easy)). Results: VAS and ROM were significantly increased by utilizing MVF, {{and the extent of}} an enhancement of the VAS and wrist ROM was positively correlated (r = 0. 72, p, 0. 05). Although FCR EMG activity also showed significant enhancement by MVF, this was not correlated with the changes of VAS and ROM. Interestingly, while we found negative correlation between EDL EMG activity and wrist ROM, MVF generally affected to be increasing both EDL EMG and ROM. Conclusions: Although there was larger extent of variability in the effect of MVF on phantom limb awareness, MVF has a potential to enhance phantom limb awareness, in case those who has a difficulty for the phantom limb motion. The present result suggests that the motor command to the missing limb can be re-activated by an appropriate therapeutic strateg...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Lack {{of sensory}} {{feedback}} is a drawback in today’s hand prostheses. We present here a non-invasive simple sensory feedback system, which provides the user of a pros-thetic hand with sensory {{feedback on the}} arm stump. It is mediated by air in a closed loop system connecting silicone pads on the prosthetic hand with pads on the amputation stump. The silicone pads in a “tactile display ” on the ampu-tation stump expand when their corresponding sensor-bulb in the prosthesis is touched, evoking an experience of “real touch”. Methods: Twelve trans-radial amputees and 20 healthy non-amputees participated in the study. We investigated {{the capacity of the}} system to mediate detection of touch, dis-crimination between different levels of pressure and, on the amputees also, the ability to locate touch. Results: The results showed a median touch threshold of 80 and 60 g in amputees and non-amputees, respectively, and 90 % and 80 % correct answers, respectively, in discrimi-nation between 2 levels of pressure. The amputees located touch (3 sites) correctly in 96 % of trials. Conclusion: This simple sensory feedback system has the potential to restore sensory feedback in hand amputees and thus it could be a useful tool to enhance prosthesis use.

40|$|Little {{has been}} {{published}} about the Krukenberg operation, which has been regarded as primarily indicated for the blind patient with bilateral hand amputations. Of the 35 Krukenberg cineplasty operations I have performed in the last 36 years, only two have been on blind patients. The operation provides <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees</b> with pincers which allow them to perform tasks without a prosthesis, but does not preclude {{the use of any}} type of aid. The author’s operative procedure is described and the results illustrate its practical application for most patients. Over 70 years have elapsed since Hermann von Kruken-berg first described the operation that is named after him (Krukenberg 19 1 7). World-wide reports praise the excel-lent results obtained (Kallio 1948; Ritsil#{ 228 }and Kivilaakso 1976; Nathan and Trung 1977; Powell 1978). These reports deal with the reasons for performing the opera-tion, and the contra-indications. Some authors have recommended the operation in children as young as two years of age (Harrison and Mayou 1977; Swanson and Swanson 1980).

40|$|<b>Forearm</b> <b>amputees</b> often {{experience}} non-painful sensations {{in their}} phantom when the amputation stump is touched. Cutaneous stimulation of specific stump areas {{may be perceived}} as stimulation of specific phantom fingers (stump hand map). The neuronal basis of referred phantom limb sensations is unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate a somatotopic map of the phantom fingers in the hand region of the primary somatosensory cortex after tactile stump stimulation. The location and extent of phantom finger activation in the primary somatosensory cortex corresponded well to the location of normal fingers in a reference population. Stimulation of the stump hand map resulted in an increased bilateral activation of the primary somatosensory cortex compared with stimulation of forearm regions outside the stump hand map. Increased activation was also seen in contralateral posterior parietal cortex and premotor cortex. Ipsilateral primary somatosensory cortex activation might represent a compensatory mechanism and activation of the non-primary fronto-parietal areas might correspond to awareness of the phantom limb, which is enhanced when experiencing the referred sensations. It is concluded that phantom sensation elicited by stimulation of stump hand map areas is associated with activation of finger-specific somatotopical representations in the primary somatosensory cortex. This suggests that the primary somatosensory cortex could be a neural substrate of non-painful phantom sensations. The stump hand map phenomenon might be useful in the development of prosthetic hand devices...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfter limb amputation, {{patients}} often {{wake up with}} a vivid {{perception of}} the presence of the missing limb, called "phantom limb". Phantom limbs have mostly been studied with respect to pain sensation. But patients can experience many other phantom sensations, including voluntary movements. The goal {{of the present study was}} to quantify phantom movement kinematics and relate these to intact limb kinematics and to the time elapsed since amputation. Six upper arm and two <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees</b> with various delays since amputation (6 months to 32 years) performed phantom finger, hand and wrist movements at self-chosen comfortable velocities. The kinematics of the phantom movements was indirectly obtained via the intact limb that synchronously mimicked the phantom limb movements, using a Cyberglove® for measuring finger movements and an inertial measurement unit for wrist movements. Results show that the execution of phantom movements is perceived as "natural" but effortful. The types of phantom movements that can be performed are variable between the patients but they could all perform thumb flexion/extension and global hand opening/closure. Finger extension movements appeared to be 24 % faster than finger flexion movements. Neither the number of types of phantom movements that can be executed nor the kinematic characteristics were related to the elapsed time since amputation, highlighting the persistence of post-amputation neural adaptation. We hypothesize that the perceived slowness of phantom movements is related to altered proprioceptive feedback that cannot be recalibrated by lack of visual feedback during phantom movement execution...|$|R
40|$|A phantom limb is the {{sensation}} that an amputated limb is {{still attached to}} the body and is moving together with other body parts. Phantom limb phenomenon is often described {{on the basis of}} the patient's subjective sense, for example as represented using a visual analog scale (VAS). The aim of this study was to propose a novel quantification method for behavioral aspect of phantom limb by psychophysics. Twelve unilateral <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees</b> were asked to perform phantom wrist motion with various motion frequencies (60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240 % of preferred speed). The attainment of phantom limb motion in each session was rated by the VAS ranging from 0 (hard) to 10 (easy). The relationship between the VAS and motion frequency was mathematically fitted by quadric function, and the value of shift and the degree of steepness were obtained as evaluation variables for the phantom limb movement. In order to test whether the proposed method can reasonably quantify the characteristics of phantom limb motion, we compared the variables among three different phantom limb movement conditions: (1) unilateral (phantom only), (2) bimanual, and (3) bimanual wrist movement with mirror reflection-induced visual feedback (MVF). While VAS rating showed a larger extent of inter- and intra-subject variability, the relationship of the VAS in response to motion frequency could be fitted by quadric curve, and the obtained parameters based on quadric function well characterize task-dependent changes in phantom limb movement. The present results suggest the potential usefulness of psychophysical evaluation as a validate assessment tool of phantom limb condition...|$|R

Method: A tactile display applied to the forearm skin was used to transfer tactile input to the forearm from various locations on a hand displayed on a computer screen. Discernment of location, levels of pressure and {{a combination of the}} two in simulated functional grips was tested to quantify the participants' ability to accurately perceive the tactile stimulations presented. Ten participants (5 <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees</b> and 5 able-bodied volunteers) unfamiliar with the equipment participated in the three-stage experiments comprising a learning session with vision, a reinforced learning session without vision and a validation session without vision. Results: The location discernment accuracy was high in both groups (75. 2 % and 89. 6 % respectively). The capacity to differentiate between three different levels of pressure was also high (91. 7 % and 98. 1 % respectively in the two groups). Recognition of simulated grip was slightly more difficult with the groups scoring 58. 7 % and 68. 0 % respectively for accuracy in the validation session. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that it is possible, following a brief training period, to transfer tactile input from an artificial hand to the forearm skin. The level of accuracy was lower for the more complex task, simulated grip recognition, possibly because this represents a more complex task requiring higher order brain functions. These results could form the basis for developing sensory feedback in hand prostheses. [Box: see text]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Intuitive {{prosthesis}} {{control is}} one of the most important challenges in order to reduce the user effort in learning how to use an artificial hand. This work presents the development of a novel method for pattern recognition of sEMG signals able to discriminate, in a very accurate way, dexterous hand and fingers movements using a reduced number of electrodes, which implies more confidence and usability for amputees. Methods The system was evaluated for ten <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees</b> and the results were compared with the performance of able-bodied subjects. Multiple sEMG features based on fractal analysis (detrended fluctuation analysis and Higuchi’s fractal dimension) combined with traditional magnitude-based features were analyzed. Genetic algorithms and sequential forward selection were used to select the best set of features. Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were analyzed to classify individual finger flexion, hand gestures and different grasps using four electrodes, performing contractions in a natural way to accomplish these tasks. Statistical significance was computed for all the methods using different set of features, for both groups of subjects (able-bodied and amputees). Results The results showed average accuracy up to 99. 2 % for able-bodied subjects and 98. 94 % for amputees using SVM, followed very closely by KNN. However, KNN also produces a good performance, as it has a lower computational complexity, which implies an advantage for real-time applications. Conclusion The results show that the method proposed is promising for accurately controlling dexterous prosthetic hands, providing more functionality and better acceptance for amputees...|$|R
40|$|Masashi Sekine, 1, 2 Kahori Kita, 1 Wenwei Yu 1 1 Center for Frontier Medical Engineering, 2 Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan Abstract: Unlike <b>forearm</b> <b>amputees,</b> {{transhumeral}} amputees have residual stumps {{that are}} too small to provide a sufficient range of operation for their prosthetic parts to perform usual activities of daily living. Furthermore, it is difficult for small residual stumps to provide sufficient impact absorption for safe manipulation in daily living, as intact arms do. Therefore, substitution of upper limb function in transhumeral amputees requires a sufficient range of motion and sufficient viscoelasticity for shoulder prostheses under critical weight and dimension constraints. We propose the use of two different types of actuators, ie, pneumatic elastic actuators (PEAs) and servo motors. PEAs offer high power-to-weight performance and have intrinsic viscoelasticity in comparison with motors or standard industrial pneumatic cylinder actuators. However, the usefulness of PEAs in large working spaces is limited because of their short strokes. Servo motors, in contrast, can be used to achieve large ranges of motion. In this study, the relationship between the force and stroke of PEAs was investigated. The impact absorption of both types of actuators was measured using a single degree-of-freedom prototype to evaluate actuator compliance for safety purposes. Based on the fundamental properties of the actuators identified, a four degree-of-freedom robotic arm is proposed for prosthetic use. The configuration of the actuators and functional parts was designed to achieve a specified range of motion and torque calculated from the results of a simulation of typical movements performed in usual activities of daily living. Our experimental results showed that the requirements for the shoulder prostheses could be satisfied.

A system aiming at relocation of sensory input from a prosthetic hand equipped with force sensors to the <b>forearm</b> skin of <b>amputees,</b> a tactile display, has been developed and constructed. The system consists of five piezoresistive force sensors or, alternatively, a prosthetic hand equipped with force sensors, five digital servomotors with a lever and a circular plastic disk pushing on the skin, control electronics based on an MSP 430 microcontroller and a test application implemented in LabVIEW running on a PC.

The system will provide continuous force feedback from sensors in the fingertips of each prosthetic finger and will likely improve the users' controllability and perception of the prosthetic hand. Here we report on tests made on "a five site" localization discrimination task and three pressure level discrimination tasks on the forearm of five healthy participants (non-amputees) using the LabView application to generate the stimulations.

40|$|International audienceDecoding {{finger and}} hand {{movements}} from sEMG electrodes {{placed on the}} <b>forearm</b> of transradial <b>amputees</b> has been commonly studied by many research groups. A few {{recent studies have shown}} an interesting phenomenon: simple correlations between distal phantom finger, hand and wrist voluntary movements and muscle activity in the residual upper arm in transhumeral amputees, i. e., of muscle groups that, prior to amputation, had no physical effect on the concerned hand and wrist joints. In this study, we are going further into the exploration of this phenomenon by setting up an evaluation study of phantom finger, hand, wrist and elbow (if present) movement classification based on the analysis of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals measured by multiple electrodes placed on the residual upper arm of five transhumeral amputees with a controllable phantom limb who did not undergo any reinnervation surgery. We showed that with a state-of-the-art classification architecture, it is possible to correctly classify phantom limb activity (up to 14 movements) with a rather important average success (over 80 % if considering basic sets of six hand, wrist and elbow movements) and to use this pattern recognition output to give online control of a device (here a graphical interface) to these transhumeral amputees. Beyond changing the way the phantom limb condition is apprehended by both patients and clinicians, such results could pave the road towards a new control approach for transhumeral amputated patients with a voluntary controllable phantom limb. This could ease and extend their control abilities of functional upper limb prosthetics with multiple active joints without undergoing muscular reinnervation surgery...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{invention}} of the computer mouse interface there have been no major changes in its design. The way we interact with computers through keyboards and mice are still the same as they first were. Recent new technologies try to replace or emulate the mouse and each have their own disadvantages. Some require the use of surfaces, cameras, sensor bars, or tethering. Other technologies are gesture based, require training, and are not intuitive. Not only is there the need for a mouse interface that is intuitive and convenient, but advancements in the field of human computer interfacing, especially using electromyogram (EMG) sensors, further open doors. The objective of this project is to design and create a wearable computer mouse interface, independent of cameras, sensor bars, surfaces, or tethering, that is intuitive, fast, accurate and convenient. This is accomplished by combining the output of both EMG sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to control the cursor and clicking functions of a mouse. The goal is to be intuitive and accurate in order to overcome the shortcomings in existing technologies. ^ Many different muscles were examined as potential candidates for the EMG sensors. The output of each sensor was observed and several different sensor setups were chosen for focus. For each setup, at least one classifier configuration was designed in the attempt to obtain the highest testing accuracy. The angular velocity measurements of the z and y axis in the IMU were chosen to physically control the mouse cursor. Several different techniques were designed based on the different sensor setups and classifier configurations to obtain the highest overall system accuracy and fewest false positives. ^ Training data was collected in MatLab for processing. Time domain features were extracted and provided as input to a linear discriminant classifier. The implementation of the designs were programed in C++ for fast and efficient real-time performance. The setup and configuration with the highest training accuracy, highest testing accuracy, lowest false positive rate, and best overall IMU integration, was the setup with EMG sensors on the muscles: Extensor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Carpi Radialis, and Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (Near Wrist). One classifier took the input of all five channels for classification into a total of seven classes or actions: Rest, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left Click, and Right Click. This design took the least time to complete the accuracy program designed to evaluate the different configurations. This design also saw the lowest false positives. ^ Compared to a standard mouse or track pad, the best design still fell far short in performance. However, the common user has been using a standard mouse or track pad their whole life, and the need for time to practice with the device is expected. With practice, the design has the potential to match or come close to the accuracy of existing mice. With further automation of the training data collection and classifier training, the device would require little configuration to start using. Further development towards a commercial product would minimize the equipment required, the sensor setup time, and make the device no less convenient than a standard mouse. ^ One of the design goals at the forefront of this project, is the application and usability by hand amputees. Muscle locations are located in the forearm, and the IMU device located {{on the back of the}} wrist or <b>forearm,</b> allows hand <b>amputees</b> and those with hand disabilities to operate the device. ...|$|R
