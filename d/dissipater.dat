40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems Egypt is facing nowadays is saving and controlling the limited available quantity of water and its quality for irrigation and other purposes. Such goals may be achieved through different types of diversion head structures across the river and in the entrance of other carrying canals. The construction of diversion head structures, which usually causes many technical problems, should have the objective of solving and overcoming to protect the structure from failure. The main problem occurs downstream. Such structures have the harmful effect of converting the potential energy gained in the upstream side to a kinetic energy in the downstream side. This energy must be dissipated shortly and safely as near as possible to the head structure to avoid its destructive effect. The hydraulic jump is the most effective tool for the dissipation of water energy, accelerating the forming of the hydraulic jump downstream such structures became essential for achieving our main goal. Using energy <b>dissipaters</b> on the soled apron in the downstream side of the structures was the main technique for accelerating the hydraulic jump formation and dissipating great amount of the residual harmful kinetic energy occurring downstream head structures. So early, many researchers investigated different types, shapes, and arrangements of such <b>dissipaters</b> to evaluate its efficiency in dissipating the water energy and accelerating the forming of the hydraulic jump. In fact, in our present study we will try to investigate some other shapes of energy <b>dissipaters,</b> which have not been studied enough, by evaluating its positive technical impact on: (i) percentage value of dissipating kinetic water energy; (ii) percentage value of increasing the dissolved oxygen (DO) content in the irrigation water, and improving its quality. The study is proposed to be held in the irrigation and hydraulic laboratory of the Civil department, Faculty of Engineering, Assiut University, using a movable bed tilting channel 20 m long, 30 cm wide, and 50 cm high, using fourteen types of curved <b>dissipaters</b> with different arrangements as shown in Table 2. It is worth mentioning that, in this first part of our paper, we will introduce a comparative analysis for the efficiency of different types of energy <b>dissipaters</b> available in the literature review. The most effective types of the previously studied <b>dissipaters</b> will be put in a comparison with our new <b>dissipaters</b> from the two above mentioned points of view, and the results will be presented {{in the second part of}} this paper later...|$|R

40|$|A near {{full-scale}} 3 D jointed precast {{prestressed concrete}} beam to column connection designed and constructed {{in accordance with}} an emerging Damage Avoidance Design (DAD) philosophy is tested under displacement controlled quasi-static reverse cyclic loading. The performance of the subassembly is assessed under unidirectional loading along both orthogonal directions as well as under concurrent bi-directional loading. The specimen is shown to perform well up to 4 % column drift with only some minor flexural cracking in the precast beams, while the precast column remains uncracked and damage-free. This superior performance is attributed to steel armoring of the beam-ends to mitigate the potential for concrete crushing. Under bi-directional loading a tapered shear-key layout is used to effectively protect the beams against adverse torsional movements. A three-phase force-displacement relationship is proposed which gives due consideration to: the prerocking flexural deformation of the beam; the rigid body kinematics during the rocking phase; and the yielding of the external <b>dissipaters</b> and post-tensioning tendons.

Investigations were conducted to understand the hydraulics on the stepped face of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) dams and overlays for embankment dams. Also a number of embankments were designed with concrete overtopping protection shaped in a stepped fashion. During large overflows on stepped chutes, there is no skin friction between mainstream and steps, and flow resistance is basically form drag. Significant energy losses occur along the stepped chute so that the energy dissipation structure, e. g. the stilling basin, becomes smaller and more economic. In addition, in design conditions when discharge, slope of the normal ground and the height of spillway are available, {{there are so many}} combinations of width and the number of steps, which leads to different head losses. In each feasible case the remained head should be dissipate by the energy <b>dissipaters</b> in down stream, which are much cost consuming.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} part of {{an extensive}} experimental programme in progress at the University of Canterbury to develop Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) structural systems and connections for multistorey timber buildings in earthquake-prone areas. The higher mechanical properties of LVL, when compared to sawn timber, {{in addition to its}} low mass, flexibility of design and rapidity of construction, create the potential for increased use of LVL in multi-storey buildings. The development of these innovative ductile connections in LVL, proposed here for frame systems, have been based on the successful implementation of jointed ductile connections for precast concrete systems, started in the early 1990 s with the PRESSS Program at the University of California, San Diego, further developed in Italy and currently under further refinement at the University of Canterbury.

A post-tensioned precast bridge pier with external replaceable mild-steel <b>dissipaters</b> is tested under biaxial loading. The {{performance of the}} post-tensioned bridge pier is compared with a conventionally reinforced monolithic bridge pier. The experimental biaxial response is then compared with previous uniaxial experimental testing of identical bridge piers to understand the influence of biaxial loading, specifically concerning post-tensioned rocking sections. A 3 -dimensional moment–curvature and moment–rotation analysis program is created to generate the monotonic section {{response of}} a conventional and post-tensioned bridge pier. After comparing {{the accuracy of the}} section analysis program to the experimental testing of the monolithic pier, the program is validated against the experimental testing of the post-tensioned bridge pier.

The <b>dissipater</b> is made of a milled-down mild steel bar that is confined by a steel tube filled with either grout or epoxy. The use of a reduced area concentrates yielding and plastic straining over a defined length while the tube prevents buckling. The device has been widely adopted in posttensioned rocking systems, and extensive experimental research was carried out on wall and beam-column subassemblies using this external <b>dissipater.</b> As part of those experimental programs, some component testing was carried out; nevertheless, a more comprehensive study was necessary to cover {{a wider range of}} geometric and mechanical parameters. The main objective of this research was to calibrate and suggest design parameters to support the design of the dissipation device. The paper shows a comprehensive experimental program under quasi-static cyclic loading carried out with varying geometrical parameters. This work forms the basis for the development of more refined analytical and numerical models to simulate the behavior of the device. In particular, the onset of the <b>dissipater</b> interaction with the confining tube and its buckling mechanism were targeted. Further numerical simulations made use of a fiber element–based model that was capable of capturing the full range of deformation mechanisms highlighted in the experimental program. Using this model, an extensive parametric analysis was carried out to determine significant design parameters, such as the maximum force in the <b>dissipater</b> and the buckling onset strain.

It could be concluded that the two coefficients were mainly dominated by the contraction ratio of the plug. The lower contraction ratio of the plug is, the larger are the two coefficients.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that following a major earthquake a substantial percentage of economic loss results from downtime of essential lifelines in and out of major urban centres. This has thus led to an improvement of both performance-based seismic design philosophies and to the development of cost-effective seismic structural systems capable of guaranteeing a high level of protection, low structural damage and reduced downtime after a design-level seismic event. An example of such technology is the development of unbonded post-tensioned techniques in combination with rocking-dissipating connections. In this contribution, further advances in the development of high-performance seismic-resistant bridge piers are achieved through the experimental validation of unbonded post-tensioned bridge piers with external, fully replaceable, mild steel hysteretic <b>dissipaters.</b> The experimental response of three 1 : 3 scale unbonded, post-tensioned cantilever bridge piers, subjected to quasi-static and pseudo-dynamic loading protocols, are presented and compared with an equivalently reinforced monolithic benchmark. Minimal physical damage is observed for the post-tensioned systems, which exhibit very stable energy dissipation and re-centring properties. Furthermore, the external <b>dissipaters</b> can be easily replaced if severely damaged under a major (higher than expected) earthquake event. Thus, negligible residual deformations, limited repair costs and downtime can be achieved for critical lifeline components. Satisfactory analytical-experimental comparisons are also presented as a further confirmation of the reliability of the design procedure and of the modelling techniques.

40|$|In {{the last}} two years the region around Christchurch was {{subjected}} to several seismic events and aftershocks that damaged buildings and infrastructures. Among them there were also historically relevant heritage structures such as the Triumphal Arch, which stands on the Bridge of Remembrance in the Christchurch CBD. The structure, built in 1924, consists of a central major arch and two lateral minor arches made of lightly reinforced concrete and architectural stone. Although the Triumphal Arch did not suffer damage after 4 th September 2010 event, it required strengthening works after the 22 February 2011 earthquake. In this paper, the authors present different solutions to assess the seismic performance of for Triumphal Arch which incorporates rocking concepts. Three retrofit designs are herein shown: a pure-rocking mechanism of the arches’ columns designed by SCIRT and two dissipative rocking concepts developed by the authors. The dissipative rocking solutions are based on the hybrid PRESSS technology and one aims to create a sort of frame system while the second one a coupling rocking wall system. The former uses axial external elasto-plastic <b>dissipaters</b> while the latter steel U-shaped flexural plates. Numerical lumped plasticity models are developed and, by using RUAUMOKO 3 D, time-history analyses are carried out as validation of the three design concepts. The three solutions are subjected to a set of ground motions which includes the Christchurch sequence.
