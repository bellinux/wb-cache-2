50|$|Cetraxate (INN) is an oral {{gastrointestinal}} medication {{which has}} a cytoprotective effect. Double-blind clinical trials in patients with gastric ulcer compared the effects of cetraxate {{with those of the}} drug <b>gefarnate,</b> a common standard drug treatment for gastric ulcer. Endoscopic examinations of patients treated with cetraxate showed cure rates of 28% after 4 weeks, 61% after 8 weeks, and 73% after 12 weeks of treatment, significantly higher than cure rates seen with <b>gefarnate</b> at both 8 and 12 weeks.|$|E
40|$|Atsuyoshi Dota, Yuko Takaoka-Shichijo, Masatsugu NakamuraOphthalmic Research and Development Center, Santen Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Ikoma-shi, Nara, JapanPurpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>gefarnate</b> on mucin-like glycoprotein secretion in isolated rabbit conjunctival tissue, and on corneal epithelial damage in rabbit and cat dry-eye models. Methods: Conjunctival tissue isolated from rabbits was treated with <b>gefarnate.</b> Mucin-like glycoprotein was detected in the culture supernatant by an enzyme-linked lectin assay. <b>Gefarnate</b> ointment was topically applied to eyes once daily for 7 days in the rabbit dry-eye model, in which the lacrimal glands, Harderian gland, and nictitating membrane were removed, or for 4 weeks in the cat dry-eye model, in which the lacrimal gland and nictitating membrane were removed. Corneal epithelial damage was evaluated by measurement of corneal permeability by rose bengal in the rabbit model or by fluorescein staining in the cat model. Results: <b>Gefarnate</b> stimulated mucin-like glycoprotein secretion in conjunctival tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In the rabbit dry-eye model, application of <b>gefarnate</b> ointment to the eyes resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rose bengal permeability in the cornea, with the effect being significant at concentrations of &ge; 0. 3 %. In the cat dry-eye model, application of <b>gefarnate</b> ointment resulted in a significant decrease in the corneal fluorescein staining score. Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>gefarnate</b> stimulates in vitro secretion of mucin-like glycoprotein in conjunctival tissue and ameliorates corneal epithelial damage in animal dry-eye models. <b>Gefarnate</b> may therefore be effective for treating dry eye.

40|$|AIMS—The {{effects of}} three drugs for the {{treatment}} of gastritis and gastric ulcer—gefarnate, ecabet sodium, and troxipide—on periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive cell density in rabbit conjunctiva in vivo were investigated.  METHODS—Eye drops containing <b>gefarnate</b> (0. 1 %, 1 %), ecabet sodium (0. 1 %, 1 %), or troxipide (0. 1 %, 1 %) were instilled in both eyes of rabbits, six times a day for 7  days. On the eighth day, filter paper was gently pressed on the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, and impression cytology was performed with PAS staining. Three points in each specimen were selected randomly, and PAS stained cells were counted.  RESULTS—The instillation of <b>gefarnate</b> increased PAS positive cell density significantly at the concentration of 1 % (p < 0. 05). In contrast, instillation of ecabet sodium or troxipide failed to change PAS positive cell density.  CONCLUSIONS—These results demonstrated that <b>gefarnate</b> stimulates PAS positive cell density in rabbit conjunctiva.    Keywords: gefarnate; goblet cell; mucin; conjunctiva; rabbi...|$|E
40|$|A 77 year-old Japanese female had a {{complaint}} of left-sided abdominal discomfort {{at the age}} of 68. She was found to have amyloid deposits by Congo red stain on biopsied materials of esophago-cardiac junction, stomach and duodenal lesions, from the endoscopic examination. Amyloid deposits were massively found in the muscularis mucosae. Diffuse deposition of amyloid was also seen in the lamina propria mucosae. AA type was demonstrated without any underlying disease. Seven years later, she was found to have amyloid deposits in the interstitium of rectal region and ileocecal value. She has no immunoglobulin abnormality and there appeared to be no antecedent disorders. She is doing well without medication except oral intake of DMSO 5 mg a day for 2 years and <b>gefarnate</b> for 6 years. Good prognosis in the present case is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} prescribing {{pattern in}} low-dose aspirin users and physician awareness of preventing aspirin-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury with combined protective medications. METHODS: A retrospective drug utilization {{study was conducted}} in the 2 nd Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The hospital has 2300 beds and 2. 5 million outpatient visits annually. Data mining was performed on all aspirin prescriptions for outpatients and emergency patients admitted in 2011. Concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RA) and mucoprotective drugs (MPs) were analyzed. A defined daily dose (DDD) methodology was applied to each MP. A further investigation was performed in aspirin users on combination use of GI injurious medicines [non-steoid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids and clopidogrel and warfarin] or intestinal protective drugs (misoprostol, rebamipide, teprenone and <b>gefarnate).</b> Data of major bleeding episodes were derived from medical records and adverse drug reaction monitoring records. The annual incidence of major GI bleeding due to low-dose aspirin was estimated for outpatients. RESULTS: Prescriptions for aspirin users receiving PPIs, H 2 RA and MPs (n = 1039) accounted for only 3. 46 % of total aspirin prescriptions (n = 30 015). The ratios of coadministration of aspirin/PPI, aspirin/H 2 RA, aspirin/MP and aspirin/PPI/MP to the total aspirin prescriptions were 2. 82 %, 0. 12 %, 0. 40 % and 0. 12 %, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in age between patients not receiving any GI protective medications and patients receiving PPIs, H 2 RA or MPs. The combined medication of aspirin and PPI was used more frequently than that of aspirin and MPs (2. 82 % vs 0. 40 %, P teprenone > sucralfate oral suspension > L-glutamine and sodium gualenate granules > rebamipide > sucralfate chewable tablets. The ratio of MP plus aspirin prescriptions to the total MP prescriptions was as follows: rebamipide (0. 47 %), teprenone (0. 91 %), L-glutamine and sodium gualenate granules (0. 92 %), <b>gefarnate</b> (0. 31 %), hydrotalcite (1. 00 %) and sucralfate oral suspension (0. 13 %). Percentages of prescriptions containing aspirin and intestinal protective drugs among the total aspirin prescriptions were: rebamipide (0. 010 %), PPI/rebamipide (0. 027 %), teprenone (0. 11 %), PPI/teprenone (0. 037 %), <b>gefarnate</b> (0. 017 %), and PPI/gefarnate (0. 013 %). No prescriptions were found containing coadministration of aspirin and other NSAIDs. Among the 3196 prescriptions containing aspirin/clopidogrel, 3088 (96. 6 %) prescriptions did not contain any GI protective medicines. Of the 389 prescriptions containing aspirin/corticosteroids, 236 (60. 7 %) contained no GI protective medicines. None of the prescriptions using aspirin/warfarin (n = 22) contained GI protective medicines. Thirty-five patients were admitted to this hospital in 2011 because of acute hemorrhage of upper digestive tract induced by low-dose aspirin. The annual incidence rates of major GI bleeding were estimated at 0. 25 % for outpatients taking aspirin and 0. 5 % for outpatients taking aspirin/warfarin, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prescribing pattern of low-dose aspirin revealed a poor awareness of preventing GI injury with combined protective medications. Actions should be taken to address this issue...|$|E
40|$|A {{short-term}} double-blind cross-over {{trial of}} prenazone 600 rng daily and phenylbutazone 300 mg daily {{was carried out}} in twenty out-patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Ten patients preferred prenazone, and eight preferred phenylbutazone. No significant difference in analgesic and anti-inflammatory potency was demonstrated under the conditions of the trial, and no serious adverse effects, either clinical or laboratory, were encountered. These findings support other claims that prenazone may be a useful alternative in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. PRENAZONE is a new anti-inflammatory agent developed in an attempt to combine the beneficial action of phenylbutazone with increased gastrointestinal tolerance. To achieve this a terpenyl group, which is thought to be responsible for the ulcer-healing properties of <b>gefarnate,</b> has been introduced into the basic phenylbutazone molecule, 4 -prenyl-l, 2 -diphenyl- 3, 5 -pyrazolidenedione (Casadio et a!., 1967). Animal experiments have suggested that prenazone is equipotent with phenylbutazone as an anti-inflammatory analgesic, with markedly less ulcerogenic effect (Casadio et al, 1972; Bianchi et al., 1972; Marazzi-Uberti et al, 1972). Studies in rheumatoid arthritis in man have shown 450 mg and 600 mg daily to b...|$|E
40|$|Recently, some antiulcer {{agents have}} been {{reported}} to have antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori, which is highly associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers. In-vitro and in-vivo activity of plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, against H. pylori was investigated. Antibacterial activity of plaunotol against a standard strain (NCTC 11637) and 14 clinical isolates was compared with those of other cytoprotective antiulcer agents: benexate, sofalcone, teprenone, cetraxate, and <b>gefarnate,</b> by an agar dilution method. The MIC » and MIC » of plaunotol against 15 strains were 6. 25 and 12. 5 mg/L, respectively, making it the most potent of the cytoprotective antiulcer agents. The bactericidal effect of plaunotol was investigated using an in-vitro killing assay. Plaunotol at concentrations of more than 6 mg/L induced a rapid reduction of culture turbidity, with an extensive loss of viability, within 30 min. Observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed that plaunotol caused autolysis and treated cells were deformed. In-vivo activity of plaunotol against H. pylori was examined in a nude mouse gastritis model. Plaunotol significantly decreased the number of H. pylori in the stomach of nude mice. In addition, the antiulcer agent enhanced the antibacterial activity of amoxycillin or clarithromycin in the infection model...|$|E
40|$|AIM: There {{are very}} few {{detailed}} reports on the features ofgastric and/or duodenal ulcers associated with non-steroidal antiinflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) during ulcer prophylaxis. In thisstudy, lansoprazole (LPZ) and <b>gefarnate</b> (GFN) were compared forefficacy in the prophylaxis of gastric and duodenal ulcers in high-riskpatients receiving NSAID therapy. MTTHODS: All ulcers that had developed during prophylaxiswith LPZ (15 mg once daily) and GFN (50 mg twice daily) in aprospective, randomized, double-blind trial were compared for theirendoscopic features {{by a panel of}} expert endoscopists based ontheir endoscopic images, in accordance with a predetermined set ofcriteria. RESULTS: A total of 15 and 46 patients had developed gastric orduodenal ulcers during prophylaxis with LPZ and GFN, respectively,during the double-blind trial. Of the 14 gastric ulcers that haddeveloped in those given LPZ, 13 (93 %) were “small” and “shallow”,while, in contrast, 31 % of 35 gastric ulcers were “medium” or “large”and 29 % were deep” in those given GFN. On the other hand, 8 outof 11 patients had “deep” duodenal ulcers in the GFN group while 1 patient a “medium” and “shallow” duodenal ulcer in the LPZ group. CONCLUSIONS: The study results demonstrated that ulcersdeveloping during secondary prophylaxis with LPZ and GFN differin their size and depth. These findings may be useful when devisinga strategy for the prevention of gastric and duodenal ulcers in highriskpatients receiving NSAID therapy in a routine clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|Under a {{scanning}} electron microscope, the microcirculation {{of normal}} and pathological stomachs was observed by a corrosion casting technique. This improved {{approach has been}} in the microvascular pattern of gastric ulcers to clarify its non-healing and recurring tendency. In the case of a normal rat, arteries, upon penetrating the serosa and immediately branched into capillaries {{at the base of the}} gastric gland. These mucosal capillaries run upward in more or less straight lines from the submucosal plexus toward the surface and continued to the vascular net on the mucosal surface. Part of the vascular net continued into a descending collecting venule which ran downward in a straight line, increasing in diameter and continuing into a collecting vein. An arteriovenous anastomotic channel was found between the artery and vein of the submucosal plexus. Although the microvascular pattern of the normal human stomach was little more complicated than that of the rat, its basic pattern was the much same. In the case of an experimental chronic gastric ulcer (acetic acid ulcer by Okabe), there are two unusual vascular structures, i. e., increased vessels and radiating vessels; histologically they represent zone of granulation and scar, these vessels are not observed horizontal anastomoses of each other. In particular, there are horizontal anastomose in the least between this vessel in scar and the vessel of the adjacent area. By the effects of the vagotomy and the drug (<b>Gefarnate),</b> this horizontal anastomose not change for the better during observation. In the case of a human chronic gastric ulcer, this particular pattern on the microcirculation was the much same. As a result of these observation, this particular pattern on the microcirculation can readily assumed that healing of deep ulcer is difficult. If it should heal, there appear weak points of blood supply, for the regenerated epithelium is supplied only by the poor scar vessels...|$|E
