40|$|Chair’s Foreword I {{am pleased}} to {{introduce}} AITSL’s second Initial Teacher Education: Data Report. Since we released the first report in May 2013, {{the debate over the}} quality and direction of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> has intensified. The first data report has contributed to the quality of that debate. The 2014 report builds on the collection of baseline data assembled for the initial report, bringing together nationally available data on <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> in Australia. For the 2014 report, additional data has been collected including time series data as well as data on the first year retention rates in <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education.</b> The addition of time series, in particular, allows for greater identification of trends and comparative analysis. The 2014 report also incorporates the results from the 2013 Staff in Australia’s Schools Survey. The data presented in this report highlight the scale and diversity of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> in Australia. Over 78, 000 students were enrolled in <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> in 2012, in over 400 courses at 48 providers. They study on campus and online, full-time and part-time, and at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. They enter <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> through diverse pathways, and graduate into employment across the range of Australian schools. This report will make a significant contribution to informing the continuous improvement of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> in the country. Professor John Hattie Chair, AITSL Boar...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{implications for}} <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> informed by key findings {{of research and}} evaluation of the Teaching Teachers for the Future (TTF) Project. The context for <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> is largely situated within an accountability agenda, evidenced by the National Plan for School Improvement which will require the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) to audit <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> programs in Australia, {{in addition to the}} scrutiny and program accreditation requirements by accrediting authorities. The TTF project demonstrated a more sophisticated, improvement agenda which respectfully acknowledged and engaged the collective wisdom of all Australian Higher <b>Education</b> Institutions providing <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> programs. The author argues that recent policy and media commentary on quality teachers, including the ABC's Q&A Education Special, Sky News State of the Nation Forum on Education, and the National Plan for School Improvement, and the reporting of Australian school students performance on international tests, have been silent in relation to the disruptive innovations occurring through technological innovations and their implications for <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education.</b> The implications from the research and evaluation of the TTF project research and evaluation indicate that the TPACK conceptualisation and AITSL's ICT Elaborations for Graduate Teacher Standards can inform the design of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> in preparing teachers for the 21 st Century.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{generate}} a systematic description of policy and practice across qualifications of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> in Aotearoa New Zealand. The study was conducted in two phases. Data from publicly-available documentation of the 27 providers of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> were recorded in an electronic data base as a means of compiling individual profiles of each qualification. Subsequently, twenty-five providers participated in interviews to ensure that profiles accurately reflected the policy and practice of the qualification. Qualification profiles were reviewed to identify common and distinctive characteristics of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> according to sector (early childhood, primary and secondary), type of qualification and type of provider. Findings were considered within a framework of contemporary national and international research and implications identified for future research, policy and practice in <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education.</b> This project confirms that <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> is incredibly complex and multi-faceted and that New Zealand qualifications reflect many of the achievements and the challenges of implementing quality teacher education that are experienced internationally. The official documentation reveals that there is a general lack of explicit coherence among components of many qualifications, that in some cases there is no clearly articulated conceptual or theoretical base underpinning qualifications, and, that, in the documentation of many qualifications, there are conspicuous silences surrounding aspects of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> critical to the New Zealand context. There is also evidence that the regulatory and compliance environment within which providers operate is sometimes perceived as distracting, rather than ensuring quality. This national project has enabled us to identify key areas for further and ongoing attention both by individual providers of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> and, more importantly, by the professional community of teacher education in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the New Zealand Teachers Council and others. We need to determine, and thence articulate more clearly, the fundamental goals of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> and to demonstrate how programmes of ITE are coherent in their underlying values, goals, design, curriculum, pedagogy and implementation. There is a need also to consider how current external quality assurance processes can be made more coherent with fundamental goals of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> and the research on theory and practice that underpins these goals...|$|R

25|$|Swahili {{is used in}} {{parliamentary}} debate, in {{the lower}} courts, and as a medium of instruction in primary school. English is used in foreign trade, in diplomacy, in higher courts, and as a medium of instruction in secondary and higher education, The Tanzanian government, however, has plans to discontinue English as a language of instruction. In connection with his Ujamaa social policies, President Nyerere encouraged the use of Swahili to help unify the country's many ethnic groups. Approximately 10 percent of Tanzanians speak Swahili as a first language, and up to 90 percent speak it as a second language. Many educated Tanzanians are trilingual, also speaking English. The widespread use and promotion of Swahili is contributing to the decline of smaller languages in the country. Young children increasingly speak Swahili as a first language, particularly in urban areas. Ethnic community languages (ECL) other than Kiswahili are not allowed as a language of instruction. Nor are they taught as a subject, though they might be used unofficially (illegally) in some cases in <b>initial</b> <b>education.</b> Television and radio programmes in an ECL are prohibited, and {{it is nearly impossible}} to get permission to publish a newspaper in an ECL.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} ideological trends in <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> {{curricula}} in East African universities during the post-independent and contemporary times. From the mid- 1960 s and mid- 1980 s, <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> curricula were integrated and harmonised {{with support from}} the East African Community whose efforts were coordinated by the Inter-University Council for East Africa. With the breakup of the Community in 1977, each independent state pursued its own educational strategy. However, underfunding of the public sector by governments, introduction of market-friendly reforms under the World Bank Structural Adjustment Programme in 1987 and the de-regularisation policies led to the liberalisation of public services, including education. Liberalisation affected among others, the quality of the <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> curricula. Consequently, national councils and commissions for higher education were established to control standards in higher education, and the Inter-University Council for East Africa was revived to standardise and harmonise educational standards at regional level. The review shows that over the past five decades, the structure and organisation of <b>initial</b> teacher <b>education</b> curricula has continuously adjusted itself and been adjusted to a hybrid culture blending classical humanism, utilitarianism, social re-constructionism, market and global ideologies. Comparable ideological inclinations at socio-economic and political levels have influenced this trend in the region.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{acquisition}} of knowledge and values conductive to social evolution, education also enables development of mind, training in logical and analytical thinking. It allows an individual to acquire organizational, managerial, and administrative skills. Moreover, enhanced self-esteem and improved social and financial status within a community is a direct outcome of education. Therefore, by promoting education among women, Pakistan can achieve social and human development, and gender equality. A large number of empirical studies have revealed that increase in women's education boosts their wages and that returns to education for women are frequently larger than that of men. Increase {{in the level of}} female education improves human development outcomes such as child survival, health and schooling. Lower female education has a negative impact on economic growth as it lowers the average level of human capital. Developmental Economists argue that in developing countries female education reduces fertility, infant mortality and increases children's education. Gender inequality in education directly and significantly affects economic growth. Empirical studies done by using regression analysis reveal the fact that the overall literacy rate, enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth. Chaudhry (2007) investigated the impact of gender inequality in education on economic growth in Pakistan. The secondary source of time series data drawn from various issues has been used. In his regression analysis, he estimated a set of regressions showing a moderate explanatory power. The variables, overall literacy rate, enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth. It was found that gender inequality in <b>initial</b> <b>education</b> reduces economic growth.|$|E
