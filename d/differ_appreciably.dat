5|$|The four lower cheekteeth—the fourth lower premolar (p4) {{and first}} through third lower molars (m1–m3)—are high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, they bear four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each {{of the lower}} cheekteeth lacks an {{additional}} loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger {{than any of the}} molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not <b>differ</b> <b>appreciably</b> from each other and are a little wider than they are long, while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. Syncline IV, which is located {{at the back of the}} tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; this valley is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. Syncline IV also opens into the centrally located syncline III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three under each of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars.|$|E

60|$|The hour of oration {{had gone}} by in the silvery ringing of a bell in the little belfry. The belt of forest closing the {{entrance}} of the valley stood like a screen between the low sun and the street of the village. At {{the other end of the}} rocky gorge, between the walls of basalt and granite, a forest-clad mountain, hiding all the range from the San Tome dwellers, rose steeply, lighted up and leafy to the very top. Three small rosy clouds hung motionless overhead in the great depth of blue. Knots of people sat in the street between the wattled huts. Before the casa of the alcalde, the foremen of the night-shift, already assembled to lead their men, squatted on the ground in a circle of leather skull-caps, and, bowing their bronze backs, were passing round the gourd of mate. The mozo from the town, having fastened his horse to a wooden post before the door, was telling them the news of Sulaco as the blackened gourd of the decoction passed from hand to hand. The grave alcalde himself, in a white waistcloth and a flowered chintz gown with sleeves, open wide upon his naked stout person with an effect of a gaudy bathing robe, stood by, wearing a rough beaver hat at the back of his head, and grasping a tall staff with a silver knob in his hand. These insignia of his dignity had been conferred upon him by the Administration of the mine, the fountain of honour, of prosperity, and peace. He had been one of the first immigrants into this valley; his sons and sons-in-law worked within the mountain which seemed with its treasures to pour down the thundering ore shoots of the upper mesa, the gifts of well-being, security, and justice upon the toilers. He listened to the news from the town with curiosity and indifference, as if concerning another world than his own. And it was true that they appeared to him so. In a very few years the sense of belonging to a powerful organization had been developed in these harassed, half-wild Indians. They were proud of, and attached to, the mine. It had secured their confidence and belief. They invested it with a protecting and invincible virtue as though it were a fetish made by their own hands, for they were ignorant, and in other respects did not <b>differ</b> <b>appreciably</b> from the rest of mankind which puts infinite trust in its own creations. It never entered the alcalde's head that the mine could fail in its protection and force. Politics were good enough for the people of the town and the Campo. His yellow, round face, with wide nostrils, and motionless in expression, resembled a fierce full moon. He listened to the excited vapourings of the mozo without misgivings, without surprise, without any active sentiment whatever.|$|E

50|$|Background {{selection}} can {{be measured}} by assessing the degree of departure of the levels of neutral variants from the predictions of neutral model-based estimations of mutation rates and genetic drift. However, {{it is not enough}} to study variation alone because the two main forms of linked selection, background and hitchhiking, produce a loss in diversity, and the models both predict similar results in genomic regions of high recombination. The relative influence of these two effects is not yet well understood, though methods have been developed for differentiating between the two effects. One technique is to compare levels of nucleotide diversity in regions of low recombination, where the models <b>differ</b> <b>appreciably</b> in their predictions. Thus, studying variation in genomic neighborhoods with relatively low recombination rates, rather than across the whole genome, can yield insights about the relative prevalence of background and hitchhiking selection.|$|E

50|$|The vibronic {{spectra of}} {{diatomic}} molecules {{in the gas}} phase also show rotational fine structure. Each line in a vibrational progression will show P- and R- branches. For some electronic transitions {{there will also be}} a Q-branch. The transition energies, expressed in wavenumbers, of the lines for a particular vibronic transition are given, in the rigid rotor approximation, that is, ignoring centrifugal distortion, byHere B are rotational constants and J are rotational quantum numbers. (For B also, a double prime indicates the ground state and a single prime an electronically excited state.) The values of the rotational constants may <b>differ</b> <b>appreciably</b> because the bond length in the electronic excited state may be quite different from the bond length in the ground state, because of the operation of the Franck-Condon principle. The rotational constant is inversely proportional to the square of the bond length. Usually B′ < B′′ as is true when an electron is promoted from a bonding orbital to an antibonding orbital, causing bond lengthening. But this is not always the case; if an electron is promoted from a non-bonding or antibonding orbital to a bonding orbital, there will be bond-shortening and B′ > B′′.|$|E
