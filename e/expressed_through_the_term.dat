30|$|The {{driving force}} of capitalism, as clearly {{elaborated}} by Karl Marx, is profit seeking and the accumulation of capital to be reinvested. The dominant sector is the financial capital (Hilferding 1981; Luxemburg 1972). It means the primacy of economics over politics. Today this orientation is <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> of ‘shareholder-value’ (Vitols 2002). Crises are a fundamental element of the capitalist system (Lutz 1984; Marx 1976; Schumpeter 1928, 1943). And {{in the sense of}} dialectics they produce social uprisings, revolts, and revolutions. Mao Dze Dong characterized this phenomenon as the ‘struggle of two lines’.|$|E
40|$|The {{essence of}} {{literature}} – it’s voice, it’s meaning– {{has always been}} scrutinized of interest to readers and theorists. The language in itself {{has the power to}} revolt against and undermine current and dominant hierarchies. This language can also be of a passive nature, accepting existing norms and dichotomies. This paper has the ambition to examine the language, the voice, of Clarice Lispector in her novel A Hora da Estrela (The Hour of the Star). The theoretical horizon from which I will read The Hour of the Star is that of Hélène Cixous, which can be <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> écriture féminine. Écriture féminine suggests a way of writing that revolts against dominating hierachies and, at the same time, rewrites oppositions and dichotomies. This way of writing, whatever associations and delimitations it’s name will invoke, is not available for one sex only; the sex that this writing refers to is that of the text. Thus both men and women can express écriture féminine, and as Cixous says, Jean Genet and Franz Kafka are examples of this although Clarice Lispector is the one, in Cixous’ opinion, who best expresses this feminine writing. In my reading and writing I will focus on the meta-fictive element in A Hora da Estrela, I hope to show that this element operates in many different ways, on different levels. This I will achieve by exploring the way in which Lispector reveals the relation to the other; a text, a person, language, the subject. My thesis is that Lispector practices what Cixous theorizes. Another point I want to make is that Lispector expresses in opposition to describe. This is related to the close relation between writing and body, and in the end writing and reading. The relation between reading and writing is a question {{of the nature of the}} text and the essence of writing. The writing is in A Hora da Estrela described as a problematic venture, discussing the role of the author and the meeting with the other. This aspect goes as far as questioning the entire relation to tradition, gender, literary canon. In conclusion: The purpose is to do a reading of and with, both Lispector and Cixous, in order to find the essence and expression of écriture féminine in the novel A Hora da Estrela...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{results of}} literary research that summarizes {{approaches to the}} concept of aboutness in information science and gives reasons for current renewed interest in semantic questions of information and knowledge processing accompanied by efforts to develop new approaches and solutions. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first part we summarize the semantic problems of content analysis. Using our own model we present the concept of aboutness which in Czech terminology lacks equivalent and is loosely <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of topic, content, subject, meaning, theme, sense, genre. The second part reviews various opinions on the subject by the authors in the field of information science. The third part deals with the concept of aboutness in the FRSAD model.

Some Zen temples include a taiso (exercise) period, often early in the morning, including yoga-like postures, quick repetitive exercises, and/or more flowing exercises reminiscent of Tai Chi. These exercises are designed to open and unblock the body in preparation for sitting meditation, develop a deeper awareness of the body, and as an opportunity to practice [...] "becoming one” with what’s happening in the moment (<b>expressed</b> in Japanese <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> narikiru - become one - or ima-koko - now-here).|$|R

40|$|A key {{change in}} the {{evolution}} of our species from a common ancestor with the chimpanzees was the shift to a field of social interaction no longer dependent upon face-to-face interaction for the maintenance of social coherency.   Our hunter-gatherers ancestors made a radical shift to social relations based on a culturally constructed system of kinship relations.   Unlike biological kinship that reflects the facts of biological reproduction, cultural kinship is a constructed, computational system that enables symbolic computation of kinship relations that are <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> kin <b>terms</b> of a kinship terminology.   The system of kin terms is analogous to arithmetic as a computational system for computing quantities with symbols instantiated by the counting numbers.   The internal logic of a kinship terminology ensures consistency both in kinship relation computations and translation of kin <b>term</b> computations to <b>the</b> perspective of each person who culturally shares the same kinship terminology.   The constraint of internal and external consistency does not lead to a single kinship terminology computational system, hence {{there are a variety of}} kinship terminology systems across human societies.   In this paper I outline a theory for the generative structure of kinship terminology systems and briefly discuss the implications this for explaining structural differences between kinship terminologies and how structure relates to social organization. ...|$|R

40|$|How do we help {{students}} to integrate their tertiary education with their development as " wise" global citizens and professionals? The study engages with this question <b>through</b> exploring <b>the</b> use of Reflective Journals as a central and integrating strategy for learning and assessment for a socially and culturally diverse group of students in a large, compulsory, first year, one-semester Engineering unit [BNB 007 : Professional Studies] between 2000 and 2004. The study supports the hypothesis that Reflective Journals {{can be an effective}} strategy for improving the often-criticised poor communication skills of domestic and international students in technical fields. For many students, the process of reflection also became a means of learning about their learning. Attitude surveys administered to students pre and post the teaching intervention in the years 2000 - 2002 showed positive changes in anticipated directions that encouraged further research. If attitude change was occurring in BNB 007, what was the nature of the change? The research showed that at a deeper, longer term and more complex level, this new self-awareness supported many students to develop the kind of futures thinking and social learning " that will be necessary to navigate the transition to sustainable futures" (Raskin et al., 2002). The study contributes to the literature and to methodology <b>through</b> <b>the</b> first complementary use of two new methodologies, Sense-Making and Causal Layered Analysis. Thirty in-depth Sense-Making based interviews, including four with staff, indicate that 'meta-reflection' and transformative learning did take place. Expressing these qualities in the discourse of internationalisation as " global portability" or even " global competence" is unsatisfactory because these popular terms do not embody the qualities graduates need to create sustainable futures. As currently used, they mainly serve a market-dominated version of globalisation and its allied internationalisation-as-profit discourse. Raskin et al proposed a more appropriate term, " sustainability professionals", emerging from a preferred, valuesbased globalisation inspired by a vision of humane, sustainable futures that see " rights assured, nature treasured, culture rich and the human spirit animate" (p. 70). This more challenging concept of a graduate for the 21 st century is <b>expressed</b> here <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Globo sapiens, whose qualities are identified in this study. Such professionals are willing to think critically and to assume responsibility for their impact on communities and the planet. This is the critical-futures oriented, transformative and therefore radical notion connoted by the title Towards Globo sapiens. This research identified some of the terrain and challenges of a post-development vision in a vocational area of teaching in Higher Education. It explained how particular students resisted or reconstructed their worlds when challenged at fundamental levels, but within a supportive atmosphere. Thus the study contributes to what educators might need to know, be and do, in order to teach effectively for the transformations urged by Sustainability Scientists, among others, and upon which any sustainable alternative futures depend. The study is underpinned by transdisciplinary syntheses that help to illuminate each area in new and fruitful ways...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe work {{described}} in this paper explores if the same visual modality (sharpness of curvature) {{can be used to}} express different dimensions of emotions (arousal and valence) depending on the modalities it is combined with. We propose two novel approaches to visually express emotions in affective agents. Both models employ a simplistic character consisting of an abstract body modelled as a closed sequence of concatenated curves. Emotions are represented in terms of arousal and valence dimensions. In the first model, the arousal value is <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sharpness of the curves that comprise the character outline, while the valence value is <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> curvature of the character's mouth. In the second model, the arousal value is <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> character's movement, while the valence value is <b>expressed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sharpness of the curves that comprise the character outline. Thus, sharpness of curvature is used to express arousal in the first model and valence in the second one. The paper also describes a user experiment which investigated whether the arousal and valence expressed by our models are appropriately perceived by the users or not. The results support both models and suggest that sharpness of curvature could be used to express arousal or valence if consistently combined with other appropriate modalities...|$|R
