25|$|A few overs of {{relative}} calm followed, Hayden forging runs with Martyn but never looking too assured, and his dismissal, came in an over where Australia had actually looked on top. However, Simon Jones {{got the last}} laugh over Hayden – only to later be reprimanded by the ICC for his celebrations. England kept muscling on, and despite never playing {{on top of their}} game they <b>got</b> <b>four</b> more wickets before the scheduled close of play. Giles got two of those, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and then an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.|$|E

25|$|A Dutch child's {{birth and}} given name(s) must be officially {{registered}} {{by the parents}} within 3 days after birth. It {{is not uncommon to}} give a child several given names. Usually the first one is for daily use, often in a diminutive form. Traditionally, Catholics often chose Latinized names for their children, such as Catharina and Wilhelmus, while Protestants more commonly chose simple Dutch forms such as Trijntje and Willem. In both cases, names were often shortened for everyday use (Wilhelmus and Willem became Wim). In 2014 39% of Dutch children received one name, another 38% were given two names, 20% had three names, 2% <b>got</b> <b>four</b> names and only a few hundred children had five or more given names.|$|E
25|$|The Gladiators {{started their}} {{campaign}} with three straight wins. However {{they lost to}} the Royals at their fourth match. Then they won two consecutive matches before they lost against the Kings. They again won three straight matches before the last match. Their loss to Barisal Burners wasn't too much effective as they went to beat the Kings at their last group stage match to top the points table of group stage. The campaign of Chittagong started with two straight defeats against Duronto and Rangpur Riders. They won just one match in their first five matches which came against the Burners while they lost to Royals and Burners in other matches. But from there they <b>got</b> <b>four</b> consecutive wins to get {{a position in the}} points table. Though in last three matches they only won against Duronto with losses against Riders and Gladiator. Still Kings qualified for the playoffs by securing the third place at the points table.|$|E
25|$|Openers Scott Newman and Richard Clinton made up {{for their}} first-innings failure and batted 22 overs until stumps on day two without giving away their wickets, but on the third morning James Kirtley got the vital breakthrough, having Clinton caught for 12 off 79 balls. Rikki Clarke's 75 led Surrey to set a target, at least, as the Pakistanis {{dominated}} - Naved-ul-Hasan <b>got</b> <b>four</b> for 70 and Mushtaq Ahmed three for 96. Surrey had some Pakistanis of their own, as Azhar Mahmood and Mohammad Akram took two and one wicket respectively, and Sussex scrambled to 33 for 4 at tea on day 3, chasing a meagre 125 to win. After tea, however, Michael Yardy and Matt Prior attacked Nayan Doshi with fury - Prior finishing with 66 not out off just 48 balls - as Sussex eased to the target with five wickets to spare, losing Yardy for 35 but still holding out for the win.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire, a team chasing {{points in}} {{their attempt to}} promote from Division Two of the County Championship, racked up a 304-run lead on first innings against Derbyshire, yet failed to win. However, the 12 points earned gave them {{promotion}} from Division Two. Winning the toss and batting first, Yorkshire relied on Australians Mark Cleary and Ian Harvey to take wickets, as Cleary ended with three for 46 and Harvey with five for 40. Harvey got his first five-for of the season as Derbyshire were bowled out for 216, while Steve Stubbings was the only batsman to pass 30. Matthew Wood and Joe Sayers then added 113 for the first wicket to put Yorkshire 103 behind with all wickets intact {{at the end of the}} first day's play. On the second morning, Durham <b>got</b> <b>four</b> wickets for 101 before Anthony McGrath and Ian Harvey notched up centuries in a two-and-a-half-hour partnership worth 156. Yorkshire were eventually bowled out at stumps on day two, having made their way to a lead of 304, despite Ant Botha wrapping up the tail to take four for 90.|$|E
25|$|Ali and Mason then chipped {{away at the}} Northamptonshire batsmen, {{and would}} have fancied their chances when the {{visitors}} were 64 for 5. However, a quickfire partnership between Sales and Wright turned the match on its head again, as the pair added 188 runs in 112 minutes - one run less than Northamptonshire had managed in the entire first innings - to send Northamptonshire into a relatively big lead on this pitch. Sales was 152 not out overnight, and powered on to 190 before Malik had him caught. However, the damage was done, and Worcestershire faced a steep target of 360 to win - or five sessions for a draw. Losing Moore and Graeme Hick early on, Ben Smith attacked for a fine 92, and a 45-minute flurry of runs from Zander de Bruyn gave Worcestershire some hope at 154 for 3. However, Monty Panesar <b>got</b> <b>four</b> for 40, Phillips dug out three for 56, Worcestershire lost the last seven wickets for 68 runs, and whimpered into a heap. Worcestershire were later docked one point due to a slow over rate.|$|E
25|$|Worcestershire were {{on top of}} Leicestershire {{for three}} and a half days at Grace Road, yet lost the match. Despite Dinesh Mongia scoring a quickfire 66, Leicestershire could only scamper 225 in their first innings, Ray Price taking three for 29 with {{economical}} off-spin and Nadeem Malik taking his fourth career five-wicket-haul. In reply, Worcestershire made 323, young batsman Daryl Mitchell making a gruelling 63 not out in five hours while Zander de Bruyn top-scored with 67. Leicestershire then collapsed to 149 for 8, thanks to tight bowling from Price who <b>got</b> <b>four</b> wickets, but experienced wicketkeeper Paul Nixon lifted them with a fine 85 before being run out. The last two partnerships added 89 runs, lifting Worcestershire's target to 141 in about 50 overs - very gettable in most cases. And when Worcestershire were 95 for 4 with the two young batsmen Steven Davies and Mitchell at the crease, it still looked possible. But Davies trod on his wicket attempting to pull a short ball, Mitchell was lbw to Mongia, Ray Price was run out for a five-ball duck, and despite double-figure scores from Chaminda Vaas and Matt Mason Worcestershire fell thirteen short of their target.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the match at Aberdeen was delayed due to rain, but when it did get underway, Ireland {{immediately}} got into trouble. The first two partnerships didn't add a single run, four batsmen departed for ducks, and Craig Wright <b>got</b> <b>four</b> wickets for the hosting Scots. Ireland crumbled to 128 for 9 before 17-year-old Greg Thompson from Lisburn hit 35 from number 10 to become the top scorer of the innings. Steven Knox hit 38 for the Scots, however, as they moved to 104 for 2. Tight bowling frustrated the Scots, who were looking for quick runs, but at least Cedric English hit 66 to lift them to 234 - a lead of 62. Ryan Watson and Dewald Nel got a wicket each before stumps, the Irish second innings score 46 for 2. Dominic Joyce, brother of more famous Ed, came to the crease as the new batsman on the third morning, and he scored 61 before being lbw to Dewald Nel - a crucial innings. The rest of the batsmen stuck in, defending against Paul Hoffmann, who bowled 18 overs for 33 runs, but only got the one wicket.|$|E
25|$|André Nel and Danish Kaneria conceded runs at {{less than}} four runs an over to help Essex Eagles to victory over Hampshire Hawks at Chelmsford, and the four points for the win {{increased}} their lead in the National League to an unassailable 14 points and secured the National League title for Essex. After an opening stand of 70 between William Jefferson and Ronnie Irani, Hampshire <b>got</b> <b>four</b> wickets for 31 as three Essex batsmen were dismissed in single figures before James Middlebrook put on 68 with Jefferson. However, three wickets fell for three runs and the score was 172 for 7, with Jefferson caught for 88, but Hampshire could only take two more wickets in the last half-hour as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 {{at the end of}} their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria dismissed Pothas and went on to concede 26 in nine overs – well short of the required run rate at five an over, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed. In the end, Hampshire finished on 210 for 8, 13 runs short of victory – with their overseas players Shane Watson and Andy Bichel contributing four runs off 18 deliveries, for a run rate of 1.33 an over.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Rambhadracharya (then {{known as}} Rambhadradas) {{undertook}} his second six-month Payovrata, taking {{a diet of}} only milk and fruits and speaking only Sanskrit, at the Sphatik Shila in Chitrakoot. The Yuvraj of Chitrakoot, Hemraj Singh Chaturvedi, was impressed by Rambhadracharya and donated a 60 feet by 80 feet land area situated besides the Mandakini river at Janki Kund to Rambhadradas. Gita Devi, Rambhadradas's elder sister, persuaded him to get an Ashram built on this plot. Rambhadradas <b>got</b> <b>four</b> rooms constructed there and started visiting the place frequently. He undertook a nine-month Payovrata at this newly built Ashram in 1986. He also started performing his Kathas there. Ramcharandas Phalahari, the Sampradaya Guru of Rambhadradas, wanted Rambhadradas {{to stay with him}} at his Ashram in Prayag, but Rambhadradas was reluctant. In 1988, Umacharan Gupta, a businessman from Manikpur offered to build a bigger Ashram and a temple on the condition that Rambhadradas stay there permanently. Rambhadradas agreed and the construction started. On 11 March 1987, the Kanch Mandir (literally glass-temple) was opened and Rambhadradas started living permanently in Chitrakoot. Following this, on the occasion of Tulsi Jayanti on August 2, 1987, he established Tulsi Peeth {{at the site of the}} Ashram. As the founder of the seat of Tulsi, the title of Śrīcitrakūṭatulasīpīṭhādhīśvara (literally The Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot) was bestowed upon Rambhadracharya by Sadhus and intellectuals. Rambhadracharya believes that this Peeth is situated at the place where, according to the epic Ramayana, the Hindu god Rama gave his sandals to his brother Bharat.|$|E
