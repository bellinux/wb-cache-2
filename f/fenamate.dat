Alternative translation initiation produces a shorter, N terminus truncated form of TREK 1 with a much reduced open probability and a proposed increased permeability to sodium compared with the longer form. We show that both forms of TREK 1 can be activated by <b>fenamates</b> and that a number of mutations that affect TREK 1 channel gating occlude the action of <b>fenamates</b> but only in the longer form of TREK 1. Furthermore, <b>fenamates</b> produce a marked enhancement of current through the shorter, truncated form of TREK 1 and reveal a K(+) -selective channel, like the long form.

40|$|The {{effects of}} certain NSAIDs were {{determined}} on agonist-evoked responses recorded from rat neurones maintained in vitro using electrophysiological techniques. Initially, the rat isolated vagus and optic nerves were employed. Alphaxalone, pentobarbitone, propofol and the NSAID, mefenamic acid (MFA), potentiated GABA-evoked {{responses of the}} vagus nerve. Propofol (1 - 100 µM) selectively potentiated GABA and glycine-evoked responses of the rat vagus and optic nerves, but {{had little effect on}} nicotinic acetylcholine-, a,β-methylene-ATP or 5 -hydroxytryptamine-mediated responses. The interaction between MFA and ligand-gated receptors was investigated further using voltage-clamped rat hippocampal neurones maintained in culture. MFA (3 - 100 µM) selectively, concentration-dependently and reversibly potentiated GABA-evoked responses, consistent with the observations made using the vagus nerve. MFA (3 - 100 |aM) however had little or no effect on glycine, AMPA, kainate or NMDA-receptor mediated responses. A final series of experiments investigated the site and molecular mechanism of the interaction between MFA and the GABA-gated chloride ion channel. The potentiating effects of MFA (and other <b>fenamates)</b> were not the result of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, since other NSAIDs did not modulate the GABA(_A) receptor (GR). The actions of MFA were not mediated via the benzodiazepine site of the GR, nor where they due to inhibition of GABA- uptake or membrane perturbation. The modulatory effects of MFA were not use-dependent, but the potentiating effects of MFA were voltage-dependent, where the potentiation was 3 -fold greater at - 100 mV than at + 40 mV, with no change in the equilibrium potential for GABA. MFA activated a current, in the absence of GABA. Hippocampal neurones varied in sensitivity to modulation by MFA and the anticonvulsant, loreclezole, which may indicate a degree of sub- unit selectivity. These data are discussed in relation to the possible site and mechanism of action of <b>fenamates</b> at the GR, their similarities with other positive modulators of the GR and the neurophysiological implications of these findings...|$|R

The structures have been solved by direct methods and refined to R value of 0. 062 and 0. 079, respectively for 1942 and 2852 observed reflections. The four crystallographically independent meclofenamate anions in the complexes have {{nearly the same}} molecular geometry {{which in turn is}} very similar to that found in the crystal structure of free meclofenamic acid. The choline and ethanolamine molecules assume a gauche conformation with respect to the central C [...] -C bond. The invariant structural features observed in the crystals of the free <b>fenamates</b> are retained by the meclofenamate ions in the complexes. These features are the rigid coplanar geometry of the six-membered ring carrying the carboxyl group, the carboxyl group and the imino nitrogen atom, and the internal hydrogen bond connecting the imino and the carboxyl groups. The crystal structures are stabilised by ionic interactions between the carboxylate groups of meclofenamate ions and choline or ethanolamine cations, and hydrogen bonds. The choline complex exhibits pseudosymmetry and the distribution of molecules in it is nearly centrosymmetric although the space group is noncentrosymmetric. The packing of molecules in the crystals is such that the polar columns are surrounded by non-polar regions. The core of each column in the choline complex is made up of water molecules connected by hydrogen bonds involving disordered protons.

40|$|A {{pre-requisite}} for the elucidation of {{the mechanism}} of action of aspirin-like drugs, which are believed to exert their pharmacological effects through the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, is an understanding of their molecular geometry, the non-covalent interactions {{they are likely to}} be involved in, and the geometrical and the electronic consequences of such interactions.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a polymorphophore was {{investigated}} by contrasting the crystal energy landscapes of monomorphic fenamic acid (2 -(phenylamino) -benzoic acid, FA) {{and one of its}} highly polymorphic derivatives, tolfenamic acid (2 -[(3 -chloro- 2 -methylphenyl) amino]-benzoic acid, TA). The crystal energy landscapes of both molecules show that the benzoic acid R 22 (8) dimer motif is found in all low energy crystal structures, but conformational flexibility of the phenyl rings leads {{to a wide range of}} crystal structures with different packings of this dimer. Many of the observed <b>fenamate</b> crystal structures can overlay a significant proportion of the coordination environment with other observed or calculated structures, but the substituents of the phenyl group affect the ordering of the related low energy crystal structures. The crystal energy landscape of tolfenamic acid has several crystal structures, including the observed polymorphs, tightly clustered around the global minimum, whereas the corresponding cluster contains only the observed and a closely related structure for fenamic acid. Hence, the <b>fenamate</b> fragment is potentially permissive of a large number of structures because of the conformational flexibility, but the substituents determine whether a specific <b>fenamate</b> will be polymorphic.

40|$|Large {{conductance}} calcium-activated K+ (KCa) {{channels are}} rapidly activated by niflumic acid dose-dependently and reversibly. External niflumic acid was about 5 times more potent than internal niflumic acid, and its action {{was characterized by}} an increase in the channel affinity for [Ca 2 +], a parallel left shift of the voltage-activation curve, and a decrease of the channel long-closed states. Niflumic acid applied from the external side did not interfere with channel block by charybdotoxin, suggesting that its site of action is not at or near the charybdotoxin receptor. Accordingly, partial tetraethylammonium blockade did not interfere with channel activation by niflumic acid. Flufenamic acid and mefenamic acid also stimulated KCa channel activity and, as niflumic acid, they were more potent from the external than from the internal side. <b>Fenamates</b> applied from the external side displayed the following potency sequence: flufenamic acid approximately niflumic acid >> mefenamic acid.

Swelling-activated [3 H]taurine efflux (Jtau swell) in CPAEC was inhibited by the anion channel blockers tamoxifen, 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB), 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid (DIDS), <b>fenamates,</b> and also quinine (in a pH-dependent manner), ATP, and the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor 4 -bromophenacyl bromide. In contrast, Jtau swell was partly or totally insensitive to bumetanide, forskolin, phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, and staurosporine. Swelling also activated myo-[3 H]inositol efflux that was blocked by tamoxifen, NPPB, DIDS, and niflumic acid. Moreover, the cellular content of taurine and other amino acids was significantly reduced in osmotically activated CPAEC. Finally, in whole cell patch-clamp experiments, taurine, glycine, aspartate, and glutamate exhibited significant permeability for swelling-activated anion channels. In conclusion, hyposmotic swelling activates efflux of taurine and other organic osmolytes in EC.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has indicated that}} NSAIDs might have direct effects on CNS tissue {{in addition to their}} classical inhibitory action on COX enzymes. This thesis addresses this hypothesis using electrophysiological and behavioural techniques. The effects of <b>fenamate</b> and other NSAIDs on native neuronal GABA(_A), 5 -HT(_ 3), nicotinic ACh, P 2 x and strychinine-sensitive glycine receptors, expressed on isolated vagus or optic nerves, was investigated using an extra-cellular recording technique. The <b>fenamate</b> NSAID, mefenamic acid (MFA) potentiated GABA (10 µM) - evoked responses in the vagus nerve. Application of MFA also resulted in non-competitive inhibition of 5 -HT-and a,βMeATP- evoked responses. Non-competitive like inhibition was also observed with flufenamic acid on DMPP- and a,βMeATP- evoked responses and with meclofenamic acid on GABA- evoked responses. Non-fenamate NSAIDs, including aspirin, did not significantly modulate the GABA(_A), 5 -HT(_ 3), nicotinic ACh, P 2 x or glycine receptors. The cognitive and behavioural effects of fenamates and other NASIDs were then investigated. MFA (5 - 20 mg/kg) caused a significant dose- and time-dependent enhancement in the non-spatial object discrimination working memory task when compared to saline controls. The enhancement observed with MFA was greater than that of the cognitive enhancer piracetam. This enhancement was not due to a change in non-mnemonic processes such as arousal, anxiety or locomotion. MFA also enhanced rats' performance in the spatial object location working memory task. The <b>fenamate</b> NSAID, meclofenamic acid (20 mg/kg) mimicked the effect of MFA, but the non-fenamate NSAIDs aspirin and ibuprofen, did not enhance object discrimination indicating that these cognitive effects are not via inhibition of COX. The GABA(_A) receptor modulators diazepam, bicuculline and loreclezole, did not replicate the effect of MFA on object discrimination, suggesting that its effects do not depend entirely on the GABAa receptor. Scopolamine (0. 25 -lmg/kg) significantly impaired object discrimination in a dose-dependent manner. This action could be fully reversed by co-treatment with MFA (20 mg/kg). In the T-maze task, MFA (20 mg/kg) decreased the number of arm entry errors and days taken to reach criterion. The number of arm entry errors made when a 5 -minute intra-trial interval was introduced was also significantly reduced by MFA compared with saline treated animals. In the radial maze, MFA (20 mg/kg) did not decrease the number of never baited arm entries to reach criterion. However MFA did significantly reduce the number of re-entry errors to baited arms, compared to controls, when an intra-trial delay (10 - 30 sees) was introduced. These results support the hypothesis that MFA enhances spatial working memory and that these effects are not task-specific. Overall, the data in this thesis show that <b>fenamate</b> NSAIDs can directly modulate native neuronal ligand-gated ion channels and that MFA can enhance working memory in normal and scopolamine-impaired rats. These results suggest additional pharmacological potential for certain <b>fenamate</b> NSAIDs...|$|E

We recently demonstrated that flufenamic acid (FFA) suppressed Vibrio cholerae El Tor variant-induced intestinal fluid secretion via mechanisms involving AMPK activation and NF-κB-suppression. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of FFA on transepithelial Cl− secretion in human intestinal epithelial (T 84) cells. FFA inhibited cAMP-dependent Cl− secretion in T 84 cell monolayers with IC 50 of ∼ 8  μM. Other <b>fenamate</b> drugs including tolfenamic acid, meclofenamic acid and mefenamic acid exhibited the same effect albeit with lower potency. FFA also inhibited activities of CFTR, a cAMP-activated apical Cl− channel, and KCNQ 1 /KCNE 3, a cAMP-activated basolateral K+ channel. Mechanisms of CFTR inhibition by FFA did not involve activation of its negative regulators. Interestingly, FFA inhibited Ca 2 +-dependent Cl− secretion with IC 50 of ∼ 10  μM. FFA inhibited activities of Ca 2 +-activated Cl− channels and KCa 3. 1, a Ca 2 +-activated basolateral K+ channels, but had no effect on activities of Na+–K+–Cl− cotransporters and Na+–K+ ATPases. These results indicate that FFA inhibits both cAMP and Ca 2 +-dependent Cl− secretion by suppressing activities of both apical Cl− channels and basolateral K+ channels.

40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential (TRP) channels form a {{large family}} of cation channel proteins that are activated and regulated by different mechanisms. So far 28 human TRP proteins were identified and classified into six TRP subfamilies of which the transient receptor potential melastatin-like (TRPM) subfamily constitutes one of them. The physiological role and cellular function of {{some members of the}} TRPM channel subfamily are poorly understood. In the present work, the two closely related constitutively active, Ca 2 + -permeable non-selective cation channels TRPM 1 (Melastatin) and TRPM 3 were functional characterized. For the first time it was shown that TRPM 1 is expressed in murine pancreatic Β-cells. Expression of the channel forming TRPM 1 protein could also be detected in various melanin-producing and melanin-deficient melanocytes. A discussed relationship between the regulation of melanin synthesis and expression of TRPM 1 was not evident in this work. In addition, the expression of TRPM 2 protein could be detected in melanocytes. In contrast to TRPM 1, the regulation of TRPM 2 appears to be coupled with the regulation of melanin synthesis as the melanin production behaves reciprocal to the protein expression of TRPM 2. The characterization of the TRPM 3 knockout mouse line generated by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Incorporated shows that the choosen inactivation strategy results in the translation of a TRPM 3 protein with an in frame deletion of 89 AA. The protein was detectable with our anti-TRPM 3 antibody in extracts of TRPM 3 mice. Functional characterization of the TRPM 3 deletion mutant in the heterologous expression system demonstrated that the channel showed neither a constitutive activity nor could be activated by the known selective agonists of TRPM 3. Localization studies confirmed a localization of TRPM 3 -deletion mutant in the same cellular compartments as the wild-type TRPM 3 protein. Also, the formation of homomers and heteromers between the truncated TRPM 3 and the TRPM 3 wild-type protein could be confirmed. We identified mefenamic acid as potent selective inhibitor of TRPM 3 within the class of <b>fenamates,</b> which are clinically used as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in pain treatment. The results presented here demonstrate that mefenamic acid blocks TRPM 3 from the outside and that the potency of its inhibitory effect depends on the extracellular pH. All other tested fenamat-derivatives could be classified as broad-range TRP-channel blockers. Thus, the class of <b>fenamates</b> represents an interesting group of small molecules that can be used as pharmacological tools for the characterization and modulation of TRP channels. Our studies also provided evidence that TRPM 3 plays {{a significant role in the}} regulation of insulin secretion. The specific activation of TRPM 3 in insulin-secreting INS- 1 E cells and murine pancreatic Β-cells leads to an increase of cytosolic calcium concentration and to a potentiation of insulin secretion, which could be blocked by mefenamic acid, the inhibitor characterized in this study...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Given {{the crucial}} role of the {{skeletal}} muscle chloride conductance (gCl), supported by the voltage-gated chloride channel CLC- 1, in controlling muscle excitability, the availability of ligands modulating CLC- 1 are of potential medical as well as toxicological importance. Here, we focused our attention on niflumic acid (NFA), a molecule belonging to the <b>fenamates</b> group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rat muscle Cl(-) conductance (gCl) and heterologously expressed CLC- 1 currents were evaluated by means of current-clamp (using two-microelectrodes) and patch-clamp techniques, respectively. Fura- 2 fluorescence {{was used to determine}} intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca(2 +) ](i), in native muscle fibres. KEY RESULTS: NFA inhibited native gCl with an IC(50) of 42 muM and blocked CLC- 1 by interacting with an intracellular binding site. Additionally, NFA increased basal [Ca(2 +) ](i) in myofibres by promoting a mitochondrial calcium efflux that was not dependent on cyclooxygenase or CLC- 1. A structure-activity study revealed that the molecular conditions that mediate the two effects are different. Pretreatment with the Ca-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine partially inhibited the NFA effect. Therefore, in addition to direct channel block, NFA also inhibits gCl indirectly by promoting PKC activation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These cellular effects of NFA on skeletal muscle demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} modify CLC- 1 and consequently gCl directly by interacting with channel proteins and indirectly by interfering with the calcium-dependent regulation of the channel. The effect of NFA on mitochondrial calcium stores suggests that NSAIDs, widely used drugs, could have potentially dangerous side-effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{for the management}} of pain in osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases is well documented. The role of NSAIDs is less clear in the treatment of conditions involving soft tissue inflammation, including the airways, ear– nose–throat (ENT) system and urogenital tract. These conditions are often treated inappropriately with antibiotics. Morniflumate, the ß-morpholinoethyl ester of niflumic acid, {{is a member of the}} <b>fenamate</b> family of NSAIDs indicated for the treatment of inflammatory conditions (with or without pain) affecting airways, the ENT system, urogenital tract and the osteoarticular system. Morniflumate has a 30 -year history of clinical use, particularly for the treatment of pain associated with paediatric ENT infection. This article reviews evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of morniflumate. Based on available evidence and the favourable tolerability profile emerging from extensive clinical use, morniflumate appears to be a valid and well-tolerated alternative to other NSAIDs, or to antibiotics, for the treatment of pain and other symptoms of soft tissue inflammation...|$|E
40|$|N-(p-amylcinnamoyl) {{anthranilic acid}} (ACA), a {{phospholipase}} A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitor, is structurally-related to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of the <b>fenamate</b> group {{and may also}} modulate various ion channels. We used the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique at room temperature to investigate the effects of ACA on the Ca(2 +) -activated chloride current (I(Cl(Ca))) and other chloride currents in isolated pig cardiac ventricular myocytes. ACA reversibly inhibited I(Cl(Ca)) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 4. 2 μM, n(Hill) = 1. 1), without affecting the L-type Ca(2 +) current. Unlike ACA, the non-selective PLA(2) inhibitor bromophenacyl bromide (BPB; 50 μM) {{had no effect on}} I(Cl(Ca)). In addition, the analgesic NSAID structurally-related to ACA, diclofenac (50 μM) also had no effect on I(Cl(Ca)), whereas the current in the same cells could be suppressed by chloride channel blockers flufenamic acid (FFA; 100 μM) or 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid (DIDS; 100 μM). Besides I(Cl(Ca)), ACA (50 μM) also suppressed the cAMP-activated chloride current, but to a lesser extent. It is proposed that the inhibitory effects of ACA on I(Cl(Ca)) are PLA(2) -independent and that the drug may serve as a useful tool in understanding the nature and function of cardiac anion channels. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|CLC-K {{chloride}} {{channels and}} their subunit, barttin, are crucial for renal NaCl reabsorption and for inner ear endolymph production. Mutations in CLC-Kb and barttin cause Bartter syndrome. Here, we identified two adjacent residues, F 256 and N 257, that when mutated hugely alter in Xenopus oocytes CLC-Ka's biphasic response to niflumic acid, a drug {{belonging to the}} <b>fenamate</b> class, with F 256 A being potentiated 37 -fold and N 257 A being potently blocked with a KD~ 1 μM. These residues are localized in the same extracellular I-J loop which harbors a regulatory Ca(2 +) binding site. This loop thus can represent an ideal and CLC-K specific target for extracellular ligands able to modulate channel activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated {{the involvement of the}} barttin subunit in the NFA potentiation. Indeed the F 256 A mutation confers onto CLC-K 1 a transient potentiation induced by NFA which is found only when CLC-K 1 /F 256 A is co-expressed with barttin. Thus, in addition to the role of barttin in targeting and gating, the subunit participates in the pharmacological modulation of CLC-K channels and thus represents a further target for potential drugs...|$|E
40|$|Colic is a {{frequent}} syndrome in horses, being basically {{a manifestation of the}} discomfort that can range from a dull ache to an excruciating pain that often ends with death. Causes can be multiple: digestive, neuronal, psychological, urinary, muscular, vascular and correlated with various pathological conditions and environmental factors, but premises of origin of true colic is stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Any disruption of their function, positional changes, twisting, swelling, infection or trauma willlead to the colic symptoms. There are many conditions that can trigger the colic syndrome, however, the widely recognized primary cause of the colic symptoms in horses is considered the stomach dilatation and / or of intestines, that will lead to obstruction of blood flow. In this sense, the review can be am useful remembrance, we believe, conceived in three chapters, for practitioners of the main elements related to inflammation and colic. Are presented: basic concepts related to anatomy and physiology of the horse digestive components, theoretical and practical recollections about the colic: general causes, syndrome types description: simple occlusion, intestinal wall stenosis, occlusion by strangulation, of bowel infarction, the sand colic, colic in foals, constipation with meconium, ulcers, bladder rupture, malformations etc, major symptoms and the clinical examination.

40|$|During {{development}} {{and also in}} the adult organism cellular growth is strictly regulated by various control mechanisms that ensure cells to start and stop dividing at the proper time and place. Dysfunction of these intricate regulatory mechanisms may result in uncontrolled proliferation of cells and can be the basis for a large diversity of pathogenic conditions including cancer. In our studies we have used normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts as a cellular model system for studying the mechanisms of density-dependent growth inhibition and alterations upon phenotypic transformation, and focused on the biophysical aspects of NRK cells including membrane potential, intracellular calcium dynamics and GJIC, in relation to their growth regulation. Since fibroblasts are considered as classical examples of non-excitable cells, it was rather surprising that NRK fibroblasts repetitively fired calcium action potentials when they were cultured to density-arrest. We have elucidated the excitability mechanism of NRK cells and demonstrated how an L-type calcium conductance, a calcium-activated chloride conductance, an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance, and gap junctional intercellular communication contribute to action potential firing and propagation. Moreover, we have shown that the cytosolic calcium concentration can oscillate in these cells by an intricate interplay between internal calcium stores and plasma membrane ion channels, thereby providing NRK cells with a timing mechanism. During our studies we discovered a novel property of <b>fenamates</b> and 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2 -APB), namely their ability to block gap junctions. The uncoupling action of 2 -APB is unique, since 2 -APB appears to be the first gap junction blocker that does not affect plasma membrane channels. Thus, {{it can be used to}} study ion channel properties in single cells in undissociated tissues. Finally, we have shown that NRK cells become depolarized and secrete a biologically active prostaglandin (PGF 2 {alpha}) upon phenotypic transformation, which are both typical consequences of tumorigenic transformation...|$|R
40|$|Slo 2. 1 {{channels}} {{conduct an}} outwardly rectifying K+ current when activated by high [Na+]i. Here, {{we show that}} gating of these channels can also be activated by <b>fenamates</b> such as niflumic acid (NFA), {{even in the absence}} of intracellular Na+. In Xenopus oocytes injected with < 10 ng cRNA, heterologously expressed human Slo 2. 1 current was negligible, but rapidly activated by extracellular application of NFA (EC 50 = 2. 1 mM) or flufenamic acid (EC 50 = 1. 4 mM). Slo 2. 1 channels activated by 1 mM NFA exhibited weak voltage dependence. In high [K+]e, the conductance–voltage (G-V) relationship had a V 1 / 2 of + 95 mV and an effective valence, z, of 0. 48 e. Higher concentrations of NFA shifted V 1 / 2 to more negative potentials (EC 50 = 2. 1 mM) and increased the minimum value of G/Gmax (EC 50 = 2. 4 mM); at 6 mM NFA, Slo 2. 1 channel activation was voltage independent. In contrast, V 1 / 2 of the G-V relationship was shifted to more positive potentials when [K+]e was elevated from 1 to 300 mM (EC 50 = 21. 2 mM). The slope conductance measured at the reversal potential exhibited the same [K+]e dependency (EC 50 = 23. 5 mM). Conductance was also [Na+]e dependent. Outward currents were reduced when Na+ was replaced with choline or mannitol, but unaffected by substitution with Rb+ or Li+. Neutralization of charged residues in the S 1 –S 4 domains did not appreciably alter the voltage dependence of Slo 2. 1 activation. Thus, the weak voltage dependence of Slo 2. 1 channel activation is independent of charged residues in the S 1 –S 4 segments. In contrast, mutation of R 190 located in the adjacent S 4 –S 5 linker to a neutral (Ala or Gln) or acidic (Glu) residue induced constitutive channel activity that was reduced by high [K+]e. Collectively, these findings indicate that Slo 2. 1 channel gating is modulated by [K+]e and [Na+]e, and that NFA uncouples channel activation from its modulation by transmembrane voltage and intracellular Na+...|$|R
