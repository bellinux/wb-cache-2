5|$|Ongoing {{negotiations}} through March yielded {{an agreement}} on March 7, 1999, {{over the objections of}} the State Department. The proceeds of the series were a major sticking point in negotiations, as it violated the United States <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> Cuba. Instead of going to the Cuban Government, it was agreed that proceeds would fund baseball programs in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder {{had been}} invited to Havana by British world music {{producer}} Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which African musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> Cuba), it transpired that the musicians from Mali had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.|$|E

5000|$|The BXP (was also {{marketed as}} the [...] "panther") is a 9×19mm submachine gun {{developed}} in the mid-1980s by the South African company Milkor (Pty) Ltd. It was qualified with Armscor in 1984 and then marketed by them for Milkor (Pty) Ltd. Due to international arms <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> South Africa due to apartheid, the country was forced to design and manufacture their own weapons. The weapon was intended for use by security forces.|$|R
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Revolution {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Fulgencio Batista, an ally of the United States, in 1959. Fidel Castro severed Cuba's formerly strong ties with the United States. The United States soon instituted a <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> Cuba, which has made it illegal for United States corporations to enter into business with Cuba. The Baltimore Orioles, who were slated to hold an 1960 exhibition series against the Cincinnati Reds in Havana, moved the games to Miami, Florida.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railroad}} in Indiana {{was built}} in Shelbyville in the late 1830s. The first major line was completed in 1847, connecting Madison with Indianapolis. By the 1850s, the railroad began to become popular in Indiana. The railroad brought major changes to Indiana and enhanced the state's economic growth. Although Indiana's natural waterways connected it to the South via cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans, the new rail lines ran East-West, and connected Indiana with the economies of the northern states. As late as mid-1859, no rail line yet bridged the Ohio or Mississippi rivers. Because of an increased demand on the state's resources and the <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> the Confederacy, the rail system was mostly completed {{by the end of}} the American Civil War.|$|E

This will allow the Republic of Cuba to further consolidate and enhance its cooporation with Small Islands Developing States like Tuvalu.” ...|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the effect}} of {{international}} sanctions on Indian economy was minimal; the technological progress was marginal. Most nations did not call for <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> India as the exports and imports together constituted only 4.0% of its GDP, with US trade accounting for only 10.0% of this total. Far more significant were the restrictions on lending imposed by the United States and its representatives on international finance bodies. Most of the sanctions were lifted within five years.|$|R

5|$|Following a US {{military}} strategy endorsed by President Bill Clinton in February 1993, the Washington Agreement {{was signed in}} March 1994. This ended the Croat–Bosniak War, abolished Herzeg-Bosnia, established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and forged the ARBiH–HVO alliance against the VRS. In addition, {{a series of meetings}} between US and Croatian officials were held in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> Bosnia and Herzegovinain effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia. In a meeting held on 29 November 1994, Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb-held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina to draw off part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent its capture by the Serbs. U.S. officials made no response to the proposal. Operation Winter'94 was ordered the same day; it was to be carried out by the HV and the HVOthe main military forces of the Bosnian Croats.|$|E
5|$|In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, {{ending the}} Croat–Bosniak War, and {{providing}} Croatia with US military advisors from Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI).

Because the UN arms embargo {{was still in}} place, MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV {{for participation in the}} NATO Partnership for Peace programme. MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources, including an article in The New York Times by Leslie Wayne and in various Serbian media reports, that MPRI may also have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia, although MPRI, American and Croatian officials have denied such claims.

50|$|In the {{preamble}} of the resolution, the Council reaffirmed {{the importance of}} the Djibouti Peace Agreement and the Transitional Federal Charter as a basis for a resolution of the conflict in Somalia. It condemned violations of the arms <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> Eritrea and Somalia and called upon all states, particularly those in the region, to refrain from violating the embargoes. Council members stressed the need for enhancing the monitoring of the arms embargoes and expressed concern at acts of intimidation against the monitoring group.|$|R

5|$|Reedman carried {{instructions}} from Salisbury to {{spend up to}} £3million on European weapons, aircraft and equipment {{as soon as he}} could. The Rhodesian government now believed that it would almost certainly declare independence unilaterally and, knowing the purchase of materiel would be more difficult following this, wished to have the Rhodesian Security Forces' necessary ammunition, weapons, spare parts and other equipment in place beforehand. Soon after arriving in Portugal, Reedman contacted the Lisbon-based Zoio brothers, José, Luiz and Jean, who had recently supplied the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola with British-made weapons in direct contravention of NATO's <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> arming Portugal's African-based troops. The Zoios were interested in stocking Rhodesia's arsenal, and promptly agreed to arrange an order of weapons from a third party on Reedman's behalf in exchange for a letter of credit from the Rhodesian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting was}} {{one in a series}} held in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. {{following}} the March 1994 Washington Agreement.

5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E
50|$|It {{was during}} the Dow {{administration}} that Mobile established formal sister city relations with Havana, Cuba. Delegations from the Mobile-La Habana society took part in these trips and the Mayor went on several of them. This brought criticism from those who thought that Mobile shouldn't have been sending delegations to Cuba {{in light of the}} <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> the communist nation. However, the trips did establish links between officials in Mobile and officials in Havana that will be useful when trade is restored between the United States and Cuba.|$|R

50|$|Embargoed is a UK-based {{human rights}} {{organisation}} campaigning {{to bring an}} immediate and unconditional end to all <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> the people of Northern Cyprus. Embargoed does not proscribe any political remedy, but considers the embargoes {{on the people of}} Northern Cyprus to be unjust and immoral. It does not consider itself a nationalist organisation, and its manifesto commits it to being multi-cultural, and avoiding politics. The group also campaigns for 1964 to be recognised as the start of the embargoes, this being the year of the breakdown of the power sharing between Greek and Turkish Cypriots (see Cyprus dispute).|$|R
5|$|Makeba's {{music was}} also popular in Europe, and she {{travelled}} and performed there frequently. Acting {{on the advice}} of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres was {{the first}} {{concrete}} result of the renewed BosniakCroat alliance in the Bosnian War, and the advance to Kupres {{was the first}} military effort coordinated between the ARBiH and the HVO since the Washington Agreement. Following the victory, morale of the ARBiH and the HVO soared. Further advantages for them were the recapture of initiative from the VRS and full control of the Split–Livno–Kupres–Bugojno road, allowing improved logistics of the ARBiH and the HVO in the area, as well as greater volume of transport of arms and ammunition, especially after the United States unilaterally ended the arms <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1994. The move in effect allowed the HV to supply itself as the arms shipments flowed through Croatia. Finally, {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Kupres secured the right flank of the Livanjsko field, which became especially significant later that month when Operation Winter '94 was launched by the HV and the HVO northwest of Livno in order to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent capture of Bihać by the VRS. The battle {{is considered to be a}} significant contribution to subsequent success of the HV in the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of China proper, the nomadic Xiongnu {{chieftain}} Modu Chanyu (r.209–174 BC) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe. By {{the end of his}} reign, he controlled Manchuria, Mongolia, and the Tarim Basin, subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand. Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders, and he established a trade <b>embargo</b> <b>against</b> the group. Although the embargo was in place, the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs. Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets. In retaliation, the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province, where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC. After negotiations, the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance, but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes, food, and wine to the Xiongnu.|$|E
50|$|In 1788, Haiti was {{responsible}} for half of the world's supply of coffee. Coffee production has been hurt by natural disasters, as well as U.S.-led <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> the governments of François and Jean-Claude Duvalier. Duvalier's dictatorship made {{it so that the}} coffee farmers of Haiti were too afraid to come down from the mountains to sell their crops. The machinery began to rust and the skills needed to harvest the coffee trees were lost in the generations. Following the movement away from Haitian coffee production, Brazil moved in and took control of the world coffee market.|$|R
50|$|Georg Heinrich Sieveking (1 January 1751 in Hamburg, Germany - 25 January 1799 in Hamburg, Germany) was a German {{merchant}} and {{follower of}} the Enlightenment.

50|$|Unlike Scott, Michel {{does not}} issue a {{complete}} set of catalogs every year, instead updating only several of the volumes. Michel is also more detailed, with quantities issued, sheet formats, and so forth. Also of significance to some collectors is its coverage of countries and periods omitted by Scott for editorial or political reasons. For instance, US <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea are reflected by Scott's failure to show market values for those countries' stamp issues (as late as 2002, Scott did not supply any information at all about North Korean stamps), and Michel is one of few sources for that information.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} {{continued to}} develop steadily with regulation by government and growers alike. Lobbying of the State and Commonwealth governments by the Board resulted in <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> {{the importation of}} peanuts and supportive legislation. In August 1930 the Queensland Government issued an Order-in-Council constituting a Peanut Marketing Board for 10 years to control all sales of peanuts produced in Queensland. Marketing problems were overcome finally with the passing in 1939 of The Peanut Industry Protection and Preservation Act by the Queensland government which ensured that the Board held control over the planting, grading, treatment and marketing of peanuts in Queensland through the health provisions of the Federal Constitution.|$|R
40|$|China’s {{concern over}} its food {{security}} {{has increased in}} recent years as it opens up its domestic food market {{to the rest of the}} world. Chinese policymakers often regard food embargoes by the West as a major potential threat to food security. This paper examines the likelihood and consequences of food <b>embargoes</b> <b>against</b> China. The paper concludes that food embargoes are unlikely to occur, and even if they did, the damage that they could inflict on China is probably small. As a deterrent to such actions, however, international rules governing food embargoes should be strengthened. This will give food-importing countries greater confidence in liberalising trade and will weaken the argument for agricultural protection on the grounds of national security. ...|$|R
