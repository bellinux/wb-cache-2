5|$|From 1913 former S {{lines were}} {{electrified}} with 1,500Vdc overhead lines and electric locomotives hauled coal trains between Shildon and Erimus marshalling yard, which had opened in 1908 between Middlesbrough and Thornaby.

5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation <b>had</b> <b>reduced</b> sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E

Waite was reappointed twice, and served until the abolition of the Upper House in 1950.|$|E
