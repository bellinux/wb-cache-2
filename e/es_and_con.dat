40|$|Introduction: The {{effect of}} {{electrical}} stimulation on muscle degeneration and regeneration is largely unknown {{and it has}} not been studied in conjunction with telomeres. The consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is widespread in athletes and the general population when faced with muscle soreness or injury. Furthermore, the effect of NSAIDs on muscle regeneration is controversial and its effect on telomere lengths is also unknown. Methods: Young adult males performed 200 electrically stimulated maximal isokinetic contractions with one leg (ES) and the other worked as a control (CON). They received either 1200 mg ibuprofen (IBU) per day or placebo (PLA) from 21 days pre- to 30 days post-exercise. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of the CON leg at baseline (H 0) and ES leg at 2. 5 h (H 2. 5) and both legs at 2, 7 and 30 days post-exercise. Blood samples were obtained at the same time points and at day 4 post-exercise. Afterwards the muscle and blood specimen were analysed for skeletal muscle and peripheral blood telomere lengths by Southern blot and signs of muscle degeneration and regeneration were quantified histologically. Results: Histological changes occurred in the ES leg, including; increased proportion of damaged myofibres (2. 1 ± 2. 8 %) and infiltrated myofibres (5. 0 ± 6. 0 %) at day 7, small myofibres (3. 0 ± 4. 4 %) and internally located myonuclei (2. 9 ± 3. 1 %) at day 30. The IBU group had significantly less internally located myonuclei at day 30 compared to PLA (1. 7 ± 2. 4 % vs. 4. 1 ± 3. 8 %). No significant differences were observed in skeletal muscle mean and minimum telomere lengths between <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> <b>CON</b> leg, between IBU and PLA group or between time points. Peripheral blood mean telomere lengths were not significantly different between IBU and PLA group, but between time points; H 0 (9. 6 ± 1. 2 kb) and H 2. 5 (9. 1 ± 1. 1 kb) were significantly shorter than day 4 (10. 3 ± 1. 6 kb) and day 7 (10. 1 ± 1. 5 kb) (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Electrically stimulated contractions caused significant muscle degeneration and regeneration in the 30 days post-exercise. Electrical stimulation also appeared to cause fluctuations in peripheral blood telomere lengths, but not skeletal muscle telomeres. The intake of ibuprofen appeared to interfere with muscle regeneration, but did not seem to affect the peripheral blood or skeletal muscle telomeres. However, due to marked individual variations and the small participant group it is difficult to conclude on the effects of electrical stimulation and ibuprofen on proliferative potential. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the effects of electrical stimulation and ibuprofen on blood and skeletal muscle telomeres...|$|E

40|$|Epigenetic {{regulation}} of gene expression {{is important in}} maintaining self-renewal of embryonic stem (<b>ES)</b> <b>and</b> trophoblast stem (TS) cells. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) negatively control histone acetylation by removing covalent acetylation marks from histone tails. Because histone acetylation is a known mark for active transcription, HDACs presumably associate with inactive genes. Here, we used genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate targets of HDAC 1 in <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TS cells. Through evaluation of genes associated with acetylated histone H 3 marks, and global expression analysis of Hdac 1 knockout <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> trichostatin A-treated <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TS cells, we found that HDAC 1 occupies mainly active genes, including important regulators of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TS cells self-renewal. We also observed occupancy of methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 (MBD 3), a subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex, at a subset of HDAC 1 -occupied sequences in ES cells, including the pluripotency regulators Oct 4, Nanog and Kfl 4. By mapping HDAC 1 targets on a global scale, our results describe further insight into epigenetic mechanisms of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TS cells self-renewal...|$|R

Increased levels of the pro-angio genic mediator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been described in skin disorders, such as chronic urticaria (CU), psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Up to now, no data {{on the role of}} VEGF endogenous inhibitors Endostatin (<b>ES)</b> <b>and</b> Thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) in CU are available. The aim of our study is to investigate the potential involvement of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TSP- 1 in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The levels of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TSP- 1 were measured in the sera of 106 adult patients with CSU and 98 healthy subjects by enzyme immunoassays. The serum levels of the anti-angiogenic mediators <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TSP- 1 resulted significantly higher in CSU than in control subjects. Analysis of these mediators in CSU sub-groups, defined by the results of the autologous serum skin test (ASST), identified a significant increase of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TSP- 1 in both ASST-positive and ASST-negative sub-groups as compared to the controls. Levels of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> TSP- 1 do not parallel the disease severity in CSU.

Survey data indicate most physicians treat <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> ESE with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), but few data are available regarding AED usage patterns. We aimed to describe AED usage for <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> ESE in critically ill children. MethodsWe performed an observational study of patients who underwent continuous electroencephalographic (cEEG) monitoring in the PICU of a single quaternary care children's hospital. We collected data regarding age, clinical diagnoses, <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> ESE occurrence, and AEDs utilized. Results 200 subjects underwent cEEG. ES occurred in 21 % (41 / 200) and ESE occurred in 22 % (43 / 200). Of the 84 patients with ES or ESE, 80 received non-benzodiazepine AEDs including 48 % (38 of 80) with <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> 52 % (42 of 80) with ESE. The most commonly administered first AEDs were levetiracetam in 38 % (30 / 80), phenobarbital in 31 % (25 / 80), phenytoin–fosphenytoin in 28 % (22 / 80), and valproate in 4 % (3 / 80).

40|$|New {{developments}} in stem cell biology offer alternatives for {{the reconstruction of}} critical-sized bone defects. One of these developments {{is the use of}} induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These stem cells are similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells, but can be generated from adult somatic cells and therefore do not raise ethical concerns. Proper characterization of iPS-derived osteoblasts is important for future development of safe clinical applications of these cells. For this reason, we differentiated mouse <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> iPS cells toward osteoblasts using osteogenic medium and compared their functionality. Immunocytochemical analysis showed significant expression of bone markers (osteocalcin and collagen type I) in osteoblasts differentiated from <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> iPS cells on days 7 and 30. An in vitro mineralization assay confirmed the functionality of osteogenically differentiated <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> iPS cells. Gene expression arrays focusing on osteogenic differentiation were performed in order to compare the gene expression pattern in both differentiated <b>and</b> undifferentiated <b>ES</b> cells <b>and</b> iPS cells. We observed a significant upregulation of osteogenesis-related genes such as Runx 2, osteopontin, collagen type I, Tnfsf 11, Csf 1, and alkaline phosphatase upon osteogenic differentiation of the <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> iPS cells. We further validated the expression of key osteogenic genes Runx 2, osteopontin, osteocalcin, collagen type I, and osterix in both differentiated <b>and</b> undifferentiated <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> iPS cells by means of quantified real-time polymerase chain reaction.

40|$|Building energy {{simulation}} (<b>ES)</b> <b>and</b> computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) can play important roles in building design by providing essential information to help design energy-efficient, thermally comfortable and healthy buildings. However, separate applications of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD usually cannot give an accurate prediction of building thermal and airflow behaviors due to the partial modeling of the problem. An integration of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD can eliminate many of the assumptions used in <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD because of the complementary nature of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD results. This thesis studies the fundamentals, implementation <b>and</b> application of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD coupling, significantly advancing the knowledge and experience in this area. The study {{has been focused on}} the iterative coupling of individual <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD programs, which shows good potential of providing reasonable results with acceptable computing costs. The research first analyzes the principles <b>and</b> challenges of <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD program coupling. To bridge three major discontinuities in time-scale, spatial resolution and computing speed between <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD programs, special coupling strategies have been developed. Particularly, the staged coupling strategies proposed can effectively reduce computing time while preserving the accuracy and details of the computed results. The study discusses the solution characteristics of iterative coupling simulation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the research verifies the solution existence and uniqueness of a coupled simulation. The investigation concludes that a converged and stable simulation can be achieved with four different data coupling methods. The study has further developed an improved iteration and control algorithm for the coupled simulation. An integrated program, E+MIT-CFD, has been developed by coupling a new- generation ES program (E+) with a newly-developed ready-to-plug-in CFD solver (MIT- CFD). All the coupling methods and strategies proposed have been implemented in this program. The program has been well validated with various experimental facilities. The comparison of numerical solutions with experimental data reveals the advantages of the integrated simulation over the separate <b>ES</b> <b>and</b> CFD applications. The study further demonstrates the performance and capabilities of the coupled program through practical(cont.) through practical design projects. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the coupling simulation to building characteristics and coupling strategies has been performed, based on which general guidelines are established for appropriate usage of the coupling simulation. by Zhiqiang Zhai.
