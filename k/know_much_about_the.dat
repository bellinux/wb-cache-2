Before filming began, Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the other young actors did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> couple. However, she found such research difficult as the libraries {{did not have the}} information she needed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{scientists}} cannot <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> internal {{mechanisms of}} extinct creatures, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism. However, {{it is generally}} agreed that endothermy first evolved in non-mammalian synapsids such as dicynodonts, which possess body proportions associated with heat retention, high vascularised bones with Haversian canals, and possibly hair. More recently, {{it has been suggested}} that endothermy evolved as far back as Ophiacodon.|$|E
25|$|Ardashir had an {{outstanding}} {{role in developing}} the royal ideology. He tried to show himself as a worshiper of Mazda related to god and possessing khvarenah. The claim of the legitimacy of his reign as a rightful newcomer from {{the line of the}} mythical Iranian shahs and the propagations attributed to Ardashir against the legitimacy and role of the Parthians in the Iranian history sequence show the valuable place that the Achaemenid legacy had {{in the minds of the}} first Sasanian shahanshahs; though the current belief is that the Sasanians did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Achaemenids and their status. On the other hand, some historians believe that the first Sasanian shahanshahs were familiar with the Achaemenids and their succeeding shahanshahs deliberately turned to the Kayanians. They knowingly ignored the Achaemenids in order to attribute their past to the Kayanians; and that was where they applied holy historiography.|$|E

500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E

2500|$|December – Apostle Christofferson {{answered}} a youth's question on homosexuality at a [...] "face to face" [...] church broadcast in Guatemala.

He encouraged the congregation of youth to respect, include, and fellowship those individuals and made clear that the church is not a place for gossip or making fun of a homosexual persons. He cited his brother Tom as a [...] "great example" [...] of a gay member of the church.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, {{the team}} {{launched}} a similar stunt when Allen announced {{she was running}} for President of the United States on the Surprise Party ticket. Burns and Allen did a cross-country whistlestop campaign tour on a private train, performing their live radio show in different cities. In one of her campaign speeches, Gracie said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Lend-Lease Bill, but if we owe it we should pay it." [...] Another typical Gracie-ism {{on the campaign trail}} went like this: [...] "Everybody knows a woman is better than a man when it comes to introducing bills into the house." [...] The Surprise Party mascot was the kangaroo; the motto was [...] "It's in the bag." [...] As part of the gag, Allen (in reality, the Burns and Allen writers) published a book, Gracie Allen for President, which included photographs from their nationwide campaign tour and the Surprise Party convention. Allen received an endorsement from Harvard University.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{shows that}} consumers' broad general {{perceptions}} of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country. For example, a global survey carried out by Nielsen, reported that [...] Country of origin image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant {{of whether or not}} someone buys a product. Its effect is strongest on consumers who don't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for [...] "low involvement" [...] product categories such as shampoo and candy. In various studies it has also been proven that the Country-of-Origin Effect also applies to services.|$|E
2500|$|While goth is [...] "considered a music-based scene", [...] "... to be Goth implies {{much more}} than shared musical tastes; it is ... an 'aesthetic,' a {{particular}} way of seeing and of being seen". Observers have {{raised the issue of}} to what degree individuals are truly members of the goth subculture. On one end of the spectrum is the [...] "Uber goth", a person who is described as seeking a pallor so much that he or she applies [...] "... as much white foundation and white powder as possible". On {{the other end of the}} spectrum another writer terms [...] "poseurs": [...] "goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd..". It has been said that a [...] "mall goth" [...] is a teen who dresses in a goth style and spends time in malls with a Hot Topic store, but who does not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> goth subculture or its music, thus making him or her a poseur. In one case, even a well-known performer has been labelled with the pejorative term: a [...] "number of goths, especially those who belonged to this subculture before the late-1980s, reject Marilyn Manson as a poseur who undermines the true meaning of goth".|$|E
2500|$|Perry’s 22nd book (10th on cricket) was {{the fourth}} {{in a series of}} five volumes drawn from his years of {{interviews}} with Sir Donald Bradman—Bradman’s Invincibles. The Sydney Morning Herald noted: [...] "This is a wonderful insider’s view of the (1948 Ashes) series... Perry is a good, unpretentious writer and the story he has to tell is one of courage and drama... It is a great Australian yarn." [...] Adrian Nesbitt in Sydney’s Sun Herald wrote: [...] "Perry paints an excellent background picture of a tour that is remembered by Australians as a triumph over the mother country, often without consideration that England was still bearing the scars of war... Perry creates suspenseful moments, in the dressing-room and on the field... His meticulous approach gives us a great understanding of the subtleties and room for instinct that were Bradman trademarks." [...] Teri Louise Kelly in Independent Weekly said, [...] "Perry’s work, much like Bradman himself, is head and shoulders above the competition... Bradman’s Invincibles leads the reader into the dusty backrooms, on to windy training pitches and mid-Test; beautifully written and accompanies by excellent photographs." [...] David Stanley in Cricket Boundary Magazine commented: [...] "Bradman’s Invincibles is required reading for all cricket lovers, particularly those of the younger brigade who may not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> players, apart from Bradman, who made up his remarkable team... It is a good read and I recommend it." [...] Inside Sport noted: [...] "Perry’s prose provides worthwhile insight into the mechanics of Bradman’s mind." [...] Neil Harvey, one the Invincibles stars, [...] said: [...] "I found it a very entertaining read. It brought memories flooding back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ardashir had a {{remarkable}} {{role in developing}} the royal ideology. He tried to announce himself as a Mazda worshiper connected to god and owner of divine khvarenah. The claim of his royal eligibility as a rightful newcomer from the line of mythical Iranian shahs and the propagations attributed to Ardashir against the eligibility {{and the role of}} the Parthians in the Iranian history sequence confirms the excellent place that the Achaemenid legacy had in the minds of the first Sasanian shahanshahs; though the consensus is that the Sasanians probably did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Achaemenids and the status. On the other hand, Shahbazi believes that the first Sasanian shahanshahs were familiar with the Achaemenids and their succeeding shahanshahs turned to the Kayanians deliberately. About that, Daryee adds that the Sasanians knowingly ignored the Achaemenids in order to be able to attribute their origins to the Kayanians; and that is why they applied the holy historiography. In that method, the social familiarity and bureaucracy did not matter and the court propagated its custom history by the help of the religious system. In order to remark his victories, Ardashir carved pictures in Firuzabad, Naqsh-e Rustam and Naqsh-e Rajab; on his picture in Naqsh-e Rustam, Ardashir and Ahura Mazda are opposite to each other on horsebacks and the bodies of Artabanus V and Ahriman are visualized under the nails of Ardashir and Mazda's horses. It can be deduced from the picture that Ardashir believed or wanted others to believe that his reign over the land that is called [...] "Iran" [...] in inscriptions is designated by the Lord. The word [...] "Iran" [...] was previously used in Avesta and as [...] "the name of the mythical Aryan land". In Ardashir's period, the title [...] "Iran" [...] was applied to the geography under Sasanian rule. The thought of [...] "Iran" [...] was accepted by both Zoroastrian and non-Zoroastrian societies in the whole empire and the collective memory of the Iranians has continued and survived until the modern period today in different stages and various layers of the Iranian society. What is clear is that the concept [...] "Iran" [...] has had a religious application too and has later ended in the formation of its political face meaning a collection of lands.|$|E
