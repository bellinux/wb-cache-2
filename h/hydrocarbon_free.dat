Regulations of air quality monitoring programmes in various countries demand high precision measurements for harmful substances often at low trace concentrations. These requirements can only be achieved by using high quality calibration gases including high purity zero gas. For volatile organic compound (VOC) observations, zero gas is defined being <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>free</b> like purified air, nitrogen or helium and is essential for the characterisation of the measurement devices and procedures, for instrument operation as well as for calibrations.

The tested gas purifiers included one adsorption cartridge with an inorganic media and two types of metal catalysts. A large range of VOCs was investigated including the most abundant species typically measured at air monitoring stations. Both catalysts were able to remove a large range of VOCs whilst the tested adsorption cartridge was not suitable to remove light compounds up to C 4.

Excess charge on contacting polyethylene (PE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) follows the triboelectric series but with one caveat: net charge is the arithmetic sum of patterned {{positive and negative}} charges, {{as opposed to the}} usual assumption of uniform but opposite signal charging on each surface. Extraction with n-hexane preferentially removes positive charges from PTFE, while 1, 1 -difluoroethane and ethanol largely remove both positive and negative charges. Using suitable analytical techniques (electron energy-loss spectral imaging, infrared microspectrophotometry and carbonization/colorimetry) and theoretical calculations, the positive species were identified as hydrocarbocations and the negative species were identified as fluorocarbanions. A comprehensive model is presented for PTFE tribocharging with PE: mechanochemical chain homolytic rupture is followed by electron transfer from <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>free</b> radicals to the more electronegative fluorocarbon radicals. Polymer ions self-assemble according to Flory-Huggins theory, thus forming the experimentally observed macroscopic patterns.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that isotope {{analysis}} of atmospheric non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and, in particular, {{the analysis of the}} deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio is valuable because the dominant self-cleansing property of the troposphere is based on the OH radical which removes, e. g., CH and other alkanes by H-atom abstraction, which induces large kinetic isotope effects. The major obstacle in applying D/H isotope analysis to atmospheric NMHCs is not only the low abundance of D itself but, in particular, the low concentrations of NMHCs in the parts per trillion range. We show how a selection of NMHCs can be quantitatively separated from 300 L air samples together with CO as carrier gas matrix, by using high efficiency cryogenic traps. After diluting the extracted NMHC mixtures with <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>free</b> air, and determining the mixing ratios, good agreement with original whole air sample analysis exists for alkanes and several halocarbons. For unsaturated hydrocarbons and some other halocarbons the extraction and recovery yield under the given conditions fell considerably, as a function of boiling point. Furthermore, the mixture of NMHCs in the CO matrix is proven to remain unchanged over several years when conveniently stored in glass ampoules. The 'extracts' or 'concentrates' of condensables extracted from larger air samples will enable the D/H isotope analysis of ultra trace gases in the atmosphere.

40|$|The secular {{equations}} {{corresponding to}} the five canonical structures for benzene and the forty-two for naphthalene, considered as six and ten-electron systems, respectively, are set up and solved with certain simplifying assumptions, leading to energy values differing by 1. 1055 α and 2. 0153 α, respectively, from those corresponding to unexcited (Kekulé-type) structures, α being a single exchange integral involving neighboring carbon atoms. Equating these values to the empirical values of the resonance energy, α {{is found to be}} about — 1. 5 v. e. It is pointed out that the dissociation of certain substituted ethanes into free radicals is due not to weakness of the carbon-carbon bond in the ethane but to the stabilization of the free radicals resulting from resonance among the structures in which the unpaired electron is located on the methyl carbon and those in which it is on other atoms (ortho, para, etc., to the methyl carbon). The secular equations for a number of such radicals have been solved, neglecting excited structures. The experimentally determined heat of formation of hexaphenylethane from triphenylmethyl, 0. 5 v. e., when equated to the calculated value C-C+ 2. 2156 α, with C-C = 3. 65 v. e., leads to α = — 1. 4 v. e. The calculated tendencies towards dissociation are in satisfactory agreement with observation, such features as the smaller dissociating power of β-naphthyl than of α-naphthyl and of biphenylene than of diphenyl being accounted for, so that resonance among the structures considered may be accepted as the principal effect causing the stability of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>free</b> radicals...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{description}} of the Secondary Emission Monitor (SEM) l, various attempts 2 - 4 have been made to fabricate SEM’s which exhibit stability in electron beams with current densities in the range 1 - 40 pA/cm 2. Figure 1 shows the variation of efficiency with transmitted beam (as measured with a toroid monitor) for an SEM made at SLAC by extending the suggestions of the Orsay group. This SEM had 500 i of gold evaporated on each side of its 7 aluminum foils. The ultrahigh vacuum system was ion pumped, and the unit was baked out at 150 - 200 ’ C after assembly. The SEM was physically wobbled in the beam, which reduced changes of calibration with change of beam position to negligible effects. As is readily seen from Fig. 1, the efficiency change is about 20 % for a transmitted charge of about 0. 16 Coulomb with a beam of area about 0. 08 cm 2. As is true of all “clean ” (oil and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>free)</b> SEM’s in our experience, the efficiency increases with transmitted charge. For “dirty ” SEMIS, the efficiency decreases. Gold was chosen for coating the foils because it is a noble metal, generally thought to be very stable. While it is true that gold is stable against oxidation, it nevertheless sorbs CO gas 5, which is a main constituent of the residual gas in ultra-high vacuum systems. From studies on tungsten, sorption of CO is known to increase the work function of the surface. 6 We therefore explain the increase in SEM efficiency for gold by noting that when the electron beam desorbs CO, lowering the surface concentration below equilibrium, the work function will decrease, thus increasing the secondary emission coefficient...|$|E

In this thesis synergistic desalination processes are developed using process synthesis, integration, and techno-economic optimization. ^ Reverse osmosis (RO), accounts for 96 % of desalinated water in the U.

Novel hybrid RO desalination processes involving Ion Exchange (IEX) water softening and heating by direct injection of steam were developed and optimized. The IEX was regenerated with the concentrate from RO, {{eliminating the need for}} external regeneration chemicals. The hybrid processes developed at the scale of 1 – 96 million US gallons per day for concentrated brackish groundwater of southwest USA and for the Colorado River alleviated the problem of mineral scaling and improved the water recovery to as high as 96 %. Annual savings amounting to US$ 15 million were estimated. ^ Produced water is the largest volume byproduct stream in oil and gas production. USA produces about 7 barrel of produced water per barrel of oil. Produced water has an adverse environmental impact due to its complex composition and disposal costs can be as high as US$ 20 /barrel. Critical to water recovery in the RO desalination of produced water is membrane fouling due to hydrocarbons. ^ A novel hybrid Adsorption/IEX/RO process was developed for produced water purification.

40|$|Understanding the {{heterogeneous}} oxidation {{of organic}} particulate matter ("aerosol") {{is an active}} area of current research in atmospheric and combustion chemistry. The chemical evolution of organic aerosol is complex and dynamic since it can undergo multiple oxidation reactions with gas phase oxidants to form a mixture of different generations of oxidation products that control the average aerosol mass and volatility. In many of these systems, <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>free</b> radicals, formed by reaction with gas phase oxidants, play key roles as initiators, propagators and terminators of surface reactions. This dissertation presents a detailed study of the reaction kinetics and mechanisms of the heterogeneous oxidation of unsaturated organic aerosol, and aims to provide new molecular and mechanistic insights into the reaction pathways in heterogeneous organic aerosol oxidation. The heterogeneous oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid C 18 H 34 O 2, linoleic acid C 18 H 32 O 2 and linolenic acid C 18 H 30 O 2) aerosol by hydroxyl (OH) radicals is first studied in Chapter 2 to explore how surface OH addition reactions initiate chain reactions that rapidly transform the chemical composition of unsaturated organic aerosol. Oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid have the same linear C 18 carbon backbone structure with one, two and three C=C double bonds, respectively. By studying carboxylic acids with different numbers of C=C double bonds, the role that multiple reactive sites plays in controlling reaction rates can be observed. The kinetic parameter of interest in these studies is the effective uptake coefficient, defined {{as the number of}} particle phase unsaturated fatty acid molecules reacted per OH-particle collision. The effective uptake coefficients for the unsaturated fatty acids are larger than unity, providing clear evidence for particle-phase secondary chain chemistry. The effective uptake coefficients for the unsaturated fatty acids decrease with increasing O 2 concentration, indicating that O 2 promotes chain termination in the unsaturated fatty acid reactions. The kinetics and products of squalene (a C 30 branched alkene with 6 C=C double bonds) oxidation are compared to that of the unsaturated fatty acids in Chapters 3 and 4 to understand how molecular structure and chemical functionality influence reaction rates and mechanisms. The squalene effective uptake coefficient, which is also larger than one, is smaller than that of linoleic acid and linolenic acid despite the larger number of C=C double bonds in squalene. In contrast to the unsaturated fatty acids, the squalene effective uptake coefficient increases with O 2 concentration, indicating that O 2 promotes chain propagation in the squalene reaction. Elemental and product analysis of squalene aerosol shows that O 2 promotes particle volatilization in the squalene reaction, suggesting that fragmentation reactions are important when O 2 is present in the OH oxidation of branched unsaturated organic aerosol. In contrast, elemental and product analysis of linoleic acid aerosol shows that O 2 does not influence the rate of particle volatilization in the linoleic acid reaction, suggesting that O 2 does not alter the relative importance of fragmentation reactions in the OH oxidation of linear unsaturated organic aerosol. Lastly, depending on the aerosol phase (e. g. solid and semi-solid) and the timescale for homogeneous mixing within the aerosol particle, the chemical composition may vary spatially within an aerosol particle. This necessitates the need for new techniques to characterize the interfacial chemical composition of aerosol particles. In the last portion of the dissertation, direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) is used to analyze the surface chemical composition of nanometer-sized organic aerosol particles in real time at atmospheric pressure. By introducing a stream of aerosol particles in between the DART ionization source and the atmospheric pressure inlet of the mass spectrometer, the aerosol particles are exposed to a thermal flow of helium or nitrogen gas containing some fraction of metastable helium atoms or nitrogen molecules. In this configuration, the molecular constituents of organic aerosol particles are desorbed, ionized and detected with reduced molecular ion fragmentation, allowing for compositional identification. The reaction of ozone with sub-micron oleic acid particles is also measured to demonstrate the ability of DART-MS to identify products and quantify reaction rates in a heterogeneous reaction...|$|E
40|$|MastersThe {{sensitivity}} of Prednisolone to gamma radiation in aqueous and organic solutions has been investigated. The degradation kinetics study showed an initial zero-order followed by complex reactions illustrated graphically as an overall first order kinetic. The {{study revealed that}} the drug is significantly more sensitive to gamma radiation in aqueous solutions than organic solvents, which {{could be attributed to}} the highly reactive radiolytic products of water, namely; hydroxyl radicals (. OH), hydrogen atoms (. H) and hydrated electrons (. aq.) compared to that produced by the organic solvents. The structure activity relationship of the organic solvents (Ethanol, n-Propanol, iso-Propanol, n-Butanol, iso-Butanol, Tertiary Butanol, 1, 3 Propane-diol, Propylene Glycol and Glycerin), and drug sensitivity to radiation have been studied. Although the difference was not significant, the alkyl chain length and branching increased the reactivity of the solvent to radiation. Moreover, the number and 2 position of hydroxyl groups in the solvent structure have significantly increased its sensitivity to radiation which has been manifested as increased drug degradation. Using iso-propanol and tertiary butanol as free radical scavengers added to aqueous solution in different concentrations has shown variable protective effects for the drug against radiation. The role of different types of surfactants (Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Tween 80 and Benzalkonium Chloride) in drug protection against radiation in aqueous solutions suggested two different mechanisms. The first is the scavenging effect of the surfactant monomers below its CMC. Above CMC, a second mechanism may be involved, where the drug is expected to be located inside the formed micelles to different extents according to its affinity to the surfactant leading to more stabilization of the drug. The protective effect of surfactants was found to be in the order : Sodium Lauryl Sulphate > Tween 80. Benzalkonium Chloride. The effect of different types of gel forming polymers on drug sensitivity to gamma radiation was investigated. At low concentration of the polymers (1 %w/w), irradiation resulted in scission of their molecular structure, leading to production of fractionated species which compete with the drug for interaction with the radiolytic products of water. The net result was the indirect slight protection of the drug. At higher polymer concentration (gel forming concentration), the drug degradation by radiation was nearly the same as in 1 % polymer solutions. Moreover, the gel viscosity was considerably decreased by radiation to nearly fluid state in cases of Methyl Cellulose, and Hydroxpropyl Methylcellulose, while increased in cases of Polyvinyl Alcohol and Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone, which is due to the differences in chemical structures of polymers and their ability to cross-linking by radiation. It was also evident that the intermolecular cross-linking, which is responsible for the increasing viscosity in cases of PVA and PVP, was not sufficient to protect the drug from radiation. The polymers were cross-linked by exposing the polymer powder to different doses of radiation and were used to prepare gels containing a constant concentration of the drug. The degree of cross-linking (cross-linking ratio) was followed up through the measurement of gel viscosity. The drug stability was determined in different cross-linked polymers and {{it was found that the}} residual drug concentration was about 41 - 49 %, of the initial concentration, after exposure to 20 kGys of radiation. Polymer concentration is a critical factor in determining the extent of cross-linking by radiation. Therefore, different polymer concentrations were irradiated with 20 kGy (a sufficient radiation dose for maximum cross-linking of polymer powders) and the viscosities of the gels were measured before and after irradiation. The results showed that the maximum 3 polymer concentration producing the highest cross-linking ratio, while maintaining the gel consistency, was found to be 5 %, 4 %, 2 % and 2 % for MC, HPMC, PVA and PVP respectively. Above such concentrations, the gel was changed to a rigid mass. It was expected that the addition of a high concentration of Tween 80 to gels, would have two functions: The first is the interference with the cross-linking process by formation of hydrogen bonding at the sites of cross-linking, with the OH groups of the surfactant, leading to the capability to incorporate a higher amount of the polymer in the gel before reaching the maximum cross-linking (formation of a rigid mass). Secondly, the presence of Tween 80 in a high concentration would be expected to afford further protection to the drug by micellar inclusion. The results revealed that up to 8 %w/w of MC or HPMC and 5 %w/w of PVA or PVP could be incorporated in the gels containing 35 %w/w of Tween 80. Accordingly, a significant protective effect was achieved by the four types of polymers. However the highest protective effect was afforded by HPMC (95 %). This could be attributed to the high cross-linking ratio of HPMC compared to that of MC which afforded 90 % protection (due to the extra OH group in HPMC). On the other hand, the glycoside ring and the larger number of carbon atoms in HPMC, make the cross-linked units of HPMC more hydrophobic than PVA (93 %) and PVP. This would also explain the lower protective effect of PVP (only 62 %) which could be due to the hydrophilic nature of the cross-linked units compared to those of MC and HPMC. It can be concluded that the protective effect of the cross-linked polymers was determined by the net result of three factors: The first is the crosslinking ratio; the second is concentration of the polymer in the gel and third is the hydrophobicity of the matrix. Addition of 5 %w/w of iso-propanol had no significant effect on the protective effect of all the polymers (P > 0. 05) except that of PVP which was slightly improved. This could be attributed to an additional scavenging effect of iso-propanol. It is obvious that the protection of the drug against radiation necessitates its presence in a hydrophobic medium such as the core of micelles and/or imbedded into a highly crosslinked polymer structure. The incorporation of the drug into a Microemulsion (ME), where the oil content as well as the high concentration of surfactant would offer the required hydrophobic medium for drug protection against radiation. Therefore the ME would be expected to be an alternative design for drug protection. The ME was constructed to contain the highest amount of water so that when applied into the aqueous medium of the eye, in situ gelling will occur. This formulation will combine both the simplicity of handling and dosing ME as eye drops, in 4 which the drug is solubilized, and the continuous and prolonged drug effect due to the in situ gelling. This would be expected to be superior to the marketed 1 % ophthalmic suspension which may suffer from complicated preparation, physical stability and ocular irritation. The formulated ME showed excellent protection for Prednisolone against gamma radiation. This was evidenced by the absence of any change in the residual concentration of the drug even after exposure to 20 kGy of radiation. This protection could be explained on the basis that the drug is dissolved in a water free inverse micellar system, in addition to its partial solubility in the oily phase. This preferential distribution was supported by the poor solubility of the drug in water and low water content of the tested microemulsion system. The free radiolytic product of water would not be expected to penetrate the water oil interface. A slight reduction in the viscosity values was observed as a result of irradiation of the ME. This trend could be attributed to a little change in the alignment of the bilayer ME system due to a partial disruption of micellar structure at O/W interface or fragmentation of very small percent of paraffin oil by radiation. However, these minor changes did not affect the physical characteristics of ME system. A complete protection of the drug was afforded in petrolatum ointment base against radiation. This would be expected due the complete anhydrous environment either in paraffin oil or in petrolatum base. Consequently, no radiolytic free radicals would be produced. The only probable free radicals which could be produced are the long chain <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>free</b> radicals through hydrogen atom abstraction, which are very weak to attack the drug. In addition, the drug is mainly suspended as solid particles (stable to radiation) in paraffin oil or petrolatum base. The viscosity of paraffin oil and petrolatum containing 0. 4 %w/w Prednisolone did not change by irradiation, which again confirm the absence of probability of any significant interaction between the paraffin oil or petrolatum base and gamma radiation. Therefore, Prednisolone can be safely sterilized by gamma radiation in both in situ gelling microemulsion and petrolatum ointment...|$|E

The measured parameters were used to calculate standard geochemical proxies such as hydrogen index (HI), oxygen index (OI) and production index (PI) based on the literature (e.g. Espitalié et al. 1977; Tissot et al. 1980, 1987; Peters and Cassa 1994).|$|R
40|$|The low {{phytic acid}} (lpa) rice (Os-lpa-XS 110 - 1, Os-lpa-XS 110 - 2) and soybean (Gm-lpa-TW- 75 - 1, Gm-lpa-ZC- 2) mutants {{generated}} by γ-irradiation were studied, aimed at comparing these mutants to the corresponding wild-types {{by means of}} metabolite profiling based on capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The usefulness of this approach {{to assist in the}} elucidation of the types of mutation result-ing in reduced contents of phytic acid should be explored. Metabolite profiling aspires to provide a comprehensive picture of the metabolites present in biological systems. It aims at extracting, detecting, identifying, and quantifying a broad spectrum of compounds in a single sample, to provide a deeper insight into complex biological systems. The extrac-tion and fractionation method used allowed a comprehensive coverage of a broad spectrum of low molecular weight metabolites ranging from lipophilic (fatty acids methyl esters, <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>free</b> fatty acids, ste-rols, tocopherols) to hydrophilic (sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, amino acids) compounds. For rice, considerable amounts of the peaks detected were statistically significantly different between wild-types and lpa mutants grown in the same field trial. However, only a few of these differences could be consistently observed in all analyzed field trials, indicating a strong influence of the biological variability. Metabolites consistently shown to be significantly different between wild-type and lpa rice mutants, were found to be closely related to the biogenetic path-ways leading to phytic acid. This allowed a prediction of the mutation targets for the lpa rice mutants in the biosynthetic pathway of phytic acid. Similar effects, i. e. statistically significantly different levels of metabolites closely related to the biosynthesis of phytic acid, were con-sistently observed for soybean...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The triatomine bugs are vectors of the {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative {{agent of}} Chagas disease. Aggregation behavior {{plays an important}} role in their survival by facilitating the location of refuges and cohesion of aggregates, helping to keep them safely assembled into shelters during daylight time, when they are vulnerable to predators. There are evidences that aggregation is mediated by thigmotaxis, by volatile cues from their faeces, and by hexane-extractable contact chemoreceptive signals from their cuticle surface. The epicuticular lipids of Triatoma infestans include a complex mixture of <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>free</b> and esterified fatty acids, alcohols, and sterols. Results We analyzed the response of T. infestans fifth instar nymphs after exposure to different amounts either of total epicuticular lipid extracts or individual lipid fractions. Assays were performed in a circular arena, employing a binary choice test with filter papers acting as aggregation attractive sites; papers were either impregnated with a hexane-extract of the total lipids, or lipid fraction; or with the solvent. Insects were significantly aggregated around papers impregnated with the epicuticular lipid extracts. Among the lipid fractions separately tested, only the free fatty acid fraction promoted significant bug aggregation. We also investigated the response to different amounts of selected fatty acid components of this fraction; receptiveness varied with the fatty acid chain length. No response was elicited by hexadecanoic acid (C 16 : 0), the major fatty acid component. Octadecanoic acid (C 18 : 0) showed a significant assembling effect in the concentration range tested (0. 1 to 2 insect equivalents). The very long chain hexacosanoic acid (C 26 : 0) was significantly attractant at low doses (≤ 1 equivalent), although a repellent effect was observed at higher doses. Conclusion The detection of contact aggregation pheromones has practical application in Chagas disease vector control. These data may be used to help design new tools against triatomine bugs. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{substitution}} of CFC 113 in textile drycleaning {{can only be}} effected within restricted guidelines, as the internationally stipulated care labels for delicate textiles are suited to CFC 113 and white spirit. The substitute must to the greatest possible extent have similar effects on textiles as CFC 113. This is why {{in the short term}} only hydrocarbons remained as possible substitutes. In order to fulfil the German regulations for the use of hydrocarbons as well as environmental regulations, new kinds of hydrocarbon solvents were developped. In extensive experimental tests using customary textiles, 8 different solvents at 4 varying solvent temperatures, the fundamental suitability of hydrocarbons was checked. It was found out that hydrocarbons with a flash point over 55 C can be taken as a substitute for CFC 113. Cleaning effect, behaviour during distillation, hygiene and safety aspects in long term use were researched and improved mainly in practical operation. In some criteria concerning use and effects of hydrocarbons there are still some differences in favour of CFC 113. However, the elimination of these characteristics has already been initiated within the framework of this research project. Regarding the cleaning of textiles and leather, the research has shown that CFC 113 can be substituted by <b>hydrocarbons</b> <b>free</b> of aromatic compounds and with a flashpoint between 55 C and 61 C. It is thus possible to emit approx. 3000 tons per annum less CFC 113. The simultaneous transfer of the research results to the drycleaning industry lead to the installation of 300 hydrocarbon machines in German drycleaning shops. (orig.)

40|$|Sodium is a {{metallic}} element with the symbol Na, {{in the same}} group with Li, K, Rb, Cs; is widespread in nature {{in the form of}} salts (nitrates, carbonates, chlorides), atomic number 11 and atomic weight 22, 9898. It,s a soft metal, reactive and with a low melting point, with a relative density of 0, 97 at 200 C (680 F). From the commercial point of view, sodium is the most important of all the alkaline metals. Elemental sodium was first isolated by Humpry Davy in 1807 by passing an electric current through molten sodium hydroxide. Elemental sodium does not occur naturally on earth, because it quickly oxidizes in air and is violently reactive with water, so it must be stored in a non-oxidizing medium, such as liquid <b>hydrocarbon.</b> The <b>free</b> metal is used for some chemical synthesis, analysis, and heat transfer applications...|$|R

30|$|Lubricant oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{beneficial}} components in modern technology that can be used to prevent friction in various industries and machinery [1]. Besides synthetic oils, vegetable oils, particularly palm oil, are becoming an important alternative to mineral oils due to their economical feasibility, low toxicity, renewability, high biodegradability, low volatility, ideal cleanliness, and satisfactory lubricating performance [2]. Nevertheless, low resistance to oxidative degradation and poor low temperature properties are major issues for palm oils to be used as lubricant [3]. The formation of oxidation products in palm oil, such as hydroperoxides, carbonyl compounds, high-molecular-weight polymeric <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and <b>free</b> fatty acids, is undesirable due to their potential in deteriorating the lubricating properties of the oils. Furthermore, polymerization and cyclization at high temperature lead to the formation of sludge and soot which can cause an increase in oil viscosity. These side reactions, therefore, shorten the service lifetime of lubricant oils.|$|R

One sample set consists of 300 mudstone samples from different sedimentary facies. This sample set is pulverized to 80 meshes in preparation for Rock-Eval pyrolysis, total organic carbon content (TOC). A Rock-Eval instrument is used to perform the pyrolysis analysis, which provides the parameters of T max, S 1, and S 2. The temperature was set as 300  °C for 3  min and then heating at 25  °C/min to 650  °C (Ding et al. 2015). T max is the temperature which corresponds to the maximum generation rate of hydrocarbons from kerogen cracking. S 1 and S 2 represent the amount of <b>hydrocarbon</b> of <b>free</b> and generated <b>hydrocarbons,</b> respectively. The TOC of the source rocks is measured using a LECO CS- 230 analyzer.|$|R
