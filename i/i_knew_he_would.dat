2500|$|In January 1969, after Bill Mallory {{was hired}} as the head {{football}} coach at Miami, Burton {{was hired as}} an assistant coach at Miami. [...] Mallory and Burton had been teammates at Miami. [...] Mallory later recalled: [...] "I'd known [...] back when we were students. [...] I always had great respect for him. He was a darn good coach. I knew he'd be the kind of person I would want on my staff. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be a good teacher of the game." [...] Burton became the first African-American coach in any capacity at Miami.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2005, {{representatives of}} Juventus met with Arsenal {{with a view}} to signing Vieira. The player, {{according}} to The Guardian, accepted that Arsenal were [...] "ready to let him go" [...] before agreeing in principle to join Juventus. On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth £13.75 million. In a later interview with the Daily Mail, Wenger explained the departure of Vieira was to serve Cesc Fàbregas' career: [...] "When Cesc Fàbregas was 18, 19, I would play him in a 4–4–2 with Patrick Vieira and I saw it did not work. Then I had the decision to make about letting Patrick go, because Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fàbregas and Silva worked, but I could not play Fàbregas and Vieira. But Fàbregas was 19 and if he did not play <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> want to go, so we risked destroying everything, all the work we had put into this player." ...|$|E

60|$|Having {{been in the}} house, I {{could well}} believe him, but if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> think have raised his terms.|$|R
6000|$|Field-Marshal Lord Wolseley writes:—“It is {{just the}} sort of book I would [...] give to any school-boy, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> enjoy every page of it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would go," [...] {{said the}} rector's wife, [...] "only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> require me {{to agree with}} him about Harry. That, of course, I cannot do." ...|$|R
60|$|I stole back, {{leaving the}} sick lady still peacefully asleep, {{to give the}} {{gardener}} instructions about bringing the doctor. I begged the man, after he had taken Mrs. Rubelle to the station, to drive round by Mr. Dawson's, and leave a message in my name, asking him to call and see me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come on my account, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> remain when he found Count Fosco had left the house.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be surprised. He {{withdrew his}} hand, and manlike, was almost angry. [...] "I forgot. You will leave here, I suppose!" ...|$|E
60|$|In five minutes-- or ten at the most-- <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be back. After {{that there}} was no telling how long he would stay.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot do that," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "it is his; I {{have some}} of my own. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> gladly {{give it to me}} if he were conscious; but I cannot take it now." ...|$|R
5000|$|While in New York, she {{was married}} to Jerry Bruckheimer who [...] "decided {{he wanted to be a}} producer," [...] she said. [...] "Little did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be the most {{successful}} producer of all time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I have {{expressed}} myself too strongly. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wish {{to take back}} the criminal; but I scarce think that he meditates more than persuasion. Ducie is a fine fellow, and every way a gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And tell us more, Harry," [...] said Ethel. [...] "Oh! it is famous! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come {{light at}} last. It is too delightful, if papa was but here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never have written in that way, in answer to my letter, {{ignoring}} your visit here altogether, unless he had written to you also." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was {{spoken with}} an impatience which left the child nothing to reply; whereupon she sought her defence in a {{completely}} different relation to the fact. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But at a {{time like}} this," [...] Morrison pleaded passionately. [...] "Every one does it sometimes. He'd be glad to help you. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> Have you ever thought what it will be like, Laverick, to be hammered?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to take Dan, mother, {{if you have no}} objection. He is very strong and active, and I think would {{generally}} be able to keep up with us; besides, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> always stick to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if you'd please {{not to say}} as I've been {{to speak}} to you, for my son 'ud be very angry with me for demeaning myself, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> and I've trouble enough without being scolded by my children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He read, {{and it was}} wondrous bad, and {{he paused}} at all the {{specially}} turgid sentences, expecting a little approval; for {{he was proud of}} those sentences, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor dear little fellow!' said Aunt Jane; 'yes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be good, but Kunz {{would be}} horribly, jealous, you see; {{he is an}} only dog, and can't bear to have his {{premises}} invaded.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who knows?" [...] said Father Herman. [...] "There is {{much that}} is dark; but one felt that his spirit reached out after hers. Well, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come back; I have long {{expected}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My sister's {{interest}} {{may account}} for my being anxious to learn something of Sir Philip Forester's motions; about which, otherwise, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not wish me to concern myself. I have a brother's safety too to be anxious for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{go to her}} {{as soon as he}} {{will let}} me. I don't think he will forbid my going to her, perhaps, after a day or two; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not let me go on purpose to meet her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] said Fanny, a {{shade of}} a smile playing on her lip. [...] "It is whether to send it {{through one of the}} {{officers}} or not. If Captain Lee is with the regiment, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take care of it for her." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hurried to}} get ready, I {{ran through the}} rain. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take it badly that it rained on his Evening of Honour. He counted himself {{a man who had}} fate against him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} deal, Larry, but not enough;--not {{enough to}} bring {{together}} {{a man and woman}} as husband and wife. I would sooner marry a man I loved, though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ill-use me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was it proper or {{improper}} when Mr. Belton made {{an offer}} to you,--as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do, of course; as I told you that he would? Was that so improper {{that it could not}} be told?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] added Eleonora, [...] "Camilla {{has made}} me {{understand}} that nothing will induce her to let papa consent; and though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> if <b>he</b> were left to himself, I also see how all this family must hate and loathe the connection." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the ‘New Country,’ Lum {{had this}} to say. [...] "I think if Hank was still alive today, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be doing the same}} thing that he was doing back then. He loved his country music and the country style. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not like this so called modern country music period." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{difference}} as to pity I suspect was a logomachy of my making. No pitiful acts {{on his part}} <b>would</b> surprise me; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be more pitiful in practice {{than most of the}} whiners; but the spirit of that practice would still seem to be unjustly described by the word pity.|$|R
6000|$|At last I got away. I had telegraphed to Jack: [...] "Am {{coming home}} Wednesday; {{meet me at}} train," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be there. How I longed to see him again--dear, old, badly treated Jack.|$|E
60|$|I {{had filled}} up the bottle from the tar-water jug. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium {{of the present}} day, by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Read me what you've done," [...] I said. He read, {{and it was}} wondrous bad and {{he paused}} at all the {{specially}} turgid sentences, expecting a little approval; for {{he was proud of}} those sentences, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{women of}} the Siouxes and of the white men are not of the same wigwam," [...] he {{answered}} evasively. [...] "Would a Teton warrior make his wife greater than himself? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not; and yet my ears have heard that there are lands where the councils are held by squaws." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Dear, dear me,' I kept on saying {{under my}} breath, 'he {{is doing it}} all wrong. A downright unmitigated villain would never go on like that; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do so and so, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look like this, and speak like that, and act like the other. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> My {{instinct}} tells me so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Our {{difference}} as to pity I suspect was a logomachy of my making.
