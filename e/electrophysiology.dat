5|$|With {{technological}} {{advances in the}} late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and <b>electrophysiology</b> to study language processing in individuals without impairments.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{developing}} neurons reach {{the core of}} the olfactory bulb, they detach from the RMS, which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli, this migration is dependent on tenascin-R, and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons. These neurons have been studied in vivo via <b>electrophysiology</b> and confocal imaging.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparative}} {{simplicity and}} regularity of the cerebellar anatomy {{led to an}} early hope that it might imply a similar simplicity of computational function, as expressed {{in one of the}} first books on cerebellar <b>electrophysiology,</b> The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine by John C. Eccles, Masao Ito, and János Szentágothai. Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles have been identified as important: (1) feedforward processing, (2) divergence and convergence, (3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. <b>Electrophysiology</b> is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{study of}} the {{electrical}} conduction system of the heart is called cardiac <b>electrophysiology</b> (EP).|$|E
25|$|An <b>electrophysiology</b> study {{involves}} a formal {{study of the}} conduction system and can be done for various reasons.|$|E
25|$|One {{additional}} form of electrocardiography is used {{in clinical}} cardiac <b>electrophysiology</b> in which a catheter is {{used to measure the}} electrical activity.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} ion {{channels}} often involves biophysics, <b>electrophysiology,</b> and pharmacology, while using techniques including voltage clamp, patch clamp, immunohistochemistry, X-ray crystallography, fluoroscopy, and RT-PCR. Their classification as molecules {{is referred to}} as channelomics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrophysiology</b> : The use of {{electrophysiological}} measures {{designed to}} measure the activation of the brain by measuring the electrical or magnetic field produced by the nervous system. This may include electroencephalography (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG).|$|E

25|$|So-called 'acute onset atrial fibrillation', {{defined by}} the North American Society of Pacing and <b>Electrophysiology</b> (NASPE) in 2003, {{responds}} well to short duration treatment with amiodarone. This has been demonstrated in seventeen randomized controlled trials, of which five included a placebo arm. The incidence of severe side effects in this group is low.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, CR {{cells in}} the {{marginal}} zone {{were found to have}} electrophysiological fingerprints. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies (the laboratory technique in <b>electrophysiology</b> allowing the study of single or multiple ion channels in cells) showed that CRN injected by a suprathreshold depolarizing current pulse express a repetitive firing mode and cells injected by a hyperpolarizing current pulse, express a hyperpolarization-activated inward current (H-current).|$|E
25|$|The patch clamp {{technique}} is a laboratory technique in <b>electrophysiology</b> {{used to study}} ionic currents in individual living cells, tissue sections, or patches of cell membrane. The {{technique is}} especially useful {{in the study of}} excitable cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, muscle fibers, and pancreatic beta cells, and can also be applied to the study of bacterial ion channels in specially prepared giant spheroplasts.|$|E
25|$|Studies using <b>electrophysiology</b> and radioactive-labeled {{dopamine}} {{have confirmed}} that the dopamine transporter is similar to other monoamine transporters in that one molecule of neurotransmitter can be transported across the membrane {{with one or two}} sodium ions. Chloride ions are also needed to prevent a buildup of positive charge. These studies have also shown that transport rate and direction is totally dependent on the sodium gradient.|$|E
25|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{multilingualism}} {{have been studied}} {{in the field of}} neurology. These include the representation of different language systems in the brain, the effects of multilingualism on the brain's structural plasticity, aphasia in multilingual individuals, and bimodal bilinguals (people who can speak one sign language and one oral language). Neurological studies of multilingualism are carried out with functional neuroimaging, <b>electrophysiology,</b> and through observation of people who have suffered brain damage.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{electricity}} in cosmetics {{goes back to}} the end of the 19th century, almost a hundred years after Luigi Galvani discovered that electricity can make the muscle in a frog's leg twitch (see galvanism). Subsequent research in <b>electrophysiology</b> has been carried out by people such as Robert O. Becker, Dr Björn Nordenström, a former chair of the Nobel Selection Committee for Medicine, and Dr Thomas Wing, who invented some of the first micro-current devices.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{stratification}} is best performed via programmed {{electrical stimulation}} (PES) in the cardiac <b>electrophysiology</b> laboratory. This is an invasive but generally low-risk procedure {{during which the}} atria are stimulated to try to induce tachycardia. If a tachycardia involving the accessory pathway can be triggered, the cardiologist can then assess how rapidly the accessory pathway is able to conduct. The faster it can conduct, the higher the likelihood the accessory pathway can conduct fast enough to trigger a lethal tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Kinesiology is the {{scientific}} study of human or non-human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, biomechanical, and psychological mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health (i.e., human kinesiology) include biomechanics and orthopedics; strength and conditioning; sport psychology; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, <b>electrophysiology</b> of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.|$|E
25|$|Loose patch clamp is {{different}} from the other techniques discussed here in that it employs a loose seal (low electrical resistance) rather than the tight gigaseal used in the conventional technique. This technique was used as early as the year 1961, as described in a paper by Strickholm on the impedance of a muscle cell's surface, but received little attention until being brought up again and given a name by Almers, Stanfield, and Stühmer in 1982, after patch clamp had been established as a major tool of <b>electrophysiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Exercise {{can cause}} a release of {{potassium}} into bloodstream by {{increasing the number of}} potassium channels in the cell membrane. The degree of potassium elevation varies with the degree of exercise, which range from 0.3 meq/L in light exercise to 2 meq/L in heavy exercise, with or without accompanying ECG changes or lactic acidosis. However, peak potassium levels can be reduced by prior physical conditioning and potassium levels are usually reversed several minutes after exercise. High levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline have a protective effect on the cardiac <b>electrophysiology</b> because they bind to beta 2 adrenergic receptors, which, when activated, extracellularly decrease potassium concentration.|$|E
25|$|Following graduation, Akil {{continued}} at the American University of Beirut with a teaching apprenticeship {{for a year}} before traveling to the United States to pursue further education at the University of Iowa. At the University of Iowa she took a course on the basics of neuroscience and pharmacology and was quite intrigued, which led her to complete a rotation in the <b>electrophysiology</b> lab where she did research on learning with Steve Fox. Akil was soon accepted to the University of California Los Angeles to pursue her doctoral degree. At UCLA she worked with John Liebeskind on pain research and after completing her Ph.D. she joined the laboratory of Dr. Jack Barchas at Stanford University.|$|E
25|$|As with sodium channels, the {{potassium}} channels {{have their}} own toxins that block channel protein action. An {{example of such a}} toxin is the large cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), but it is notable that the toxin does not have the same mechanism of action on all potassium channels, given the variety of channel types across species. The presence of potassium channels was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster mutant flies that shook uncontrollably upon anesthesia due to problems in cellular repolarization that led to abnormal neuron and muscle <b>electrophysiology.</b> Potassium channels were first identified by manipulating molecular genetics (of the flies) instead of performing channel protein purification because there were no known high-affinity ligands for potassium channels (such as TEA) at the time of discovery.|$|E
25|$|Neurolinguistics is {{the study}} of the {{structures}} in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, <b>electrophysiology,</b> and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.|$|E
25|$|Akil is a Gardner C. Quarton Distinguished Professor of Neurosciences in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical School. In addition, {{she serves}} as {{co-director of the}} Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience {{institute}} and the University of Michigan node of the Pritzker Neuropsychiatric Disorders Research Consortium with her husband, Stanley Watson. Akil {{is also one of}} seven leading scientists that comprise the Hope For Depression Research Task Force, who together have developed an exceptional research plan that combines the most advanced knowledge in genetics, epigenetics, molecular biology, <b>electrophysiology,</b> and brain imaging in an effort to accelerate cutting-edge scientific research pertaining to depression and its related mood and emotional disorders. Throughout her career, she has been honored with numerous awards and membership to various societies, most notably she served as a past President of the Society for Neuroscience, the largest neuroscience organization in the world.|$|E
25|$|At the {{cognitive}} level, cognitive neuroscience addresses {{the questions of}} how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry. The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, PET, SPECT), <b>electrophysiology,</b> and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates. Although many studies still hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena, recent research shows {{that there is an}} interesting interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research, soliciting and integrating both perspectives. For example, the neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interesting interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy, psychology and psychopathology. Moreover, the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past, supporting a view of memory as a generative, constructive and dynamic process.|$|E
500|$|Neurolinguistics is {{the study}} of the neural {{mechanisms}} in the human brain that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language. As an interdisciplinary field, neurolinguistics draws methods and theories from fields such as neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive science, neurobiology, communication disorders, neuropsychology, and computer science. [...] Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language.

2500|$|The serum {{potassium}} concentration {{at which}} electrocardiographic changes develop is somewhat variable. [...] Although the factors influencing {{the effect of}} serum potassium levels on cardiac <b>electrophysiology</b> are not entirely understood, the concentrations of other electrolytes, as well as levels of catecholamines, play a major role.|$|E
2500|$|Nakanishi's {{research}} has largely {{focused on the}} molecular science behind glutamate receptors. Using <b>electrophysiology</b> and the Xenopus oocyte expression system, Nakanishi's team was able to isolate receptors and ion channels. The team {{was the first to}} characterize the molecular structure of NMDA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The research suggested that specific types of receptors had varying functions {{in different parts of the}} brain.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{reentrant}} {{nature of}} atrial flutter, {{it is often}} possible to ablate the circuit that causes atrial flutter with radiofrequency catheter ablation. [...] This {{is done in the}} <b>electrophysiology</b> lab by causing a ridge of scar tissue in the isthmus that crosses the path of the circuit that causes atrial flutter. Eliminating conduction through the isthmus prevents reentry, and if successful, prevents the recurrence of the atrial flutter.|$|E
