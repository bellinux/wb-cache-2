5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen {{of the big}} screen. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill.|$|E
5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen.

5|$|When both UIRP (particularly in its {{approximation}} form) and {{purchasing power}} parity (PPP) hold, the two parity conditions together reveal a relationship among expected real interest rates, wherein changes in expected real interest rates reflect expected changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> exchange rate. This condition {{is known as}} real interest rate parity (RIRP) and {{is related to the}} international Fisher effect. The following equations demonstrate how to derive the RIRP equation.|$|E

5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes {{that this is not}} her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by the image of her step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E
5|$|Aval Appadithan {{is one of}} {{only two}} films ever {{directed}} by Rudhraiya; the other was Gramathu Athiyayam (1980). Aval Appadithan was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English. The dialogues were sharp and were considered almost vulgar. It also broke the style of filmmaking followed up until that time. It was the first film made by a graduate from the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute, facilitating Indian film technology students to achieve success in the film industry. Sripriya included it in her list of favourite films she had worked in. Rudhraiya's daughter, Ganga, noted that Aval Appadithan help her face life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world.|$|E

Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down the mausoleum, they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control minds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the mausoleum and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid {{to gain access to}} the mausoleum. Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world {{represent}} character {{actions in}} an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation {{are used to}} bridge differences between {{the real world and}} the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E
