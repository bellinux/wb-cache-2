40|$|US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District (CENWP) {{operates}} the Bonneville Lock and Dam Project on the Columbia River. High spill flows {{that occurred during}} 2011 moved a large volume of rock from <b>downstream</b> of the <b>spillway</b> <b>apron</b> to the stilling basin and apron. Although 400 cubic yards of rocks {{were removed from the}} stilling basin, there are still large volumes of rock downstream of the apron that could, under certain flow conditions, move upstream into the stilling basin. CENWP is investigating operational changes that could be implemented to minimize future movement of rock into the stilling basin. A key analysis tool to develop these operational changes is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the spillway. A free-surface CFD model of the Bonneville spillway tailrace was developed and applied for four flow scenarios. These scenarios looked at the impact of flow volume and flow distribution on tailrace hydraulics. The simulation results showed that areas of upstream flow existed near the river bed downstream of the apron, on the apron, and within the stilling basin for all flows. For spill flows of 300 kcfs, the cross-stream and downstream extent of the recirculation zones along Cascade and Bradford Island was very dependent on the spill pattern. The center-loaded pattern had much larger recirculation zones than the flat or bi-modal pattern. The lower flow (200 kcfs) with a flat pattern had a very large recirculation zone that extended half way across the channel near the river bed. A single flow scenario (300 kcfs of flow in a relatively flat spill pattern) was further interrogated using Lagrangian particle tracking. The tracked particles (with size and mass) showed the upstream movement of sediments onto the concrete apron and against the vertical wall between the apron and the stilling basin from seed locations downstream of the apron and on the apron...|$|R

Attraction flow from this fishway entrance is provided to enhance fish passage, but flow over the spillway from the surface bypass weir and adjacent gate at the dam crest interferes with fish finding this entrance. This paper will discuss how computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to explore various options to modify the fishway entrance geometry and to effectively dissipate the energy of high velocity flows leaving the <b>spillway</b> <b>apron</b> near the fishway entrance. In particular, three options to improve fishway entrance flow conditions will be presented, including removal of the present entrance deflector wall, use of a fish-friendly turbine discharge, and adding a plunge pool in the <b>spillway</b> <b>apron.</b> For each option, the results of CFD simulations will be presented with {{an evaluation of the}} probable impact of flow patterns on upstream fish passage...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, large gully control {{programmes}} have been established in Ethiopia. Based on detailed observations and measurements of 400 check dams in the highlands near Hagere Selam (Tigray, northern Ethiopian Highlands), {{the effectiveness of the}} check dam technique was assessed. In this study, catchment area, slope gradient, technical characteristics and the presence of smectite clays are the main factors controlling dam stability. Simple and logistic regression techniques were used to analyse the data. The frequent collapse of dams (39 % after two years) is strongly associated with drainage area (A) and slope gradient of the soil surface near the gully (S), the product of these factors (S X A) being a proxy for runoff energy. Good functioning dams have a <b>spillway,</b> <b>apron,</b> concave plan form (when looking downslope) and are built at vertical intervals and with heights that result in a negative slope gradient of the line connecting the spillway and the foot of the upstream dam. Therefore, a reverse slope of this line is recommended. Furthermore, if large cracks arc present in smectite-rich soils, the construction of check dams can lead to piping and concentrated flow bypassing the dam. Given that the collapse of some check dams seems inevitable where catchment areas are large or there are steep slopes, it is necessary to repair dams as soon as partial collapse starts and to complement this gully control technique with biological control measures. status: publishe...|$|R

Operations began immediately, but a loss of labor was experienced due to problems in the Central Valley, but the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation gave it the go ahead. By the end of 1941, the foundations were completed, despite the labor challenges, by the Guy F. Atkinson Company. During the construction, weather changes were another issue. In the summer months, the workers had to spray water over the aggregates to lower the temperature during extremely hot weather. In the winter, workers heated the mixture to keep the temperatures above 50 degrees. During rainy seasons the construction was stopped due to flooding.3 In 1944, during the end of World War II, there was a strike by workers for about a month due to the Guy F. Atkinson Company's earlier agreement to raise workers’ wages. Workers returned after a promise by the War Labor Board to consider the wage issue, {{and at the end of}} 1944, the agency increased the wages. In December 1947 exhaustion of funds had altered the building of the dam; however, the powerhouse structure was completed.

By means of measuring the DO concentration at the crest and <b>downstream</b> of <b>spillways,</b> the experimental results showed that the more the flow rate is, the less the re-aeration ability of roughened spillway is. Compared with the smooth spillway, stepped spillway has the best reoxygenation effect, followed by the spillway whose bottom is pasted some semi-tennis balls, the worst is the smooth spillway. The results highlight that appropriate artificial roughness on the bottom of spillways or chutes may play an important role to increase dissolved oxygen content and improve water quality...|$|R

40|$|The bottom charged side {{spillway}} is a {{new concept}} of spillway in which the excess water is spilled from the bottom level which is sediment rich water and the cleanest quality of water {{is sent to the}} turbine. It is different in a sense that it will remove sediments as well while getting rid of the excess water different than the conventional spillways which will spill the cleanest quality of water. The concept was developed by Professor Haakon Støle and so far not much work has been done concerning the concept. The main objective of the present study is to prepare a design guideline for bottom charged side spillway. Hydraulic Model Study Different calculations have been done for the design of canal, intake, surface charged spillway and bottom charged spillway considering different considerations. Detail design drawings were prepared based on design and model was constructed at NTNU/SINTEF lab. The present model of bottom charged spillway consists of the following modules. • Inlet arrangement. • Upstream canal section. • Surface charged side spillway section. • Bottom charged side <b>spillway</b> section. • <b>Downstream</b> canal section. • Outlet arrangement. • Instrumentation and measuring arrangements. Since the study is of a new concept, there has been no real prototype for the model but for ease of calculation and making the study more realistic all the calculations has been started considering some imaginary values. The prototype dimensions were then converted to model dimensions using Froude’s model law. Model Test Result It is observed from the study that the bottom charged spillway can be an efficient alternative for effectively spilling the excess water and parallel flushing of the sediments as well. The design of the model was conducted using different approaches. Since not much literature was available about the concept, some assumptions were made to proceed the design. Different approaches of general spillway approach, submerged side orifice approach and side spillway approaches were applied with modifications for bottom entry losses. The attempt were made to figure the relation for more accurate calculation. Some relations concerning the calculation of bottom entry losses were derived based on the model study but these need to be refined for better results. The most favorable approach by the model test was found to be the approach of side spillway with additional effect of bottom orificelosses. The calculation with side spillway approach gave less variation with the actual observed values. <b>Downstream</b> <b>spillway</b> end point was considered as the control point for the design. The depth and the Froude number at this point is the starting data for the design. The variation in the nature of flow among the surface charge spillway and bottom charge spillway was not observed.

The optimization of a hydraulic jump type stilling basin using general purpose published design methodologies (i. e., USBR, SAF, etc.) for a project can be challenging, as these methodologies may not account for all site specific conditions and structure formulations by designers. Also, it is not often clear to a designer as to which flow rates (and corresponding flood events) will have the greatest influence on the basin geometry and features (i. e., jump formation location and stability). This can be further obscured for projects where a high tailwater condition is predicted during flood events.
