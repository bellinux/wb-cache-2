The blast damaged or destroyed most of the experiments, but enough data was recovered to measure the gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Driving past Silent Hill as a shortcut, Travis swerves {{his truck}} to avoid hitting a spirit manifestation of Alessa. While {{following}} the spirit manifestation, he stumbles upon a burning house and rescues the real Alessa, who was immolated in a ritual to impregnate {{her with the}} cult's god. Losing consciousness outside the house, he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, Travis unlocks his repressed childhood memories and defeats monstrous forms of his parents: <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, {{and his father had}} killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned. Additionally, Travis kills the Butcher, a monster that has been slaughtering other monsters.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E

25|$|After he {{attained}} arhatship, {{he began}} to think deeply of his parents, and wondered what happened to them. He used his clairvoyance to see where they were reborn and found his father in the heavenly realms i.e. {{the realm of the}} gods. However, <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> reborn in a lower realm, known as Avīci, or the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. His mother took on the form of a hungry ghost (preta)– so called because it could not eat due to its highly thin and fragile throat in which no food could pass through, yet it was always hungry because it had a fat belly. <b>His</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> greedy with the money he left her. He had instructed her to kindly host any Buddhist monks that ever came her way, but instead she withheld her kindness and her money. It was for this reason she was reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts.|$|E

2500|$|Plácido {{was born}} {{the son of a}} Tonkawa Chief and a Comanche female captive/slave. <b>His</b> <b>mother</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> Comanche is highly ironic, in that he became the {{greatest}} enemy the Comanche had in Texas. [...] Plácido, known in his own language as Ha-shu-ka-na ("Can't Kill Him"), was the last major Chief of the Tonkawa Indians. The fierce Tonkawas became great friends of the white Texas settlers, helping them against all their enemies.|$|R
25|$|Promoted to captain on 30 August 1688, Fairborne {{was given}} {{command of the}} fifth-rate HMS Richmond later that month. The fact that <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> left without a pension by the old regime {{is likely to have}} made Fairborne a {{supporter}} of the Glorious Revolution of November 1688. He transferred to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Phoenix in early 1689 and then commanded the third-rate HMS Warspite at the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in June 1690 during the Nine Years' War. After the battle the upper decks of the ship were found to be full of Dutch musket balls.|$|E
25|$|Wells himself matured in {{a society}} wherein the merit of an {{individual}} was not considered as important as their social class of origin. His father was a professional sportsman, which was seen as inferior to 'gentle' status; whereas <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a domestic servant, and Wells himself was, prior to his writing career, apprenticed to a draper. Trained as a scientist, {{he was able to}} relate his experiences of struggle to Darwin's idea of a world of struggle; but perceived science as a rational system, which extended beyond traditional ideas of race, class and religious notions, and in fiction challenged the use of science to explain political and social norms of the day.|$|E
25|$|In September 1969, Prabhupada {{finally came}} to visit the new UK base, reuniting with his disciples and meeting Harrison and Lennon for the first time.

Their conversation was taped by Shyamsundar and later made available as Lennon '69: Search for Liberation, the first publication in Mukunda's Vedic Contemporary Library Series. Of the two bandmates, Lennon was the one most impressed with Prabhupada initially. Harrison, who was preoccupied with news that <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken severely ill, later admitted to having underestimated the acharya at first.|$|E

500|$|Arshad said {{troops had}} secured 80 {{percent of the}} complex and were moving slowly, as the {{resistance}} was intense in the remaining areas. The standoff continued, as heavily armed militants had retreated into the basement using women and children as human shields, according to the Pakistan Army spokesman. The militants in the basement resisted with machine guns, shoulder-fired rockets, and Molotov cocktails. In a last interview with Geo TV during the operation, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who was hunkered down in the basement, claimed that <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wounded by gunfire and was quoted as saying, [...] "The government is using full force. This is naked aggression... my murder is certain now." [...] Ghazi also claimed that 30 rebels were still battling Pakistani troops, but they only had 14 AK-47s.|$|E

Rindt had one half-brother, Uwe, through his mother.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, BBC {{producer}} Rodney Wilson asked Stockhausen {{to collaborate}} with Stephen and Timothy Quay on a film for the fourth series of Sound on Film International. Although Stockhausen's music had been used for films previously (most notably, parts of Hymnen in Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout in 1971), {{this was the first}} time he had been asked to provide music specially for the purpose. He adapted 21 minutes of material taken from his electronic music for Freitag aus Licht, calling the result Zwei Paare (Two Couples), and the Brothers Quay created their animated film, which they titled In Absentia, based only on their reactions to the music and the simple suggestion that a window might be an idea to use [...] When, at a preview screening, Stockhausen saw the film, which shows a madwoman writing letters from a bleak asylum cell, he was moved to tears. The Brothers Quay were astonished to learn that <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> [...] "imprisoned by the Nazis in an asylum, where she later died. … This was a very moving moment for us as well, especially because we had made the film without knowing any of this" [...]|$|E
