40|$|Between September 1995 and September 1996, 4 -day {{composite}} <b>duplicate</b> <b>plate</b> samples (379 solid food {{samples and}} 303 beverage samples) {{were obtained from}} a stratified random sample of 75 individuals in Maryland and analyzed {{for the presence of}} 10 pesticides. Samples were collected in each of six approximately equally spaced cycles {{as part of a larger}} pilot investigation of longitudinal exposure to pesticides and other elements. Chlorpyrifos was detected in 38. 3 % of the solid food samples, malathion in 75. 2 %, and p,p'-DDE in 21. 4 %. Other pesticides were detected in less than 10 % of the solid food samples. Pesticide residues were not detected in duplicate beverage samples. In solid food samples, the mean concentration of chlorpyrifos was 0. 7 (SD 1. 7) microg/kg, 1. 8 (2. 1) for malathion, and 0. 2 (0. 6) for p,p'-DDE. The detection rate and mean concentration of chlorpyrifos, malathion, and p,p'-DDE varied by a factor of 2 - 3 among sampling cycles and significantly according to results from several statistical analyses. Co-occurrence of chlorpyrifos and malathion in solid food samples was found relatively frequently and also varied with time. Pesticides were detected in food samples with greatest frequency in spring and summer months and with lowest frequency in winter months. These results support the hypothesis that 4 -day average exposure to chlorpyrifos and malathion varies over time for this population mean and for individual members of the population and that correlation between exposures to these two organophosphate pesticides can occur. The measurements of pesticide levels in <b>duplicate</b> <b>plate</b> samples presented here can be used to evaluate and set parameters for dietary exposure models...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} awareness of calcium and health outcomes, along with the acknowledgement of nationwide inadequate calcium intake, {{has led to a}} growing market of calcium-fortified foods in the US. Interviews done in 12 states with 203 primary food providers for early adolescents (10 - 13 year old) suggested that a noticeable proportion of the intentional purchasers of fortified foods failed to correctly identify such products while some individuals purchased fortified foods without awareness. This brings the challenge in assessing dietary calcium intake from all food sources. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} compare self-reported and objective measure of calcium intakes in order to identify specific dietary assessment tool(s) that could comprehensively capture all dietary calcium sources among Asian, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White women. ^ Self-reported dietary intake was assessed with food records, a calcium-specific food frequency questionnaire, and the Block food frequency questionnaire. With the <b>duplicate</b> <b>plate</b> collection being the direct reflection of actual food consumption, data suggested food records were able to capture dietary calcium sources more thoroughly and accurately than food frequency questionnaires among 50 women from the targeted race/ethnic groups. Food records estimated calcium intake almost identical as the <b>duplicate</b> <b>plate</b> collection. As a sub-study of the project, comparison of self-reported energy intake with objective measure of energy intake further showed the subjects reported statistically equivalent or higher energy intake in the FR than in the DPC. Calcium and energy data jointly suggested that this group of highly-educated subjects were able to record all duplicated foods with adequate details and/or correct identification of portion size after receiving in-depth tutorial session and close monitor throughout data collection. The completion of DPC in addition to keeping FR might have been an extra burden for the subjects as fewer caloric intake was recorded when the FR and DPC were completed over the same days. The discrepancy between intake estimates from different dietary assessment methods may have been caused by the omission to duplicate and record or subconscious underconsumption due to participant-perceived burden of completing multiple study tasks. ...|$|E

Samples for the CS included drinking water, urine, hair, and dust; both studies included food (<b>duplicate</b> <b>plate,</b> composited 4 -day food samples from participants). Except for AsB and As(V), the levels for As species {{measured in the}} food and drinking water samples were very low or nonexistent. The analytical methods used for measuring As species were sensitive to 90 %) except for hair (47 %), indicating that the analytical method was sufficiently sensitive.

Exposures to total As in food for children in the CS were about {{twice as high as}} in the general R 5 population (medians of 17. 5 ppb and 7. 72 ppb, respectively). In addition, AsB was the most frequently detected form of As in food eaten by the participants, while As(V) was only rarely detected. Thus, the predominant dietary exposure was from an organic form of As. The major form of As in drinking water was As(V). Spearman (rank) correlations and Pearson (log-concentration scale) correlations between the biomarkers (urine, hair) and the other measures (food, drinking water, dust) and urine versus hair were performed. In the NHEXAS CS, total As and AsB in the food eaten were significantly correlated with their levels in urine. Also, levels of As(V) in drinking water correlated with DMA and MMA in urine. Arsenic levels in dust did not show a relationship with urine or hair levels, and no relationship was observed for food, drinking water, and dust with hair. Urine samples were collected on days 3, 5, and 7 of participants’ monitoring periods. Total As levels in urine were significantly associated across the three pairwise combinations—i. e., day 3 versus day 5, day 3 versus day 7, and day 5 versus day 7. Because the half-life of As in the body is approximately 3 days, this suggests that some exposure occurred continually from day to day. This trend was also observed for AsB, suggesting that food is primarily responsible for the continual exposure.

This study aimed to compare daily dietary F intake (DDFI) estimated by the 3 -d FD and 2 -d DP methods at group and individual levels. Dietary data for sixty-one healthy children aged 4 – 6 years were collected using 3 -d FD and 2 -d DP methods with a 1 -week gap between each collection. Food diary data were analysed for F using the Weighed Intake Analysis Software Package, whereas duplicate diets were analysed by an acid diffusion method using an F ion-selective electrode. Paired t test and linear regression were used to compare dietary data at the group and individual levels, respectively. At the group level, mean DDFI was 0 · 025 (sd 0 · 016) and 0 · 028 (sd 0 · 013) mg/kg body weight (bw) per d estimated by 3 -d FD and 2 -d DP, respectively. No statistically significant difference (P = 0 · 10) was observed in estimated DDFI by each method at the group level.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that young children are inaccurate reporters of dietary intake. The {{purpose of this study was}} to validate a single recall of the previous day’s school lunch reported by 6 – 8 year old Swedish children and to assess teacher-recorded intake of the same meal in a standardized food journal. An additional research question was whether parents could report their child’s intake of the previous day’s lunch. Subjects constituted a convenience sample from the large, multi-country study Identification and prevention of Dietary- and lifestyle-induced health EFfects In Children and infantS (IDEFICS). Validations of both children’s recalls and teachers ’ records were made by comparing results with the <b>duplicate</b> <b>plate</b> reference method. Findings: Twenty-five children (12 boys/ 13 girls) aged 6 – 8 years participated in the validation study at one school in western Sweden. Children were accurate self-reporters of their dietary intake at lunch, with no significant difference between reported and weighed intake (Mean difference (SD) : 7 (50) kcals, p= 0. 49). Teachers significantly over-reported intake (Mean difference (SD) : 65 (79) kcals, p= 0. 01). For both methods, child-reported and teacherrecorded, correlations with weighed intake were strong (Pearson’s correlations r= 0. 92, p< 0. 001 and r= 0. 83, p< 0. 001 respectively).

40|$|An {{observational}} {{study was conducted}} to determine dietary fluoride intake, diet, and prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis of school age children in three fluorosis endemic districts of the Ethiopian Rift Valley having similar concentrations of fluoride (F) in drinking water (~ 5 mg F/L). The <b>duplicate</b> <b>plate</b> method was used to collect foods consumed by children over 24 h from 20 households in each community (n = 60) and the foods, along with water and beverages, were analyzed for fluoride (F) content. Prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis was determined using presence of clinical symptoms in children (n = 220). Daily dietary fluoride intake was at or above tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg F/day and the dietary sources (water, prepared food and beverages) all contributed to the daily fluoride burden. Urinary fluoride in children from Fentale and Adamitulu was almost twice (> 5 mg/L) the concentration found in urine from children from Alaba, where rain water harvesting was most common. Severe and moderate dental fluorosis was found in Alaba and Adamitulu, the highest severity and prevalence being in the latter district where staple foods were lowest in calcium. Children in all three areas showed evidence of both skeletal and non-skeletal fluorosis. Our data support the hypothesis that intake of calcium rich foods in addition to using rain water for household consumption and preparation of food, may help in reducing risk of fluorosis in Ethiopia, but prospective studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To obtain {{information}} {{on the level of}} total fluoride intake from food, beverages and toothpaste by children at the age of 22 - 25 months of low and high socioeconomic status (SES) in major Colombian cities. Methods: Daily fluoride intake was assessed by the <b>duplicate</b> <b>plate</b> method and by recovered toothpaste solution during a 3 -day period and afterwards analysed by the microdiffusion method. Results: Mean daily fluoride intake was 0. 11 (+/- 0. 10), 0. 14 (+/- 0. 12), 0. 10 (+/- 0. 07) and 0. 07 (+/- 0. 06) mg/kg body weight (bw) /day in Bogota, Medellin, Manizales and Cartagena, respectively. The total fluoride intake was higher in low-SES subjects in the cities of Medellin and Bogota. In the high-SES children of the four cities, the average intakes ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 09 mg F/kg bw, whereas, the low-SES children in three cities had intakes between 0. 11 and 0. 21 mg F/kg bw (Cartagena, 0. 07). Toothpaste (containing 1000 - 1500 ppm F, with 1500 ppm F being more common) accounted for approximately 70 % of total fluoride intake, followed by food (24 %) and beverages (< 6 %). More than half the children had their teeth brushed by an adult, on average twice a day, using 0. 22 - 0. 65 g of toothpaste. Conclusion: Children from three Colombian cities have a mean total daily fluoride intake above the 'optimal range'. Health authorities should promote an appropriate use of fluoridated dentifrices discouraging the use of dentifrices containing 1500 ppm F in children younger than 6 years of age and promoting a campaign of education of parents and oral health professionals on adequate toothbrushing practices...|$|E

40|$|New {{anabolic}} steroids show up occasionally in sports doping and in veterinary control. The discovery of these designer steroids is facilitated by findings of illicit preparations, thus allowing bioactivity testing, structure elucidation using NMR and mass spectrometry, and final incorporation in urine testing. However, {{as long as}} these preparations remain undiscovered, new designer steroids are not screened for in routine sports doping or veterinary control urine tests since the established GC/MS and LC/MS/MS methods are {{set up for the}} monitoring of a few selected ions or MS/MS transitions of known substances only. In this study, the feasibility of androgen bioactivity testing and mass spectrometric identification is being investigated for trace analysis of designer steroids in urine. Following enzymatic deconjugation and a generic solid-phase extraction, the samples are analyzed by gradient LC with effluent splitting toward two identical 96 -well fraction collectors. One well plate is used for androgen bioactivity detection using a novel robust yeast reporter gene bioassay yielding a biogram featuring a 20 -s time resolution.

The feasibility of this approach for doping control is demonstrated via the screening of human urine samples spiked with the designer anabolic steroid tetrahydrogestrinone.

40|$|To reevaluate {{the ability}} of the disk {{diffusion}} method to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 73 such isolates from 13 cities were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with the standardized disk diffusion test. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>plates</b> were incubated at 30 and 35 degrees C and read after 18, 24, and 48 h. After incubation at 35 degrees C for 24 h, 97 % of isolates appeared resistant to methicillin, and 99 % appeared resistant to oxacillin. A significantly smaller proportion of isolates appeared resistant to cephalothin (P less than 0. 001) and cefamandole (P less than 0. 001). Isolates from some cities had no zones of inhibition around methicillin and oxacillin disks, whereas those from other cities had measurable zones of inhibition, with light growth inside the zones. Patterns of growth around cephalothin and cefamandole disks also varied among isolates from different cities. Incubation at 30 degrees C for 24 h did not result in better detection of methicillin or oxacillin resistance. All study isolates appeared resistant to methicillin and oxacillin after 48 h of incubation at 35 degrees C. The results suggest that methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains from many areas will be detected if standardized disk diffusion tests are incubated at 35 degrees C for 24 h...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{identify}} novel {{small molecules}} against the TSH receptor, {{we developed a}} sensitive transcription-based luciferase high-throughput screening (HTS) system named the TSHR-Glo Assay (TSHR-Glo). Methods: This assay uses double-transfected CHO cells stably expressing the human TSHR and a cAMP response element (CRE) construct fused to an improved luciferase reporter gene. Results: The assay was highly responsive towards TSH in a dose-dependent manner with a TSH sensitivity of 10 - 10 M (10 ± 1. 12 μU/mL) and thyroid-stimulating antibodies, a hallmark of Graves’ disease, could also be detected. The assay was validated against the standard indicator of HTS performance - the Z-factor (Z’) – producing a score of 0. 895. Using the TSHR-Glo assay we screened 48, 224 compounds from a diverse chemical library in <b>duplicate</b> <b>plates</b> at a fixed dose of 17 μM. Twenty molecules with the greatest activity out of sixty-two molecules that were identified by this technique were subsequently screened against the parent luciferase stable cell line in order to eliminate false positive stimulators. Conclusion: Using this approach {{we were able to}} identify specific agonists against the TSH receptor leading to the characterization of several TSH agonist molecules. Hence, the TSHR-Glo assay was a one-step cell-based HTS assay which was successful in the discovery of novel small molecular agonists and for the detection of stimulating antibodies to the TSH receptor...|$|R

40|$|A {{miniaturized}} nitrate reduction test (MNRT) for oral bacteria {{was developed}} and its reliability compared with a conventional nitrate reduction test (CNRT). In the MNRT 100 [mu]l aliquots of freshly grown heavy suspension of various oral bacterial species, in physiological saline, were added to equal volumes of 0. 1 % filter-sterilized KNO 3 solution in distilled water in wells of transparent plastic <b>plates.</b> <b>Duplicate</b> <b>plates</b> were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 35 [deg]C for 12 - 15 h. At {{the end of the}} incubation period the test was performed by adding either a trace amount of a non-liquid reagent (mixture of -(+) -tartaric acid, sulfanilic acid and 1 -naphthylenediamine dihydrochloride, 10 : 1 : 1, wt/wt) or conventional liquid reagents A and B (sulfanilic acid and N,N-dimethyl- 1 -naphthylamine). In the conventional nitrate reduction test (CNRT), tubes of a basal anaerobic broth were inoculated with the same bacterial species used for MNRT, and the nitrate reduction tests performed after anaerobic incubation of the cultures for 4 - 6 days. Several hundred anaerobic and facultative bacterial isolates belonging to genera Veillonella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, Actinomyces and Capnocytophaga were characterized by MNRT and CNRT. Analysis of the data showed that MNRT and CNRT systems were comparable. In the MNRT system Veillonella parvula and Selenomonas sputigena were capable of reducing nitrate only under anaerobic conditions. Actinomycetes reduced the nitrates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, while all black-pigmented Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Capnocytophaga species did not reduce nitrate. These findings suggest that the MNRT is reliable, rapid and may be conveniently used in clinical or research laboratories with a heavy microbiological work load...|$|R
40|$|Many {{laboratories}} {{are experiencing}} growing shortages of trained microbiology technologists and technicians. Consequently, {{there is considerable}} interest in new automation that could potentially lessen labor demands for specimen processing. In this study, we present the first published evaluation of a new microbiology instrument, the Walk Away Specimen Processor (WASP), manufactured by Copan, Inc., in which we evaluated cross-contamination, the accuracy of plating, {{and the quality of}} the results. The absence of cross-contamination was demonstrated by plating a total of 200 alternating inoculated and sterile specimen tubes. The ability of the WASP to subculture enrichment broths was evaluated with 106 Lim broth specimens, with the results being identical to those obtained by testing by routine methods. Plating of urine specimens with the WASP was compared to plating with the Dynacon Inoculab instrument. Three hundred specimens were <b>plated</b> in <b>duplicate</b> on both instruments with 1 -μl loops, and 293 specimens were <b>plated</b> in <b>duplicate</b> on both instruments with 10 -μl loops. The results of <b>duplicate</b> <b>plating</b> with the same instrument (replicate plating) and of the consensus agreement between the two instruments were compared. The replicate plating results were comparable for both instruments, while the WASP had more specimens with significant results than the Inoculab with the 1 -μl loop only. Lastly, for the plating of 113 specimens in ESwab tubes, the manual method and WASP plating each yielded 90 potential pathogens. In summary, we report the first evaluation of a new microbiology specimen-plating instrument, the WASP, which offers opportunities for the automated plating of microbiology specimens to an extent that has not been possible to date...|$|R
