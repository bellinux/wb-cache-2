50|$|The ACT is an {{off-axis}} Gregorian telescope, with a six-metre (236 in) {{primary mirror}} and a two-metre (79 in) secondary mirror. Both mirrors are segmented, consisting of 71 (primary) and 11 (secondary) aluminum panels. Unlike most telescopes which track the rotating sky during observation, the ACT observes {{a strip of}} sky, typically five degrees wide, by scanning {{back and forth in}} azimuth at the relatively rapid rate of two degrees per second. The rotating portion of the telescope weighs approximately 32 tonnes (35 short tons), creating a substantial engineering challenge. A <b>ground</b> <b>screen</b> surrounding the telescope minimises contamination from microwave radiation emitted by the ground.

5000|$|In {{professional}} student laboratory kits, {{the container}} A is {{often in the}} form of two concentric cylinders of metal screen, open at the top. [...] A screen acts the same as a solid metal sheet for electrostatic charge, as long as its holes are small. The inner cylinder is the Faraday pail container itself, separated from the outer cylinder with insulating supports. The outer cylindrical metal screen surrounds the inner, and acts as a ground to shield it from stray charges. This design largely eliminates the stray charge problem, as well as allowing the experimenter to see inside the container. The electrometer ground lead is clipped to the outer <b>ground</b> <b>screen,</b> and the experimenter touches this screen while performing any procedure. To ground the inner screen, the experimenter can bridge his finger between the inner and outer screens. When doing this it is important that he lift his finger first from the inner screen, not the outer, to avoid leaving charge on the inner screen.|$|E

Radiation is assumed to be diffusely emitted, transmitted and reflected, both by the cladding and the screening surfaces. The importance of the geometry and temperature of the screening surface, and of the radiometric properties of the screen in determining the radiative environment inside are indicated. On the basis of this model, together with the outside radiation fluxes, temperature of the <b>ground,</b> <b>screen</b> and cover and data on the properties of the cladding and screening surfaces, the net thermal radiation inside the greenhouse can be determined, both in clear and overcast night sky conditions.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the major plasma processes involved in the SERT 2 spacecraft experiments was conducted {{to aid in the}} interpretation of recent data. A plume penetration model was developed for neutralization electron conduction to the ion beam and showed qualitative agreement with flight data. In the SERT 2 configuration conduction of neutralization electrons between thrusters was experimentally demonstrated in space. The {{analysis of}} this configuration suggests that the relative orientation of the two magnetic fields was an important factor in the observed results. Specifically, the opposed field orientation appeared to provide a high conductivity channel between thrusters and a barrier to the ambient low energy electrons in space. The SERT 2 neutralizer currents with negative neutralizer biases were up to about twice the theoretical prediction for electron collection by the <b>ground</b> <b>screen.</b> An explanation for the higher experimental values was a possible conductive path from the neutralizer plume to a nearby part of the <b>ground</b> <b>screen.</b> Plasma probe measurements of SERT 2 gave the clearest indication of plasma electron temperature, with normal operation being near 5 eV and discharge only operation near 2 eV...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have studied bilayer {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) electron and hole systems in GaAs. The work {{consists of three}} experimental studies, which involve low temperature magneto-transport measurements of one 2 D system independent of the other, and one theoretical study. Firstly, we present a new technique for measuring the chemical potential of a 2 D system. In a bilayer 2 D electron system (2 DES), we use the lower 2 DES as a quantum Hall electrometer to measure the chemical potential of the upper 2 DES. We track {{the evolution of the}} Landau levels in the upper 2 DES, and extract an effective mass that is consistent with previous values. Secondly, we investigated the hysteresis in the quantum Hall regime of a bilayer 2 DES, which was previously attributed to a slow charge transfer mechanism between the adjacent layers. Using our quantum Hall electrometry technique, we provide compelling evidence that the origin of the hysteresis is instead the nonequilibrium induced currents that are generated in one of the 2 DES at integer filling factors. Thirdly, we present a technique for using a nearby <b>ground</b> plane to <b>screen</b> the long-range Coulomb interactions in a 2 D hole system (2 DHS). Using a bilayer 2 DHS, we are able to vary the distance from the ground plane to the 2 DHS between 50 and 340 nm, in the same sample without thermal cycling. This technique was used to study the effect of a ground plane on the metallic behaviour, which arises from electron-electron interactions, and it was shown that the <b>ground</b> plane <b>screening</b> effect was much weaker than might at first be expected. Finally, we developed a theoretical model to answer some important questions raised by the <b>ground</b> plane <b>screening</b> experiment: Does a 2 D system perform <b>ground</b> plane <b>screening</b> as effectively as a metal gate? How effective do we expect <b>ground</b> plane <b>screening</b> to be when the 2 D system is in the metallic regime? We show that <b>ground</b> plane <b>screening</b> by a 2 D system is at least as effective as a metal gate, and that the intralayer screening when a 2 D system is in the metallic regime dominates the <b>ground</b> plane <b>screening</b> effect...|$|R
