The smallest taxon, the King <b>Island</b> emu, was confined to a small <b>island</b> situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King <b>Island</b> was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the <b>island.</b> As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King <b>Island</b> emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E
