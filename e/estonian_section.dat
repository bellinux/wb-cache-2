50|$|After the German {{revolution}} in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed {{attack against the}} new state. However, {{by this time the}} support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An Estonian Workers Commune was set up, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the Central Committee of the <b>Estonian</b> <b>Sections</b> of the RCP(b) (Venemaa Kommunistliku (bolshevike) Partei Eesti Sektsioonide Keskkomitee). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the November 5, 1920 the Communist Party of Estonia (EKP) was founded as a separate party.|$|R

After the Bolshevik revolution, he was deputy chairman of the Estonian revolutionary soviet in Tallinn, but fled back to Petrograd after Estonia was occupied by the German army. He joined Cheka, and in August 1918 carried out the arrest of Fanny Kaplan, who had shot and attempted to kill Lenin. He returned to Estonia in November 1918, to organise the banned Estonian Communist Party, and presided over its first congress, in November 1920. He was arrested by the Estonian Political Police on 3 May 1922, after a mass May day demonstration in Tallinn, and executed that same night.|$|E
40|$|Development of a Network ofBaltic German Agricultural SocietiesThe first {{agricultural}} {{society in the}} Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire was the Livonian Public Welfare and Economic Society (LS) established in 1792 in Riga (approved by the Empress in 1794 and started operating in 1796). Having been transferred from Riga to Tartu in 1813, the society operated here until 1939. In accordance with diversifying economic activities {{as well as the}} agrotechnical innovation of agriculture that started in the 1820 s, the LS endeavoured to extend the scope of its field of activities. On the one hand, it purportedto coordinate the activities of the analogous societies in thethree Baltic provinces, or, indeed, to be their umbrella organisation. On the other hand, it was attempted to create branch societies with an unlimited membership, and, thereafter, sub-institutions for performing specific tasks. Thus, a merino sheep purchase boom facilitated the establishment of the Livonian Sheep Breeders’ Association in 1825, which cooperated with a similar association in Estonia. In the late 1830 s the first pan-governorate agricultural societies were established also in the neighbouring provinces. On 31 st October 1839 the Emperor approved the articles of association of three agricultural societies (Courland, Kuldīga, and Estonia). Since the administration hindered the establishment of pan-governorate affiliate societies untilthe last decades of the 19 th century, the Courland Economic Society and Estonian Agricultural Society (Estländische Landwirtschaftliche Gesellschaft) subsequently needed to perform the functions of an umbrella organisation in their provinces, similarly to the Society in Livonia. Differently from the LS which included only a limited numberof members, the societies in Courland and all the three provinces were open, i. e., accepted an unlimited number of members. They accepted people interested in the subject from all classes and admitted them by voting during general assemblies. Upon the initiative of LS several agricultural societies were created in Livonia in the early 1840 s; they were established as branches or affiliates of the Society. The Livonian Society of Agriculture and Promotion of Trade (LSAPT, Livländischer Verein zur Beförderung der Landwirtschaft und des Gewerbfleisses), the articles of association ofwhich were approved in 1844, was the most important affiliate of LS and its direct extension. The most extensive undertakings of LSAPT were the organisation of annual exhibitions in Tartu as of 1876, and the publication of the weekly newspaper Baltische Wochenschrift für Landwirtschaft, Gewerbefleiss und Handel (1863 – 1915) intended for the readership of the three Baltic governorates in cooperation with the Society. The Agricultural Societies of Pärnu–Viljandi and Kuressaare were approved only as late as 1845. Since the sphere of activity of LSAPT first and foremost enveloped the vicinity of Tartu and Northern Livonia in terms of its location and membership, the estate owners in the Latvian section of Livonia established their own society in early 1848. At first it bore the name of the Agricultural Society of Võnnu–Volmari–Valka; as of 1866, however, it was changed to the SouthernLivonian Public Welfare and Agricultural Society and the hub of its activities transferred to Riga. The last of the LS County affiliates to be established in 1877 was the Agricultural Society of Võru. In {{the last quarter of the}} 19 th century and the early 20 th century a number of LS’s affiliates were established as pan-governorate specialty societies (some also as societies functioning in all the Baltic governorates) : Baltic Foresters’ Society (Verein baltischer Forstwirte) in 1867; Baltic Cattle Breeders’ Society (Verband Baltischer Rindviehzüchter) in 1885 —this was divided into the Baltic Angler Breeders’ Society (Verband baltischer Anglerviehzüchter) in 1904 / 2 and the Livonian Dutch Friesian Cattle Breeders’ Society (Verband livländischer Holländer-Friesenviehzüchter) in 1904; Livonian Society for the Promotion of Horse Breeding (Verein zur Förderung der livländischen Pferdezucht) 1897; Livonian Society for the Promotion of Women’s Works (Livländischer Verein zur Förderung der Frauenarbeit) in 1897; Livonian Seed Producers’ Society in 1900; Livonian Gardening Society in 1901; Baltic Swamp Land Improvement Society (Baltischer Moorverein) in 1908; Baltic Association of Cold-Blooded Horse Breeders (Baltischer Verein von Züchter kaltblütiger Pferde) in 1912. Agricultural Societies were also established in parishes; in the Latvian section of Livonia: Ruhja in 1877; Salatsi in 1884; Pociemsi in 1888; Smiltene–Palsmane–Aumeisteri–Gaujiena in 1884; Vendzava in 1897 and Limbaži-Suntaži-Allaži in 1904; in the <b>Estonian</b> <b>section,</b> the Agricultural Societies of Vändra in 1895, Kodavere in 1896, Räpina in 1898; and Laiuse in 1900; while Kanepi–Antsla Agricultural Society was established in 1891. The membership of the former consisted nearly exclusively of Baltic German estateowners and scientists in the specialised field concerned; while the latter, LS’s affiliates in the parishes were so-called mixed societies, which also included Estonian or Latvian farmers besides the estate owners and officials, who occupied the dominant positions. Most of the Estonian and Latvian farmers’ societies were independent from the start, while the leadership of the aforementioned mixed societies transferred to small farmers at the beginning of the 20 th century. As at 1915 the status of Society affiliates had been granted to 26 societies on the basis of the articles of association; six of those housed their headquarters in the facilities of the Society in Tartu, Lossi 1 - 3. Compared to the active and close-knit network of societies in Livonia the establishment of societies was slower in the governorate of Estonia; there were also considerably fewer societies—both those of Baltic German great landowners as well as of Estonian small farmers. In the first thirty years of the 19 th century the large scale farmers were united only by the Estonian Agricultural Society. The most fundamental changes in reorganising the Estonian agriculture took place in the 1860 s and 1870 s, while the county affiliates of Estonian Agricultural Society in Virumaa (1869) and Läänemaa (1872) were also founded then. The specialty societies that functioned with a fluctuating degree of activity were a hunting society (Estländische Wildschutzverein) and gardening society. After the establishment of the Courland Economic Society (CES) and the Kuldiga AS (1839), the following 4 ASs were founded considerably later—in Tukums in 1867, Dobele in 1871, Jaunjelgava in 1877, Talsi 1878. Since a sufficient number of members there were already members of the CES, the representatives of the aforementioned local societies declared CES the central society and themselves as branch societies. The most close-knit, varied and active network of Baltic German agricultural societies developed owing tothe LS specifically in Livonia...|$|E
50|$|EKP {{was formed}} November 5, 1920, as the Central Committee of the <b>Estonian</b> <b>Sections</b> of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was {{separated}} from its mother party. During {{the first half of}} the 1920s the hopes to an immediate world revolution were still held, and Estonian communists had their own hopes of restoring their power. Widespread economic and social crisis gave lots of support for that kind of hopes. Activists of the party had not only to support the agenda, but also to be ready to participate in the illegal actions, such as organising conspirative apartments, transporting weapons and communist propaganda materials, hide undercover activists and collect information for the revolutionaries. It resulted in a standing conflict situation with the governments. As oriented not to the legal goals EKP never tried to legalise itself in the Estonian Republic, as well as didnt abandon demands for the armed uprising and joining Estonia to the USSR.|$|R

40|$|Background: Sedentary {{lifestyles and}} {{concomitant}} behaviours such as smoking and poor dietary habits are increasingly {{implied in the}} rise of non communicable diseases which have become a major cause of morbidity and death not only in high income countries but also in lower income countries. This development makes it increasingly important to study aetiological factors that are linked to features of the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents. Special consideration should be given to behavioural and lifestyle factors that are more readily adaptable and may have an early advantageous effect on metabolic risk factors. Objectives: To examine the relationship between physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic risk factors in healthy children and adolescents. Research Design: The data used in the analysis was collected as part of the <b>Estonian</b> and Swedish <b>section</b> of the European Youth Heart Study (EYHS). The EYHS is a school based, multi center, cross sectional study designed to examine the nature and the interactions between individual, lifestyle and environmental factors in their relationship to cardiovascular risk. The main variables under investigation were total physical activity and activity intensity levels measured by accelerometry; cardiorespiratory fitness measured by maximal ergometer bike tests; markers of body fat; fasting serum levels of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol; pubertal and socioeconomic status. Results: A) Total, moderate vigorous and vigorous physical activity were positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness. B) Lower body fat levels were associated with greater time periods spent at vigorous levels of physical activity. C) Body fat was positively correlated with metabolic risk factors and may act as a mediator in the association between cardiorespiratory fitness with metabolic risk. D) Cardiorespiratory fitness was more strongly correlated to clustered metabolic risk factors than total physical activity and may have mediated the effect of physical activity on metabolic risk. E) The associations between physical activity and insulin resistance were strongest at higher levels of physical activity. F) Children of the lowest socioeconomic status spent more time in sedentary behaviours such as watching TV but were not less physically active than their peers. G) Time periods spent in total physical activity are greater on school days than on weekends and a social gradient is observed in girls. Conclusion: The results presented in this thesis reemphasize the importance of physical activity {{as an integral part of}} a health enhancing lifestyle. They show that associations and interactions between physical activity and markers of metabolic risk can be observed at an early age and can provide important insights into the aetiology of metabolic disease patterns...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to explore {{with the help of}} {{interviews}} and content analysis, how do the workers of three major newspapers – Postimees, SL Õhtuleht and Eesti Päevaleht – regard commenting and moderating. The main questions are: if, how much, how often and on what bases do the editors remove unbecoming comments from their commentaryrooms and what do the removed comments have in common. The keywords of this baccalaureate thesis are “flame,” “comments,” “commentators,” “moderators,” “moderating” and “unbecoming comments. ” Two editors from each edition, all together six people were interviewed. The interviews were carried out at SL Õhtuleht and Postimees in the spring of 2006 and at Eesti Päevaleht one year later. In addition two employees of Postimees answered in writing to some additional questions. The results of the interviews showed that all editions have their own way of approach to moderating and commentaries. For example, the workers at SL Õhtuleht don´t regard to moderating as their first priority, they remove as much as needed and as few as possible of the unbecoming comments. On the other hand, Eesti Päevaleht has been paying {{a lot of attention to}} the quality of their comments, in the beginning of 2005 they took into service the system of registrated users and it has been quite successful at its purpose, but in May 2007 they decided to change their commenting system open to all readers. This thesis observs the period when only registrated users could use the benefit of commenting. For about a year Postimees has been using the system of voluntary moderators, where readers can become moderators and remove unbecoming comments. The editors at Postimees and Eesti Päevaleht think that commenting has a surplus value and it should not be taken advantage of. The interviews also showed that online news sites do not have separate moderators, moderating is a part of the editors everyday job and they are quite content with it. The editors at SL Õhtuleht and Postimees check the reported comments few times during the day and voluntary moderators at Postimees check the total flow of comments, but the editors at Eesti Päevaleht keep their eye on all of the comments. The quantity of removed unbecoming comments depends on the actual articles, but on the average the editors remove up to 20 - 30 comments per day, exept for Eesti Päevaleht, where the maximum is five comments per day. The readers of SL Õhtuleht and Postimees use the opportunity to report of unbecoming comments score of times during the day, but only third of the reports are justified because people have different values and they react differently. It also became obvious that editors use their common sense as they remove unbecoming comments, Postimees and Eesti Päevaleht use the filter of forbidden words, but only to some extent. If it becomes a habbit of a certain commentator to post unbecoming comments, the editors have the oportunity of blocking the address of that commentator. SL Õhtuleht and Postimees use that choice only as temporary shocktherapy, but Eesti Päevaleht blocks the address permanently. Editors think that blocking the IP-address is enough punishment for the commentators and the police should intervene only in extreme situations, for example when a commentator posts frequently comments that are hostile, contain deaththreats or false information. Comments need to be monitored more closely in the case of articles that are about death, jewes, Russia and drastic politicians. The unbecoming comments that were removed from the online news sites during seven days were analyzed with content analysis. The quantity of comments removed was quite different: SL Õhtuleht removed 96, Postimees 92 and Eesti Päevaleht only 6 comments during one week. The reason for this drastic difference is that only registered readers can comment on articles in Eesti Päevaleht and because of that they behave much better. The results of the content analysis showed that editors removed the unbecoming comments mostly from the <b>Estonian</b> news <b>section,</b> but Entertainment was also popular. A lot of comments were removed from articles concerning police or politics, local and global celebrities were also under attack. Readers prefer to use as their alias names that are describing (gives a hint of their status, nationality, feelings, political preferences), nicknames or proper names. The average lenght of the removed comments was 24 words and they were mostly agressive towards the characters or the contents of the articles...|$|R
