Politicians such as Joe Bossano and Peter Caruana continued to demand that no political concessions be made to Spain.|$|R

50|$|With {{conventional}} cams, {{stress is}} highest at <b>full</b> <b>lift,</b> when turning at zero speed (engine cranking), and diminishes with increasing speed as inertial {{force of the}} valve counters spring pressure, while a desmodromic cam has essentially no load at zero speed (in the absence of springs), its load being entirely inertial, and therefore increasing with speed. Its greatest inertial stress bears on its smallest radius. Acceleration forces for either method increase with the square of velocity resulting from kinetic energy.|$|E

50|$|Since {{flux pinning}} is an {{important}} factor for providing the stabilizing and lifting force, the HTSC can be made much more easily for FES than for other uses. HTSC powders can be formed into arbitrary shapes so long as flux pinning is strong. An ongoing challenge that has to be overcome before superconductors can provide the <b>full</b> <b>lifting</b> force for an FES system is finding a way to suppress the decrease of levitation force and the gradual fall of rotor during operation caused by the flux creep of the superconducting material.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{airships}} {{would replace}} the helium gas with a near-vacuum environment and would theoretically {{be able to provide}} the <b>full</b> <b>lift</b> potential of displaced air, so every liter of vacuum could lift 1.28 g. Using the molar volume, the mass of 1 liter of helium (at 1 atmospheres of pressure) is found to be 0.178 g. If helium is used instead of vacuum, the lifting power of every liter is reduced by 0.178 g, so the effective lift is reduced by 14%. A 1-liter volume of hydrogen has a mass of 0.090 g.|$|E
50|$|At {{steady load}} conditions, the valve opens, fuel is injected, and the valve closes. Under a sudden {{increase}} in throttle, the valve opens {{in the same}} intake stroke and a greater amount of fuel is injected. This allows immediate acceleration. For the next stroke, the ECU calculates engine load at the new, higher RPM, and decides how to open the valve: early or late, wide-open or half-open. The optimal opening and timing are always reached and combustion is as precise as possible. This, of course, is impossible with a normal camshaft, which opens the valve for the whole intake period, and always to <b>full</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E

To keep glass up, the strap latched to the inside of the door. The interior included only two bucket seats from a Dodge van. Center console, heater, sound deadeners, side view mirrors, radio, carpeting, and even arm rests were deleted to save weight.|$|E

50|$|A helical {{camshaft}} {{is a type}} {{of mechanical}} variable valve actuation (VVA) system. More specifically it is a camshaft that allows the valve opening duration to be varied over a wide, continuous, step-less range, with all of the added duration being at <b>full</b> valve <b>lift.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{has never}} been a {{mechanical}} VVA system that had either the duration range at <b>full</b> <b>lift</b> or the high RPM capability to do anything like this. “Camless” electromagnetic/hydraulic systems do have similar duration/lift ranges to the Helical Camshaft but at present their high RPM ability is strictly limited. On a possibly somewhat more practical level, dynamometer testing of road engines has shown that even with the Helical Camshaft limited to only about 30 degrees increase in duration, a typical road engine can increase its power by 25% to 30% at the same RPM power peak as the standard cam - and the idle and low RPM behaviour are totally normal.|$|E

50|$|The Kawasaki GPz750 was a sport bike {{introduced}} by Kawasaki in 1982. It {{was more than}} a warmed-over KZ750, as it was improved in many areas, focusing on high-performance. Changes started at the front, with tapered bearings in the steering head instead of the KZ750's ball bearings, and the upper triple clamp was changed also, giving the GPz solid aluminum clip-on handle grips instead of the traditional handlebar. A bikini fairing almost identical to the one on the GPz550 was added too. The GPz750 boasted increased power, with slightly higher compression, and camshafts designed to get the valves to <b>full</b> <b>lift</b> quicker, and fitting Mikuni 34mm carburetors to it for smoother airflow. The cylinder heads were also given a new combustion chamber with a 'squish zone' and porting & polishing from the factory. To maintain reliability oil passages were installed under the pistons for increased cooling, and an oil-cooler was added. The GPz750 was the quickest factory 750, as Cycle World recorded a time of 11.93 seconds at 109.62 mph in the 1/4 mile. The GPz750 underwent some significant changes in 1983. The original was based on the 1981 KZ750-E. Kawasaki retired the KZ750 after 1983. The 1983 KZ750L3 was nearly identical to the '82 GPz750, but for different colors, no bikini fairing, and without the porting & polishing in the cylinder head.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{sanctions}} Libya's refining capacity eroded. Libya's {{role on the}} international stage grew less provocative after UN sanctions were imposed. In 1999, Libya fulfilled one of the UNSCR requirements by surrendering two Libyans suspected in connection with the bombing for trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands. One of these suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, was found guilty; the other was acquitted. UN sanctions against Libya were subsequently suspended. The <b>full</b> <b>lifting</b> of {{the sanctions}}, contingent on Libya's compliance with the remaining UNSCRs, including acceptance of responsibility for the actions of its officials and payment of appropriate compensation, was passed 12 September 2003, explicitly linked to the release of up to $2.7 billion in Libyan funds {{to the families of the}} 1988 attack's 270 victims.|$|R
