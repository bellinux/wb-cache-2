However, any USB keyboard is also compatible with the Xbox 360.|$|E

A web browser from Planetweb was included, and a mouse and <b>keyboard</b> <b>adapter</b> were available to simplify navigation. Sega also released a dedicated Saturn mouse and Saturn keyboard.

50|$|Sony {{released}} a Linux-based operating {{system for the}} PS2 in a package that also includes a <b>keyboard,</b> mouse, Ethernet <b>adapter</b> and HDD.

50|$|Sony {{released}} a Linux-based operating {{system for the}} PS2 in a package that also includes a <b>keyboard,</b> mouse, Ethernet <b>adapter</b> and HDD. Currently, Sony's online store states that the Linux kit is no longer for sale in North America. However, as of July 2005, the European version was still available. The kit boots by installing a proprietary interface, the run-time environment, which is on a region-coded DVD, so the European and North America kits only work with a PS2 from their respective regions.|$|R
2500|$|The device's USB port {{is capable}} of {{supporting}} a <b>keyboard,</b> mouse, Ethernet <b>adapter,</b> or USB storage, but not a printer, as Chrome OS offers no print stack. Adding further hardware outside of the previously mentioned items will likely cause problems with the operating system's [...] "self knowing" [...] security model. Users instead were encouraged to use a secure service called Google Cloud Print to print to legacy printers connected to their desktop computers, or to connect an HP ePrint, Kodak Hero, Kodak ESP, or Epson Connect printer to the Google Cloud Print service for a [...] "cloud aware" [...] printer connection.|$|R
2500|$|He {{is listed}} as either primary {{inventor}} or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications related {{to a range of}} technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, <b>keyboards,</b> power <b>adapters,</b> staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards and packages. Jobs's contributions to most of his patents were to [...] "the look and feel of the product." [...] His industrial design chief Jonathan Ive had his name along with him for 200 of the patents. Most of these are design patents (specific product designs; for example, Jobs listed as primary inventor in patents for both original and lamp-style iMacs, as well as PowerBook G4 Titanium) as opposed to utility patents (inventions). He has 43 issued US patents on inventions. The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with [...] "magnification" [...] feature was issued the day before he died. Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers, Jobs later used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.|$|R
