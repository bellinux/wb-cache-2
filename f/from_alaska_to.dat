5|$|A {{widespread}} {{species with}} an almost cosmopolitan distribution, {{it has been reported}} from Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania), Asia (China, Himalayas, Japan, southern India), Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America (Brazil). It has been collected from subarctic areas of Greenland, and subalpine regions in Iceland. In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges <b>from</b> <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, although it is less common in Central America. The species is popular on postage stamps, and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea, Paraguay, Romania, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} to the Military Division of the Pacific, {{he was the}} top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officer on the entire American Pacific Coast. Upon his arrival on the West Coast, he visited locations <b>from</b> <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> the Mexican border in order to analyze the work that would be needed. Between 1868 and 1870, he surveyed numerous California harbors and made engineering suggestions as required. One of these suggestions resulted {{in the construction of}} a 7,000-foot breakwater that made Long Beach harbor accessible to large amounts of shipping for the first time. In 1870, he suggested that landowners near Colusa, California, construct levees to contain the Sacramento River within a single channel. The plan would reclaim swampland and control the river's annual floods, making large-scale farming possible. The plan was eagerly seized upon by local residents.|$|E

25|$|One of Spain's {{gains from}} the Seven Years' War was the French Louisiana Territory which was {{secretly}} given to Spain.

25|$|Although he is {{best known}} for his work with killer whales, Bigg spent most of his career {{studying}} other marine mammals.

In 1972, Bigg organized a sea otter conservation translocation of Pacific sea otters <b>from</b> <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Vancouver Island, a population that continues to thrive. He also conducted research on Steller sea lions, California sea lions, and harbor seals.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the mid-20th century, several {{attempts}} were made to produce a list of the largest shell specimens. Perhaps the earliest of these was the Lost Operculum Club List of Champions, initiated in 1950 by John Q. Burch (1894–1974) of the Los Angeles-based Conchological Club of Southern California. This project was overseen by Bertram C. Draper (1904–2000) between 1966 and 1987, and bore four major print publications during this time. The list was limited in scope compared to later efforts, encompassing only marine species of the Eastern Pacific, <b>from</b> <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Chile.|$|E

The CAB {{ruled in favor of}} a Seattle route for Star in March 1941, but President Franklin D. Roosevelt vetoed the ruling. Pan American Airways started a Seattle – Ketchikan – Juneau service with a Sikorsky flying boat in 1940, but the route was discontinued when World War II started.|$|E
25|$|Russian traders {{settled in}} Alaska during the 18th century. In 1740, a Divine Liturgy was celebrated {{on board a}} Russian ship off the Alaskan coast. In 1794, the Russian Orthodox Church sent missionaries—among them Saint Herman of Alaska—to {{establish}} a formal mission in Alaska. Their missionary endeavors contributed to the conversion of many Alaskan natives to the Orthodox faith. A diocese was established, whose first bishop was Saint Innocent of Alaska.
