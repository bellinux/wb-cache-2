5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former. The principal eyes are also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are immobile.|$|E
5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E
5|$|After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, {{joined the}} PCHA in 1914, the {{trustees}} {{issued a statement}} that the Cup was no longer for {{the best team in}} Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world. Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this time, so it was without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the day of his father.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species {{tends to}} be seasonal, {{particularly}} in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include {{the length of the}} wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are thought to be plesiomorphic (ancestral) for primates. The young are precocial (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as ungulates (hoofed mammals). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the mother's fur with their hands and feet.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the case of karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This {{would be the case}} when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.|$|E
