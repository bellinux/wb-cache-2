2500|$|Later on 8 April, Voronin {{made the}} {{following}} statement: [...] "For the first time, the Moldovan people saw the opposition openly betray {{their own people}} and their own country by taking the path of provoking open civil war. The whole country saw {{that there is no}} opposition whatsoever in Moldova — neither anti-Communist, nor anti-Voronin. There is only opposition to the state." [...] The President also commented on the displaying of Romanian flags: [...] "What <b>happened</b> <b>yesterday</b> brought indelible shame on our politicians, on the whole of our democracy. The entire Moldovan nation witnessed the greatest humiliation of its own sovereignty and its own democracy when the state standards were ripped from the flagpoles of Parliament and the President's Office and replaced with the flags of Romania." [...] In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País, Voronin claimed the professors and teachers, especially in Chişinău, have a very destructive role as [...] "continuators of Ion Antonescu".|$|E
2500|$|A key {{technique}} in improving and helping recall memory {{is to take}} advantage of Mnemonic devices and other cognitive strategies. Mnemonic devices are a type of cognitive strategy that enables individuals to memorize and recall new information in an easier fashion, rather than just having to remember a list of information that is not related to one another. An example of mnemonic devices are PEMDAS or Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally; this is a device for arithmetic when solving equations that have parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction and what order to do each calculation. Words or an acronym can stand for a process that individuals need to recall. The benefits of using these types of strategies to perform tasks are that encoding becomes more organized and it is easier to remember and process information. Also this device reduces the need of intentional resources at the point of retrieval, which means that recall does not need outside sources helping an individual remember what <b>happened</b> <b>yesterday.</b> Cognitive strategies can leverage semantic connections that will allow the brain to process and work more efficiently than just having to process the information as whole parts. By using the strategies the information becomes related to each other and the information sticks.|$|E

2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what <b>happened</b> <b>yesterday</b> were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I think the president has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E

40|$|You want to {{talk about}} climate change – change from what? Or {{invasive}} species – coming from where? To help us understand what is happening today, we need to unlock the old literature to understand what was <b>happening</b> <b>yesterday.</b> ” To understand fully the world around us as it is now we need to understand how it was before. We are fortunate in biodiversity to have more than 250 years of observations of the natural world sitting on library shelves that can help us understand how the world used to be. Or could, if we could had the time to read all 300 million pages. If humans don’t have the time, perhaps computers can help. How can we liberate the data and reveal what we already know? This talk covers some of the computing techniques developed to extract explicit data, such as taxon names and locations, as well as implicit data, such as concepts and relationships, while overcoming the problems inherent in digitising printed matter. However, just extracting data is not enough to make it usable. Hence, the talk concludes with examples of how linked open data addresses this second problem and thereby lets us reveal what we already know...|$|R

40|$|The culture someone {{grows up}} in helps to define that person, {{for better or}} for worse. This culture steeps itself into the writer's work, and helps make the writer into who he or she is. For Seamus Heaney, this {{steeping}} was done by the rich history of the Ireland that birthed him. Ireland is closely tied to its historical roots, and Heaney's poetry reflects this past-focused thinking. While others may choose to focus their writing on things in the present, Heaney mixes together the traditions that make up Ireland and goes about the present through the past. His writing works to weave together the past into the present, and through this connection Heaney does a variety of work. Some of this interweaving is to raise the past, culture and people, to a higher form, and some of it is to lower the present. Heaney's use of the past, whether through religion, family, trades, or even the land itself, contributes to comment on the present. The rhythm of life, formed through the way the past works through the present into the future, is something that Heaney plays with through his usage of the past in his poems, and therefore Heaney turns what <b>happens</b> <b>yesterday</b> into a comment on tomorrow...|$|R

5000|$|But the {{expectant}} {{person should}} {{always remember that}} [...] "every time he catches his soul not expecting victory, he knows {{he does not have}} faith." [...] Anna had a choice, the same as everyone has, and used it. Kierkegaard says, [...] Her choice is made. It did not <b>happen</b> <b>yesterday</b> or the day before yesterday so that we should be ready with our assistance to get it changed. Her choice is made, and if she has regretted it, the time of regret has been long. She chose to remain faithful to her late husband, as he had been faithful to her, or to say it another and more truthful way, even though it might not seem as beautiful to her, she chose to remain true to herself; after all, every external bond was dissolved, and only that love bound her in which she had her freedom and without which she would not have known herself again. In this fidelity, her life became very poor in variety, which some people achieve to the point of repulsiveness, but her life became fruitful for the eternal. And whatever you may think of this, my listener, it is certainly up to each individual to decide on his own, so that according to circumstances one choice may be just as commendable in its fervent love as another, but this much is certain-that the woman who is busy consoling herself over the loss of her late husband is hardly God’s choice to appear as a witness of expectancy in the hour when the expectancy of the human race has its fulfillment.
