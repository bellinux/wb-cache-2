60|$|The {{walls of}} them were painted with {{pictures}} of <b>flying</b> <b>fishes,</b> above a clear white sea, in which fish of many kinds were swimming, with the spray and bubbles flying from their tails, as the sea flows apart from the rudder of a ship. There were pictures of bull fights, men and girls teasing the bull, and throwing somersaults over him, and one bull had just tossed a girl high in the air. Ladies were painted in balconies, looking on, just such ladies as had watched Theseus and his company; and young men bearing tall cool vases full of wine were painted on other walls; and others were decorated with figures of bulls and stags, in hard plaster, fashioned marvellously, and standing out from the walls 'in relief,' as it is called. Other walls, again, were painted with patterns of leaves and flowers.|$|E

Twice I caught him with his red head against the chart in the cabin, gazing at that pin, which was always approaching and yet never reaching the African coast. At last one evening, as Captain Fourneau and I were playing ecarte in the cabin, the mate entered with an angry look upon his sunburned face.|$|E

30|$|Flying {{fish are}} {{important}} traditional fisheries resources in various Caribbean, South East Asian, and Southern Pacific regions and countries (Huang and Ou 2012). In the past, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> were economically important species for coastal fisheries, with the catch amount reaching the top twenty {{in terms of}} fisheries production in Taiwan. Darkwinged <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus cyanopyerus), Limpidwing <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cheilopogon unicolor), Spotwing <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus poecilopterus), and Stained <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cheilopogon spilonotopterus) are the main edible species caught in Taiwan (Huang and Ou 2012). Recently, Staphylococcus xylosus strain Q 2 isolated from dried <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> was a halotolerant histamine-former capable of producing > 500  ppm of histamine in culture broth without shaking at 35  °C for 24  h (Kung et al. 2015). So far, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> have never been implicated in the outbreaks of scombroid poisoning in the world. However, if the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle is contaminated with Gram-positive histamine former, such as S. xylosus, and stored at improper temperatures, {{it is important to}} be aware that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle could become a hazardous food vehicle for histamine poisoning. Currently, no information is available concerning histamine formation in contaminated <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle. This work was undertaken to study the effect of S. xylosus proliferation in <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle on histamine formation and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) under the controlled storage temperatures of − 20, 4, 15, 25, and 35 °C.|$|R

6000|$|In these [...] "Miscellanies" [...] there {{appeared}} the famous [...] "Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus," [...] written chiefly by Pope, {{in which he}} lashed the various proficients in the bathos, under the names of <b>flying</b> <b>fishes,</b> swallows, parrots, frogs, eels, &c., and appended the initials of well-known authors to each head. This roused Grub Street, whose malice had nearly fallen asleep, into fresh fury, and he was bitterly assailed in every possible form. Like Hyder Ali, he now--to travesty Burke--"in the recesses of a mind capacious of such things, determined to leave all Duncedom an everlasting monument of vengeance, and became at length so confident of his force, so collected in his might, that he made no secret whatever of his dreadful resolution, but, compounding all the materials of fun, sarcasm, irony, and invective, into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of Richmond Hill; and whilst the authors were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon, it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of its contents on the garrets of Grub Street. Then issued a scene of (ludicrous) woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of literary war before known or heard of--(MacFlecknoe, the Rehearsal, &c.)--were mercy to the new tempest of havoc which burst from the brain of this remorseless poet. A storm of universal laughter filled every bookseller's shop, and penetrated into the remotest attics. The miserable dunces, in part, were stricken mad with rage--in part, dumb with consternation. Some fled for refuge to ale, and others to ink; while not a few fell, or feared to fall, into the 'jaws of famine.'" [...] This singular poem was written in 1727. It was first printed surreptitiously (i.e., with the connivance of the author) in Dublin, and then reprinted in London. The first perfect edition, however, did not appear in London till 1729. On the day of its publication, according to Pope, a crowd of authors besieged the publisher's shop; and by entreaties, threats, nay, cries of treason, tried to hinder its appearance. What a scene it must have been--of teeth gnashing above ragged coats, and eyes glaring through old periwigs--of faces livid with famine and ferocity; while, to complete the confusion, hawkers, booksellers, and even lords, were mixed with the crowd, clamouring for its issue! And as, says Pope, [...] "there is no stopping a torrent with a finger, out it came." [...] The consequence he had foreseen. A universal howl of rage and pain burst from the aggrieved dunces, on whose naked sides the hot pitch had fallen. They pushed their rejoinders {{beyond the limits of}} civilised literary warfare; and although Pope had been coarse in his language, they were coarser far, and their blackguardism was not redeemed by wit or genius. Pope felt, or seemed to feel, entire indifference as to these assaults. On some of them, indeed, he could afford to look down with contempt, on account of their obvious animus and gross language. Others, again, were neutralised by the fact, that their authors had provoked reprisals by their previous insults or ingratitude to Pope. Many, however, were too obscure for his notice; and some, such as Aaron Hill and Bentley, did not deserve to be classed with the Theobalds and Ralphs. To Hill, he, after some finessing, was compelled to make an apology. Altogether, although this production increased Pope's fame, and the conception of his power, it did not tend to shew him in the most amiable light, or perhaps to promote his own comfort or peace of mind. After having emptied out his bile in [...] "The Dunciad," [...] he ought to have become mellower in temper, and resigned satire for ever. He continued, on the contrary, as ill-natured as before; and although he afterwards flew at higher game, the iron had entered into his soul, and he remained a satirist, and therefore an unhappy man, for life.|$|E

30|$|In this study, it {{demonstrated}} that hazardous levels of histamine could be formed by S. xylosus in <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat when stored at temperatures above 15 °C. Flying fish {{may become a}} hazardous food if the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat is contaminated with histamine formers, such as S. xylosus, and exposed to temperatures above 15  °C. However, the formation of histamine by S. xylosus in samples stored at 4 °C after 96  h was negligible. Although histamine was not detected in any frozen samples, it accumulated rapidly in the previously frozen <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat and once thawed and stored at 25 °C. It is suggested that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat should be stored below 4  °C to control histamine production.|$|R
30|$|Histamine is {{the main}} causative agent of scombroid poisoning. However, unlike scombroid fish, {{histamine}} poisoning due to consumption of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> has never been reported. In this study, the white muscle of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> had high levels of free histidine at approximately 423.9  mg/ 100  g, and was inoculated with Staphylococcus xylosus Q 2 isolated from dried <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> at 5.0 log CFU/g and stored at − 20 to 35 °C to investigate histamine-related quality. The histamine contents quickly increased to higher than 50  mg/ 100  g in samples stored at 25 and 35 °C within 12  h as well as stored at 15 °C within 48  h. However, bacterial growth and histamine formation were controlled by cold storage of the samples at 4 °C or below. Once the frozen <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> samples stored at − 20 °C for 2  months were thawed and stored at 25 °C after 24  h, histamine started to accumulate rapidly (> 50  mg/ 100  g of <b>fish).</b> Therefore, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle was a good substrate for histamine formation by bacterial histidine decarboxylation at elevated temperatures (> 15 °C) when it is contaminated with S. xylosus. In conclusion, since the improperly contaminated <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle with S. xylosus could lead to production of hazardous levels of histamine over time when stored at temperatures > 15 °C, the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> should be stored below 4  °C or below to control proliferation of S. xylosus, and TVBN and histamine production.|$|R

50|$|Like other ommastrephids and onychoteuthids {{known as}} 'flying squid', neon flying squid are so named {{for their ability}} to shoot out of the water, much like <b>flying</b> <b>fishes.</b> They {{sometimes}} unintentionally land on the decks of ships. This happens more frequently during rough weather or in the presence of predators in the vicinity, and it is presumed that this behavior is an instinctive response to threat. Flying squid have been observed to engage in behaviors that prolong the time it remains in the air, making it more akin to actual flight than just gliding. Biologists, however, still do not fully understand the exact mechanisms by which the squid become airborne. Nevertheless, the phenomenon is known to happen quite frequently and at least one photographic evidence of Ommastrephes bartramii in flight exists.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} the foraging habitats {{of the winter}} breeding community of tropical seabirds from Europa Island (Mozambique Channel) in September 2003. We focused our study on the dominant species of this austral community, the sooty tern (Sterna fuscata), the red-footed booby (Sula sula), and the frigatebirds, including the great (Fregata minor) and the lesser fri-gatebirds (F. ariel). We considered the at-sea distribu-tion and abundance of these species in relation to chlorophyll concentration, sea-surface temperatures, sea-surface height anomalies, depth of the thermocline, distance to the colony, and presence of surface marine predators, <b>flying</b> <b>fishes</b> and other seabirds. Although the marine environment where seabirds foraged was oligo-trophic, it presents the best feeding opportunities for seabirds for the area in winter. Our study demonstrates that the winter-breeding seabird species of Europa Is-land tend to forage in productive waters in association with other marine predators when possible. Sooty terns and frigatebirds were widely distributed in the whole study area, whereas red-footed boobies were not found farther than 160 km from their colonies and were asso-ciated with relatively productive waters. Sooty terns and red-footed boobies were aggregated where <b>flying</b> <b>fishes</b> were abundant. The presence of other marine predators was associated with larger multispecies feeding flocks than when no association occurred. Sooty terns, which are numerically dominant at Europa and adopted net-work foraging, seem to be catalysts of feeding events, and represented a good target for the other foraging species, especially frigatebirds. However, when possible, frigatebirds favour association with flocks of red-footed boobies...|$|E
