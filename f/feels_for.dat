5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely <b>feels</b> <b>for.</b> While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also <b>feels,</b> <b>for</b> whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E

Seeing Silvia, Thurio claims her as his, but Valentine warns Thurio that if he makes one move toward her, he will kill him. Terrified, Thurio renounces Silvia.

25|$|Hamlet {{struggles to}} turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends {{a large portion of}} the play waiting rather than doing. Scholars have {{proposed}} numerous theories as to why he waits so long to kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet <b>feels</b> <b>for</b> his victim, fearing to strike because he believes that if he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet the darker side of revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for their passion, intensity, and lack of logical thought.|$|E
25|$|Whedon made a {{conscious}} effort to focus on Willow and Tara's relationship instead of either's identity as a lesbian or the coming out process. When Willow discloses to Buffy what she <b>feels</b> <b>for</b> Tara, she indicates that she has fallen in love with Tara, not that she is a lesbian, and avoids categorizing herself. Some critics regard this as a failure on Willow's part to be strong; Em McAvan interprets this to mean that Willow may be bisexual. Scholar Farah Mendlesohn asserts that Willow's realization that she is in love with Tara allows viewers to re-interpret Willow's relationship with Buffy; in the first three seasons, Willow is often disappointed that she is not a higher priority to Buffy, and even after Willow enters a relationship with Tara, still desires to feel integral to Buffy's cause and the Scooby Gang.|$|E

Rāma {{is pleased to}} be in the city of Mithilā, but the other kings who have come in Sītā's Svayaṃvara are not pleased about his arrival. The people of Mithilā {{experience}} bliss in seeing Rāma. When Janaka asks Viśvāmitra about the two princes, Viśvāmitra introduces Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Janaka. Janaka takes both princes to his palace and welcomes them. Later Lakṣmaṇa wishes to see the city of Mithilā and Rāma accompanies him. The children of Mithilā take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa around the city, and embrace Rāma in the end. Early morning on the next day, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa go to the royal garden of Janaka to get flowers for Viśvāmitra's worship. Sītā arrives in the same garden to worship Pārvatī on the day before her Svayaṃvara. Sītā and Rāma see each other for the first time when they come face-to-face in the garden. Rāma tells Lakṣmaṇa about the attraction he <b>feels</b> <b>for</b> Sītā. He tells Lakṣmaṇa that Sītā must be his wife in future, for even in his dreams his mind never longs for the wife of another. Lakṣmaṇa then bows to Sītā, thinking of her as his mother. Sītā worships Rāma in her mind and then departs for her palace after worshipping Pārvatī. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa return to Viśvāmitra and worship him with the flowers from Janaka's royal garden. Rāma tells Viśvāmitra everything about the attraction he felt for Sītā. Viśvāmitra blesses Rāma and goes to sleep. Rāma is awake in the night, admiring the beauty of the moon which reminds him of the face of Sītā.|$|E

With The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex {{published}} in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented sexual selection to explain impractical animal features such as the peacock's plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural racial characteristics, while emphasising that humans are all one species. His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, {{one of the first}} books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the evolution of human psychology and its continuity with the behaviour of animals. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that [...] "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."
