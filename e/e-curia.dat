5000|$|The European Union, {{for example}} {{has created the}} e-Justice Portal through which {{legislation}} case law and legal information may be accessed. [...] The European Union also offers two other cyberjustice services, namely e-CODEX, which simplifies cross-border litigations by providing access to electronic delivery services, electronic signatures, electronic payments, electronic authentication and electronic documents, and <b>e-CURIA,</b> which is essentially just an e-filing system. Additionally, other countries within the European Union have incorporated certain technologies into their adjudication of justice, such as the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. For its part, the United Kingdom is most renowned for its Money Claim Online (MCOL), which is a service that allows a claim to be instituted online against two people at most who owe up {{to a maximum of}} Â£100,000 that they refuse to pay. [...] Italy, on the other hand, offers Trial Online, which is essentially an electronic filing and case management system simultaneously. Finally, Spain has passed particular laws whose aim is to regulate technology used in conjunction with the legal system and has ultimately resulted in the incorporation of technology in the legal system for the purposes of treating data and managing legal files, {{not the least of which}} is LexNET which enables the secure transfer of judicial data.|$|E
