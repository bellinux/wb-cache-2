5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant <b>Elicitor</b> Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E
2500|$|Fear of {{the unknown}} or irrational fear is caused by {{negative}} thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear like any other fears share common neural pathway that engages to mobilize bodily resources {{in the face of}} threat. Many people are scared of the [...] "unknown". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years, or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the <b>elicitor</b> stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use False Evidence Appearing Real as a definition. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. E.g. Continuation of scholarly education, most educators perceive this as a risk that may cause them fear and stress and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research, this can lead to habits such as laziness and procrastination. The ambiguity of a situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety, other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly. E.g. War-ridden or Conflict places, Terrorism, Abuse ...etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate children's psyche development or personality. E.g. Parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment that it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required. Developing [...] a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.|$|E

Moreover, child reactivity to animal and sociomoral <b>elicitors</b> and contamination correlated with parental responsiveness. Finally, young children who failed to demonstrate contagion and conservation knowledge were as reactive to core <b>elicitors</b> and contamination as children of the same age who demonstrated such knowledge.

The copalyl diphosphate synthase of S. miltiorrhiza (SmCPS) is the key enzyme in the first step for transformation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into miltiradiene, which has recently been identified as the precursor of tanshinones.

Taking advantage of the plant natural immune system by using plant defence <b>elicitors</b> is an interesting avenue to explore.

The protection efficacy against gray mold and the modes of action of potential <b>elicitors</b> were studied on tomato. Modulation of plant defense was studied using both global and targeted metabolic profiling. We identified seven potential <b>elicitors</b> showing good plant protection efficacy and able to trigger the oxylipin pathway, including jasmonic acid production, after inoculation with Botrytis cinerea. Following preliminary assays, seven <b>elicitors</b> including two well-studied <b>elicitors</b> (Bion 50 WG® and BABA) showing good plant protection efficacy and low fungitoxic effect were selected to assay the effect of abiotic stresses (wounding, water stress and nitrogen deficiency) on their protection efficacy. Our results showed that the protection efficacy of all products was reduced when plants were exposed to abiotic stresses, suggesting an antagonistic interaction between the tomato responses to abiotic stresses and product treatments. We found that responses to leaf cuttings and product treatments induced metabolic changes in a time-dependent manner, and that both of which mainly activated the oxylipin and JA pathway. However, the negative effects of wounding on tomato protection efficacy of defence <b>elicitors</b> suggest that interplay with other antagonistic signalling pathways is also involved in the tomato responses to this combination of stress...|$|R
40|$|To defend {{themselves}} against invading pathogens plants utilize a complex regulatory network that coordinates extensive transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming. Although many of the key players of this immunity-associated network are known, the details of its topology and dynamics are still poorly understood. As an alternative to forward and reverse genetic studies, chemical genetics-related approaches based on bioactive small molecules have gained substantial popularity {{in the analysis of}} biological pathways and networks. Use of such molecular probes can allow researchers to access biological space that was previously inaccessible to genetic analyses due to gene redundancy or lethality of mutations. Synthetic <b>elicitors</b> are small drug like molecules that induce plant defense responses, but are distinct from known natural <b>elicitors</b> of plant immunity.

Cryptogein as well as harpin induced stomatal closure, while elevating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in the guard cells of A. thaliana. Kinetic studies with fluorescent dyes revealed that the rise in ROS levels preceded that of NO in guard cells, when treated with these two <b>elicitors.</b> The restriction of NO levels in guard cells, even by ROS modulators indicates the essentiality of ROS for NO production during elicitor-triggered stomatal closure.
