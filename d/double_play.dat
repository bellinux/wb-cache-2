5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a <b>double</b> <b>play</b> or triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a <b>double</b> <b>play</b> or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1991 season, Memorial Stadium, the Orioles' {{home since}} 1954, saw its last MLB game against the Tigers. Ripken was the last Oriole to bat at the stadium, hitting into a <b>double</b> <b>play</b> against Detroit's Frank Tanana on Oct 6, 1991.|$|E
5|$|Tinker, Evers, and Chance {{began playing}} {{together}} with the Cubs in 1902, and formed a <b>double</b> <b>play</b> combination that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the National League pennant four times from 1906 and 1910 (and the 1907 and 1908 World Series), often defeating the Giants {{en route to the}} World Series.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>plays.</b> In 1887, Bennett {{broke the}} career {{record for most}} <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> turned as a catcher. His final career total of 114 <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> was the major league record until 1900.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Double</b> <b>plays.</b> Zimmer's 16 <b>doubles</b> <b>plays</b> as {{a catcher}} in 1895 broke the Major League record, and in 1900 he also broke Charlie Bennett's Major League {{record for most}} career <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> as a catcher.|$|R
25|$|<b>Double</b> <b>plays</b> as catcher. In 1904, McGuire broke Chief Zimmer's {{record for}} most <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> turned as catcher. McGuire's final total of 143 <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> {{remained}} the major league record until 1920 when it was broken by Steve O'Neill.|$|R
5|$|In {{baseball}} statistics tie-breakers {{count as}} regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, Mike Piazza grounded into his 27th <b>double</b> <b>play</b> {{of the season}} in the 9th inning, adding to his league-leading total. Similarly, Leiter's performance advanced his position on several 1999 statistical leaderboards including shutouts and walks issued. Reese, Ventura, and Ordóñez won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for the season while Piazza and Alfonzo won Silver Sluggers. Robin Ventura also finished sixth in Most Valuable Player voting, with Chipper Jones taking the award.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a <b>double</b> <b>play.</b> Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E
5|$|Lowe {{suffered}} {{a knee injury}} late in the 1902 season, providing Evers with more playing time. Tinker, Evers, and Chance first appeared in a game together on September 13, 1902. They turned their first <b>double</b> <b>play</b> on September 15, 1902. Lowe's injury did not properly heal during the offseason, making Evers the new permanent second baseman for the Cubs in 1903. Chance succeeded Selee as manager during the 1905 season when Selee became ill.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a <b>double</b> <b>play</b> after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|In , the Dodgers won a close pennant {{race against}} the Braves and the Giants, then beat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. Koufax pitched two perfect relief innings in the Series opener, though they {{came after the}} Dodgers were already behind 11–0. Alston gave him the start in the fifth game, at the Los Angeles Coliseum in front of 92,706 fans. Koufax allowed only one run in seven innings, but lost the 1–0 game when Nellie Fox scored on a <b>double</b> <b>play.</b> Returning to Chicago, the Dodgers won the sixth game and the Series.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 spring training, Huff {{competed with}} Brandon Belt and Brett Pill for the Giants' first base job. Belt won the job, and Huff {{opened the season}} as the Giants' left fielder. He had two hits and three RBI on April 13, {{including}} a two-run home run against Joel Hanrahan in a 50 victory over Pittsburgh. On April 21, because the Giants {{did not have any}} infielders available, Huff was positioned at second base {{for the first time in}} his career in the ninth inning of a tied game against the Mets. He failed to cover second base in a potential <b>double</b> <b>play</b> situation, and the Mets went on to win the first game of the doubleheader 54. After the game, on April 25, Huff was placed on the 15-day disabled list with anxiety issues.|$|E
50|$|In his {{minor league}} career, he led California League {{catchers}} with 18 <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> and 38 passed balls while {{playing for the}} Stockton Ports in 1962, and led Eastern League catchers with 17 <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> while playing for the Elmira Pioneers in 1963.|$|R
50|$|During his Gold Glove {{season of}} 1971, Helms set a Reds record turning 130 <b>double</b> <b>plays.</b> He led National League second basemen in <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> in 1969 and 1971, fielding {{percentage}} in 1970, 1971 and 1974 and assists in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|May 20: Detroit {{second baseman}} Jerry Priddy started a record five <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> {{in the first}} 5 innings to lead the Tigers to a 5-3 win over the A's. Shortstop Johnny Lipon participated in all the <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> to tie an AL record.|$|R
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1. After the third out, the Dodgers came back to the plate. Reese {{grounded}} out, but Snider and Robinson hit back-to-back singles. Campanella grounded into a <b>double</b> <b>play</b> to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled with two outs. Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca on the mound, {{and ended}} the inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore. In {{the top of the}} fifth, Reese and Bruce Edwards singled, and Schultz grounded out on a bunt. Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into a <b>double</b> <b>play,</b> ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe on the mound, and retired the side in order. The sixth inning contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was stranded on first after hitting a single.|$|E
5|$|Now {{trailing}} by five runs, the Angels threatened {{again in}} the eighth inning with runners on second and third, but Hudler grounded out to end the threat. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had the bases loaded when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, and finally a sacrifice fly <b>double</b> <b>play</b> hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E
5000|$|June 11, 1887: Detroit's Fred Dunlap {{established}} a National League record by starting four <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> at second base. He participated in five <b>double</b> <b>plays</b> in all {{to tie the}} existing major league mark and helps the Wolverines edge the Hoosiers‚ 7-6.|$|R

5|$|Philadelphia {{scored the}} first runs {{of the series}} when Chase Utley {{hit a home run}} with Jayson Werth on base {{in the top of the}} first inning. Tampa Bay loaded the bases in the bottom of the third inning; however, Upton {{grounded}} into an inning-ending <b>double</b> <b>play</b> and the score remained 20. The Phillies extended their lead when Carlos Ruiz batted in Victorino in the fourth inning. A solo home run from Carl Crawford pulled the Rays back within two runs. Tampa Bay added their second run the following inning on an RBI double by Akinori Iwamura. Philadelphia starter Cole Hamels pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs, while Brad Lidge recorded his 47th consecutive save in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine <b>double</b> <b>play.</b> He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E

5|$|In {{the history}} of the Gold Glove Award, there have been eleven double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders, that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend upon each other for the {{majority}} of double plays. The most common type of <b>double</b> <b>play</b> occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out. Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Brandon Crawford and Joe Panik, who won with the San Francisco Giants in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Mark Teixeira {{tied the}} game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another solo homer. Martínez {{departed}} the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston, Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending <b>double</b> <b>play.</b> This was the first of two calls by Gorman in this game which were later shown to have been wrong by video replays.|$|E
5|$|Pérez was {{originally}} {{signed by the}} Colorado Rockies in 1992. Frequently praised for his defensive skills, Pérez reached the major leagues in 1996 and become the Rockies' shortstop for good in 1997. Over the next three years, he scarcely missed a game and won a Gold Glove in 2000. During 2001, he {{was traded to the}} Kansas City Royals, where he also played in 2002. The trade proved to be unpopular with both teams, and Pérez joined the San Francisco Giants for 2003 and 2004. He lost his starting job during the 2004 season and was released during that year. Pérez then signed with the Chicago Cubs, whom he finished the season with and spent most of the next two years with. He was the Cubs' starting shortstop in 2005 but was used as a reserve player in 2006 before getting traded to the Detroit Tigers during the year. He finished his career in 2007 with the Tigers. As a Tiger, he turned a <b>double</b> <b>play</b> which saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter, but he also had a series of positive tests for amphetamines which effectively ended his career.|$|E
