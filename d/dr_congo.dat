5|$|In the 19th century, {{the valley}} was {{dominated}} by the Kingdom of Lunda of Mwata Kazembe. The boundaries of the province between Zambia and <b>DR</b> <b>Congo</b> were disputed for many years, running from an 1894 treaty into the late 1960s. The province {{has a long history}} of opposing colonial rule through militancy. From the 1950s, there were revolutionary groups that supported the Anti Federationist African National Congress. Post independence, the province was the base for the United National Independence Party (UNIP) militants. Laupula has constant migration of labour from <b>DR</b> <b>Congo</b> and also from nearby Copperbelt Province. During the 1980s, the then President Kenneth Kaunda appointed traditional Chiefs of the region as District Governors or members of the powerful UNIP central committee. The practice was seen similar to colonial rule when local leaders were drafted to political domain. Mwata Kazambe was appointed the District Governor for the province by the President during the 1980s.|$|E

Concerns about the success of the project were voiced in 2008, when the disaster of Hewa Bora Airways Flight 122 revealed serious aviation safety flaws in the <b>DR</b> <b>Congo.</b> As a consequence, Hewa Bora was banned from operating within the European Union (any air carriers from the <b>DR</b> <b>Congo</b> had already been included in the EU blacklist since 2006 due to a lack or regulatory oversight in the country, but there had been an exception for Hewa Bora's Brussels service).
