40|$|AbstractFine {{particulate}} matter (PM 2. 5) {{is a growing}} public health concern especially in industrializing countries but existing monitoring networks are unable to properly characterize human exposures due to low resolution spatiotemporal data. Low-cost portable monitors can supplement existing networks in both developed and industrializing regions to increase density of sites and data. This study tests {{the performance of a}} low-cost sensor in high concentration urban environments. Seven Portable University of Washington Particle (PUWP) monitors were calibrated with optical and <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 2. 5 reference monitors in Xi'an, China in December 2013. Pairwise correlations between the raw PUWP and the reference monitors were high (R 2  =  0. 86 – 0. 89). PUWP monitors were also simultaneously deployed at eight sites across Xi'an alongside <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 2. 5 monitors (R 2  =  0. 53). The PUWP monitors were able to identify the High-technology Zone site as a potential PM 2. 5 hotspot with sustained high concentrations compared to the city average throughout the day...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{particulate}} matter (PM) emission of light-duty vehicles (LDVs) {{is a complex}} issue with many stakeholders, including engine manufacturers, health effect scientists, climatologists and regulatory agencies. With particulate emission regulatory limits in California and United States decreased by more than two orders of magnitude since the 80 s, efforts continue to investigate alternatives to the gravimetric method for quantification of LDVs PM emission. Several alternative metrics including total particle number (TPN), solid particle number (SPN), black carbon (BC), and particle surface (PS) area were measured along with <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> mass to study the correlation between different methods, {{using a variety of}} LDVs chosen to represent different emission levels and a range of current technologies in the modern fleet. It was found that <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> mass is strongly dependent on chemical nature of the PM. Thus correlations of gravimetrically determined PM mass with alternative metrics were different between two different testing cycles (e. g. FTP vs SFPT-US 06). Alternative metrics are free from such cycle dependency which is due to adsorption artifact and therefore considered as a good future metric or supplemental metric such as SPN for EU regulation. Particle surface (PS) area turned out to be very sensitive with wide range and current instrumentation has a room to improve in terms of measuring tunnel blank and reducing electrometer drift...|$|R

Children’s exposure to PM is likely to involve both combustion-related ambient PM and PM related to a child’s activity in various indoor and outdoor microenvironments. Among 19 children with asthma, 9 – 17 years of age, we examined the relationship of temporal changes in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) to personal continuous PM exposure and to 24 -hr average <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> mass measured at home and central sites. Subjects were followed for 2 weeks during either the fall of 1999 or the spring of 2000, in a southern California region affected by transported air pollution.

40|$|Great {{uncertainty}} exists around indoor biomass burning exposure-disease relationships {{due to lack}} {{of detailed}} exposure data in large health outcome studies. Passive nephelometers can be used to estimate high particulate matter (PM) concentrations during cooking in low resource environments. Since passive nephelometers do not have a collection filter they are not subject to sampler overload. Nephelometric concentration readings can be biased due to particle growth in high humid environments and differences in compositional and size dependent aerosol characteristics. This paper explores relative humidity (RH) and gravimetric equivalency adjustment approaches to be used for the pDR- 1000 used to assess indoor PM concentrations for a cookstove intervention trial in Nepal. Three approaches to humidity adjustment performed equivalently (similar root mean squared error). For gravimetric conversion, the new linear regression equation with log-transformed variables performed better than the traditional linear equation. In addition, gravimetric conversion equations utilizing a spline or quadratic term were examined. We propose a humidity adjustment equation encompassing the entire RH range instead of adjusting for RH above an arbitrary 60 % threshold. Furthermore, we propose new integrated RH and gravimetric conversion methods because they have one response variable (<b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 2. 5 concentration), do not contain an RH threshold, and is straightforward...|$|R
40|$|By {{extending}} {{the method of}} Stedman (1998), daily data of atmospheric concentrations of <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 10, black smoke (BS) and sulphate aerosol (SA) from national networks were analysed to determine the trends in time of the contribution of different sources of particulate matter to total PM 10 measured in central Edinburgh. Since BS is an indicator of combustion-related primary sources of particulate matter, the quantity obtained by subtraction of daily BS from daily PM 10 {{is indicative of the}} contribution to total PM 10 from other primary sources and from secondary aerosol. This PM 10 -BS statistic was regressed on SA, since SA is an indicator of variation in secondary aerosol source. For Edinburgh, SA is a considerably better indicator of PM 10 -BS during summer than winter (reflecting the much greater photochemical generation of secondary aerosol in summer) and there is evidence that the contribution of other secondary aerosol (presumably nitrate aerosol) has increased relative to SA between 1992 and 1997. The concentration of non-combustion primary particulate material (marine aerosol, suspended dust) to PM 10 in Edinburgh has not changed over this period but is about twice that calculated as the U. K. national average. The increasing input to PM 10 from secondary aerosol sources at regional rather than urban scale has important implications for ensuring local air quality compliance. The method should have general applicability to other locations...|$|R

As part of an epidemiologic study of inner-city children with asthma, continuous (10 -min average) measurements of particle concentrations were made for 2 -week periods in 294 homes drawn from seven cities. Measurements were made using an optical scattering device that is most sensitive to fine particles. The concentrations recorded by these devices were corrected to agree with colocated outdoor <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 2. 5 monitors. Indoor concentrations in the homes averaged 27. 7 (standard deviation = 35. 9) µg/m 3, compared with concurrent outdoor concentrations of 13. 6 (7. 5) µg/m 3. A multivariate model indicated that outdoor particles penetrated indoors with an efficiency of 0. 48 and were therefore responsible for only 25 % of the mean indoor concentration. The major indoor source was smoking, which elevated indoor concentrations by 37 µg/m 3 in the 101 homes with smokers. Other significant sources included frying, smoky cooking events, use of incense, and apartment housing, although the increases due to these events ranged only from 3 to 6 µg/m 3. The 10 -min averaging time allowed calculation of an average diurnal variation, showing large increases in the evening due to smoking and smaller increases at meal times due to cooking.

40|$|Air {{scrubbers}} {{are commonly}} used for removal of ammonia and odor from exhaust air of animal houses in the Netherlands. In addition, air scrubbers remove {{a part of the}} particulate matter. In this article, the results of an on-farm monitoring are presented in which PM 10 removal was monitored at 24 scrubbers. It was found that scrubbers with long air contact times (empty bed residence time (EBRT) > 3 s) achieved relatively high PM 10 removal efficiencies (on average 79 %). However, at short air contact times (EBRT < 3 s), efficiencies were lower (on average 49 %). As dust particles travel through the humid scrubber environment, they grow in size and mass, which increases their chance of being intercepted and removed from the air. The results suggest that the maximum particle size is reached within this period of 3 s, but a controlled experimental setup is required to prove this assumption. Possible formation of salt aerosols inside the scrubbers may have affected measured removal efficiencies, especially for acid scrubbers, that are operated at EBRT < 3 s. As multistage scrubbers have a higher average air residence time, they show a higher PM 10 removal efficiency than acid scrubbers and bioscrubbers. In addition, it is suggested that the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 10 determination method might need to be improved to eliminate the effect of differences in moisture levels between scrubber inlet and outlet air on particle cutoff...|$|R

The candidate systems were designed around the minimum requirements of allowing a gravimetric {{determination of the}} total emitted PM mass and incorporating a real time particle sensor. All PEMS-PM systems were found to reproduce within ± 30 % the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> results determined with reference measurement systems under non-regenerative operating conditions, at emission levels lying at and above the Euro VI limit of 10 mg/kWh. The use of prolonged sampling times envisaged in In Service Conformity (ISC) testing (> 120 min) {{was found to be}} beneficial, as it reduced the limit of detection of the PEMS-PM instrumentation to 1 - 3 mg/kWh (120 min) from 3 to 9 mg/kWh (30 min). The real time aerosol instrumentation exhibited a much higher sensitivity, being capable of quantifying emission levels below the EURO VI particle number limit of 6 × 1011 #/kWh. Some modifications were required though in two particle sensors that were based on diffusion charging, in order to avoid a disproportional increase in their responses in the presence of homogeneously nucleated particles. Passive regeneration of the particulate filter resulted in excessive emission of volatile PM but also large discrepancies between the PEMS-PM and reference systems. The accurate quantification of absolute emission levels of non-volatile PM from the real time sensors can assist in the identification of such excessive volatile PM fractions, to avoid properly working DPF systems to fail an ISC test.

Evidence suggests that metals {{play a role in}} the cardiotoxicity of fine PM (PM 2. 5) and in exposure-related decreases in heart rate variability (HRV). We examined the association between daytime exposure to the metal content of PM 2. 5 and night HRV in a panel study of boilermaker construction workers exposed to metal-rich welding fumes. MethodsTwenty-six male workers were monitored by ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) on a workday while exposed to welding fume and a non-workday (baseline). From the ECG, rMSSD (square root of the mean squared differences of successive intervals) was summarized over the night (0 : 0022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 7 : 00). Workday, <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 2. 5 samples were analyzed by x-ray fluorescence to determine metal content. We used linear mixed effects models to assess the associations between night rMSSD and PM 2. 5 metal exposures both with and without adjustment for total PM 2. 5. Matched ECG measurements from the non-workday were used to control for individual cardiac risk factors and models were also adjusted for smoking status. To address collinearity between PM 2. 5 and metal content, we used a two-step approach that treated the residuals from linear regression models of each metal on PM 2. 5 as surrogates for the differential effects of metal exposures in models for night rMSSD. ResultsThe median PM 2. 5 exposure was 650 /m 3; median metal exposures for iron, manganese, aluminum, copper, zinc, chromium, lead, and nickel ranged from 226 /m 3 to non-detectable.

Fine PM was less affected by indoor sources, exerting a major impact on the PM 1 – 2. 5 fraction. Over half of the indoor fine particles were estimated to originate from outdoors.

PQ 100 gravimetric sampler with a US EPA certified Graseby Andersen PM 10 inlet; an Airmetrics Minivol static gravimetric sampler; a Casella cyclone gravimetric personal sampler; an Institute of Occupational Medicine <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 10 personal sampler; and two TSI Inc. Dustrak real-time optical scattering personal samplers. For 24 h sampling of ambient PM 10 concentrations around 10 microg m(- 3), the estimated measurement uncertainty for the two gravimetric personal samplers was larger (approximately +/- 20 %) compared with estimated measurement uncertainty for the PQ 100 /Graseby Andersen sampler (< +/- 5 %). Measurement uncertainty for the Dustraks was lower (approximately +/- 15 % on average) but calibration of the optical response against a reference PM 10 method is essential since the Dustraks systematically over-read PM 10 determined gravimetrically by a factor approximately 2. 2. However, once calibrated, the Dustrak devices demonstrated excellent functionality in terms of ease of portability and real-time data acquisition. Estimated measurement uncertainty for PM 10 concentrations determined with the Minivol were +/- 5 %. The Minivol data correlated well with PQ 100 /Graseby Andersen data (r= 0. 97, n = 18) but were, on average, 23 % greater. The reason for the systematic discrepancy could not be traced. Intercomparison experiments such as these are essential for assessing measurement error and revealing systematic bias. Application of two Dustraks demonstrated the spatial and temporal variability of exposure to PM 10 in different walking and transport microenvironments in the city of Edinburgh, UK. For example, very large exposures to PM 10 were identified for the lower deck of a double-decker tour bus compared with the open upper deck of the same vehicle.

40|$|Particle number {{concentration}} (PNC) and transition metal content are {{implicated in the}} health effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) but they are difficult to measure so consequently their temporal and spatial variations are not well characterized. Daily concentrations of PNC and particle-bound water-soluble metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, As, Cd and Pb) were measured at background and kerbside sites in Glasgow and London to examine if other metrics of air pollution such as optical darkness (absorbance) of collected filter samples of <b>PM,</b> <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM,</b> and NO, NO 2 and CO gas concentrations, can be used as surrogates for the temporal and spatial variations of the former. NO 2 and NOx exhibited a high degree of within-site correlation and with PNC and water-soluble metals (Fe, Cu, As, Cd, Pb) at background sites in both cities. There is therefore potential to use NO 2 and NOx as surrogates for PNC and water-soluble metal at background sites. However, correlation was weaker in complex street canyon environments where pollutant concentrations are strongly affected by local sources and the small-scale variations in pollutant dispersion induced by the wind regimes within street canyons. The corollary of the high correlation between NO 2 and PNC and water-soluble metals at the background sites is that the latter pollutants may act as confounders for health effects attributed to NO 2 from such sites. Concentrations of CO cannot be used as a surrogate for PNC. Increments in daily NOx and NO 2 concentrations between trafficked and background sites were shown to be a simple and novel surrogate for daily spatial variation of PNC; for example, increments in NOx explained 78 – 79 % of the variance in PNC at the paired sites in both Glasgow and London, but relationships were city specific. The increments in NOx also explained 70 % of the spatial variation in Cu and Ni in Glasgow but not in London. Weekly NO 2 measurements derived from passive diffusion tubes were also shown to correlate well with increments in PNC. A high temporal correlation between PNC and 1, 3 -butadiene and benzene (which can also be measured by passive sampler) implies that passive sampler measurements may be a straightforward tool for deriving long-term spatial patterns in PNC...|$|R

This stark difference in living conditions creates different public health challenges for Ulaanbaatar residents. Through this research study we aim to test our hypothesis that women living in gers burning coal in traditional stoves for cooking and heating during the winter are exposed to higher concentrations of airborne PM 2. 5 than women living in apartments in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and this exposure may include exposures to lead in coal with effects on blood lead levels. This cross sectional study recruited a total of 50 women, 40 – 60 years of age, from these two settings.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Background: Walk-in-line {{pedestrians}} {{crossing the}} U. S. -Mexico border northbound at the San Ysidro, CA Port of Entry ("Border Commuters") {{may be at}} {{an increased risk of}} experiencing elevated traffic-related air pollution, including diesel exhaust (DE). DE exposure has been associated with numerous adverse health effects, particularly cardiovascular and respiratory problems, including as lung cancer. Pedestrian crossers wait in line for extended periods and stand within 10 feet of highly concentrated traffic, particularly to diesel buses. Understanding the magnitude of traffic-related exposures is important for this vulnerable population. It was hypothesized that subjects who reside in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico and cross the border as a pedestrian will experience higher exposure to traffic-related pollutants than those who live and work in South San Diego, CA, USA and do not cross the border. Methods: Ninety-one participants were enrolled for this study; 80 % were "Border Commuters" and 20 % were "Non-Border Commuters". "Non-Border Commuters" served as the comparison group and were defined as residents who lived in or near and worked or went to school in San Ysidro, CA but did not cross the border. Questionnaires, time activity diaries, and urine samples were collected from all participants. Of the "Border Commuters", 56 personal 24 -hour PM 2. 5 and 1 -nitropyrene (1 -NP) - a marker for diesel exhaust - samples were collected. There were 22 at-home indoor and 14 at-home outdoor 1 -NP samples collected. Additionally, area samples collected at the border included 35 days of 1 -NP, black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and ultrafine particulate matter (UFP). Of the "Non-Border Commuters", 15 personal 24 -hour PM 2. 5 and 1 -NP samples were collected. Additonally, 3 at-home indoor and outdoor 24 -hour 1 -NP samples were collected. Results: Personal exposure to PM 2. 5 was nearly 2 -fold higher among "Border Commuters" compared to "Non-Border Commuters" (39 ± 30 μg/m 3 vs 21 ± 11 μg/m 3), while personal exposure to 1 -NP was more than 8 -fold higher among the "Border Commuters"(1. 7 ± 2. 6 vs 0. 22 ± 0. 21 pg/m 3, p< 0. 01, Mann-Whitney). Two metabolites of 1 -NP were readily detected in urine samples, the most abundant of which was 8 -hydroxy- 1 -nitropyrene (8 -OHNP). "Border Commuters" had greater than a 2 -fold higher concentration of 8 -OHNP (0. 071 ± 0. 066 vs 0. 032 ± 0. 021 pg/mL, p= 0. 05, Mann-Whitney) and a 3 -fold higher concentration of 8 -OHNAAP (0. 063 ± 0. 11 vs 0. 021 ± 0. 013 pg/mL, p= 0. 11, Mann-Whitney) as compared to "Non-Border Commuters". Home indoor concentrations of 1 -NP were 30 - 60 % of home outdoor concentrations with "Border Commuters" having higher concentrations both indoors (0. 64 ± 0. 81 vs 0. 078 ± 0. 075 pg/m 3, p= 0. 04, Mann-Whitney) and outdoors (1. 0 ± 0. 93 vs 0. 27 ± 0. 24 pg/m 3, p= 0. 11, Mann-Whitney) compared to "Non-Border Commuters". Border concentrations of 1 -NP weighted by the time spent at the border, total travel given season, and season were all predictors of personal exposure to 1 -NP among "Border Commuters". However, when placed in a multivariate linear regression model total travel given season was the only predictor variable to remain significant. Season was the only predictor for personal exposure to PM 2. 5 among "Border Commuters". Total travel was also a significant predictor for 8 -OHNP among "Border Commuters. " Median values (IQR) of daily averages for fixed-site measurements made at the border were as follows: 40, 000 (24, 000 - 52, 000) UFP/cm 3, 5 (3 - 6) ppm CO, 1. 3 (0. 5 - 2. 6) pg/m 3 1 -NP, 4 (3 - 11) μg/m 3 BC, 41 (23 - 57) μg/m 3 real-time PM 2. 5, and 15 (13 - 22) μg/m 3 <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 2. 5. Wind speed was a predictor of <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 2. 5 at the border explaining 22 % of the variance. Relative humidity and vehicle delay were both predictors of UFP measured at the border, explaining 13 % and 21 % of the variance, respectively. However, when modeled together none remain significant. There were no predictors for 1 -NP measurements at the border. Conclusions: This is the first quantitative study characterizing traffic-related exposure to a vulnerable population, indicating that this vulnerable population is indeed at high risk for exposure. "Border Commuters" experience higher exposure to 1 -NP and PM 2. 5 as compared to "Non-Border Commuters", as determined by both personal and at-home measurements. In addition, traffic-related air pollution exposure among "Border Commuters" within 10 feet of highly concentrated traffic is of great public health concern as concentrations at the border are similar to near-roadway studies that link exposure to adverse health effects. Interventions to reduce border wait times would significantly reduce traffic pollutant exposures in this vulnerable population. However, further work {{needs to be done to}} understand the spatial heterogeneity of at-home exposures between the two study groups...|$|R

This error is then accounted for in the regulatory standards as a “Measurement Allowance”. A comprehensive program has already been conducted for the gas-phase measurement allowance, with the PM measurement allowance program about to begin. The main objective of this work was to provide preliminary measurements from PM PEMS to assess the accuracy of PM measurements under in-use conditions and provide a basis for the development of the more comprehensive Measurement Allowance program. The MASC utilized the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Bourns College of Engineering – Center for Environmental Research and Technology’s (CE-CERT) Mobile Emissions Laboratory (MEL) to perform the initial in-use PM PEMS evaluation. For this program, PM PEMS were directly compared with the MEL over a series of different on-road driving conditions. Prior to the on-road testing, MEL underwent a 40 CFR Part 1065 self-audit focused on PM sampling. In-use measurements were made from a class 8 truck whose in-use PM emissions levels averaged 0. 043 g/hp-h, which is near the 0. 03 g/hp-h in-use threshold level. The goal was to test a vehicle at or slightly above the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) threshold to investigate sources of error for the PM instruments at levels where their performance is most critical. The on-road driving courses included segments near sea level, in coastal regions, in desert regions, and on longer uphill inclines. PM measurements in real-time were made with a variety of different PM instruments from manufacturers preparing for the PM Measurement Allowance program, as well as other commercially available instruments such as a Dekati DMM and TSI Dustrak. These measurements were directly compared with <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> mass measurements that were collected with the MEL under 1065 compliant sampling conditions. Measurements were made under conditions where NTE events would be expected (e. g., uphill driving segments) and for varying durations to provide a range of mass loadings. Comparisons of the performance of the instruments and PM mass measurements from 0. 02 to 0. 1 g/hp-h are be presented. The results of this study are expected to be an important component of PM Measurement Allowance program development...|$|R
40|$|Inter-comparisons of European {{air quality}} models show that {{regional}} transport models, including the EMEP (Co-operative Programme for {{monitoring and evaluation}} of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe) aerosol model, tend to underestimate the observed concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2. 5. Obviously, an accurate representation of the individual aerosol constituents {{is a prerequisite for}} adequate calculation of PM concentrations. On the other hand, available measurements on the chemical characterization of ambient particles reveal that full chemical PM mass closure is rarely achieved. The fraction unaccounted for by chemical analysis can comprise as much as 30 - 40 % of <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 10 or PM 2. 5 mass. The unaccounted PM mass can partly be due to non-C atoms in organic aerosols and/or due to sampling and measurement artefacts. Moreover, a part of the unaccounted PM mass is likely to consist of water associated with particles. Thus, the gravimetrically measured particle mass does not necessarily represent dry PM 10 and PM 2. 5 mass. This is thought {{to be one of the}} reasons for models under-prediction of observed PM, if calculated dry PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations are compared with measurements. The EMEP aerosol model has been used to study to what extent particle-bound water can explain the chemically unidentified PM mass in filter-based particle samples. Water content of PM 2. 5 and PM 10 has been estimated with the model for temperature 20 °C and relative humidity 50 %, which are conditions required for equilibration of dust-loaded filters according to the Reference method recommended by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). Model calculations for Europe show that, depending on particle composition, particle-bound water constitutes 20 - 35 % of the annual mean PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations, which is consistent with existing experimental estimates. At two Austrian sites, in Vienna and Streithofen, where daily measurements of PM 2. 5 mass and chemical composition are available, calculated PM 2. 5 water content is found to be about 75 - 80 % of the undetermined PM 2. 5 mass and there is correlation between them. Furthermore, accounting for aerosol water has improved the agreement between modelled and measured daily PM 2. 5 concentrations, whilst model calculated dry PM 2. 5 concentrations appear to agree quite well with the total identified PM 2. 5 mass. No information on the composition of PM measured at EMEP sites is presently available. Given that PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations are measured at EMEP stations with gravimetric methods they are likely to contain water. We show that the levels of modelled PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations with aerosol water included agree with measurements better than dry PM concentrations. As expected, the spatial correlation has not changed significantly, whereas the temporal correlation of daily PM 10 and PM 2. 5 with monitoring data has slightly improved at most of the EMEP sites. Our results suggest that aerosol water should be accounted for in modelled PM 10 and PM 2. 5 when compared with filter-based gravimetric measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{awareness}} of {{adverse health effects}} associated with diesel aerosol emissions has generated a great public and academic interest in studying various aerosol-producing sources. While automotive industry has achieved significant progress in controlling and reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions, {{there was only a}} very limited attention paid to ship transport, i. e. to marine diesel engines (MDE). Nowadays, shipping {{is one of the biggest}} contributors of PM emissions to the atmosphere, although is still lacking attention from PM legislators and diesels aerosol researchers. This thesis is focused on measurement and characterization of particulate emissions from diesel engines (both marine and heavy-duty) operating on conventional and alternative marine fuels. Different PM emission characteristics such as particle size distributions, total and nanoparticle concentrations, PM mass and particle morphology were measured and analysed in current thesis. The observed significant differences in PM results between 2 -stroke and 4 -stroke marine diesel engines indicate the importance of engine technology, while pronounced contribution of heavy fuel oil’s ash fraction (in contrast to MGO) to solid PM reveals the importance of considering the fuel factor. In addition, PM characteristics from marine diesel engines were found to be different from that of heavy-duty engine, but a certain, somewhat surprising, agreement between results for 4 - stroke MDE and 4 -stroke heavy-duty engine was also observed. Particle morphology analysis confirmed the three main origins (sources) of particulates: fuel, lubrication oil and mechanical wear of moving cylinder parts. The sole effect of high sulphur level in marine fuels was studies using a sulphur-doping of a reference low-sulphur MGO up to 4 % S by mass. The contribution of sulphur to PM mass appeared to be more pronounced than is known from automotive engine studies. The homogeneous nucleation of sulphur and HC compounds was observed only at very low load conditions, while heterogeneous nucleation, i. e. condensation on the surface of existing solid particles, was found to be the dominating mechanism and can be associated with a rather low turbulence level in a primary porous tube diluter and availability of considerable amount of solid nucleus. As volatile particles are very sensitive to dilution parameters and in order to obtain repeatable and reproducible results, the effects of primary dilution ratio (PDR) and primary dilution air temperature (PDT) were studied. Both these parameters showed no effect on solid carbonaceous particles formed inside the engine cylinders, and at the same time were vital for semivolatile HC and sulphur compounds. Increase in PDR reduces the partial pressure of volatile compounds, and hence their tendency to nucleate; too low PDR should be avoided as water condensation can occur leading to some deceptive results. Increasing PDT results in increased saturation vapour pressure of volatile compounds, which is also suppressing nucleation. Effect of filter media on the results of <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> analysis was studied and no filter type was found overwhelmingly superior due to various positive and/or negative artifacts associated with each filter type. The environmental benefits in terms of gaseous, smoke and PM emissions of fish oil (FO) biofuel and GTL synthetic fuel as alternatives to conventional MGO were investigated. A fairly good ignition and combustion properties together with excellent emission characteristics were observed in case of FO, which although requires some additional testing of its rheological and cold temperature properties and oxidation stability. GTL fuel showed reduction in PM mass, smoke and all gaseous emissions except THC, which together with registered particle number concentration showed a visible increase. This can be associated with possible higher incidence of wall-wetting by GTL fuel as its volumetric flow rates were increased to compensate for lower fuel density (lower volumetric energy content). Injection system tuning/modification or shift to common rail injection system can be proposed for reduction of gaseous (especially THC) and PM emissions even further.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the applicability of the 137 Cs technique in obtaining spatially distributed information of soil redistribution at small catchment. This paper reports the result of the choice of conversion model for erosion rate estimates and the sensitive of the changes in the model parameter. For this purpose, small site was selected, namely landuse I (LU-I). The top of a slope was chosen as a reference site. The erosion/deposit rate of individual sampling points was estimated using the conversion models, namely Proportional Model (<b>PM),</b> Mass <b>Balance</b> Model 1 (MBM 1) and Mass Balance Model 2 (MBM 2). A comparison of the conversion models showed that the lowest value is obtained by the PM. The MBM 1 gave values closer to MBM 2, but MBM 2 gave a reliable values. In this study, a sensitivity analysis suggest that the conversion models are sensitive to changes in parameters that depend on the site conditions, but insensitive to changes in  parameters that interact to the onset of 137 Cs fallout input.   Keywords: soil erosion, environmental radioisotope, cesiu...|$|R
40|$|Po Valley is one {{the largest}} European region with remarkably high {{concentration}} level of atmospheric pollutants, both for particulate and gaseous compounds. In {{the last decade}} stringent regulations on air quality standards and on anthropogenic emissions have been set by the European Commission, leading to the latest 2008 / 50 /CE, which requires a monitoring plan also for PM 2. 5, used {{as an indicator of}} population exposure to atmospheric particulates. These regulations lead to an overall improvement on air quality across Europe, including PM 10 in the Po valley (Bigi and Ghermandi, 2014). Due to the different nature of PM 2. 5 and its large fraction of secondary aerosols, patterns and trends of PM 2. 5 exhibit large difference to PM 10 features, therefore the latest air quality regulations may represent a hard challenge for municipalities and environmental agencies. Daily <b>gravimetric</b> equivalent <b>PM</b> 2. 5 concentration at 44 sites over the Po valley (either in urban or rural background conditions) has been analysed. Long term trends on deseasonalized monthly means have been estimated by Generalised Least Squares. These results have been compared with trends on annual quantiles. Changes, over the sampling period, in frequency distribution of PM 2. 5 in each month have also been estimated. For each site, impact of primary anthropogenic particulate emissions has been qualitatively estimated by testing PM 2. 5 series for a significant weekly periodicity using three different metrics. The former compares the median among time series of PM 2. 5 anomalies of weekdays, the second consists in the weekend effect magnitude. The latter used frequency domain analysis in order to test whether estimated spectral density at 1 / 7 day- 1 frequency is significantly higher than the spectral density of a red noise series. Finally a cluster analysis on the dataset has been performed, showing a geographical pattern for PM 2. 5 concentration across the valley.

40|$|THESIS 8356 Research {{was carried}} out into the {{relative}} exposure of commuters to air pollutants in Dublin between four modes of transport. These differences were determined experimentally by simultaneously sampling the personal exposure of commuters to VOCs and PM 2 5 in cars, buses, on bicycles and on foot. Over 400 samples were recorded from January 2005 to June 2006 along two different commuter routes (Route 1 and 2) and the resulting dataset revealed {{statistically significant differences between}} exposure concentrations in the modes of transport. The Car commuter was found to have the highest exposure to VOCs followed by the bus, cyclist and pedestrian, while the bus had the highest exposure to PM 2. 5 followed by the car, cyclist and pedestrian. Using a numerical lung model to predict the internal deposition and absorption of these harmful pollutants revealed that for PM 2 5 the cyclists had the highest uptake due to their elevated breathing rates, followed by the bus, pedestrian and car. For VOCs the car was found to have the highest uptake, owing to its high exposure concentration and long duration of exposure, followed by the cyclist, pedestrian and bus.

40|$|Airborne {{particulate}} matter (PM) has important harmful effects on human health, {{as well as}} a number of other important atmospheric effects. Although progress has been made in understanding the sources and effects of PM, there remains considerable uncertainty on a number of issues, including the nature of a lot of the carbonaceous material, which comprises 30 { 50 % on average of PM mass. This project aims to compare different methods of PM measurement, and contribute understanding to the nature and origin of the carbonaceous fraction of PM. Daily samples of PM 10 were collected from three sites in the Edinburgh area using Partisol-Plus 2025 Sequential Air Samplers: 1) Urban Background (20 August 2008 until 21 April 2010); 2) Rural (25 February 2009 until 21 April 2009); and 3) Roadside (10 September 2009 until 21 April 2010). These localities provided PM that was, respectively, representative of: 1) city-wide background air; 2) air at a location distanced from population centres, roads and industrial areas; and 3) air influenced by the emissions associated with traffic. <b>Gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> 10 concentration (µgm- 3) was determined for each daily filter sample, after a blank correction to compensate for the relative humidity (RH) -influenced change in filter mass over time. The correction was successful, with good agreement attained between the Partisol and a PM 10 Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance Filter Dynamics Measurement System (TEOM-FDMS) co-located at the Urban Background site. The general levels of PM 10 measured in this monitoring campaign indicate that the air in Edinburgh was relatively clean. The main factor causing exceedance of the daily European Union (EU) limit value was shown to be transport of PM 10 from areas of mainland Europe. High PM 10 concentrations were also strongly associated with calm weather conditions in Edinburgh, which allowed the build-up of particulate pollution over time. Aethalometer-equivalent daily concentrations of black carbon (BC) were determined by measuring the optical reflectance of the PM 10 filters from the Partisol samplers. The conversion of reflectance values to BC concentrations relied on a number of correction factors, which may have impacted on the accuracy of the results with time and location. The concentration of BC in Edinburgh was shown to be relatively low, with the daily variation being controlled by local emissions and meteorology. BC as a proportion of PM 10 increased with sampling location in the order: Rural < Urban Background < Roadside. Predominantly traffic-related BC concentrations increased during periods of low wind speed and were not greatly influenced by long-range transport of aerosol. Daily water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) concentrations were obtained by aqueous extraction of the filter samples and measurement of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). About 11 % on average of the Edinburgh PM 10 was WSOM. The majority of this WSOM seemed to have originated from air masses outside of the city, although there was a minor contribution from urban traffic sources. A solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure was used to isolate about one-third of the WSOM as hydrophobic compounds and this revealed a relative increase in the amount of less oxygenated material from traffic sources. Higher than average WSOM concentrations were strongly associated with calm weather conditions that allowed the transient build-up of particle concentrations. Some of the peaks in WSOM concentration were related to the transport of air masses from areas of mainland Europe where biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and biomass burning were likely sources. Analysis of the WSOM samples by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy showed clear seasonal trends in the composition of hydrophobic watersoluble organic matter (HWSOM), interpreted as predominance of lower molecular weight aliphatic compounds in summer but predominance of larger aromatic and polyconjugated compounds in winter. Raman spectra were obtained for different carbonaceous reference materials. The results of curve fitting for these spectra gave D 1 band full width at half maximum (FWHM) values that distinguished between diesel exhaust particles from a local bus and a humic acid sample. Analysis of Edinburgh PM 10 samples using Raman microspectroscopy (RM) showed a variation in the structural order of the carbon compounds present between that of soot and HUmic-LIke Substances (HULIS), with a tendency towards more soot-like material being present. There was no strong relationship between carbonaceous order and BC concentration, showing that coloured organic compounds have the potential to influence reflectance measurements. The combination of these measurement approaches has yielded insights into the nature and variation in carbonaceous PM material with time and sampling location.

40|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{agencies}} are implementing {{a series of}} regulations that will control emissions, including oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), from diesel engines during “in-use” conditions. The purpose is to ensure the emission standards can be maintained {{throughout the course of}} the engine’s useful lifetime. One of the most important regulations with respect to controlling in-use emissions is the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) regulation. This regulation sets limits for pollutants that are emitted during operation in a defined portion of the engine map and specifies the protocols required to make those measurements. Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) are critical for the implementation of these in-use regulations. The EPA, CARB, and the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) formed a measurement allowance steering committee (MASC) to develop a “measurement allowance” to account for measurement error {{associated with the use of}} PEMS for in-use measurements. A comprehensive program was completed for the gas-phase measurement allowance (Miller et al., 2008; Buckingham et al. 2007; Fiest et al. 2007). This report presents the results of the in-use validation portion of the PM measurement allowance program. The MASC approach pursued an experimental program to try to use laboratory measurements and modeling to characterize errors that might be observed with in-use, and then validate those errors with in-use testing. The development of the MA involved a sophisticated Monte Carlo model that considered laboratory measurement errors associated with engine broadcast information, emissions measurements, affects due to ambient conditions, and affects that might be observed due to on-vehicle operating conditions. The in-use validation effort used the same PEMS systems used for the laboratory testing, but under real-world conditions. The idea was that the errors found in-use should be within the bounds of the proposed MA. For this program, comparisons were made between the PM PEMS and UCR’s Mobile Emissions Laboratory (MEL) reference laboratory under in-use on-road driving conditions. The MEL is unique in that it contains a full 1065 compliant constant volume sampling (CVS) system with <b>gravimetric</b> <b>PM</b> measurements, while being fully operational under on-the-road driving conditions. Two PEMS manufacturers were selected for the in-use validation testing, and multiple serial numbers of each of the selected PEMS were included in the in-use testing. Measurements were made from one class 8 heavy-duty diesel vehicle equipped with a original equipment manufacturer (OEM) diesel particulate filter (DPF). A bypass system was designed to simulate a failed DPF while maintaining the functionality of the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). The bypass was designed to target an in-use bsPM emission level of 25 mg/hp-h. In-use routes were designed and utilized to exercise the PM PEMS equipment over a range of environmental conditions, and included segments near sea level, in coastal regions, in desert regions, and longer uphill incline segments and segments at elevations up to 4500 ft. Prior to validation testing, the MEL underwent a series of 1065 audits and a cross laboratory correlation with SwRI. All PM PEMS and PM instruments tested showed a negative bias compared to the reference system. The PEMS 2 non-regeneration mean bias at the 20 mg/hp-h bsPM emissions was - 10 mg/hp-h, and at 30 mg/hp-h the mean bias was - 18 mg/hp-h. When the intercept was forced through zero, the mean bias at 20 mg/hp-h went to - 15 mg/hp-h. The PEMS 3 non-regeneration mean bias at the 20 mg/hp-h bsPM emissions was - 1. 7 mg/hp-h, and at 30 mg/hp-h the mean bias was - 2. 2 mg/hp-h. When the intercept was forced through zero, the PEMS 3 mean bias went to - 1 mg/hp-h at the 20 mg/hp-h level. The other instruments used showed a higher mean bias than PEMS 3 and lower mean bias than PEMS 2. The proposed bsPM MA is 6 mg/hp-h at the 20 mg/hp-h in-use standard. For these results, the PEMS 3 system was within the proposed MA, while the PEMS 2 values exceeded the proposed MA. Several issues were discovered during testing, including problems related to testing under in-use conditions, operational issues, and post processing issues. The in-use issues ranged from electrical and mechanical connections, crystal usage from short NTE’s, valve switching, measurement signals, and crystal behaviors. Operational problems occurred during startup, commissioning, and with the systems prior to testing in-use. Typical issues include incorrect system configurations, procedures that don’t work, and issues with the startup software and other recommended practices that didn’t function according to the manual. The post processing issues ranged from data filtering, bsPM differences between processor versions, data identification, and method calculations not being available.

Despite the establishment by the European Union of emission standards (European directive 2008 / 50 /CE e. g) to control the limits of particulates in the air, the emissions by industrial plants are still not accurately monitored.

The MSD and phase state of semivolatile organic pollutants were determined at various polluted sites {{in addition to the}} PM composition and MSD. The distribution pattern of pollutants varied from side to side in correspondence to main particle sources and PM composition. Levels of particle-associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were 1 - 30 ng m(- 3) (corresponding to 15 - 35 % of the total, i. e., gas and particulate phase concentrations), of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were 2 - 11 pg m(- 3) (4 - 26 % of the total) and of DDT compounds were 2 - 12 pg m(- 3) (4 - 23 % of the total). The PM associated amounts of other organochlorine pesticides were too low for quantification. The organics were preferentially found associated with particles < 0. 45 mu m of aerodynamic equivalent diameter. The mass fractions associated with sub-micrometer particles (PM 0. 95) were 73 - 90 %, 34 - 71 % and 36 - 81 % for PAHs, PCBs and DDT compounds, respectively. The finest particles fraction had the highest aerosol surface concentration (6. 3 - 29. 7) (x) 10 (- 6) cm(- 1) (44 - 70 % of the surface concentration of all size fractions).

As such, this region has experienced rapid industrial development, which resulted also in increasing industrial air emissions, primarily from bitumen upgrading and mine vehicle fleet operations. This rapid development has led to concerns regarding health risk to humans, and other terrestrial and aquatic wildlife associated with exposure to toxic contaminants, especially metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) particularly along the Athabasca River and its watershed.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{vegetation}} is capable of capturing contaminants from air. In particular, plant leaves can act as a biological filter and as a sink for airborne particles and their associated Semi Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs) such as Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), influencing their environmental fate. In order to assess the filtration performance of plants with respect to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and their associated SVOCs, deposition on vegetation has recently been investigated by a number of different methods (field, laboratory studies as well as modelling approaches). Some authors studied the particulate matter uptake and retention capacity of different plant species, showing that some plant type are much more efficient than other at collecting particulate matter and PAHs contained upon them. Other researches were focused on measuring particle deposition velocities not only for specific tree species but also at different wind speeds. Furthermore different predictive approaches were developed to evaluate PM uptake by trees in urban areas and to estimate dry particle matter deposition on leaf surfaces using species-specific deposition velocity. Nevertheless, the existing multimedia fate models do not generally account for <b>PM</b> mass <b>balance</b> in predicting <b>PM</b> deposition to vegetation and the corresponding chemical flux. In the present study we used a dynamic multimedia fate model (SoilPlusVeg), which incorporates a vegetation compartment, to calculate leaf particle-bound PAHs uptake from air. In this model, formulated in terms of fugacity, the vegetation compartment can be composed by a mono- or multi- specific forest canopy, which interacts with dynamic air and the soil compartments. The model, which incorporates some forest structural parameters such as specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area index (LAI), was modified to account for some of recent findings concerning the particulate matter uptake by vegetation. Simulations were performed for some high molecular weight PAHs, as they exist predominantly in the particulate phase, for a multi-specific semi-urban wood located in Como. The results were compared to data measured in air, deposition and vegetation in the same location...|$|R
30|$|On each of {{the test}} days, after {{checking}} all abovementioned criteria, the four stages of the experiment were performed {{in the following order}} with subjects sitting in a quiet, temperature-controlled, driving simulator: (a) sensors were attached in the appropriate positions, which took at least 15 min; (b) a rest period of 10 min; (c) the drink was consumed over a period of 5 min; and (d) a simulated monotonous driving period of 90 min. Each test was performed over a 120 -min period. In order to simulate a real monotonous driving situation, each subject was previously informed that they had to continue driving safely, as though they were actually driving, that they should maintain a speed of 80 ~ 120 km/h, and that they should drive within a specified lane. Test sessions were performed either in the morning (10 : 00 - 12 : 00 AM) or in the afternoon (13 : 00 - 15 : 00 <b>PM)</b> in a <b>balanced</b> manner. Each subject started each test day at the same time. In addition, for {{each of the}} test sessions, subjects were allowed to have a meal 2 h prior to the experiment so that the food was not likely to affect the subject’s sleepiness.|$|R
