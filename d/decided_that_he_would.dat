5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, when Lafayette was 11, he {{was summoned}} to Paris {{to live with his}} mother and {{great-grandfather}} at the comte's apartments in Luxembourg Palace. The boy was sent to school at the Collège du Plessis, part of the University of Paris, and it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> carry on the family martial tradition. The comte, the boy's great-grandfather, enrolled the boy in a program to train future Musketeers. Lafayette's mother and great-grandfather died, on 3 and 24 April 1770 respectively, leaving Lafayette an income of 25,000livres. Upon the death of an uncle, the 12-year-old Lafayette inherited a handsome yearly income of 120,000livres.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E
50|$|In 1859, Charles Dickens was {{the editor}} of his {{magazine}} Household Words, published by Bradbury and Evans; a petty dispute with them led Dickens to realize <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was at the publisher's whim, and to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> create a new weekly magazine <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> own and control entirely.|$|R
50|$|OMACs (Observational Meta-human Activity Constructs) {{have been}} spotted {{all over the}} world and have managed to kill several metahumans. Batman and Wonder Woman {{investigate}} the OMACs while Booster, after meeting Guy Gardner in space, <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather investigate Ted Kord's disappearance with other former members of the Justice League International.|$|R
50|$|In September 2009, {{he succeeded}} Sir Hugh Orde as Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In January 2014, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> retire from the PSNI in September 2014, having <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not apply to extend his contract. On 5 June 2014, <b>he</b> announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> retire earlier than planned; stepping down on 29 June.|$|R
5|$|Jordan {{responded by}} scoring 38 {{points in the}} next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> resume wearing his former number, 23, immediately. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA. Jordan was fined an {{additional}} $5,000 for opting to wear white shoes {{as the rest of}} the Bulls wore black. He averaged 31 points per game in the series, but Orlando won the series in 6 games.|$|E
5|$|Lord Harris {{expressed}} his {{view that the}} painting should show an action shot of a match at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, and suggested that the bowler in the painting should be Kent's Colin Blythe. Kent had only played three matches at Canterbury during the 1906 season; of those {{it was decided that}} the subject of the painting would be Kent's match against Lancashire County Cricket Club. That match was part of the Canterbury Cricket Week, and Blythe had taken eight wickets, making it the most appropriate of the three fixtures to depict. Tayler <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> show {{the second day of the}} match, at an hour prior to lunchtime.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{uncertain}} future continued to dog him, and Rawtenstall expressed their displeasure at their recruit's apparent refusal to fulfil his contract. Miller had privately <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{not go through}} with the deal, but was refusing to inform the Lancastrian club. In the meantime, he had various job proposals, which he spurned until privately receiving a contract offer from the manager of North Sydney Cricket Club. The proposed deal {{would give him a}} subsidy for the costs of his relocation to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman, and gave him generous leave conditions so that he could play sport.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{never make}} enough money in rural Virginia to marry and support a family, {{he decided to go}} west to seek his fortune and improve his health. He {{reportedly}} persuaded his parents to agree with his migrating to Texas to improve his health and welfare. His father gave him $75.00 to help him on his way.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in this narrative. He thought what a narrow escape he had had in <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not attempt to climb up the shrouds, and <b>he</b> secretly determined <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be very careful, not only {{while he was on}} board the steamer, but also on all other occasions, not to violate the proprieties of life by obtruding himself into places where he ought not to go.|$|R
50|$|Al-Kharafi {{was elected}} Speaker of the National Assembly in 1999. He was reelected as Speaker in all {{elections}} after until <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{not stand for}} reelection in the 2012 National Assembly elections. This was due to Al-Kharafi wanting {{to focus on the}} family business {{after the death of his}} brother Nasser Al-Kharafi. Ahmed Al-Sadoun succeeded him as Speaker of the National Assembly.|$|R
5|$|On January 1, 1777, {{money from}} the Continental Congress arrived in Trenton and the men were paid. Washington also {{received}} a series of resolves from Congress including one that gave Washington powers {{similar to those of}} a military dictator. Washington <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stand and fight at Trenton, and ordered General John Cadwalader, who was at Crosswicks with 1,800 militia, to join him in Trenton. On December 31 Washington learned that an army of 8,000 men under the command of General Charles Cornwallis was moving to attack him at Trenton.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{over the}} WWE United States Championship began when Booker T, Orlando Jordan, and Christian each {{explained}} why {{they thought they}} deserved a title match against the champion, Chris Benoit. Theodore Long, SmackDown!'s on-screen general manager/authority figure, then announced that Benoit could choose who he wanted to face for the title. After Jordan won a standard wrestling match between three wrestlers, also involving Booker and Christian, Benoit <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> face all three men in a match between the four at No Mercy.|$|E
5|$|At {{a special}} session of {{government}} held on 30 August 1944 in Pavelić's villa, guarded by armed men, Lorković and Vokić were accused of conspiracy against the Poglavnik and Croatia's German ally. Vice President of the Government, Džafer Kulenović, and many others defended them but to no avail. Lorković was kept under house arrest until he was tried before the Poglavnik's Bodyguard Division (PTS) where it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be stripped of his rank and expelled from the PTS. After the trial, he was transferred to Koprivnica and later in Lepoglava, alongside Vokić, Farolfi, Ljudevit Tomašić and others, although Košturić later escaped. Lorković was executed {{at the end of}} April 1945.|$|E
50|$|Casper is seen {{reading the}} book How to Win Friends, a real book by Dale Carnegie. Every night at midnight his {{brothers}} and sisters scare people, except for Casper, who doesn't want to scare people, so he stays home instead. Casper <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather make friends with the living. While his family is off scaring people, Casper bids his pet cat goodbye and leaves home.|$|R
50|$|<b>Deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather {{pursue a}} {{teaching}} career, Smith left industry {{and moved to}} the education sector, where he started 'Star Schools' - the aim of these schools are to provide value for money education with top-class teachers. During the next 25 years, he became famous throughout South Africa, where his schools have taught almost a million pupils of all races. Smith also won the 'Teacher of the Year' award.|$|R
50|$|Although Unicron himself {{does not}} appear again, his origin in the {{animated}} series is later revealed. Unicron was created {{near the beginning of}} the universe by the diminutive genius known as Primacron, who intended for him to devour all life in the universe, leaving a blank slate that Primacron could use as he saw fit. However, Unicron turned upon Primacron, <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rule the universe and subsequently setting out to achieve that goal.|$|R
5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E
5|$|He won a {{government}} {{scholarship to the}} University of Melbourne and Queen's College, a university residential college. Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression. He decided to take up medical studies {{at the end of}} his third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours.|$|E
5|$|On a dare, Antonucci then <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> try {{producing}} a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, {{he ended up}} drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. He faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused. After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Harry S. Truman <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> too, <b>would</b> build {{a library}} to house his Presidential papers {{and helped to}} {{galvanize}} congressional action.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 Qasim <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{henceforth}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{work only}} as a freelancer, away from government jobs which locked his weapon: his pen.|$|R
50|$|In December 2009, {{he signed}} for Tamworth of the Conference National on non-contract terms, {{following}} a brief spell in Scotland. After {{it was revealed}} the club was under financial difficulties, Newbold left Tamworth and signed for Hucknall Town F.C., despite being {{thought to be the}} transfer target for a number of league clubs. Newbold left Hucknall without making a single appearance for the club after <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look {{to get back into the}} professional game.|$|R
5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, {{other than the fact that}} it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E
5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
5|$|Off the pitch, Miller privately <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not honour his Rawtenstall contract. He {{secretly}} {{accepted an}} offer to relocate to Sydney {{to work as a}} liquor salesman and play cricket. Back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day. He hit the first ball of the next day for six, and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men on the fence. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw. Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.|$|E
5000|$|Although having {{taught himself}} to play bass {{at an early}} age by {{listening}} to new wave bands such as The Stranglers and Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wilkinson took an interest in jazz and went on to tour the jazz circuit across the north west of England and North Wales. He gained a college diploma in the genre before <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never be able {{to move out of the}} small clubs he was already playing whilst playing jazz.|$|R
50|$|During {{his stay}} in the inn, Adams’ hopes for his sermons are mocked in a {{discussion}} with a traveling bookseller and another parson. Nevertheless, Adams remains resolved to continue his journey to London until it is revealed <b>that</b> his wife, <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be more in need of shirts than sermons on his journey, has neglected to pack them. The pair thus decide {{to return to the}} parson's parish: Joseph in search of Fanny, and Adams in search of his sermons.|$|R
5000|$|Birdie {{points out}} that it is {{dangerous}} to cross tracks, especially on bridges and tunnels, the latter of which finally convinces Sly Fox about the dangers of railroads (he is run over in the process, to which he replies [...] "If I weren't a cartoon character, I'd be dead as a doornail.") Sly now <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> just stand and wave at the train as it goes by; Birdie points out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shouldn't be too close, pointing out that they could be carrying heavy objects.|$|R
5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} {{to use it}} on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|E
5|$|The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics {{season began}} with Christopher {{the subject of}} a {{possible}} trade. The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees, but they wanted Christopher in return. Mack refused to give him up, and as a result the trade never materialized. He began the season in the starting rotation, and was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5–0 loss against the Yankees. Over {{the first part of the}} season, Christopher again split time between the rotation and the bullpen. In a 7–3 loss to the Indians on July 18, Christopher could not get out of the second inning, allowing five earned runs. After this, he did not pitch for a month, and spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever. He finished the season with five wins, seven losses and a 4.30 ERA. After the season ended, Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball. He had lost 10 pounds in the final months of the season and was light to begin with, and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> retire if he could not gain the weight back over the winter.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July, Willaumez sailed again, attacking {{shipping}} at Montserrat, Nevis and St. Kitts before sailing to Tortola {{in preparation}} for {{an attack on the}} Jamaica convoy. Before he could reach the convoy, Willaumez was intercepted off the Passage Islands by a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and driven northwards into the Bahamas. There he waited for the Jamaica convoy to pass, seizing any ship of any nationality that came within sight, in case they should reveal his position. After several weeks of waiting, Captain Bonaparte, the Emperor's brother and commander of the ship Vétéran, <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> no longer submit to Willaumez's command and sailed north during the night of 31 July, without orders or even notifying the admiral. Vétéran eventually returned to France on 26 August, after destroying six ships from a Quebec convoy. Panicked by the unexplained disappearance of one of his ships and its illustrious captain, Willaumez struck north in search of the vessel and as a result missed the passage of the Jamaica convoy, also narrowly avoiding an encounter with the squadrons under Warren and Strachan. On 18 August a hurricane dispersed his ships, severely damaging them and scattering them along the Atlantic Seaboard of the Americas. One was destroyed by a British patrol, two others were too badly damaged to be repaired and were broken up, and three of his ships successfully made the journey back to France over the next two years.|$|E
50|$|Before the battle, <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be unable}} to defend Manila with the forces {{available}} to him, and to preserve as large a force {{as possible in the}} rural mountain Luzon region of the Philippines, General Tomoyuki Yamashita had insisted on a complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manila in January 1945. However, Yamashita's order was ignored by about 10,000 Japanese marines under Rear Admiral Iwabuchi Sanji who chose to remain in Manila. About 4000 Japanese army personnel were unable to leave the city due to the advance of the American and Filipino forces.|$|R
50|$|After much mental agony, Rukmangada <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather {{kill his}} son than break the {{observance}} of Ekadasi and thus compromise his devotions to Vishnu. The distraught but unwaveringly devoted Sandhyavali acquiesces to this decision. Rukmangada raises his sword. Just {{as he is}} about to strike off his son's head, Vishnu appears before them, pleased. Vishnu reveals that Mohini is an apsara, sent to test Rukmangada's devotion, a test which he has passed. Dharmangada is crowned king. Vishnu takes Rukmangada and his pious wife Sandhyavali away to his heavenly abode, Vaikuntha.|$|R
5000|$|Master Humphrey is {{a lonely}} {{man who lives}} in London. He keeps old manuscripts in an antique longcase clock by the chimney-corner. One day, <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> start a little club, called Master Humphrey's Clock, where the members would read out their manuscripts to the others. The members include Master Humphrey; a deaf gentleman, Jack Redburn; retired {{merchant}} Owen Miles; and Mr. Pickwick from The Pickwick Papers. A mirror club in the kitchen, Mr. Weller's Watch, run by Mr. Weller, has members including Humphrey's maid, the barber and Sam Weller.|$|R
