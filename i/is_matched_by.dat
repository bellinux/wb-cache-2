5|$|The {{giant otter}} is very {{sensitive}} to human activity when rearing its young. No institution, for example, has successfully raised giant otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect, abuse and infanticide, as well as decreased lactation. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are all risks. This sensitivity <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site {{from year to year}} <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E

25|$|As of 2014, {{the first}} stage in the {{acceleration}} process (pre-accelerator injector) takes place in two ion sources which turn hydrogen gas into H− ions. The gas is introduced into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes, each a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1mm and {{held in place by}} glass ceramic insulators. A magnetron generates a plasma to form the ions near the metal surface. The ions are accelerated by the source to 35keV and matched by low energy beam transport (LEBT) into the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) which applies a 750keV electrostatic field giving the ions their second acceleration. At the exit of RFQ, the beam <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> medium energy beam transport (MEBT) into the entrance of the linear accelerator (linac).|$|E
25|$|Hanmer Basin {{is a small}} (10 x 20nbsp&km) {{pull-apart}} basin {{formed at}} the overlap between the Hope River and Conway segments of the Hope Fault. The right-stepping geometry of the offset between the two segments has caused local extension to occur and a basin to form. The hot springs of Hanmer Springs {{are one of the}} results of the basin formation. Other smaller basins of similar type have formed at minor offsets along the Hope River segment. The basin began to form in the Pleistocene and contains more than 1000 m of sedimentary fill in the main depocenter. The eastern end of the basin is currently being deformed by transpression associated with the southwestern end of the Conway segment. The destruction of the basin at its eastern end <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> transtensional deformation at the western end that continues to enlarge the basin, giving rise to a roughly steady-state geometry. The basin fill is being constantly reworked as it is uplifted at the basin's eastern end and redeposited to the west.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a further}} {{contrast}} in the next phrase [...] "führe ins Haus" [...] where the soprano and alto are paired with a long lyrical melisma in semiquavers on the word [...] "führe" [...] (lead). This new musical material <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> the semiquaver figures of the woodwind. Similarly the detached quaver accompaniment in the continuo <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> parallel figures in the tenor and bass parts. In the next four bars of this second rendition of the sinfonia, [...] there is a reprise of the rising semiquaver figures in the continuo and sustained chords in the woodwind. In the first two bars each voice in the chorus enters successively with a new rising fourth motif for the phrase [...] "und die" [...] before the music intensifies as the chorus joins the sustained chords of the woodwind for the word [...] "Elend". The final two bars of the closing cadence of the ritornello are more complex. On the one hand the mounting tension in the previous bars is resolved with the phrase [...] "führe ins Haus" [...] in the soprano, alto and bass voices.|$|E

Other bands to feature extreme vocals include Cadacross, Ensiferum, Ithilien and Equilibrium. In contrast, bands like Mägo de Oz and Metsatöll are known to feature [...] "clean" [...] singing in line with their more traditional metal approach. Numerous other bands in the genre are known to feature both extreme vocals and clean singing. This includes Primordial, Turisas, Windir and Wintersun.|$|E
500|$|Scotland's Neolithic discoveries {{portray a}} radical {{departure}} from the earlier hunter-gatherer societies. During this period complex societies evolve that are capable of creating substantial structures. [...] Development is by no means linear and architectural advances are often followed by periods of stagnation and even reversal. The Balbridie site, for example, <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> only two others so far discovered in Scotland at Kelso and in the Forth Valley and they are quite dissimilar from both anything found earlier and the monumental stone structures found later. No timber buildings of a similar size were re-created until the Saxon invasions some four millennia later. The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were constructed contemporaneously with the emergence of the Ancient Egyptian culture, more than 500 years before the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza and almost a millennium before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected.|$|E

500|$|Despite the film's {{generally}} mixed reception, critics praised Sawa's {{performance as}} Alex. [...] Holden of The New York Times commented that [...] "The disaster and Alex's premonitions {{set up a}} heavy-handed fable about death and teenage illusions of invulnerability". David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews remarked [...] "Sawa's personable turn as the hero <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> a uniformly effective supporting cast rife with familiar faces (i.e. Seann William Scott, Brendan Fehr, Tony Todd, etc)...," [...] while Leydon of Variety pointed out that [...] "Sawa is credible as the second-sighted Alex—unlike many other actors cast a teen protagonists, he actually looks like he might still be attending high school—but the supporting players are an uneven bunch". LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Sawa and Ali Larter's pairing, saying that [...] "Larter and Sawa, who becomes more scruffy and wild-eyed as the film progresses, make an appealing pair".|$|E
500|$|Writing 21 {{years after}} its release, Alan Clayson {{dismissed}} the song as [...] "archaic parlour poetry" [...] on an album full of [...] "long, dull melodies". Simon Leng admires the [...] "warm sonic scenes" [...] of [...] "The Answer's at the End" [...] and recognises it as an [...] "interesting" [...] composition, one that [...] "ponders the nature of relationships" [...] {{in a similar way}} to Bob Dylan's 1975 album Blood on the Tracks. Leng pairs the song with another Extra Texture track, [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies", however, as [...] "two slabs of introspection" [...] that suffer from being [...] "part calls for tolerance and part expression of downright despair". While similarly noting the bleakness of the subject matter, Ian Inglis opines: [...] "The lack of optimism in his words <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> a largely inconspicuous melody and an inconsistent production in which alternate piano, strings, and guitar interludes fail to provide a coherent musical context." ...|$|E
500|$|Numerous reviewers {{commented on}} Morgan's writing and story. In The Seattle Times, {{journalist}} and science fiction author Nisi Shawl tied the writing {{quality to the}} action scenes, [...] "Morgan's talent for tension-building <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> the clarity with which he describes the sideswiping, rubber-burning, rear-end-ramming, full-contact racing scenes. And both these skills are quietly eclipsed by his word-for-word writing ability. Apt metaphors and similes abound." [...] However, science fiction critic Robert K. J. Killheffer, in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, wrote [...] "it's not his best – it lacks the dense and evocative background of his Takeshi Kovacs books, and Morgan is not as sure-handed with near-future situations and characters – but it takes chances and largely succeeds." [...] Likewise, in the San Francisco Chronicle the reviewer wrote [...] "In its present form, the novel feels bloated and obvious, despite the sharpness of the descriptive writing {{and a couple of}} first-rate fight sequences. With the right artist, Market Forces might still make a compelling—and necessarily shorter—graphic novel." [...] The Library Journal review ended with a recommendation: [...] "Morgan's sf suspense belongs in most sf collections." [...] The reviewer in Booklist concluded [...] "It's not a particularly pleasant future, but Morgan paints it in broad strokes, drawing us into his future world and making it feel like a natural outgrowth of today's corporate chicanery. The novel might have been unremittingly bleak if it weren't for the moral center provided by Faulkner, who is a genuinely likable guy. Fans of Morgan's gritty, noirish brand of sf will ﬂock to this one." ...|$|E

[...] The American publication Consequence of Sound placed the album at number seventy-nine on their 2010 list of the Top 100 Albums Ever. In 2015, Post placed on number 69 on Spins list of the 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years, claiming that [...] " [...] fearless plunge into styles <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> the aplomb with which she bares her anxieties and aspirations." [...] Celebrating the album's 20th anniversary, the British magazine NME described it as, [...] "a masterful matching of hard, up-to-the-minute beats with complex, personal lyrics about the rush and rage of being a modern urban woman". American writer Tom Moon included Post in his 2008 reference book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die. Also in 2008, FNAC placed the album at number 246 in its list of the 1000 best albums of all time. Entertainment Weekly included the album in its 2013 list of the 100 Greatest Albums Ever at number 78. In an unordered list of 500 essential albums compiled for Vanity Fair in 2013, English musician Elvis Costello included Post and mentioned [...] "Hyperballad" [...] as a highlight of the record. In the album's entry of the [...] "Women Who Rock: The 50 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] list of 2012, Rolling Stone felt, [...] "Björk's artistic stature grew by yards {{in the course of}} this strange, affecting work, by turns harshly industrial, meditative and neon jubilant." ...|$|E
