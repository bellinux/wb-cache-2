25|$|Liposuction, {{also known}} as lipoplasty, is a {{cosmetic}} surgical procedure that slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by removing excess fat deposits, improving the body's contours and proportion, and ultimately, enhancing the patient's self-image. Liposuction {{involves the use of}} a small stainless steel tube, called a cannula. The cannula is connected to a powerful suction pump and inserted into the fat through small incisions in the skin. Fat removal is accomplished as the suction cannula creates tiny tunnels through the fatty layers. Liposuction can be performed on both men and women. Ideal for this type of procedure are non-smokers, healthy individuals who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing, adults within 30% of their <b>ideal</b> <b>weight</b> who have firm and elastic skin.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Determining an individual’s "ideal " {{body weight}} is {{fundamental}} in nutritional therapy. A simulation {{of the human}} body to a cylindrical volumetric model permits the calculation of the <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> from the measured height, interacromioclavicular distance, and humeral length. A group of 189 healthy normal volunteers were assessed. The calculated "Pitt " <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> correlated closely (r = 0. 88 for males, r = 0. 72 for women) with values obtained from the Metropolitan tables. The technique provides an estimate of <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> based upon reproducible, easily obtained measurements of fixed bony landmarks. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 11 : 255 - 258, 1987) Determining an individual’s <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> is a fundamental step in classifying nutritional status and in establishing goals for nutritional therapy.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern of}} the policy maker about eating behavior {{has focused on the}} spread of obesity and on the evidence of a consistent number of individuals dieting despite being underweight.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} low-tidal volume ventilation in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and assess if any demographic or clinical factors improve low-tidal volume ventilation adherence. DESIGN: Descriptive post hoc analysis of four multicenter pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome studies. SETTING: Twenty-six academic PICU. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifteen pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients who received conventional mechanical ventilation at hours 0 and 24 of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome who had data to calculate <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> were included. Two cutoff points for low-tidal volume ventilation were assessed: {{less than or equal}} to 6. 5 mL/kg of <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> and {{less than or equal to}} 8 mL/kg of <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight.</b> Of 555 patients, we excluded 240 for other respiratory support modes or missing data. The remaining 315 patients had a median PaO 2 -to-FIO 2 ratio of 140 (interquartile range, 90 - 201), and there were no differences in demographics between those who did and did not receive low-tidal volume ventilation. With tidal volume cutoff of less than or equal to 6. 5 mL/kg of <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight,</b> the adherence rate was 32 % at hour 0 and 33 % at hour 24. A low-tidal volume ventilation cutoff of tidal volume less than or equal to 8 mL/kg of <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> resulted in an adherence rate of 58 % at hour 0 and 60 % at hour 24. Low-tidal volume ventilation use was no different by severity of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome nor did adherence improve over time. At hour 0, overweight children were less likely to receive low-tidal volume ventilation less than or equal to 6. 5 mL/kg <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> (11 % overweight vs 38 % nonoverweight; p = 0. 02); no difference was noted by hour 24. Furthermore, in the overweight group, using admission <b>weight</b> instead of <b>ideal</b> body <b>weight</b> resulted in misclassification of up to 14 % of patients as receiving low-tidal volume ventilation when they actually were not. CONCLUSIONS: Low-tidal volume ventilation is underused in the first 24 hours of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III, and pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome severity were not associated with improved low-tidal volume ventilation adherence nor did adherence improve over time. Overweight children were less likely to receive low-tidal volume ventilation strategies in the first day of illness...|$|R
