Place also agreed to let the officers search the luggage he had checked, but they declined to do so in light of the flight's imminent departure. Discrepancies between the two luggage tags on Place's two suitcases further aroused the officers' suspicions, and they confirmed that the addresses were false. The Miami officers alerted DEA agents at LaGuardia to their suspicions about Place.|$|E

25|$|Rush had {{actually}} made his international début, in May 1980, {{just before he}} officially became a Liverpool player. His Reds début came on 13 December that year in a First Division fixture at Portman Road against Ipswich Town. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> for his future strike-partner, Kenny Dalglish (out with an ankle injury {{but at the time}} one of the most highly rated strikers in the world), and wore his No 7 shirt. Midfielder Jimmy Case scored Liverpool's only goal in a 1–1 draw. At this stage, Liverpool were defending the league title and the League Cup, and also contending for the European Cup, while Ipswich were emerging as surprise title contenders. Ultimately, Liverpool disappointed in the league and finished fifth (with Aston Villa winning the title), but they did win the European Cup (for the third time) and the League Cup (for the first time).|$|E
25|$|Pagliaroni {{was born}} in Dearborn, Michigan, {{and grew up in}} Long Beach, California. He was {{contracted}} by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent out of Wilson High School in Long Beach, California in 1955. He was only 17 years old when he made his debut with the Red Sox that same year. Although he didn't get much opportunity to play during his first season, he received valuable instruction from former catcher, Mickey Owen. Pagliaroni then joined the United States Army from 1956 to 1958, when he was discharged in time to report to spring training with the Red Sox. Pagliaroni spent the next three seasons playing in the minor leagues before rejoining the Red Sox in August 1960. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the on deck circle during a game at Fenway Park on September 28, 1960, when Ted Williams hit a home run in his final at bat in the major leagues.|$|E
500|$|The crowd {{continued}} to press around the soldiers, taunting them by yelling, [...] "Fire!", by spitting at and throwing snowballs {{and other small}} objects at them. Richard Palmes, a local innkeeper who was carrying a cudgel, came up to Preston and asked if the soldiers' weapons were loaded. Preston assured him they were, but {{that they would not}} fire unless he ordered it, and (according to his own deposition) that he was unlikely to do so, since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of them. A thrown object then struck Private Montgomery, knocking him down and causing him to drop his musket. He recovered his weapon, and was thought to angrily shout [...] "Damn you, fire!", then discharged it into the crowd although no command was given. Palmes swung his cudgel first at Montgomery, hitting his arm, and then at Preston. He narrowly missed Preston's head, striking him on the arm instead.|$|E

500|$|The first table read of {{the episode}} was held on January 9, 1991. The episode was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on January 15, 1991. Filming {{of the episode}} took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season premiere [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode. The scene in which Jerry informs George he told Elaine about the apartment initially showed them standing in line for the movies, talking about sitting {{in the front of the}} theatre. George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> line to get a ticket for The Exorcist (1973), and people would let him go in front of them without saying anything. The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself [...] "lord of the idiots", but this was changed during rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the close}} of the 1891 County Championship, Hewett was part of Lord Hawke's party which toured North America, playing six matches in the United States of America and two in Canada. Sammy Woods wrote that Hewett, along with Charles Wreford-Brown and George Ricketts, became very seasick on the journey there. The first two matches were {{first-class}} fixtures against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. Hewett scored 30 and 49 in the first, an eight wicket loss which Woods blamed on taking place too soon after their arrival, claiming the team [...] "had hardly found our land-legs." [...] The first match had yielded an aggregate of 861 runs, the second contained only 352, of which Hewett scored 10 and 29. His captain, Lord Hawke, was the only other batsman to reach double figures in both innings as the touring side won by four wickets. None of the remaining fixtures on the tour had first-class status, and not all were eleven-a-side contests. Hewett scored 113 against the sixteen man All New York on Staten Island, a match in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> as captain due to Lord Hawke being ill. Woods rated Hewett, along with Lord Hawke and Brown, as the best batsmen on the tour.|$|E

2500|$|After {{retiring}} from his playing career in 1979, Shepherd decided against becoming a coach, {{and decided to}} become an umpire instead.

A widely repeated claim, disputed by King and Godley, but confirmed in a 1988 interview by Creme, and also on the webpage of Gouldman's current line-up, is that the band name represented a volume of semen {{that was more than}} the average amount ejaculated by men, thus emphasising their potency or prowess.|$|E
2500|$|Healy's friend, {{the writer}} Henry Taylor, told Moe Howard that {{the fight was}} preceded by an {{argument}} between Healy and three men whom he identified as [...] "college fellows".

[...] The wrestler Man Mountain Dean reported that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of the Plaza Hotel in Hollywood at 2:30am when Healy emerged, bleeding, from a taxi.

[...] Wyantt LaMont, Healy's personal physician, was summoned to the home the following morning when Healy began experiencing convulsions. [...] Despite the efforts of LaMont and a cardiologist, John Ruddock, Healy died later that day. [...] Because of the circumstances, LaMont refused to sign Healy's death certificate.|$|E

2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
