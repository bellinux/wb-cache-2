The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel {{the entire length of the}} container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up.

50|$|Like normal macro-level extrusion, several similar microextrusion {{processes}} {{have been}} described over the years. The most basic processes were forward (direct) and backward (indirect) microextrusion. The ram (which propels the billet forward) and billet both move {{in the same direction}} with forward microextrusion, while in backward microextrusion has the ram and billet moving in opposite directions. These in turn have been applied to specialized applications such as the manufacture of microbillet, brass micropins, microgear shafts, and microcondensers.

40|$|A {{modified}} axisymmetric <b>forward</b> spiral <b>extrusion</b> (AFSE) {{has been}} proposed recently to enhance the strain accumulation during the process. The new technique is called variable lead axisymmetric <b>forward</b> spiral <b>extrusion</b> (VLAFSE) that features a variable lead along the extrusion direction. To assess the effect of design modification on plastic deformation, a comprehensive study has been performed here using a 3 D transient finite element (FE) model. The FE results established the shear deformation as the dominant mode of deformation which has been confirmed experimentally. The variable lead die extends strain accumulation in the radial and longitudinal directions over the entire grooved section of the die and eliminates the rigid body rotation which occurs {{in the case of}} a constant lead die, AFSE. A comparison of forming loads for VLAFSE and AFSE proved the advantages of the former design in the reduction of the forming load which is more pronounced under higher frictional coefficients. This finding proves that the efficiency of VLAFSE is higher than that of AFSE. Besides, the significant amount of accumulated shear strain in VLAFSE along with non-axisymmetric distribution of friction creates a surface feature in the processed sample called zipper effect that has been investigated. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Samples of AZ 31 wrought {{magnesium}} alloy are hot extruded into forward direction with various initial billet temperatures and extrusion ratios (ERs). Usually the insufficient room temperature formability of magnesium wrought alloys makes processing steps like rolling, extrusion etc. difficult, thus limiting their use for rolled or wrought parts. However, {{in this paper}} experiment is preformed under the hot <b>forward</b> <b>extrusion</b> process for AZ 31 wrought {{magnesium alloy}} with different important parameters. Major process parameters such as punch speed, billet temperatures and ERs are considered and applied to the hot extrusion process with a constant value of the die land. The influence of different billet temperatures and ERs on the hot <b>forward</b> <b>extrusion</b> process is investigated and analyzed {{in terms of the}} grain flow, microstructure, grain size and hardness distribution of formed part for magnesium and Mg alloy. Maximum forming loads for various main parameters is tackled and checked to know the optimum forming load for hot <b>forward</b> <b>extrusion</b> process. Also finest grain sizes and an inhomogeneous microstructure of extruded parts seem to occur near the die land of tool-set due to the anisotropic plastic behavior during the hot extrusion process. Extrusion properties such as extrusion load, grain size, micro hardness and surface quality are compared between the main parameters during the hot <b>forward</b> <b>extrusion</b> process. In addition it is easily disclosed from the experiment results that the die land designed for safe tool-set {{plays a key role in}} improving the mechanical properties of formed product during hot <b>forward</b> <b>extrusion</b> process for AZ 31 magnesium alloy...|$|E

40|$|Cold {{extrusion}} is {{a process}} commonly used to manufacture drive train components in the automotive industry. Large plastic strains can be applied during this operation (up to 1. 5) and greatly changes the mechanical properties of the resulting material. This study focuses {{on the impact of}} cold extrusion process parameters on the multiaxial fatigue behaviour of steel components. A specific set of <b>forward</b> rod <b>extrusion</b> tools was developed to get original fatigue specimen able to characterise the effect of the manufacturing process on the fatigue behaviour. The specimens were extruded from two different initial diameters, giving two different reductions in cross-section of 18 % and 75 % respectively. To understand the influence of cold extrusion, the following analyses have been undertaken for each condition and on the initial material: monotonic tensile properties, microstructure, EBSD, residual stresses and hardness. Simulation of the forming process and microstructural observations show that the plastic strain is homogeneous in the specimen section. For both reduction factors, the forming process has a positive effect on the components properties: induced residual stresses in compression and improved hardness and roughness (Ra decreasing). Tension, plane bending and torsion fatigue tests show that the fatigue strength is about 30 % higher for the batch with 75 % reduced cross-section. All investigations show that strain hardening is the principal material parameter responsible for the increase in fatigue strength. A multiaxial fatigue criterion taking into account the effects of the <b>forward</b> rod <b>extrusion</b> process was also developed. This work has been performed within the ANR (National Research Agency) DEFISURF project, in a partnership including several industrial (Ascometal, Cetim, PSA, Transvalor, Atelier des Janves, Gévelot) and academic (INSA Lyon MATEIS, ENSMP-CEMEF, Arts et Métiers ParisTech LAMPA) institutions...|$|R
