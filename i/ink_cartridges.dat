On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion; and the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter for violation of copyright. 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes designed to waste <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges,</b> and launching DDoS attacks against its websites.|$|E
25|$|Printer <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> can be reused. They are sorted by {{brand and}} model, to be {{refilled}} or resold {{back to the}} manufacturers. The companies then refill the ink reservoir to resell to consumers. Toner cartridges are recycled {{the same way as}} <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges,</b> using toner instead of ink. This method is highly efficient as there is no energy spent on melting and recreating the cartridges.|$|E

25|$|The Space Pen, {{also known}} as the Zero Gravity Pen, is a pen that uses {{pressurized}} <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> and is claimed to write in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in extreme temperature ranges. The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The thixotropic ink in the hermetically sealed and pressurized reservoir is claimed to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen. In 1965, the space pen was invented and patented by Paul C. Fisher. After two years of testing at NASA, the space pen was first used during the Apollo 7 mission in 1968.|$|E

Refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing, and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade. Works like [...] "The Waste Makers" [...] by Vance Packard explain some of the criticism of exports of working product, for example, the ban on import of tested working Pentium 4 laptops to China, or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by Japan.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> are {{typically}} priced at $13 to $75 per ounce ($1,664 to $9,600 per gallon) of ink, meaning that refill cartridges sometimes cost a substantial {{fraction of the}} cost of the printer. To save money, many people use compatible <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> from a vendor other than the printer manufacturer. Others use aftermarket inks, refilling their own <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> using a kit that includes bulk ink. The high cost of cartridges has also provided an incentive for counterfeiters to supply cartridges falsely claiming to be made by the original manufacturer. The print cartridge industry lost an estimated $3 billion in 2009 due to this, according to an International Data Corporation estimate.|$|E
