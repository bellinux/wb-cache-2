5|$|The <b>Fab</b> Five is a 2011 ESPN Films {{documentary}} about the 1990s Michigan Wolverines men's basketball players known collectively as the <b>Fab</b> Five: Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. It chronicles the recruitment, glory years, notorious time-out fiasco, cultural impact and the scandal that followed these players who are described as iconic figures in the media. The film originally aired on March 13, 2011 on a national broadcast on ESPN. On its original airing, the film drew 2.7 million viewers, setting a record as the highest-rated ESPN documentary ever.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Fab</b> Five, the 1991 {{recruiting}} {{class of}} five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having {{gone to the}} championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts, which was later popularized by Michael Jordan, and for wearing black athletic socks. Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited. Although Webber was {{the only member of}} the <b>Fab</b> Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished. Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans. and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors. All but Jackson played in the NBA. They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book entitled <b>Fab</b> Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream, which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie. In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, <b>Fab</b> Five, that was the network's highest-rated in its history.|$|E
40|$|Context. The {{evidence}} of a decrease with increasing luminosity in the fraction <b>f(abs)</b> of absorbed and Compton-thin among X-ray-selected (2 - 10 keV) AGN is observationally well supported, while that {{of an increase in}} <b>f(abs)</b> with redshift is fairly controversial. In a previous paper, the gravitational effect of the SMBH on the molecular interstellar gas, in the central region of the host galaxy, was shown to predict an anti-correlation between <b>f(abs)</b> and the black-hole mass M(BH). Aims. The most recent findings on the distribution of the Eddington ratio lambda = L(b) /L(E) as a function of M(BH) and z are used to convert that relationship into one between <b>f(abs)</b> and both bolometric (L(b)) and X-ray (L(X)) luminosities at various values of z. Methods. The findings for lambda(M(BH), z) are properly treated to ensure completeness in the prediction of <b>f(abs)</b> above a certain luminosity, at values of z = 0. 1, 0. 35, 0. 7, and >= 1. To verify the consequence of these findings alone, we first adopted a distribution of gas surface density Sigma, observed in a sample of local spiral galaxies, irrespective of the galaxy morphological type and z. Results. Assuming the Eddington limit, lambda = 1, in the lambda(M(BH), z) distribution as a "natural" cut-off, the predictions are consistent with the existence of an anti-correlation between <b>f(abs)</b> and L(X), but they fail to reproduce an increase in <b>f(abs)</b> with z. Because the early type galaxies are on average much poorer in molecular gas than late type ones, a quantitative agreement with the local value of <b>f(abs)</b> requires the existence of a correlation between Sigma and the central activity. An increase in typical values of Sigma with z, correlated with the activity, might explain an increase in <b>f(abs)</b> with z. However, <b>f(abs)</b> could hardly exceed about 0. 3 at the highest luminosities...|$|R
40|$|An {{antibody}} phage display {{library was}} constructed from RNA extracted from lymph node cells of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -infected long-term-nonprogressor macaque. Seven gp 120 -reactive <b>Fabs</b> {{were obtained by}} selection of the library against SIV monomeric gp 120. Although each of the <b>Fabs</b> was unique in sequence, there were two distinct groups based on epitope recognition, neutralizing activity in vitro, and molecular analysis. Group 1 <b>Fabs</b> did not neutralize SIV and bound to a linear epitope in the V 3 loop of the SIV envelope. In contrast, two of the group 2 <b>Fabs</b> neutralized homologous, neutralization-sensitive SIVsm isolates with high efficiency but failed to neutralize heterologous SIVmac isolates. Based on competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with mouse monoclonal antibodies of known specificity, these <b>Fabs</b> reacted with a conformational epitope that includes domains V 3 and V 4 of the SIV envelope. These neutralizing and nonneutralizing <b>Fabs</b> provide valuable standardized and renewable reagents for studying the role of antibody in preventing or modifying SIV infection in vivo.

5|$|In summary, the <b>Fab</b> {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the <b>Fab</b> region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E

40|$|Histone {{modifications}} play {{an important}} role in epigenetic gene regulation and genome integrity. It remains largely unknown, however, how these modifications dynamically change in individual cells. By using fluorescently labeled specific antigen binding fragments (<b>Fabs),</b> we have developed a general method to monitor the distribution and global level of endogenous histone H 3 lysine modifications in living cells without disturbing cell growth and embryo development. <b>Fabs</b> produce distinct nuclear patterns that are characteristic of their target modifications. H 3 K 27 trimethylation-specific <b>Fabs,</b> for example, are concentrated on inactive X chromosomes. As <b>Fabs</b> bind their targets transiently, the ratio of bound and free molecules depends on the target concentration, allowing us to measure changes in global modification levels. High-affinity <b>Fabs</b> are suitable for mouse embryo imaging, so we have used them to monitor H 3 K 9 and H 3 K 27 acetylation levels in mouse preimplantation embryos produced by in vitro fertilization and somatic cell nuclear transfer. The data suggest that a high level of H 3 K 27 acetylation is important for normal embryo development. As Fab-based live endogenous modification labeling (FabLEM) is broadly useful for visualizing any modification, it should be a powerful tool for studying cell signaling and diagnosis in the future...|$|R
