5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, <b>iridocyclitis,</b> and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
2500|$|In the eye, {{atropine}} induces mydriasis {{by blocking}} contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with <b>iridocyclitis,</b> and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma.|$|E

5000|$|Anterior uveitis {{includes}} <b>iridocyclitis</b> and iritis. Iritis is {{the inflammation}} of the anterior chamber and iris. <b>Iridocyclitis</b> presents the same symptoms as iritis, but also includes inflammation in the ciliary body. [...] Anywhere from two-thirds to 90% of uveitis cases are anterior in location. This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature.|$|E

50|$|A {{reduction}} in visual acuity in a 'red eye' {{is indicative of}} serious ocular disease, such as keratitis, <b>iridocyclitis,</b> and glaucoma, and never occurs in simple conjunctivitis without accompanying corneal involvement.|$|E
50|$|Ciliary flush {{is usually}} present in eyes with corneal inflammation, <b>iridocyclitis</b> or acute glaucoma, though not simple conjunctivitis.A ciliary flush is {{a ring of}} red or violet {{spreading}} out from around the cornea of the eye.|$|E
50|$|Eye changes {{associated}} with the disease have been described since the 1980s, being found as uveitis, <b>iridocyclitis,</b> conjunctival hemorrhage, optic neuritis, amaurosis, and ocular artery obstruction. It {{can also be found}} as necrotizing vasculitis, progressing into peripheral gangrene.|$|E
50|$|Intraocular {{pressure}} {{should be}} measured {{as part of}} the routine eye examination.It is usually only elevated by <b>iridocyclitis</b> or acute-closure glaucoma, but not by relatively benign conditions.In iritis and traumatic perforating ocular injuries, the intraocular pressure is usually low.|$|E
50|$|A Cochrane review {{compared}} {{outcomes of}} people treated with ivermectin alone versus doxycycline plus ivermectin. While {{there were no}} differences in most vision-related outcomes between the two treatments, there was low quality evidence suggesting treatment with doxycycline plus ivermectine showed improvement in <b>iridocyclitis</b> and punctate keratitis, over those treated with ivermectine alone.|$|E
50|$|In {{the acute}} {{stage of the}} disease, a {{catarrhal}} conjunctivitis is present, with signs of ocular pain, usually blepharospasm, increased lacrimation, and photophobia. Miosis is also usually present. After a few days, this will progress to a keratitis and <b>iridocyclitis.</b> Other ocular problems may also occur, including conjunctival and corneal oedema, and aqueous flare.|$|E
50|$|A synechia is an eye {{condition}} {{where the}} iris adheres {{to either the}} cornea (i.e. anterior synechia) or lens (i.e. posterior synechia). Synechiae {{can be caused by}} ocular trauma, iritis or <b>iridocyclitis</b> and may lead to certain types of glaucoma. It is sometimes visible on careful examination but usually more easily through an ophthalmoscope or slit-lamp.|$|E
50|$|Acute, tender, {{erythematous}} plaques, nodes, pseudovesicles and, occasionally, blisters with an annular or arciform pattern {{occur on}} the head, neck, legs, and arms, particularly {{the back of the}} hands and fingers. The trunk is rarely involved. Fever (50%); arthralgia or arthritis (62%); eye involvement, most frequently conjunctivitis or <b>iridocyclitis</b> (38%); and oral aphthae (13%) are associated features.|$|E
50|$|In an {{eye with}} <b>iridocyclitis,</b> (inflammation {{of both the}} iris and ciliary body), the {{involved}} pupil will be smaller than the uninvolved, due to reflex muscle spasm of the sphincter muscle of the iris.Generally, conjunctivitis {{does not affect the}} pupils.With acute angle-closure glaucoma, the pupil is generally fixed in mid-position, oval, and responds sluggishly to light, if at all.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the author}} of 74 medical papers, many of which {{concerned}} the eye's aqueous humor. He was also interested in uveitis; in 1964 he listed 130 different diseases in which uveitis may happen.

50|$|Equine {{recurrent}} uveitis (ERU), {{also known}} as moon blindness, recurrent <b>iridocyclitis</b> or periodic ophthalmia, is an acute, nongranulomatous inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye, occurring commonly in horses of all breeds, worldwide. The causative factor is not known, but several pathogeneses have been suggested. It {{is the most common}} cause of blindness in horses. In some breeds, a genetic factor may be involved.|$|E
50|$|Rash {{occurs in}} 40-50% of cases, {{generally}} as a maculopapular rash occurring {{two to five}} days after onset of symptoms. Digestive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, may also occur. In {{more than half of}} cases, normal activity is limited by significant fatigue and pain. Infrequently, inflammation of the eyes may occur in the form of <b>iridocyclitis,</b> or uveitis, and retinal lesions may occur.|$|E

50|$|In {{clinical}} trials for melanoma, the following side effects occurred {{in more than}} 10% of subjects and more frequently than with chemotherapy alone: rash and itchy skin, cough, upper respiratory tract infections, and peripheral edema. Other clinically important side effects with less than 10% frequency were ventricular arrhythmia, inflammation of parts of the eye (<b>iridocyclitis),</b> infusion-related reactions, dizziness, peripheral and sensory neuropathy, peeling skin, erythema multiforme, vitiligo, and psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|Fuchs heterochromic <b>iridocyclitis</b> - a {{condition}} {{characterized by a}} low grade, asymptomatic uveitis in which the iris in the affected eye becomes hypochromic and has a washed-out, somewhat moth eaten appearance. The heterochromia can be very subtle, especially in patients with lighter colored irides. It is often most easily seen in daylight. The prevalence of heterochromia associated with Fuchs has been estimated in various studies with results suggesting {{that there is more}} difficulty recognizing iris color changes in dark-eyed individuals.|$|E
50|$|Eye disease: JIA is {{associated}} with inflammation {{in the front of}} the eye (specifically <b>iridocyclitis,</b> a form of chronic anterior uveitis), which affects about one child in five who has JIA, most commonly girls. This complication is usually asymptomatic and can be detected by an experienced optometrist or ophthalmologist using a slit lamp. Later slit lamp features include synechiae. Most children with JIA are enrolled in a regular slit lamp screening program, as poorly controlled chronic anterior uveitis may result in permanent eye damage, including blindness.|$|E
50|$|Fuchs heterochromic <b>iridocyclitis</b> (FHI) is {{a chronic}} {{unilateral}} uveitis appearing with the triad of heterochromia, predisposition to cataract and glaucoma, and keratitic precipitates on the posterior corneal surface. Patients are often asymptomatic and {{the disease is}} often discovered through investigation of {{the cause of the}} heterochromia or cataract. Neovascularisation (growth of new abnormal vessels) is possible and any eye surgery, such as cataract surgery, can cause bleeding from the fragile vessels in the atrophic iris causing accumulation of blood in anterior chamber of the eye, also known as hyphema.|$|E
50|$|In the US {{corticotropin}} is used {{to treat}} epileptic spasms in infants, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults; acute episodes of psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; in acute exacerbations or as maintenance therapy for the collagen disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic dermatomyositis; for skin conditions like severe erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome; for serum sickness; for severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye such as keratitis, iritis, <b>iridocyclitis,</b> diffuse posterior uveitis, choroiditis, optic neuritis, chorioretinitis, and anterior segment inflammation; sarcoidosis in the lungs; and to treat edema in certain nephrotic syndromes.|$|E
50|$|Amsler sign {{also known}} as Amsler-Verrey sign {{is the name of}} the {{diagnostic}} finding seen in patients with Fuchs heterochromic <b>iridocyclitis</b> (FHI). It is described as presence of blood (hyphema) in the aspirated vitreous fluid, in paracentesis of the anterior chamber, and is caused due to iris atrophy usually seen in FHI and exposure of the fragile iris vasculature to the vitreous fluid. The sudden change of pressure in the anterior chamber upon suction induced by the paracentesis, or during a cataract surgery, causes bursting of the fragile superficial iris capillaries resultsing in micro-bleeding. This is one clinical diagnostic sign of FHI.|$|E
50|$|Retinal {{vasculitis}} is {{inflammation of}} the vascular branches of the retinal artery, caused either by primary ocular disease processes, or as a specific presentation of any systemic form of vasculitis such as Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, or any form of systemic nectrozing vasculitis such as temporal arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or due to lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis. Eales disease, pars planitis, birdshot retinochoroidopathy (autoimmune bilateral posterior uveitis), and Fuchs heterochromic <b>iridocyclitis</b> (FHI) can also cause retinal vasculitis. Infectious pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, visceral larva migrans (Toxocara canis & Toxocara cati) can also cause retinal vasculitis.|$|E
50|$|Involvement {{of the eye}} {{is rarely}} the initial symptom but {{develops}} in 60% of persons with RP. The most common forms of ocular involvement are usually mild and often consist of unilateral or bilateral episcleritis and/or scleritis, that is often anterior and could be lingering or relapsing. Scleritis that is necrotizing {{is found to be}} exceedingly rare. Less often, conjunctivitis occurs.There are also other ocular manifestations that occur in persons with RP, these include keratoconjunctivitis sicca, peripheral keratitis (rarely with ulcerations), anterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, proptosis, lid edema, keratoconus, retinopathy, <b>iridocyclitis</b> and ischemic optic neuritis that can lead to blindness.Cataract also is reported in relation to either the disease or to glucocorticoid exposure.|$|E
5000|$|When {{used as a}} {{descriptive}} term in medicine, the meaning of red eye is quite different, and indicates that the bulbar conjunctiva is reddened due to dilatation of superficial blood vessels. Leaving aside rarities, it indicates surface infection (conjunctivitis), intraocular inflammation (e.g., <b>iridocyclitis)</b> or high intraocular pressure (acute glaucoma or occasionally severe, untreated chronic glaucoma). This use of [...] "red eye" [...] implies disease. The term is therefore not used in medicine for ocular albinism, in which the eye is otherwise healthy despite an obviously red pupil and a translucent pinkish iris due to reflected light from the fundus. [...] "Red eye" [...] is used more loosely in veterinary practice, where investigation of eye diseases can be difficult, but even so albinotic breeds are easily recognised and are usually described as having [...] "pink eye" [...] rather than [...] "red eye".|$|E

5000|$|In 1985 Edward Blau, a {{pediatrician}} in Marshfield, Wisconsin, reported {{a family that}} over four generations had granulomatous inflammation of the skin, eyes and joints. The condition was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In the same year Jabs et al. reported a family that over two generations had granulomatous synovitis, uveitis and cranial neuropathies. The condition was transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 1981 Malleson et al. reported a family that had autosomal dominant synovitis, camptodactyly, and <b>iridocyclitis.</b> One member died of granulomatous arteritis {{of the heart and}} aorta. In 1982 Rotenstein reported a family with granulomatous arteritis, rash, iritis, and arthritis transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait over three generations. Then in 1990 Pastores et al. reported a kindred with a phenotype very similar to what Blau described and suggested that the condition be called Blau Syndrome (BS). They also pointed out the similarities in the families noted above to BS but also pointed out the significant differences in the phenotypes ...|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the smaller}} joints are {{affected}} in polyarticular JIA, {{such as the}} fingers and hands, although weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, and ankles may also be affected. The joints affected are usually symmetrical, meaning that it affects both joints {{on both sides of}} the body (such as both wrists.) Children with polyarticular JIA are also at risk for developing chronic <b>iridocyclitis</b> or uveitis and should also be monitored by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.Rheumatoid factor may be positive, i.e. seropositive, in children with polyarticular JIA occurring between 9 and 16 years of age and is associated with HLA DR4 and HLA DW4. This group has poorer prognosis with about 50% progressing to severe disabiling arthritis, persisting into adulthood. It is generally seronegative in JIA occurring below 10 years of age with a milder disease process and responds better to treatment. Seropositivity is rare in children with systemic JIA. Due to the greater number of joints affected by polyarticular JIA, as well as the tendency to worsen over time, polyarticular JIA must be treated aggressively.|$|E
5000|$|This form {{accounts}} for about 50% of JIA cases, and usually involves the large joints such as the knees, ankles, and elbows, but smaller joints (such as the fingers and toes) may also be affected. The hip is not affected unlike polyarticular JIA. It is usually not symmetrical, meaning the affected joints are {{on one side of}} the body rather than on both sides simultaneously. Length discrepancy and muscle atrophy often happen, which leads to asymmetric growth and risk of flexion contracture. Early childhood onset patients are at risk for developing a chronic <b>iridocyclitis</b> or anterior uveitis, which is inflammation of the eye. This condition often goes unnoticed; therefore, these children should be closely monitored by an ophthalmologist. If ANA+, patient need routine eye exam every 3 months. If ANA- and older than 7 years, they can have eye exam every 6 months. [...] Children with late-onset oligoarticular JIA are at risk for sacroiliitis and spondyloarthropathy; late-onset oligoarticular JIA affects boys more often than girls and is associated with HLA-B27.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{disadvantages}} of corneal tattooing are {{the difficulty of}} performing the procedure {{and the risk of}} the procedure. Going blind from the attempt of the procedure is a possibility. Corneal tattooing is a procedure that is very difficult to perform precisely. Often, the area tattooed fades after time and rarely remains permanently. The size of the area tattooed also might reduce over time. Sometimes, the results are not what were expected, and the eye might need to be re-tattooed. Also, results may not last very long because of the multiple incisions, and the multiple lacerations might cause recurrent corneal erosions. Finally, not all leucoma respond to the tattooing. J.N. Roy says, [...] "All leucomas do not equally respond to intervention, which must be done only on those which present old, solid and flat corneal cicatrices." [...] Also, there are some considerable dangers linked to corneal tattooing. Some patients complain that it feels like something is in their eye and slight redness. The ink might not remain in the cornea and could possibly cause keratitis. Other complications include [...] "toxic reaction, <b>iridocyclitis,</b> persistent corneal epithelial defects, and corneal ulceration." [...] In summary, the corneal tattooing might not always work successfully, and physicians run into problems such as fading, reduction in size, complications, and short-term results.|$|E
