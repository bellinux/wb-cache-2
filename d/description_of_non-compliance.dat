30|$|Eight {{studies have}} focused on the {{determination}} of the leading causes of ICU admissions due to preventable ADE [7 – 10, 12, 14, 17, 18]. Similar leading causes to that found in our study were reported (in variable proportions): drug misuse (dose error, inadequate follow-up, drug interaction, administration error and contraindication), underuse (absence of prophylaxis) and overuse (inappropriate drug). However, the present study is the first to date to provide a comprehensive <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and self-medication as leading causes of ICU admissions. The fact that patients in the preventable ADE group came more often from home or the Emergency Department than those in the unpreventable ADE group is in line with the study of Heaton et al. which reported that non-compliance substantially required Emergency Department visits [37]. In our study, medication non-compliance was the principal leading cause of ICU admissions due to preventable ADE (30  %), showing that adherence failure might also generate severe outcomes and a significant burden for the healthcare system.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDigoxin {{is highly}} potent and efficacious for {{treatment}} of heart failure (HF) and/or atrial fibrillation (AF) yet compliance is often poor. AimsTo examine prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin; variations between clinical settings, types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection; and potential factors influencing non-compliance with digoxin. MethodsThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin in patients with HF and/or AF, published in English. The studies were identified through these bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, IPA and Cochrane CENTRAL. Subgroup analysis examined the influence of clinical settings, types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection. ResultsTen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1841 patients with HF and/or AF. The corresponding prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for outpatients, after hospital discharge and inpatients were 43. 1 % (interquartile range [IQR] 29 – 48 %), 25 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 12 – 37 %) and 4. 5 %, respectively. In patients with HF and AF co-morbidities, the prevalence rate <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin was 38. 7 % (IQR 27 – 46 %); the corresponding prevalence rates of overdosing and underdosing were 33. 04 % (IQR 22 – 49 %) and 33. 8 % (95 % CI 25 – 42 %), respectively. Rates varied depending on the methods <b>of</b> detecting <b>non-compliance.</b> Regularity <b>of</b> prescribed dose, diuretic use, coronary artery bypass, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, number of office visits and pill boxes demonstrated strong associations with non-compliance with digoxin. ConclusionsNon-compliance with digoxin is prevalent among patients with HF and/or AF. A {{better understanding of the}} factors influencing compliance and improved intervention strategies are necessary to increase digoxin compliance...|$|R

30|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{developing}} a simple theoretical model in which the obvious benefits <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for an employer are to be set against the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> We model these as composed of the probability of getting caught, and the fine imposed if caught. However, alternative interpretations of the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are possible, including peer effects. We model the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> {{as a function of}} the total short fall of the wage bill compared to full compliance, allowing for the possibility that employers adjust partially towards the minimum wage. The model predicts that employment will fall as the result of a minimum wage, but that a spread of wages below the minimum wage should be observed in response to the law. Employer responses to a minimum wage law depend on the level at which the minimum wage is set, relative to the existing wage. Wages will rise towards the minimum wage, and under certain conditions, the lowest wages will rise proportionately more than those close to the stipulated minimum.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} find out why states do not obey law beyond the nation-state, i. e. why they violate legally binding norms and rules that cannot relay on a {{monopoly}} of legitimate power for their enforcement. The EU is an ideal case to explore the sources <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with law beyond the nation-state. As it is the institution with the most developed body of supranational law, it presents a critical case for non-compliance {{in the sense of a}} least likely case. Moreover, it offers a rich field for empirical research since cases <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are comprehensively documented according to the nature <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> the type <b>of</b> law infringed and the policy sector to which the law pertains, the violating member states and measures taken by EU institutions in response to non-compliance...|$|R

The dissemination <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> within a selection of regulatory requirements was also examined. The result shows that the proportion non-compliances increase when more than one inspector is present. Inspectors carrying out fewer controls show significant differences in their assessment of compliance with certain requirements.

40|$|Despite {{improvements}} {{in the management of}} hypertension in the past several years, nearly 70 % of patients with hypertension are not adequately controlled. Today's physician treating hypertension is armed with numerous efficacious antihypertensive agents. Thus, one of the major contributors to the large number of uncontrolled hypertensive patients appears to be non-compliance with prescribed regimens. Non-compliance is a universal characteristic and can affect all patients. However, the major problem <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> is that it remains largely unrecognised in clinical practice. Several types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> exist with the 'drug holiday' being the most common. Good communication with the patient and the entire health care team is critical in increasing patient compliance. Long-acting medications that provide good blood pressure control beyond the 24 -hour dosing period should be considered drugs of choice in non-compliant hypertensive patients. This article will discuss different types of compliance, methods to measure compliance, and clinical consequences <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in hypertension...|$|R
