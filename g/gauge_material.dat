40|$|The {{enhancement}} of optical forces has enabled {{a variety of}} technological applications that rely on the optical control of small objects and devices. Unfortunately, optical forces are still {{too small for the}} convenient actuation of integrated switches and waveguide couplers. Here we show how the optical gradient force can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by making use of <b>gauge</b> <b>materials</b> inside two evanescently coupled waveguides. To this end, the <b>gauge</b> <b>materials</b> inside the cores should emulate imaginary vector potentials for photons pointing perpendicularly to the waveguide plane. Depending on the relative orientation of the vector potentials in neighboring waveguides, i. e., pointing away from or towards each other, the conventional attractive force due to an even mode profile may be enhanced, suppressed, or may even become repulsive. This and other new features indicate that the implementation of complex-valued vector potentials with non-Hermitian waveguide cores may further enhance our control over mode profiles and the associated optical forces...|$|R

50|$|To reduce both air {{resistance}} and rolling resistance on the road, tires are lightweight, narrow, {{and have a}} thin, smooth tread. They are inflated to a high pressure, typically around 8 bar (820kPa/120psi); track racing tires can be inflated up to circa 14 bar. Until recently, most racing bikes used tubular tires which have no beads: they are sewn around the tube and glued to the rim. These tires provide an advantage in weight (lacking the relatively heavy wire bead), rolling resistance, grip and pinch flat protection, but their greatest advantage lies {{in the ability to}} use a very lightweight simple box-section rim, rather than the U-shaped clincher rim. A U-shaped clincher rim must be made of relatively heavier <b>gauge</b> <b>material</b> to prevent the tire pressure from spreading the inherently weak U shape and allowing the tire to come off the rim. Advances in tire technology, however, have seen the far more practical (due to greater ease of changeability) clincher (beaded) tire close the gap.Some manufacturers create tubular-clincher tires, where the tires are sewn around the tubes and have a bead, but there is some debate as to the effectiveness of a tubular-clincher tire. Proponents believe that it has all the advantages of a tubular tire made to fit a clincher rim, but critics argue that the design includes disadvantages inherent to both systems---the rim weight is still high, the tire is more expensive than a standard clincher tire, and repairing a puncture on a tubular clincher is as inconvenient as it is with a standard tubular tire. However, a particular benefit of the tubular-clincher design is that the risk of pinch flats is very low (like the tubular tire), yet it allows the use of the more popular clincher wheel.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel normal and shear force sensor by using liquid metal alloy (Ga-In-Sn) as piezoresistive <b>gauge</b> <b>material</b> {{encapsulated}} in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate.

Each force sensor comprises a pair of symmetric piezoresistors, which is screen-printed on the cavity of PDMS substrate with tilt angle around 30 ° {{to be sensitive to}} both normal and shear forces. Normal force will compress both piezoresistors as common mode while shear force will shorten one piezoresistor but elongate the other as differential mode.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} the basic {{mathematical}} {{structure of a}} thermo-poro-mechanical model for faults under rapid shear is discussed.

The <b>gauge</b> <b>material</b> is considered as a two-phase material consisting of a thermo-elastic fluid and of a thermoporo-elasto-viscoplastic skeleton. The governing equations are derived from first principles, expressing mass, energy and momentum balance inside the fault. They are a set of coupled diffusion-generation equations that contain three unknown functions, the pore-pressure, the temperature and the velocity field inside the fault. The original mathemetically ill-posed problem is regularized using a viscous-type and a 2 nd gradient regularization. Numerical results are presented and discussed. 1...|$|E

A parabolic relationship between the real part of the impedance Zre and the true strain ε is observed, mainly due to the resistance change of the electrolyte.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations to determine how process settings and crimp geometry affect the seal strength and integrity of traditional polyolefin and biopolymer flexible packaging materials. The results show agreement with previous studies where temperature and dwell time are found to be the dominant factors for both polyolefin and biopolymer films. Pressure and crimp geometry are shown to be secondary factors in the process, up to the point of squeezing the film into molecular contact. In general it is shown that biopolymers exhibit similar sealing characteristics to more traditional films. In respect of the sealing crimp geometry it is shown that the crimp pitch has little or no effect on sealing integrity for films with gauges between 25 µm and 40 µm. But, for the same <b>gauge</b> <b>material,</b> crimp angles greater than 80 ° offer the greatest potential to gain higher seal strengths. It is further shown that with the cellulose and PLA films tested, a higher seal strength can be produced with crimp pitches of 2 mm and lower.
