40|$|C++ {{is often}} {{described}} as an object-oriented programming language because of its strong support for classes with multiple inheritance and polymorphism. However, for a growing community of numerical programmers, an equally important feature of C++ is its support of operator overloading on value-semantic classes. The union of these two techniques results in a programming style which we choose to call object-oriented numerics. The object-oriented numerics paradigm emphasizes the distinction between polymorphic classes and value-semantic classes. Polymorphic classes are generally high-level, are part <b>of</b> an <b>inheritance</b> hierarchy, and have an interface of named functions based on message passing. Value-semantic classes are generally low-level, are <b>not</b> part <b>of</b> an <b>inheritance</b> hierarchy (but may form a conversion hierarchy), and have a public interface of overloaded operators based on an algebra.

40|$|Abstract. The {{integration}} of the concurrent mechanisms in object-oriented programming is without doubt, an attractive idea. Unfortunately, the design of some efficient programming languages that can achieve this thing is extremely difficult. The primitives of communication and synchronization between concurrent activities interfere with features of the object-oriented programming causing the deterioration of some properties of some concepts that {{form the basis of}} those two programming techniques. The inheritance anomalies represent the most intensively studied in the literature conflicts generated by such interference. A systematically analysis of these conflicts was not been done until now. Moreover, we want to prove that any of the classifications of these anomalies achieved until now are not complete. We will show as well, that conflicts between concurrency and delegation or between concurrency and association are of the same type as the inheritance anomalies, and the key of these latter determines automatically the elimination of those other conflicts. In this way, we will suggest in the end the global treatment of all conflicts of this type (and <b>not</b> only <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> anomalies in particular) using the generic name of reuse anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a debate over what the notion <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> means [1, 9, 13, 15, 16]. For example, Winkler [16] points to the {{dichotomy}} between the concept-oriented view (COV) and the program-oriented view (POV) <b>of</b> classes and <b>inheritance.</b> Wegner [15] has referred to COV as “logical” and POV as “physical. ” According to COV, squares form a subclass of rectangles. But this leads to some major problems in POV, where the set of operations applicable to a subclass is seen as a monotonic extension of its superclass. This is because applying operations such as “set-width ” to a square object would allow one to change the width of a square independently of its length. To remedy this situation, Winkler proposes an object-oriented view (OOV) <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> that replaces the term “class, ” “subclass ” and “superclass ” with “object type, ” “extension type ” and “base type, ” respectively. Winkler makes it seem to be a dichotomy of two different, overlapping but <b>not</b> identical, views <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> that can be resolved by renaming the concepts involved. But {{it turns out to be}} a more complex issue on deeper reflection. To realize the full complexity underlying the notion <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> we must take a closer look at what Winkler has casually dubbed COV. Is inheritance from a conceptual point of view always (or often) unambiguous? Is a square always a rectangle? While one may be tempted to answer both these questions in the affirmative at first, a further reflection reveals that things are more subtle. For instance, if we were to just think of a class of all squares and a class of all rectangles, then obviously the former is a proper subclass o...|$|R

40|$|Commensal gut {{bacteria}} in many species including flies are {{integral part of}} their host, and are known to influence its development and homeostasis within generation. Here we report an unexpected impact of host-microbe interactions, which mediates multi-generational, non-Mendelian <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> a stress-induced phenotype. We have previously shown that exposure of fly larvae to G 418 antibiotic induces transgenerationally heritable phenotypes, including a delay in larval development, gene induction in the gut and morphological changes. We now show that G 418 selectively depletes commensal Acetobacter species and that this depletion explains the heritable delay, but <b>not</b> the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> the other phenotypes. Notably, the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> the delay was mediated by a surprising trans-generational effect. Specifically, bacterial removal from F 1 embryos did not induce significant delay in F 1 larvae, but nonetheless led to a considerable delay in F 2. This effect maintains a delay induced by bacterial-independent G 418 toxicity to the host. In line with these findings, reintroduction of isolated Acetobacter species prevented the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> the delay. We further show that this prevention is partly mediated by vitamin B 2 (Riboflavin) produced by these bacteria; exogenous Riboflavin led to partial prevention and inhibition of Riboflavin synthesis compromised {{the ability of the}} bacteria to prevent the inheritance. These results identify host-microbe interactions as a hitherto unrecognized factor capable <b>of</b> mediating non-Mendelian <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> a stress-induced phenotype. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a semantic model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and investigates its {{applications for the}} analysis and design <b>of</b> programming languages. <b>Inheritance</b> is a mechanism for incremental programming {{in the presence of}} self-reference.

Novel applications <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> revealed by the model are illustrated to show that inheritance has wider significance beyond object-oriented class inheritance. Constraints induced by self-reference and inheritance are investigated using type theory and yield a formal characterization of abstract classes and a demonstration that the subtype relation is a direct consequence of the basic mechanism <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The model is proven equivalent to the operational semantics <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> embodied by the interpreters of object-oriented languages like Smalltalk.
