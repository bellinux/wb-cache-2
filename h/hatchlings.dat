5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, <b>hatchlings</b> dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. <b>Hatchlings</b> enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by {{the reflection of the}} moon and starlight off the water's surface.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys and her {{remaining}} followers build {{a funeral}} pyre for Drogo. Daenerys places her dragon eggs atop the pyre, and she orders Ser Jorah to tie Mirri to it. Having {{set fire to}} the pyre, Daenerys declares herself queen of a new khalasar, freeing those who would remain with her. Despite Jorah's worries, Daenerys then steps into the pyre. By daybreak, Jorah and the khalasar are surprised to find her unharmed in the ashes, carrying three dragon <b>hatchlings.</b> Amazed, they bow to Daenerys as one of the <b>hatchlings</b> clambers onto her shoulder and a dragon's screech is heard {{for the first time in}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hatchlings</b> measure 1 to 2mm {{in shell}} length, and yearlings average around 10mm. Measurements of all Novisuccinea chittenangoensis in 2002 ranged from 7 to 23mm.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{bacteria}} such as Pseudomonas and Salmonella attack loggerhead <b>hatchlings</b> and eggs. Fungi such as Penicillium infect loggerhead {{sea turtle}} nests and cloacae.|$|E
5|$|Apart from habitat {{destruction}} and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans {{are vulnerable to}} disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors. Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs, leave <b>hatchlings</b> exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, <b>hatchlings</b> commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The <b>hatchlings</b> {{are a source of}} food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile <b>hatchlings</b> is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and {{especially}} snapping turtles, {{have increased the}} predation of <b>hatchlings.</b> Outside the Southeast, where sliders are native, released pet red-eared slider turtles increasingly compete with painted turtles. In cities, increased urban predators (raccoons, canines, and felines) may impact painted turtles by eating their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate <b>hatchlings</b> from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. <b>Hatchlings</b> of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and <b>hatchlings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the <b>hatchlings</b> gulping air. The <b>hatchlings</b> are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hatchlings</b> {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hatchlings</b> were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.|$|E
5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and <b>hatchlings</b> survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests {{were more likely to}} fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.|$|E
5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. <b>Hatchlings</b> north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of embryonic ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus <b>hatchlings,</b> like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many <b>hatchlings.</b>|$|E
5|$|While nesting, Arctic terns are {{vulnerable}} to predation by cats and other animals. Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger herring gull steals eggs and <b>hatchlings.</b> Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do isolated nesting sites. While feeding, skuas, gulls, and other tern species will often harass the birds and steal their food. They often form mixed colonies with other terns, such as common and Sandwich terns.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the <b>hatchlings</b> emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. <b>Hatchlings</b> feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead <b>hatchlings</b> are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Gerhard Heilmann {{discussed}} Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable {{length in}} his 1926 book The Origin of Birds. Heilmann examined <b>hatchlings</b> {{of many other}} bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to more primitive species, in hope of finding additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists {{for the next several}} decades. Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis as late as the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose <b>hatchlings</b> start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), <b>hatchlings</b> begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their <b>hatchlings.</b>|$|E
5|$|In most {{of their}} range, egg laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, {{egg-laying}} takes place in December. Eggs and <b>hatchlings</b> are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are very rarely predated, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{animals are}} predators of or otherwise {{pose a threat}} to the wood turtle. They include snapping turtles, porcupines, raccoons, otters, foxes, and cats. All of these species destroy unhatched eggs and prey upon <b>hatchlings</b> and juveniles. Several animals that often target wood turtle eggs are the common raven and coyote, which may completely destroy the nests they encounter. Evidence of predatory attacks (wounds to the skin and such) are common on individuals, but the northern populations tend to display more scarring than the southern ones. In addition to these threats, wood turtles also suffer from leech infestations.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtles {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous <b>hatchlings</b> fall prey to water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, ospreys, crows, red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.|$|E
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the <b>hatchlings,</b> making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The <b>hatchlings</b> develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{of coconut}} crabs {{consists}} primarily of fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise <b>hatchlings</b> and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle <b>hatchlings,</b> and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E
5|$|The tyrannosaurids {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This is seen in modern Komodo dragons, where <b>hatchlings</b> start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. For example, Albertosaurus have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} {{takes a long}} time to reach sexual maturity, has a low {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or <b>hatchlings.</b> Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks in the spring and again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or <b>hatchlings.</b> Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
5|$|Three {{to seven}} eggs (typically four or five) are laid {{approximately}} 24–72 hours apart. The average egg size is , 10% larger than average for birds {{of its body}} size. The eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey splotching. Incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly {{the responsibility of the}} female, although the male incubates 15–20% of the time. Eggs that are lost are typically replaced in 11–12 days. Hatching takes place over three to four days. <b>Hatchlings</b> are altricial, and are only able to sit up after five days. They grow very quickly, reaching an adult weight after 16–17 days. After 28–31 days, their wings develop and they are able to leave the nest.|$|E
5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks {{begin to move}} around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for <b>hatchlings.</b> Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
