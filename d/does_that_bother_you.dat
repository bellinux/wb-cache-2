5000|$|Eisenhower sent Attorney General Herbert Brownell to {{meet with}} Bricker to try to delay {{consideration}} of the resolution while the administration studied it; Bricker refused, noting his original proposal was introduced over a year earlier in the previous session of Congress. Bricker was willing, however, to compromise on the language of an amendment, unlike Frank Holman, who was intent on a particular wording. However, the administration, particularly Dulles, irritated Bricker by refusing to offer an alternative to his resolution. [...] Eisenhower privately continued to disparage the Amendment with strong language, calling it [...] "a stupid blind violation of the Constitution by stupid, blind non-interventionists" [...] and stating [...] "if {{it is true that}} when you die the name of the things <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>you</b> the most are engraved on your skull, I'm sure I'll have there the mud and dirt of France during the invasion and the name of Senator Bricker." ...|$|R

5000|$|The song {{originated}} between vocalist Nicholas Petricca and guitarist Eli Maiman, {{who first}} developed the verse and found something infectious about it. The following weekend, Petricca {{went to a}} party named Funky Soul Saturday at The Echo in Echo Park, Los Angeles while feeling frustrated with the writing process. The song is largely based on that night: [...] "We were at the bar, and it was taking forever to get a drink. I was frustrated because there was great music playing and I wanted to be out there," [...] he remembered. His girlfriend, in [...] "a backless dress and some beat up sneaks", abruptly invited him to dance with her, inspiring the song's title. Petricca later went home {{to work on the}} song, and incorporated his experiences into the song's lyrics. After creating the song's main refrain, he began picturing himself in high school: an [...] "incredibly uncomfortable, awkward adolescent dude," [...] he imagined the song as [...] "an anthem for the dork who is 100 percent me." [...] In an interview with American Songwriter, he summarized the song's theme as [...] "Encouraging people to let go of whatever it is <b>that’s</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>you</b> and get into your body and out of your head." ...|$|R

[...] And after a little more talk he succeeded in mollifying the cook and the hired girl {{to such an extent}} that they went back to their work. Then the fathers of the boys withdrew once more to the library.|$|R

Eurogamer gave the game an 8 out of 10 stating [...] "For the first time, the Championship Manager series is {{a viable alternative to}} Football Manager... CM10's attempts to innovate must be applauded, and the majority of its refinements are either solid additions or real winners. MSN UK also applauded the game and concluded [...] "Once you get stuck into a season, it is fearsomely addictive, and all aspects of football management are present and correct, if not necessarily developed to Football Manager’s level of sophistication. It is a lot more forgiving than Football Manager... If <b>that</b> doesn’t <b>bother</b> <b>you,</b> it’s worth considering {{for the first time in}} years." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nobel Prize-winning {{physicist}} Richard Feynman recounts that he {{was approached}} by young rabbis in a seminary who asked him [...] "is electricity fire?". He replied, [...] "no", but asked why they wanted to know, and was shocked that they weren't interested in science at all, but just wanted to interpret the Talmud. Feynman said that electricity was not a chemical process, as fire is, and {{pointed out that there}} is electricity in atoms and thus every phenomenon that occurs in the world. Feynman proposed a simple way to eliminate the spark: '"If <b>that's</b> what's <b>bothering</b> <b>you,</b> you can put a condenser across the switch, so the electricity will go on and off without any spark whatsoever—anywhere.'

However, the difficulty must be got over somehow, and at any rate the plan seems to promise better than anything I had thought of. The first difficulty is how to get the ruffians for such a business. I cannot go up to the first beetle browed knave I meet in the street and say to him, 'Are you disposed to aid me in the abduction of a lady?'" ...|$|R

Hurricane Katrina, and the flood that followed, struck two years ago this month, and since then the tourists have returned, basic services are operating, and the city has crafted a comprehensive recovery plan. Linger a bit on the subject, however, and optimism quickly turns to exasperation.

Then with your left hand bring around the bow so that your fist--with the arrow-head, which is resting on top of it--shall point, as nearly as you can make it, directly at the centre of the target. Then let fly, and ten to one you'll make a hit. Now, what do you think of that for a discovery? I've thoroughly tested the plan, and it works splendidly." ...|$|R
