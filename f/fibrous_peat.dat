60|$|Earth-worms {{abound in}} England in many {{different}} stations. Their castings {{may be seen in}} extraordinary numbers on commons and chalk- downs, so as almost to cover the whole surface, where the soil is poor and the grass short and thin. But they are almost or quite as numerous in some of the London parks, where the grass grows well and the soil appears rich. Even on the same field worms are much more frequent in some places than in others, without any visible difference {{in the nature of the}} soil. They abound in paved court- yards close to houses; and an instance will be given in which they had burrowed through the floor of a very damp cellar. I have seen worms in black peat in a boggy field; but they are extremely rare, or quite absent in the drier, brown, <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat,</b> which is so much valued by gardeners. On dry, sandy or gravelly tracks, where heath with some gorse, ferns, coarse grass, moss and lichens alone grow, hardly any worms can be found. But in many parts of England, wherever a path crosses a heath, its surface becomes covered with a fine short sward. Whether this change of vegetation is due to the taller plants being killed by the occasional trampling of man and animals, or to the soil being occasionally manured by the droppings from animals, I do not know. {9} On such grassy paths worm- castings may often be seen. On a heath in Surrey, which was carefully examined, there were only a few castings on these paths, where they were much inclined; but on the more level parts, where a bed of fine earth had been washed down from the steeper parts and had accumulated to a thickness of a few inches, worm-castings abounded. These spots seemed to be overstocked with worms, so that they had been compelled to spread to a distance of a few feet from the grassy paths, and here their castings had been thrown up among the heath; but beyond this limit, not a single casting could be found. A layer, though a thin one, of fine earth, which probably long retains some moisture, is in all cases, as I believe, necessary for their existence; and the mere compression of the soil appears to be in some degree favourable to them, for they often abound in old gravel walks, and in foot-paths across fields.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{a thin layer of}} pumice la pilli and ash close {{to the surface of the}} Rukuhia and Moanatuatua peat bogs was recorded by Grange and Taylor (1939). Since this time a similar band of pumice has been noted in many of the other peat areas in the Hamilton basin. In the undeveloped <b>fibrous</b> <b>peats</b> of the Woodlands bog a layer of pumice lapilli 2 to 3 inches thick occurs at a depth of 18 to 20 inches from the surface. This is similar to the observations of Grange and Taylor. In the more loamy peats the pumice layer is predominantly fine ash and any lapilli present are extremely weathered and crush easily. In the <b>fibrous</b> <b>peats</b> it is thought that the fine ash that fell on the bog surface soon dispersed in the loose network of dead material, whereas the lapilli were of sufficient size to be trapped. In the loamy peats more active weathering took place in an acid environment as the organic matter was breaking down. This made the lapilli very fragile, so with drainage and compaction of the peat the lapilli were very soon crushed to fine ash size...|$|R

Controlled and repeated burning of different fuel sources (well-humified <b>peat,</b> <b>fibrous</b> upper <b>peat,</b> peat turf and wood) was carried out {{over a number of}} burning episodes, each of three days duration. A range of mineral magnetic measurements, including remanences and the variation of susceptibility with high temperature, were taken from the resulting ash samples. The high temperature susceptibility measurements show that the <b>fibrous</b> upper <b>peat</b> and peat turf have a single magnetic component, with a drop in magnetic susceptibility at ca. 600 &# 176;C. In comparison the well-humified peat and wood have one, sometimes two, distinct magnetic components characterized by drops in susceptibility at ca. 330 and ca. 550 &# 176;C. Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed on the room temperature magnetic data. A biplot of the resulting two main variables distinguishes the well-humified peat and wood.

Potting Epiphytic Orchids Epiphytes prefer conditions where roots can be exposed, therefore, tight pots and close-contact soil mixes do not work well and will induce rot. Mix 3 parts dust-free, medium-grade bark, 1 part coarse grit or perlite, 1 part charcoal, and 1 part peat moss together, OR use a commercial orchid mix. As with the terrestrial orchid, select a pot that will accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make sure {{that it has a}} drainage hole. Even better, select an orchid pot, which has vertical slits down sides. Hold orchid over pot so that crown is just below the rim of the pot.

Until roots attach, tie orchid in place with fishing line. Constant humidity is a must. Support Orchids that have long flower stalks will need staking. Staking is best done as stem grows and before buds open. Many growers prefer to insert stake when potting orchid, but it is up to you.|$|E

40|$|Limited {{data are}} {{available}} pertaining to the peat soils on south west Tasmanian mountains or on the variability of peat soils over the lowland to alpine environmental gradient. This thesis describes organic soils on Mt. Sprent, a 'typical' mountain, in south west Tasmania and analyses their relationships with climate, vegetation and topography. Climate data were collected using data loggers which recorded maximum and minimum air and surface temperatures, and relative humidity over a 30 month period. Rain gauges were located close to the data loggers. The climatic equipment was at four sites, at different altitudes ranging from 509 m to 1059 m. Vegetation data were collected along altitudinal and topographic gradients, using a cover/abundance measure for 25 m 2 quadrats. The altitudinal data were collected for every 10 m increase in altitude, while the topographic data were collected along a grid system of transects laid out at four sites on the mountain. Soils data were collected along the same topographic transects as the vegetation data. Soil depths were determined in the field, while physical properties were determined {{in the field and}} the laboratory. Other environmental data were collected along the altitudinal and the topographic gradients. A total of 34 water table wells were located on the mountain, at each of the four topographic study sites and at the climatic stations. Peat soils in south west Tasmania are shallow, with an average depth of 30 cm. Three types of <b>peat</b> were recognised: <b>fibrous,</b> intermediate and muck. These vary in their moisture content, organic content, degree of humification and depth. Where more than one peat type was found in a profile, shallow <b>fibrous</b> <b>peats</b> overlaid intermediate which in turn overlaid deeper muck peats. Peat depth, moisture content and organic content decrease with altitude inferring climatic influences on the processes of peat formation and decay. Rainfall and relative humidity were found to be more than adequate to support peat accumulation. The temperatures {{at the base of the}} mountain were higher than those reported in the literature for optimum peat formation. However, these temperatures were offset by very high rainfall and relative humidity values. By using evaporation data from a nearby village (12 km to the north east) and solar radiation values for the summit, evaporation rates for the mountain during summer were estimated. When compared to rainfall for the same period there was a moisture deficit at each station for February. Vegetation varies with altitude and along topographic gradients. Buttongrass moorland, alpine heathland and alpine sedgeland occur in an altitudinal sequence. The deepest soils are found under the lowland buttongrass moorland vegetation, and the shallowest soils occur under the alpine vegetation. The four vegetation groups coincided with the four soil groups. The amount of organic matter in the surface horizon was significantly related to vegetation type at two of the four sites, while soil depth related to vegetation type at three sites. Slope is an important correlate of peat depth at two of the four sites, while rock cover is important at three sites. The mean and modal water table depths are correlated with plant community distributions and the pH of the surface and lower soil horizons. Factors affecting peat formation viz, depth and physical properties are interrelated to such an extent that it is difficult to determine the affects of a single factor. On the mountain, deeper peats occur at lower altitudes, in waterlogged conditions, and under buttongrass moorland vegetation. <b>Fibrous</b> <b>peats</b> are found under moorland, woody and alpine vegetation types in relatively well-drained areas. Reddish-brown <b>fibrous</b> <b>peats</b> occur under woody vegetation while buttongrass tends to produce black <b>fibrous</b> <b>peats.</b> Muck peats are found in areas of impeded drainage. Higher temperatures experienced at lower altitudes may be offset to some extent by higher rainfall. A decrease in peat depth with altitude infers that climate affects the process of peat formation by affecting peat accumulation rates. A precipitation deficit during the summer months may be responsible for the shallow nature of the peats. Alternatively fire history and the relatively low productivity of the vegetation may also account for the shallow soils...|$|R

The eight forest stands, {{all but one}} on waterlogged <b>fibrous</b> <b>peats,</b> are dominated by Carex lacustris (4 stands), C. /asiocarpa (2), C. rostrata (1) and C. atherodes (1). They exhibit above-ground standing crops ranging from 425 to 738 g dry wtfm 2, {{with a mean of}} 606 gfm 2. The five prairie stands on well-drained silty peats are all dominated by Carex atherodes, and their standing crops range from 679 to 1248 g dry wtfm 2, with a mean of 941 gfm 2.

40|$|Encountered {{extensively}} in wetlands, <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat</b> is considered as problematic soil because it exhibits unusual compression behavior. When {{a mass of}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat</b> soil with both vertical and horizontal drainage boundaries is subjected to a consolidation pressure, rate of excess pore water dissipation from the soil in the horizontal direction (ch) {{is expected to be}} higher than that in the vertical direction (cv). ch/cv of two is commonly used in practice for estimation of consolidation in soft clay improved by vertical drain whereas published data showed that the ch/cv ratio for <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat</b> could be as high as 300.

Hydraulic consolidation tests in Rowe cell, the coefficient of rate of horizontal consolidation increases significantly with consolidation pressure, while the increase in the coefficient of rate of vertical consolidation does not increase as much. The ch/cv ratio increase from 3. 5 to 6 for consolidation pressure of 25 to 200 kPa. The ratio of coefficient of permeability kh/kv under a consolidation pressure of 200 kPa is about 5.

40|$|Peat {{classification}} {{methods for}} engineering purposes {{and the main}} factors and aspects of these classification systems are discussed. Among the factors that enter into the classification of tropical lowland peats are the organic content and degree or level of humification (on the von Post scale). The organic content {{as a percentage of}} the total content determines whether an organic soil is classified as a slightly organic soil (3 - 20 Â  organic content), an organic soil (20 - 75 Â  organic content), or a peat (more than 75 Â  organic content). The ASTM standard method of classifying peat is outlined in the Standard Classification of Peat Samples by Laboratory Testing (ASTM D 4427), which includes the use of the ASTM D 5715 (fiber content by field testing for degree of humification) field test method. The von Post humification test (von Post classification system) involves squeezing the peat and the material that is extruded between the fingers, examining the material, and classifying the soil as belonging to one of ten (H 1 -H 10) humification or decomposition categories.

The paper examines both embankments on <b>fibrous</b> <b>peats</b> and a range of soft clays. It demonstrates that good geotechnical engineering is at least as important with the use of geosynthetics as it is without their use. For example, geosynthetic basal reinforcement can be extremely effective in allowing timely construction of embank· ment over peats and soft clays - however an understanding of the mechanism at work and the key engineering properties is essential for consistent success. Not all soils are the same and likewise not all geosynthetic reinforcement is the same.

It highlights not only the advantages but also the limitations of different types of reinforcement for different types of soil. It provides field examples, supported by numerical analysis, of great success in the use of geosynthetics - and failures. The paper discusses where both can be anticipated.

The tephra-marker horizons further show that the palynologically defined transition from the Subboreal to the Subatlantic Period is synchronous in the investigated area. However, the macroscopic visible marker in peat, the change from <b>fibrous</b> to sapric <b>peat,</b> the “Schwarztorf-Weißtorf-Kontakt,” is asynchronous. Bog vegetation did not immediately react in unison to a climatic change at this pollen zone boundary; instead, the timing of vegetation change depended on the location within the bog...|$|R
40|$|The design specification, {{development}} and manufacture of a Byelorussian (Russian) peat corer constructed from carbon fibre composite (CFC) are described. The availability {{of this new}} composite material introduces new possibilities for constructing field instruments that are as strong as, or stronger than, equipment made from steel and other metals. One advantage is a significant weight reduction. A 10. 5 metre coring set in standard stainless and soft steel weighs around 16 kg, whereas the total weight of a similar CFC set is 5. 2 kg, giving a weight reduction of almost 70 %. The CFC sample chamber is 500 mm long with internal diameter 65 mm, and so contains almost twice the volume of peat that can be collected with a standard 45 mm diameter steel corer. The diameter of the rods is 30 mm, which improves ergonomics, and the CFC has better thermic properties for winter use. Another advantage is that the contamination of samples (notably by chromium and nickel) {{associated with the use}} of steel corers is eliminated. The CFC sampler works well in soft peats such as Sphagnum and Carex types. It is less suitable for little-decomposed <b>fibrous</b> and forest <b>peats</b> (e. g. Polytrichum type) and those containing hardwood remains, especially in the more compacted bottom layers. It should be totally satisfactory for organic lake sediments, but probably not for stiff and coarse mineral deposits...|$|R
40|$|Peat soil is {{described}} as a naturally occurring highly organic substance derived primarily from plant materials. It is formed when organic (usually plant) matter accumulates more quickly than it humifies (decay). Various construction techniques have been carried out to support embankments over peat deposits without risking bearing failures but settlement of these embankments remains excessively large and continues for many years. Cement columns method is a method which may exclude settlement problem of peat soil. This study has investigated the effects of cement columns ’ composition on compressibility parameters of fibrous tropical peat reinforced with cylindrical cement columns; and presents the compressibility characters of fibrous tropical peat. A comprehensive laboratory work was carried out in order to study the compressive parameters of <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat</b> stabilized with various quantities of cement which they were subjected to Rowe Cell Consolidation test. The results indicate that increasing the cement ratio decrease amount of settlement and compressibility of tropical peat soil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pinhook Bog is an acidic, weakly-minerotrophic {{peatland}} that occupies an ice-block {{depression in}} the Valparaiso Moraine in northwest Indiana. It has a floating mat approximately 22 ha in area but no central pond. Detailed stratigraphic descriptions of the peatland were made to analyze its developmental history and determine what factors {{may be responsible for}} mat formation. Stratigraphic data along four transects identified a clay-lined basin with three major sub-basins 18, 14, and 14 m deep. The deeper part ~ of the sub-basins contain fibrous limnic peats with some intermixed lacustrine sediments deposited between 12000 and 4200 years ago. The younger, upper peat layers are composed primarily of Sphagnum and consist of the fibrous surface peat and two underlying layers of fluid, <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat</b> separated by a water layer about one meter thick. Peat materials from above the water layer have fallen through the water to form the lower layer of detritus peat. In addition to the obvious factors of climate and presence of mat-forming species...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite-strain hyperviscoplastic constitutive model within a thermodynamically consistent framework for peat which was categorised as a material with both rate-dependent and thermodynamic equilibrium hysteresis {{based on the}} data reported in the literature. The model was implemented numerically using implicit time integration and verified against analytical solutions under simplified conditions. Experimental studies on the undrained relaxation and loading-unloading-reloading behaviour of an undisturbed <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat</b> were carried out to define the thermodynamic equilibrium state during deviatoric loading as a prerequisite for further modelling, to fit particularly those model parameters related to solid matrix properties, and to validate the proposed model under undrained conditions. This validation performed by comparison to experimental {{results showed that the}} hyperviscoplastic model could simulate undrained triaxial compression tests carried out at five different strain rates with loading/unloading relaxation steps. Comment: 30 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables. This is a pre-peer reviewed version of manuscript submitted to the International Journal of Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanic...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the main constitutive models for peat and other highly organic soils having extremely high water content. At present, predictions of the geomechanical behaviour of such soils for design practice are mostly based on constitutive theories developed for fine-grained mineral soils. Conventional concepts of primary consolidation and secondary compression as applied to peat are explained using the two-level structure assumption of micropores and macropores [1]. As background, the historical development of consolidation hypotheses A & B [2] regarding the concept of primary consolidation and secondary compression is reviewed for both mineral and organic soils. It is understood that models adopting hypothesis A are represented by the C?/Cc concept developed by Mesri and his co-workers [3, 4], whereas models adopting hypothesis B consider that creep occurs during both primary and secondary compression stages. Based on microscopic examinations and in-situ testing, it is generally accepted that hypothesis B is more suitable for peat. The micro-mechanical rheological model proposed by Berry and Poskitt [5] and the isotache-compression model developed by den Haan [6] reported good agreement with experimental laboratory data for <b>fibrous</b> and amorphous <b>peats.</b> Attention is given to the structural anisotropy of peat soils, present on account of its fibrous nature, in the constitutive frameworks. The effect of structural degradation caused by the decomposition of peat is a novel feature of Karunawardena?s [7] elastic visco-plastic model. Micro- and macro- mechanical models considering the dramatic reduction in the coefficient of permeability and high compressibility of peat occurring under loading are mostly based on empirical laws rather than experimental data. Future research outlooks are discussed, including recommendations to concentrate efforts on developing and improving thermodynamically consistent approaches to model structural anisotropy and the large deformation experienced by peat and other highly organic materials under loading...|$|R
40|$|The Sicilian endemic {{herbaceous}} perennial plant Limonium hyblaeum (family Plumbaginaceae) {{is rapidly}} becoming a serious weed in South Australia and Victoria, where it invades saltmarshes and rocky coastal sites exposed to salt spray. It has small, light seeds that float and remain viable in sea water and {{which can also}} be dispersed readily by wind, animals and vehicles. It can form dense, extensive mats and buds sprouting from rhizomes allow encroachment into dense native vegetation. It seems certain to be apomictic and is readily able to become dominant. Forming dense, compact cushions which accumulate large amounts of <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat,</b> Limonium hyblaeum is the first cushion plant to become naturalized in Australia; {{the importance of the}} cushion habit as an adaptation to salt spray is under-appreciated. Some control measures for Limonium hyblaeum have begun in Victoria, but much remains to be done there and in the other southern Australian states; a ban on the sale of the species by nurseries is urgently required...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{examined the}} efficiency of biological removal of air contaminants performed with a prototype “open ” biofilter. The biofilter bed composed the following components by weight: 35 % <b>fibrous</b> <b>peat,</b> 35 % sallow peat, 10 % barley straw, composts from sewage plant and horse manure- 10 % each. With Waters ` liquid chromatograph use there was determined a content of ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, sulphates, chloride phosphates, iodides, bromides and fluorides in the air. The examinations on the physico-chemical properties of medium and air pollution were run over 180 days, collecting the samples on the 5 th, 35 th, 65 th, 95 th and 180 th biofiltration days. After 35 days there was recorded stabilization of temperature, moisture, reaction, dynamic growth of total bacteria count and coli titre in the medium. Ammonia biofiltration efficiency ranged from 36 to 89 %, while for nitrates, nitrites and phosphates it was even higher than 66 - 100 %...|$|E
