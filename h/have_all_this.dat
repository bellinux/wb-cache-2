500|$|However, {{the show}} did {{come in for}} some criticism. San Jose Mercury News criticized the plot and the casting saying that [...] "the storylines usually involve the {{obligatory}} three-episode-arc drug problems or lost virginity with dialogue designed to keep a dog up to speed", and that [...] "Whoever at FOX thought Benjamin McKenzie (Ryan on [...] "The O.C.") could pass for anything younger than 25 should be fired". A DVD review was critical of the repetitive plot stating that [...] "the Ryan-Marissa fol-de-rol gets tiresome as it devolves into relentless bad timing", while Entertainment Weekly did not think the acting was always up to scratch, stating [...] "it's unfortunate to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> potential for arm-flinging drama invested in Barton, an actress who can be as flat as a paper doll". It was also denounced for excessive brawling and glamorizing underage drinking.|$|E
500|$|Allam {{justified}} the intended name change {{as part of}} his plans to create [...] "additional sources of revenue" [...] for the club, after Hull City Council refused to sell him the stadium freehold so he could develop, as he had stated, [...] "a sports park" [...] on the site. The council has refused to sell in order, as they stated, [...] "to preserve the annual Hull Fair held on the adjacent car park." [...] After the collapse of the negotiations, Allam stated: [...] "I had in mind £30 million to spend on the infrastructure of the club, to increase the stadium by 10,000 and to have commercial activities around the stadium — cafeterias, shops, supermarkets — to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> to create income for the club so that in the future it can be self-financing and not relying on me." [...] He asked rhetorically, [...] "What if I dropped dead tomorrow?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world up when we read it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head." [...] The case was further {{complicated by the fact that}} audio samples from the authoring website were included in [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", which serves as a prelude to [...] "Purity".|$|E
2500|$|According to Tarantino, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of making the film was [...] "trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other great action directors", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create [...] "one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: [...] "Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in our back yard, and you don't <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> shit. How would you achieve this effect? Ingenuity is important here!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What? What," [...] he said. [...] "I won't <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> fuss. Go on {{with the}} performance, there's no need to bother about me." [...] His eye was wild.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, ladies," [...] said Mrs. Faulkner, [...] "in my opinion, {{the thing}} {{for us to do}} is to go to see Maria Port; tell her what we think of her; and <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> wickedness stopped." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But what <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> {{to do with}} Peterkin?" [...] asked Harry, as the {{accountant}} paused to relight his pipe and toss a fresh log on the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Run away!" [...] I said. [...] "Why, {{that would}} be to confess myself guilty, for only the guilty run away. What I want is to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> {{business}} thrashed out and that devil Pereira exposed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The public like excitement," [...] soliloquized Mr. Jubber, as he {{disappeared}} behind the red curtain. [...] "I must <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> in the bills to-morrow. It's safe to draw {{at least thirty}} shillings extra into the house at night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--that {{is another}} question. I should do many things if he told me. He {{is the head}} of our family. I think he ought to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> money, and be a rich great man, as the Earl Lovel should be." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly. I don’t {{believe they}} are drowned at all," [...] said Miss Lindsay, suddenly. [...] "I believe you <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> terrible anguish for nothing. It’s too cruel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, dear, how my head does ache!" [...] {{thought she}} to herself; [...] "and poor mother! {{she said this}} morning she was afraid another of her sick turns was coming on, and we <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> work to pull out and do over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes.... I {{told you}} why I {{wanted you to}} know.... And now forget that--and when I'm gone--if you think of me ever, let it be about how much better it made me--to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> good luck--to help your father and to save you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that, dearest madamigella. I would unsay nothing now, if I could, unless to {{take away}} the pain I have given you. It has been more a relief than a shame to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> known to you; and even if you should despise me"-- ...|$|E
