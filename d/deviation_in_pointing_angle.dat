OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical accuracy and <b>deviation</b> <b>in</b> screw positions in robot-assisted pedicle screw placement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Accuracy of pedicle screw placement in in vivo studies varies widely, especially when minimally invasive techniques are used. Robotic guidance was recently introduced to increase screw placement accuracy but still reported accuracies vary. METHODS: Reproducibility of the surgeon's plan using robotic guidance was assessed by fusing individual vertebras from the preoperative computed tomography (CT) containing the planning with a postoperative CT. <b>Deviation</b> <b>in</b> entry <b>point</b> and difference <b>in</b> <b>angle</b> of insertion was measured on axial and sagittal planes. Grading of pedicle screw placement was performed on postoperative CTs using the Gertzbein-Robbins classification. RESULTS: CT-to-CT fusion succeeded for 178 screws, but these appeared to be random, with no apparent selection bias. Mean <b>deviation</b> <b>in</b> entry <b>point</b> was 2. 0 ± 1. 2 mm. Mean difference in angle of insertion was 2. 2 ° ± 1. 7 ° on the axial plane and 2. 9 ° ± 2. 4 ° on the sagittal plane. Assessment of pedicle screw accuracy showed that 477 of 487 screws (97. 9 %) were safely placed (< 2 mm, category A+B), 8 screws in category C and 1 in category D. None of the screws necessitated resurgery for revised placement. CONCLUSION: Preoperative planning of robotic guidance is reproduced intraoperatively within acceptable deviations.

The model is built upon probability theory governing random migration of photons in free space, undergoing scattering, in terms of angular direction and distance. The model analytically captures the contributions of different scattering orders. Thus it relaxes the assumptions of single scattering theory and provides more realistic results. This allows us to assess the importance of high-order scattering, such as in a thick atmosphere environment, where short range NLOS UV communication is enhanced by hazy or foggy weather. By simulation, it is shown that the model coincides with a previously developed Monte Carlo model. Additional numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effects of link geometry and atmospheric conditions. The results indicate the inherent tradeoffs <b>in</b> beamwidth, <b>pointing</b> <b>angles,</b> range, absorption, and scattering and so are valuable for NLOS communication system design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract − The {{positional}} deviation (difference between the actual and target position) {{belongs to the}} important criteria that describe the performance of numerically controlled axes. The procedure for determination of such <b>deviation</b> is described <b>in</b> the international standard ISO 230 - 2 : 1997.

40|$|For {{a variety}} of applications, it is {{important}} to measure the sensitivity of the pointing of a beam emerging from a collimator, as a function of temperature changes. A straightforward method for carrying out this measurement is based on using interferometry for monitoring the changes <b>in</b> beam <b>pointing,</b> which presents its own problems. The added temperature dependence and complexity issues relating to using an interferometer are addressed by not using an interferometer in the first place. Instead, the collimator is made part of an arrangement that uses a minimum number of low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and by using a quad diode to measure changes <b>in</b> beam <b>pointing.</b> <b>In</b> order to minimize the influence of the test arrangement on the outcome of the measurement, several steps are taken. The collimator assembly is placed on top of a vertical, 1 -m-long, fused silica tube. The quad diode is bonded to a fused silica bar, which, in turn, is bonded to {{the lower end of the}} fused silica tube. The lower end of the tube rests on a self-aligning support piece, while the upper end of the tube is kept against two rounded setscrew tips, using a soft rubber string. This ensures that very little stress is applied to the tube as the support structure changes dimensions due to thermal expansion. Light is delivered to the collimator through a bare fiber in order to minimize variable bending torque caused by a randomly relaxing, rigid fiber jacket. In order to separate the effect of temperature on the collimator assembly from the effect temperature has on the rest of the setup, multiple measurements are taken with the collimator assembly rotated from measurement to measurement. Laboratory testing, with 1 -m spacing between the collimator and the quad diode, has shown that the sensitivity of the arrangement is better than 100 nm rms, over time spans of at least one hour, if the beam path is protected from atmospheric turbulence by a tube. The equivalent sensitivity to detecting changes <b>in</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angle</b> is 100 nanoradians...|$|R

The result is weakened contact of implants with bone and possible loss of rigid fixation. The {{aim of this}} study was to find an optimal condition where the increase in bone temperature during bone drilling process would be minimal. [...] - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Influence of different drill parameters was evaluated on the increase of bone temperature. Drill diameters were 2. 5, 3. 2 and 4. 5 mm; drill speed 188, 462, 1, 140 and 1, 820 rpm; feed-rate 24, 56, 84 and 196 mm/min; drill <b>point</b> <b>angle</b> 80 degrees, 100 degrees and 120 degrees and external irrigation with water of 26 degrees C. [...] - RESULTS: Combinations of drill speed and drill diameter with the use of external irrigation produced temperatures far below critical. Without external irrigation, temperature values for the same combination of parameters ranged 31. 4 - 55. 5 degrees C. Temperatures above critical were recorded using 4. 5 mm drill with higher drill speeds (1, 140 and 1, 820 rpm).

(2012) with r([...] θ) = 0, in which just the noise component is given randomly, showed that Δ x_SSC, Δ y_SSC, and [...] Δθ_V were very close to zero. Therefore, these biases result from the 3 - or ε-shape of the limb-point distributions and the small standard <b>deviation</b> <b>in</b> the noise component. What may {{be a problem for}} practical use are variances in Δ x_SSC, Δ y_SSC, and [...] Δθ_V, because we can rotate L_V in addition when calculating the radiance on each longitude–latitude grid, such that these biases vanish. Differences Δ x_SSC and Δ y_SSC are smaller than 0.1 and 0.01, respectively, in the dayside Cases L and S. Difference Δ x_SSC is larger than Δ y_SSC, since the limb is assumed to be located on the left-hand side of the images (θ_ 1 = 115 ^∘, θ_ 2 = 245 ^∘). There is not a large difference in Δθ_V between Cases L and S. However, the impact of the pointing accuracy upon cloud-feature positions in longitude–latitude coordinates is larger in Case S than in Case L, since the distance between the spacecraft and Venus’s center in Case S is longer than that in Case L. Variations in cloud-feature positions (1 σ) are, for example, 5.8  ×  10 − 2 km (UVI 365  nm) and 8.6  km (IR 1 0.97  μm) when the spacecraft–cloud-layer distance is 104 km. When this distance is 105 km, the 1 σ values are 3.6  ×  10 − 1 km (UVI 283  nm) and 7.0  km (IR 2 2.26  μm). However, {{it should be noted that}} the above standard <b>deviations</b> <b>in</b> <b>pointing</b> are estimated under ideal conditions.
