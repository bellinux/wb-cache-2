From BPBE/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) calculations, the geometrical {{results of these}} complexes revealed an elongation and shortening of the H—C bond lengths of chloroform (HCCl 3) and <b>fluoroform</b> (HCF 3), respectively. In terms of the infrared spectrum, the analysis of stretch frequencies revealed that the variations in the H—C modes are essentially recognized as red and blue-shifting modes. For the purposes of understanding the two vibrational phenomena of the ? hydrocarbon complexes studied here, PBE/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) calculations were carried out and partitioning of atomic charges derived from the ChelpG algorithm were also used. A theoretical justification of red- and blue-shift effects was drawn up using charge-transfer analysis, which is manifested in the ? bonds of acetylene and ethylene to chloroform (H—CCl 3) and <b>fluoroform</b> (H—CF 3), respectively. Finally, a further debate regarding the distinct polarizability power of chloroform and <b>fluoroform</b> is presented, concluding that, in comparison with <b>fluoroform,</b> chloroform possesses the requisite features for conventional proton donors and a red-shift is therefore observed in the C 2 H 4 •••HCCl 3 and C 2 H 2 •••HCCl 3 complexes. </div...|$|E

A contraction of the C—H bond length of the <b>fluoroform</b> (HCF 3) was observed by analyzing the main structural parameters. Consequently, results of infrared spectrum analysis showed the blue-shift in the stretch frequency accompanied by a significant decrease in absorption intensity. With the purpose of comprehending this vibrational phenomenon, hybrid functional and split valence basis sets were used and topological parameters derived from Atoms-in-Molecules (AIM) theory were also applied. Moreover, the non-linear deviation in (O···H) anti-hydrogen bonds due to the secondary interaction (Hα···Fϕ) between the fluorine (Fϕ) of <b>fluoroform</b> and axial hydrogen atoms (Hα) of the heterocyclic structures was verified...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study of local density {{augmentation}} around an attractive solute (i. e., giving rise to more attractive interaction with the solvent than solvent-solvent interactions) in supercritical <b>fluoroform.</b> This work is based on molecular dynamics simulations of coumarin 153 in supercritical <b>fluoroform</b> at densities both {{above and below the}} critical density, ranging from dilute gaslike to liquidlike, at a reduced temperature (T/Tc) of 1. 03. We focused on studying the structure of the solvation shell and the variation of the solute electronic absorption and emission shifts with density. Quantum calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level were run on the solute in the ground state, and time-dependent DFT calculations were performed in the solute excited state {{in order to determine the}} solute-solvent potential parameters. The results obtained for the Stokes shift are in agreement with the experimental measurements. To evaluate local density augmentation from simulations, we used two different definitions, one based on the solvation number and the other derived from solvatochromic shifts. In the former case, the agreement with experimental results is good, while, in the latter case, better agreement is achieved by perturbatively including the induced-dipole contribution to the solvation energy...|$|E

The data and theory are refinements of previous work. Measurements at zero density allow the contribution from solute-solvent interactions to be separated from strictly intramolecular contributions to $T_ 1 $. The results in the polyatomic SCFs are compared to data in Ar. The density functional/thermodynamic $theory^ 1 $ has been extended to include contributions at large wavevector (k). Very good, quantitative agreement between theory and data taken in ethane and <b>fluoroform</b> is achieved, but the agreement for data taken in carbon dioxide, while reasonable, is not as good. The theory uses a variety of input information on the SCF properties obtained from the fluids' equations of state and other tabulated thermodynamic data. The solute-solvent spatial distribution is described in terms of hard spheres.

Through the calculations {{performed at the}} B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory, the optimized geometries of the C 3 H 6 -HCF 3, C 2 H 4 O-HCF 3 and C 2 H 4 S-HCF 3 hydrogen-bonded complexes were determined. By analyzing the structural parameters, it was observed a contraction of the C-H bond length of the <b>fluoroform</b> (HCF 3).

In the purpose to comprehend this vibrational phenomenon, topological parameters computed at the light of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) were also used.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the CH···F H-bond is studied by {{examining}} the potential energy surfaces for dimers of the fluoromethanes, including all homo- and heterodimers involving CH 4, CFH 3, CF 2 H 2, CF 3 H, and CF 4. Several of the surfaces encompass two separate minima. Any pair capable of forming a cyclic structure does so, this geometry being more stable than any other minima that might occur on the surface. Such cyclic dimers are bound by 2 − 3 kcal/mol. Noncyclic geometries are only very weakly bound. In all cases, the C−H bonds that participate directly in the H-bonds undergo a contraction and associated blue shift in their stretching frequencies, whereas the C−F bonds manifest an elongation. The most strongly bound of all dimers studied pairs CH 3 F with CHF 3, for which the C−H bond contracts by 0. 0023 Å, and its stretching frequency increases by 39 cm- 1.

From these more realistic calculations we conclude that although electrostriction can cause the high-density limit of such selectivities to be attained at much lower densities than would be expected in the absence of electrostriction, it would be very unlikely for this effect to generate a non-monotonic density dependence...|$|E

Resonant excitation of the rotational degrees of freedom of the molecules aligns their permanent dipoles along the terahertz electric field. This alignment is translated into an optical birefringence through the polarizability anisotropy of each molecule. Therefore, the resulting net signal scales with the polarizability anisotropy, whose sign is imprinted faithfully onto the transient birefringence signal...|$|E

To this end, this work entails {{the development of a}} synthetic process which exploits the facile release of trifluoroacetate for chemical transformations. A novel, efficient method for the installation the α-methylenation of carbonyl groups through a unique release of trifluoroacetate is reported. Our detrifluoroacetylative methylenation provides a very mild and highly efficient protocol that is amenable to a series of ketones, lactams, and lactones. Our method is also an improvement for α-methlyenation of sterically hindered carbonyl groups on highly complex natural products such as (+) -sclareolide and (–) -eburnamonine. Mechanistic information was gathered through a time course 19 F NMR studies. Additionally, biological evaluation of a library natural product derivatives led to the discovery of an analogue of (–) eburnamonine with significant activity to MDA-MB- 231 cells. ^ The release of trifluoroacetate is again demonstrated to be a facile, powerful process to perform synthetic reactions. Expanding from this work, a powerful, new amidinate salt of hexafluoroacetone hydrate is developed to perform trifluoromethylations after a base-induced release of trifluoroacetate. This salt is an air stable, anhydrous, non hygroscopic solid which can be obtained in multi gram scale through a simple one step acid base process. Nucleophilic trifluoromethylations of non-enolizable aldehydes and ketones can be performed at both milligram and gram scales to provide excellent yields of product.
