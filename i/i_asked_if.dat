500|$|Luke Wilson guest starred as Sheriff Hartwell; he had {{previously}} worked on 1998 comedy film Home Fries, which had been scripted by Vince Gilligan. Former child actor Patrick Renna played Ronnie Strickland. He said of the part, [...] "before we started <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> Ronnie was {{pretending to be a}} moron. They told me, 'No. He's really just a moron.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Proclus later retells a story that, when Ptolemy <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> {{there was}} a shorter path to {{learning}} geometry than Euclid's Elements, [...] "Euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry." [...] This anecdote is questionable since it {{is similar to a}} story told about Menaechmus and Alexander the Great.|$|E
2500|$|Lionsgate's {{president}} of theatrical marketing Tim Palen {{thought of the}} idea to make 1,000 posters {{with a small amount}} of Bell's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink. He said, [...] "We decided to do a poster and he's wearing a red cloak. I was talking to the printer and asked what we could do to get the deepest blood red. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> it would be possible to use actual blood. There was silence. He said, 'We could try, but are you serious?' I said I was dead serious." [...] The posters were sold for $20, with the first being auctioned off; all the proceeds from the auctioned poster were donated to the Red Cross. [...] Lionsgate also held the third annual [...] "Give Til It Hurts" [...] blood drive for the Red Cross and collected 23,493 pints of blood.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2007, JR and Babe's tempestuous romance {{received}} notice by TV Guide's Daniel R. Coleridge, {{who published}} {{an exclusive interview}} with Babe's former portrayer, Alexa Havins, and queried her about the matter. Coleridge cited the marriage as dysfunctional and seemed perplexed as to why Babe would stay with a man who tried to kill her, and as he put it, [...] "verbally abuses her all the time". Havins addressed deeper issues about the coupling:I know. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> we could do a PSA (Public service announcement) for women in abusive relationships to get help, but that didn't happen. I was concerned about how viewers might be influenced by Babe saying, 'Oh, it's OK, JR, you only tried to kill me because you were drinking.' What if a woman decided to ignore the warning signs of abuse and stay in a bad relationship, and then a true tragedy happened? ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, Davidson {{refused to}} go on stage in Plymouth because he objected to {{wheelchair}} users in the front row. A spokesman for the Plymouth Pavilions, where he was performing {{as part of a}} national tour, said: [...] "Jim Davidson apparently took exception to a number of wheelchair users in the front stalls of the Pavilions Arena. Mr Davidson cited the fact that a proportion of his act was aimed at disabled customers and that he would be unable to perform under these circumstances." [...] In a statement Davidson explained he [...] "took the mick" [...] out of everyone in the front row of his shows. [...] "As {{all the people in the}} front row were in wheelchairs I feared it would appear I was specifically targeting disabled people. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> just some would mind moving. Much of my act depends upon audience reaction and in fact one part of the show involves getting the audience to gang up against the front row." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E

6000|$|... "Still, {{your face}} is very familiar," [...] persisted the Tin Woodman. [...] "Pardon me, but may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> you--eh--eh--if {{you ever had a}} Body?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Having {{the home}} {{recording}} system also proved useful for production, the band {{felt that it}} would not only benefit themselves, but other local bands who could not afford the studio prices, even in the Welwyn Garden City area. It was here that Billy and Charlotte both stumbled upon the opportunity that would eventually prove significant for the band. [...] "I was producing a local Welwyn Garden City band in my front lounge one day and I noticed that it was quite good so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they were going to send it to any London venues, because I knew a few that would like it. They said {{that they were going to}} send it off to Michael Eavis who runs Glastonbury Festival, and I asked why..." [...] Michael Eavis that year was running an unsigned bands competition to play on the Other Stage, and The Subways decided that would be a great idea. [...] "It was really just another address to send one of our CDs off to. All we wanted was to play shows and this was another great opportunity. The CD we sent off to Michael Eavis was literally one among a bunch of 30 that were being sent out to London promoters for a load of gigs we wanted to book. We never expected the phone call saying that we'd won and were to play Glastonbury", said Cooper on radio. The Subways remain friends with Eavis today, and have suggested that other upcoming bands should send demos to Eavis.|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} think of any retort to this, so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> Mrs. Strickland had children.|$|E
