An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the <b>inner</b> <b>glass,</b> reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E

50|$|U-HID (Ultra High Intensity Discharge) {{is a type}} of lamp. A {{mixture of}} two {{physical}} principles in lighting electronics, U-HID is the combination of Plasma and High Intensity Discharge (HID) technologies. The U-HID lamp produces a beam of light due to the formation of a plasma discharge arc. Its tube is made of a sphere of transparent quartz or ceramic filled with a special inactive high pressure gas. Through the plasma formation in its core, the atoms outside the chamber produce light. At the beginning of the plasma formation, a blue color at the tips of the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> insulation can be seen. This can be considered a characteristic of the technology. U-HID lamp uses a high voltage pulse discharge that does not dissipate the plasma produced. The brilliance of a U-HID lamp can reach 80% in four seconds under normal temperature conditions, and can start working at 100% instantly after a re-ignition. Comparatively, the intensity of light from a U-HID lamp is at least three times stronger than a metal halide HID lamp in a color range of 4200K (cold light).|$|E

5000|$|The {{introduction}} of electric light bulbs {{made it possible}} to produce colour light signals which were bright enough to be seen during daylight, starting in 1904. These at first were [...] "short-range" [...] signals, used in low-speed applications. Improvements in signal glassware by Dr. Churchill of Cornell University in conjunction with Corning Glass Works (Corning, New York) increased the daylight viewing range to that of [...] "medium-range" [...] signals. These were quickly adopted by many U.S. rapid transit and trolley (street, light) railway systems. Ultimately, by 1913, Dr. Churchill developed the [...] "doublet lens" [...] combination wherein an outer clear Fresnel lens was sealed with inwards facing ribs to an <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> of the desired colour with ribs facing the outer lens. Both inner and outer exposed surfaces were therefore smooth, avoiding dirt accumulation. The inner lens convexity permitted a 35-watt, 10-volt lamp filament to be almost surrounded by this system, gathering much more of the light produced than with previous systems. This yielded the first true [...] "long-range" [...] daylight signal with a range of over 2500 ft under bright sun conditions. The first application was by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad's use of the US&S [...] "Style L" [...] colour light signal on their line through the Pacific Northwest in 1914. These were intentionally fitted from the start with two lamps one ahead of the other, the circuitry so arranged that failure of the main lamp caused the lighting the back-up lamp to assure the most restrictive indication always being illuminated. The final improvement came in the early 1920s with Corning's [...] "High Transmission" [...] glass colours, increasing this range to 3500 ft under bright sun conditions. The results were that in the U.S., all semaphore manufacturing had ceased by 1944, having been completely replaced with light signals of one type or another.|$|E

These natural glasses are tubular in shape with a central void surrounded by an <b>inner</b> <b>glass,</b> and the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> is surrounded by an outer crust or toasted region. Previous studies report different kinds of melts existing in several different types of fulgurites; however, little to no chemical data has been collected that tracks chemical variations from the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> to the outer crust of a fulgurite.

Between each measurement, 100 μL of non-radioactive water was added to the test tube so as to progressively increase the sample volume, while maintaining the total activity unchanged (not withstanding radioactive decay that was corrected analytically). In this way, count rate data were obtained for sample volumes between 0.1 and 4.0 mL.
