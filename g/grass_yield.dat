50|$|After Green Bamboo was {{abandoned}} {{a decision was}} made to use the Interim Megaton Weapon known as Green Grass in the Yellow Sun casing and designate it as Yellow Sun Mk.1 until better warheads were available for a Mk.2. Green Grass was of similar layout to Green Bamboo, although it was not thermonuclear, being a very large unboosted pure fission warhead that was based in part on the core of the Orange Herald device tested at Grapple, with some of the implosion and firing features of Green Bamboo. Twelve Green Grass warheads were fitted in larger, older casings derived from Blue Danube and known as Violet Club. These twelve warheads were later transferred to the Yellow Sun Mk.1 casings and supplemented by further warheads totalling 37. Green <b>Grass</b> <b>yield</b> was originally stated to the Royal Air Force (RAF) as 500 kilotons of TNT equivalent (2.1 PJ), but the designers estimate was later revised downwards to 400 kt of TNT. The Green Grass warhead was never tested. It used a dangerously large quantity of fissile material - thought to be in excess of 70 kg, and considerably more than an uncompressed critical mass. It was kept subcritical by being fashioned into a thin-walled spherical shell. To guard against accidental crushing of the core into a critical condition, the shell was filled with 133,000 steel ball-bearings, weighing 450 kg. In a conflict, these would have had to have be removed before flight. The RAF thought it unsafe.|$|E
40|$|The <b>grass</b> <b>yield</b> embodies its productivity，and also {{is ground}} for {{developing}} animal husbandry production management. Now the remote sensing {{technology has been}} becoming an efficient and feasible mean to estimate the <b>grass</b> <b>yield.</b> In the study, the thought about Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was involved in estimating the <b>grass</b> <b>yield.</b> The special characteristics of samples measured on field were considered, and then each sample has a local function covering area around. And the parameters for the function are decided by the weighted function which {{is associated with the}} spatial distance between the sample and others around. GWR is a good solution to the model without spatial stationarity, as a consequence a significant model-fitting degree comes out. Based on GWR model an ideal production of grassland can be estimated. In this study, Qinghai province, about 0. 72 million square kilometres, was taken as an example. The province is an important one on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Here the grassland not only closely relates with the local animal husbandry economy, but also directly affects the regional ecosystem security. Landsat TM data in 2013 and samples on field were used to estimate the production. As input parameters, OSAVI and FVC have high correlation coefficient more than 97 % with <b>grass</b> <b>yield.</b> There were 201 samples involved in modelling, and the accuracy is 87. 27 %, above about 47 % than that of multiple linear regression model, a widely used traditional statistic model.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that Acacia karroo Hayne trees compete with and negatively affect the production of grasses in their immediate surroundings. This perception formed {{as a result of}} observations by farmers of their veld as well as some research. The complexity of plant interactions in different conditions required that research be done to better explain the extent of grass and tree interactions. In response to this need, the effect of a range of Acacia karroo densities on grass production was tested in areas of differing rainfall. Results emphasize the complexity of such plant interactions but highlight rainfall as influencing the effect of tree density on grass production and grass quality. Study sites were chosen with significant differences in tree density and rainfall and this was found to be concomitant with significant differences in <b>grass</b> <b>yield</b> and crude protein (p < 0. 001). <b>Grass</b> <b>yield</b> (mass produced) was negatively correlated with tree density (p < 0. 001) and was affected by rainfall. High tree density reduced <b>grass</b> <b>yield</b> at the lower rainfall sites, but a reduction in yield was only recorded during dry conditions in the higher rainfall areas. By contrast, the crude protein content of grasses was positively correlated to tree density (p < 0. 001). However, as with yield, rainfall played an important part in the strength of the correlation. Soil properties such as temperature (-) (p = 0. 011), phosphorus content (+) (p = 0. 006), calcium concentration (+) (p = 0. 005), acid saturation (-) (p = 0. 018), and soil pH (+) (p = 0. 008) were also significantly correlated to tree density. Tree density enriched the soil, subsequently benefitting grass quality. The study sites investigated, had different plant communities and environmental conditions with Cradock, Kubusi Drift and Kei Mouth having unique communities and conditions while Adelaide and Cathcart could not be separated in either. Cradock was the driest site and the vegetation was dominated by both grasses and karroid shrubs, differing in pattern and process from the other sites.

In places where economical and successful crop production cannot be managed, the grassland based animal husbandry can be an efficient way of food production. In addition, these ecosystems have an important role in carbon sequestration, and with their rich flora – and fauna connected to it – in conservation of biodiversity. The protection of nature, and the sustainable agriculture is getting more and more attention in the European Union, but, looking at the consumers’ needs, the production of healthy food cannot be neglected either. Because of these facts, the effects of two specific composts - which are officially authorized in organic farming, in Agri-environment Schemes and Natura 2000 programs – on <b>grass</b> <b>yields</b> and sward compositions were investigated in a field trial. The investigation took place in Hungary, on a natural grassland based on solonetz soil. Three rates of compost (10 t/ha, 20 t/ha, 30 t/ha) were tested on 3 m X 10 m experimental plots. Every treatment had four replications and both type of compost had four-four control plots too, this way 32 experimental plots were included in the investigations. The yield of the pasture was harvested two-times (in May and in September) and before cutting the plots, measurements on botanical compositions were made. Samples for laboratory analysis were also taken. Dry matter yield of pasture showed positive responses to the rates of composts. The increase in dry matter yield was partly due to some positive changes in sward composition. It means that the proportions of grass species with higher yield potential increased in ground cover of the sward without depressing out valuable native species of diverse natural grasslands.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyScott A. StaggenborgVolatile energy prices, energy independency, and {{environmental}} concerns {{have increased the}} demand for renewable fuel production in the United States. The current renewable fuel industry in the United States has developed around the conversion of starch into ethanol fuel, supplied mainly by corn (Zea mays L.) grain. Future energy demands cannot be met by corn grain alone; therefore greater amounts of biomass from traditional and alternative crops must be utilized. Nutrient removal by selected biofuel crops is important {{in order to determine}} biomass quality, required fertilizer inputs, and economic viability of biofuel cropping systems. The objectives of this study were to evaluate grain, stover, total biomass, and estimated ethanol yields of annual and perennial C 4 crops grown under the same soil and weather conditions; and fermentable carbohydrate (FC) yields from extracted sweet sorghum juice. In addition, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentrations of biomass were evaluated to determine total nutrient removal for annual and perennial crops. Field trials, at two locations in northeast Kansas, included corn, sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and perennial warm-season <b>grass</b> cultivars. <b>Yields</b> and nutrient removal were greater for annual crops than perennial <b>grasses.</b> Annual crop <b>yields</b> varied among cultivars, but were similar between locations and years. Perennial <b>grass</b> <b>yields</b> improved significantly from the 2007 establishment year to 2008, however nutrient removal was not affected by the yield increase. The highest grain yield and grain nutrient removal amounts were observed for corn across both years and locations. Total biomass yields were greatest for sweet and photoperiod sensitive sorghum cultivars. Average extracted sweet sorghum FC yields were 4. 8 Mg ha[superscript] 1. Estimated ethanol yields of sweet sorghum were greater than all other crop cultivars. Overall, nutrient removal was most affected by biomass yield variation among crop cultivars; however P concentrations, and subsequent removal, were dependent upon soil P levels at individual locations.

Economic analysis based on 13 % increase in DM for 2 and 3 cut systems, gave an increased grass value between £ 38 ha− 1 and £ 98 ha− 1. CTF for multi-cut grass silage effectively increases yields by reducing compaction and sward damage...|$|E
60|$|She {{reclined}} in {{the recess}} among the <b>grass,</b> which <b>yielded</b> to her limbs {{in a way}} that gave her a sense of voluptuous ease. Her pose, although scarcely a conventional one, showed to advantage the fine contour of her form; and the lilac-tinted dress that flowed in classic lines about her made a patch of cool restful color on the warm ocher of her surroundings. It was easy to read the man's admiration in his glance, and she became suddenly filled with mischievous daring.|$|R
40|$|A {{world wide}} {{increasing}} demand {{can be observed}} to use energy crops for biogas production. The rese-arch project aimed at optimising anaerobic digestion of animal manures, maize and clover grass. The hig-hest specific methane yield (166. 3 Nl CH 4 (kg VS) - 1) was produced from manure received from cows with medium milk yield that were fed a well balanced diet. Lignin in the manure reduced the specific methane yield. With energy crops, a maximum methane yield per hectare should be achieved. Influence of variety and harvesting time on the methane yield was investigated. Maximum methane yield from late ripening maize varieties ranged between 7100 and 9000 Nm 3 CH 4 ha- 1. Early and medium ripening varieties yiel-ded 5300 – 8500 Nm 3 CH 4 ha- 1 when grown in favourable regions. On medium to good locations, clover <b>grass</b> <b>yielded</b> 3000 – 4500 Nm 3 CH 4 ha- 1. Maize and clover grass are optimally harvested, when the pro-duct from specific methane yield and VS yield per hectare reaches a maximum. From the digestion expe-riments, the new Methane Energy Value System was developed. It estimates the methane yield from the nutrient composition of maize and clover grass silage...|$|R
40|$|Oat (Avena sativa) {{is grown}} to provide feed in winter for {{livestock}} {{production in the}} alpine area of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The effect of early cutting (T 1), late cutting (T 2) as well as once cutting and twice cutting (T 3) on forage yields and qualities were investigated for five oat varieties (YTA, CNC, B 3, Q 473 and Q 444). The cutting frequency and time significantly affected forage yield and quality of five varieties with the effects being different among the five varieties. T 3 increased hay yield and crude protein yield than T 2. The dry hay yield and crude protein yield of T 2 were all significantly lower when compared to T 1. YTA presented the maximum fresh <b>grass</b> <b>yields,</b> total hay yields and total crude protein yields under all cutting treatments among five varieties. T 3 also improved feed quality on S/L ratio, F/D ratio, CP, CF and CA compared to T 2 treatment. The results showed that utilization of two cuttings of oat artificial grasslands {{can be used to}} supply forage for livestock in alpine area. YTA is a good oat introduced variety which has higher hay yield and feeding quality even with two cuttings in alpine area...|$|R
