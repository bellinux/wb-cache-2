500|$|According to the Polish diplomat Edward Bernard Raczyński, Raczyński and General Sikorski met {{privately with}} Churchill and Alexander Cadogan on 15 April 1943, {{and told them}} that the Poles had {{concrete}} proof that the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. Raczyński reports that Churchill, [...] "without committing himself, showed by his manner that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> of it". Churchill said that [...] "The Bolsheviks can be very cruel". However, at the same time, on 24 April 1943, Churchill assured the Soviets: [...] "We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism". Unofficial or classified UK documents concluded that Soviet guilt was a [...] "near certainty", but the alliance with the Soviets was deemed to be more important than moral issues; thus the official version supported the Soviets, up to censoring any contradictory accounts. Churchill asked Owen O'Malley to investigate the issue, but in a note to the Foreign Secretary he noted: [...] "All this is merely to ascertain the facts, because we should none of us ever speak a word about it." [...] O'Malley pointed out several inconsistencies and near impossibilities in the Soviet version. Later, Churchill sent a copy of the report to Roosevelt on 13 August 1943. The report deconstructed the Soviet account of the massacre and alluded to the political consequences within a strongly moral framework but recognized there was no viable alternative to the existing policy. No comment by Roosevelt on the O'Malley report has been found. Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair gives little further insight. In his memoirs, he refers to the 1944 Soviet inquiry into the massacre, which found the Germans responsible, and adds, [...] "belief seems an act of faith".|$|E

2500|$|The film had {{personal}} {{meaning for}} Chaplin as it contained numerous references {{to his life}} and family: the theatre where he and Bloom performed in the film was the same theatre where his mother gave her last performance; Bloom was directed by Chaplin to wear dresses similar to those his mother used to wear; Chaplin's sons and his half-brother all had parts. Bloom states that she felt {{one of the reasons}} she got the part was because she closely resembled his young wife, Oona O'Neill. In his autobiography, Chaplin writes that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> the film would be a success: [...] "I had fewer qualms about its success than any picture I had ever made."

2500|$|The French press {{immediately}} {{protested the}} prospect of a Hohenzollern on the Spanish throne, and on 6 July the new Foreign Minister, the Duc de Gramont [...] told the Chamber that France would not permit Prince Leopold to become King of Spain. [...] Ollivier added that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Prussia would yield in the face of French firmness, but that 'if war be necessary, the government will not enter upon it without the consent of the Legislative Body.' Gramont's statement and Ollivier's mention of war were greeted with great enthusiasm by the deputies, and in the public galleries the ladies rose to their feet and waved their handkerchiefs as they joined in the wild applause. Next day the Paris press called for war with Prussia, and on 8 July their language was even more violent. The government instructed [...] Benedetti, the French ambassador to Prussia, to demand that King William should publicly refuse his consent to Prince Leopold's acceptance of the throne of Spain.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{a hundred}} local sheep farmers {{gathered}} at Kerry airport {{to protest the}} eagles' arrival. Irish Farming Association Hill Committee chairman Mr O'Leary said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> the eagles would take lambs. Since their reintroduction seven eagles have been confirmed poisoned in County Kerry, two suspected of having been poisoned, and one shot. A 13th eagle released in Kerry was shot in Northern Ireland. Twenty more eagles were due for release in 2010. However, Dr Allan Mee, {{in charge of the}} sea eagle project, stated [...] "the continuing loss of eagles to poisoning had cast a shadow over the future of the ambitious programme." [...] The first white-tailed eagle breeding pair since 1912 nested 100 years later on Lough Derg (Loch Deirgeirt), marking a great success for the Irish reintroduction programme. In early May 2013, the first eaglets were born in Ireland since the re-introduction programme began; one in the Killarney National Park and two in County Clare. In Spring 2015, five nests hatched chicks in 4 counties in Ireland - Clare, Cork, Galway and Kerry.|$|E

2500|$|The mill {{was built}} in 1786 by Matthew Boulton, {{with the backing of}} City financiers and Joah Bates, an organ player and {{composer}} who [...] "embarked all his own money and 10,000/ belonging to his wife" [...] to build it. It was the first steam-powered commercial flour mill in the United Kingdom. James Watt, an associate of Boulton, was personally hired to build a steam engine for the mill to grind corn. Watt's engine was tested before numerous spectators, including Sir Joseph Banks, but encountered problems with the sun and planet gear, and the piston rods. Repairs were completed in April 1786. The cost of erecting the mill proved to be considerably in excess of the original estimate, and Watt soon feared that it {{would turn out to be}} a losing concern. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the engines or the machinery would be able to do all that had been promised; but he feared that the absence of business capacity on the part of the managers would be fatal to the mill's commercial success. In September 1786, the Duke of Milan visited the mills.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of the sexual orientation of the sonnets' author was openly articulated in 1780, when George Steevens, upon reading Shakespeare's description {{of a young man}} as his [...] "master-mistress" [...] remarked, [...] "it is impossible to read this fulsome panegyrick, addressed to a male object, without an equal mixture of disgust and indignation". Other English scholars, dismayed at the possibility that their national hero might have been a [...] "sodomite", concurred with Samuel Taylor Coleridge's comment, around 1800, that Shakespeare's love was [...] "pure" [...] and in his sonnets there is [...] "not even an allusion to that very worst of all possible vices". Robert Browning, writing of Wordsworth's assertion that [...] "with this key [...] Shakespeare unlocked his heart", famously replied in his poem House, [...] "If so, the less Shakespeare he!" [...] The controversy continued in the 20th Century. By 1944, the Variorum edition of the sonnets contained an appendix with the conflicting views of nearly forty commentators. In the year after [...] "the law in Britain decriminalized homosexual acts between consenting males over twenty-one", the historian G. P. V. Akrigg published the first extended study of the Earl of Southampton, [...] "who <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> was the 'fair youth' of the sonnets." [...] Akrigg wrote, [...] "One is forced to suspect that some element of homosexuality lay {{at the root of the}} trouble [...] [...] [...] The love which he felt for Southampton may well have been the most intense emotion of his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 9, 1995, Ernesto Zedillo's 71-day-old {{administration}} {{ignited a}} tremendous social crisis. After he announced Subcomandante Marcos to be Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente. In counterproductive turn of events, President Ernesto Zedillo {{made a series}} of decisions that broke the peaceful solution strategy action plan defined by Carlos Salinas that kept the peace since the Zapatista Army of National Liberation uprising and the agreements Zedillo authorized his Secretary of Interior [...] Esteban Moctezuma to compromise with Marcos 3 days before in Guadalupe Tepeyac. No matter there was an amnesty law by Salinas and without knowing exactly who Marcos was, only with the PGR single presumption that Marcos was a dangerous guerrilla. President Ernesto Zedillo decided to launch a military offence to capture or annihilate Marcos. In a televised special broadcast, President Ernesto Zedillo alleged Marcos to be a terrorist in Nicaragua. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. Conflicting signals got strengthened for a fast military solution. Facts seemed to confirm Manuel Camacho Solís June 16, 1994 accusations that the reason for his resignation as the Chiapas Peace Commissioner was due to sabotage done by then presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo. Faced with this situation, Rafael Guillén's childhood friend and colleague, at the Jesuits College Instituto Cultural Tampico, Max Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a military solution by demonstrating that, contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo, Rafael Guillén was no terrorist. He recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the Jesuits in which they competed in Mexico. Confirming that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist. Max Appedole asked for help from Edén Pastora, the legendary Nicaraguan [...] "Commander Zero", to prepare a report for under-Secretary of the Interior Luis Maldonado Venegas; the Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma and the President Ernesto Zedillo about Marcos natural pacifist vocation and the terrible consequences of a tragic outcome. The document concluded that the marginalized groups and the radical left that exist in Mexico, have been vented with the Zapatistas movement, while Marcos maintains an open negotiating track. Eliminate Marcos and his social containment work would cease and the radical groups would take control of the movement. They will response to violence with violence. Terrorist activities would begin. The country would be in a dangerous spiral, which could lead to very serious situations because not only there is discomfort in Chiapas, but in many places in Mexico. Under a big political pressure of a highly radicalized situation in Mexico, Luis Maldonado Venegas reestablished the Mexican government-Zapatista Army of National Liberation dialog to search for peace by demonstrating Marcos' natural peace vocation and the terrible consequences of a military solution. Time showed that the policy initiated since the uprising by Carlos Salinas to achieve a peaceful solution to the Zapatista uprising was legal, politically and honorably correct, saving many lives in Mexico.|$|E
