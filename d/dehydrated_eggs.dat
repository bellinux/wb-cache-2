50|$|Powdered {{eggs are}} fully <b>dehydrated</b> <b>eggs.</b> They are made using spray drying {{in the same}} way that {{powdered}} milk is made. The major advantages of powdered eggs over fresh eggs are the price, reduced weight per volume of whole egg equivalent, and the shelf life. Other advantages include smaller usage of storage space, and lack of need for refrigeration. Powdered eggs can be used without rehydration when baking, and can be rehydrated to make dishes such as scrambled eggs and omelettes.|$|E
50|$|Dehydrated {{and frozen}} egg whites are cheaper and more {{efficient}} than fresh egg whites. However, each lot of dehydrated egg whites varies from the next. This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture, moisture, volume, and height. Surfactants {{that have been used}} to improve the whipping properties of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>eggs</b> are sodium desoxycholate, triethyl citrate, triacetin, sodium oleate and oleic acid. Frozen egg whites do not form as firm or stable foams as fresh egg whites. It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than fresh eggs. Acids can be added in manufacturing such as acetic, malic, tartaric, and citric. These improve the color and cake structure by lowering the pH, however they do not work as well as cream of tartar.|$|E
50|$|In February 1944 Anellis {{joined the}} newly created U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps Food and Container Institute in Chicago, and worked on {{problems}} of the microbiological safety of foods being shipped overseas to U.S. servicemen. Dehydrated milk and <b>dehydrated</b> <b>eggs</b> were products developed at this time for which Anellis tested the microbiological safety. Anellis's research focused on strains of bacteria which were especially heat-resistant, including salmonella and clostridium botulinum. This led to the consideration {{of the use of}} gamma radiation as a food preservative, and Anellis began research on the radiation resistance of bacteria in canned foods. In 1963 the Food and Container Institute was closed and its operations were moved to the U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Laboratories in Natick, Massachusetts. Anellis continued his research on the radiation resistance of bacteria at the Natick Labs until his retirement in 1977. While working at the Natick Labs he also participated in the program to develop foods and food preservations for NASA. Anellis was an advocate of irradiation of foods as a food preservative and preventative against microbiological contamination, and testified before the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the safety of human consumption of foods irradiated at low dosage.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{high and}} {{intermediate}} moisture sorption isotherms of whole egg, egg white, and egg yolk at 25 and 45 C {{with and without}} the addition of selected food humectants (glucose, sucrose, glycerol, propylene glycol, sodium chloride) were determined. In the pure <b>egg</b> systems, <b>dehydrated</b> <b>egg</b> white exhibited the highest water activity (aw) lowering ability, <b>dehydrated</b> whole <b>egg</b> was intermediate, and <b>dehydrated</b> <b>egg</b> yolk was the lowest when used in liquid egg systems. The pattern was reversed when the humectants were employed as the aw controlling agents in the systems. On an equivalent weight basis, the aw depressing property of sodium chloride was the most effective, followed by that of glycerol, which was comparable to the moisture sorption characteristics of propylene glycol. Glucose was not as effective as glycerol or propylene glycol but was superior to sucrose as an aw lowering solute. The aw of the egg systems incorporated with egg solids, glucose, sucrose, or sodium chloride was lower at 45 than at 25 C.

Porém, não é esclarecida a vantagem da forma fresca sobre as demais. Este trabalho teve como objetivo comparar o efeito do uso de ovo líquido pasteurizado e de ovo desidratado na qualidade de massa curta do tipo rigatoni. Foram avaliadas 9 formulações de massa seca, sendo uma sem adição de ovos (controle), 4 com diferentes proporções de ovo líquido pasteurizado (5 %, 10 %, 15 % e 20 %) e 4 com ovo desidratado nas proporções (1, 19 %, 2, 38 %, 3, 57 %, 4, 76 %), correspondentes as de ovo líquido pasteurizado estudadas. As massas obtidas foram avaliadas quanto às características de cozimento (AACC 66 - 15, 2000), textura (TA-XT 2 i) e cor (Minolta). Através de testes sensoriais, a firmeza e o sabor das diferentes amostras foram avaliados, assim como a aceitabilidade das amostras controle e as de maiores quantidades de ovo. Com base nos resultados obtidos, pode-se concluir que podem ser produzidas, nas condições utilizadas neste trabalho, massas alimentícias similares utilizando uma das duas formas comerciais de ovo. Desta forma, as diversas vantagens do ovo desidratado em relação ao líquido (facilidade de transporte e estocagem em temperatura ambiente, menor volume ocupado, maior durabilidade, facilidade de mistura à farinha de trigo) podem ser aproveitadas sem prejuízo ao produto final.

In the present study, cysts (<b>dehydrated</b> dormant <b>eggs)</b> from Argentinean Artemia spp. populations were analysed for their fatty acid profile. Most of the cyst samples analysed (n = 16) were obtained from Artemia persimilis populations, but 3 belonged to A. franciscana.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hatching}} {{success of}} leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea (Vandelli, 1761), {{is influenced by}} heterogeneously distributed ecological factors. However, the hatching success according to nest-site selection has rarely been studied and {{little is known about}} the role of nest-site selection and infertile (yolkless) egg production on the predation rate and development of fertile eggs in leatherback turtle nests laid in French Guiana. A field study of 99 leatherback turtle nests was conducted to quantify the relationships between hatching success and (i) the nest-site selection (i. e., vegetation line, sea tide line) and (ii) the infertile eggs, especially their state after incubation (i. e., hydrated or dehydrated) and their effects on predation rate. We found that hatching success on this beach was very low (38. 2 %). This study illustrates that nest-site selection influences the predation rate and the dehydration of yolkless eggs, while the production of yolkless eggs by leatherback turtles has consequences on nest success. The proportion of yolkless eggs in the clutch, as well as their status at the end of incubation (hydrated or not, preyed upon), correlates with predation rate, development of yolked eggs, and hatching success. There was a significant relationship between nest location (relative to high tide line and vegetation line) and both the predation rates of eggs and the percentage of <b>dehydrated</b> yolkless <b>eggs</b> within a clutch.

Thus far, there has been no success in the preservation of fish eggs because of the large size of the eggs and the thick external shell. This paper discusses the effectiveness of using the liquid meniscus formed around the egg for protecting its morphology. Freezing and thawing experiments of medaka eggs were performed under different freezing conditions, and the hatching rate of the egg was examined. Before freezing, the <b>eggs</b> were <b>dehydrated</b> at room temperature {{in order to reduce the}} effect of volume expansion caused by freezing. It was confirmed that 100 % of the <b>eggs</b> <b>dehydrated</b> by 15 % or less were successfully hatched. In the freezing process, a medaka egg was placed on a hydrophobic cooling plate and a thin liquid meniscus was formed around the hydrophilic egg surface. An aqueous solution of trehalose was used as the liquid meniscus as well as a cryoprotectant to prevent damage caused by freezing. Cryopreservation of the egg was not successfully performed for all processes, including intracellular freezing; however, 80 % of the eggs were alive even after freezing of the external meniscus. Therefore, it is confirmed that the liquid meniscus is effective for the cryopreservation of the external shell. The liquid meniscus can reduce the physical stress due to extracellular ice growth. Moreover, since the liquid meniscus system has a low heat capacity, the thermal process is easy to control compared to the conventional method.
