5|$|The couple {{met with}} Mahatma Gandhi, {{becoming}} the first African Americans to have an audience with him. When Thurman asked him to take his message to the United States, he demurred as his work in India and his personal quest there were not finished. One {{important aspect of the}} meeting was a discussion of how non-violent resistance {{could be used as a}} means of creating social change. The meeting had a profound effect on the couple, changing the direction of their lives. Though they would remain Christians, the meeting with Gandhi led them to consider establishing a church free of prejudice, transcending racial, social, economic and spiritual boundaries. After they returned to the United States, Howard received a letter from A. J. Muste on behalf of Alfred Fisk who was looking for someone to establish a church in San Francisco which crossed the racial and spiritual divides. Muste was hopeful that Rev. Thurman might <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> divinity student interested in the position. Instead, Howard decided to take up the challenge himself, securing a leave of absence in order to found the church. Thurman went with him bringing their two daughters, as she strongly believed in the cause.|$|E

The women enter, and the whole group joins in dancing a furiant. Away from the jollity the nervous Vašek muses over his forthcoming marriage in a stuttering song ("My-my-my mother said to me"). Mařenka appears, and guesses immediately who he is, but does not reveal her own identity. Pretending to be someone else, she paints a picture of [...] "Mařenka" [...] as a treacherous deceiver. Vašek is easily fooled, and when Mařenka, in her false guise, pretends to woo him ("I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maiden fair"), he falls for her charms and swears to give Mařenka up.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{informed}} Davison {{that the}} commission had concurred with the revision, and that Beach had been instructed to complete work {{as quickly as possible}} so as to have the coins available at an early date. On February24, 1923, commission secretary Hans Caemmerer showed the completed models to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly, who was pleased with them. [...] O'Reilly suggested that if Beach was certain there would be no further changes, that he send photographs of the models to the commission's offices, to be forwarded with its endorsement to the Bureau of the Mint in Washington. [...] This was done, and the designs were approved by both Mint Director Frank Edgar Scobey and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon on March8. [...] Moore was enthusiastic about the designs, writing to Davison on March21 that [...] "I feel great exultation over the way the model... has turned out... I do not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> memorial [...] coin which for sheer beauty equals this..." ...|$|E
500|$|The circuit {{received}} a mixed {{response from the}} drivers. De Ferran described it as [...] "very, very fast" [...] and felt {{the first and second}} turns was similar to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The fourth corner reminded him of Homestead-Miami Speedway and what the former Club corner at the Silverstone Circuit used to be like. Da Matta said the circuit was good and that it was faster than the drivers expected. However, he felt the speeds the cars drove at exceeded those normally considered safe and that overtaking was difficult. Tracy stated the Rockingham Motor Speedway was a good track to drive on, and felt it would be [...] "a great facility" [...] to show CART in the United Kingdom. Drivers did not criticise the problems that affected the event. De Ferran stated that similar problems had occurred at several race tracks across the United States. He said that the advice he would give to CART was to avoid holding the race in September. Bräck stated he did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar event where it had taken longer than expected to dry the track. Heitzler said the series would return to Rockingham Motor Speedway in 2002, and pledged that any problems with circuit drainage would not reoccur.|$|E

He remarked: [...] "Were I not an Emperor, I would like to be a teacher. I do not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> task more noble than to direct young minds and prepare the men of tomorrow." [...] His reign saw the creation of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute to promote research and preservation in the historical, geographical, cultural and social sciences. The Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera and the PedroII School were also founded, the latter serving as a model for schools throughout Brazil. The Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts, established by his father, received further strengthening and support. Using his civil list income, PedroII provided scholarships for Brazilian students to study at universities, art schools and conservatories of music in Europe. He also financed the creation of the Institute Pasteur, helped underwrite the construction of Wagner's Bayreuth Festspielhaus, as well as subscribing to similar projects. His efforts were recognized both at home and abroad. Charles Darwin said of him: [...] "The Emperor does so much for science, that every scientific man is bound to show him the utmost respect".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / When I was young I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When I grow up / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot of stuff that you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I know when I was young, and I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little kid who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E

The appointed passage includes that the king [...] "desires to see the dwarf even more than to receive the precious gifts from Punt".

[...] Millenear tells him that she is unable to teach light magic herself, but she does <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist monastery in Hong Kong that could be able to instruct him. The three arrive at the monastery only to be attacked by a swordsman and his companion. Deshwitat discovers that the swordsman is his old friend Rett Butler, who should have died over 300 years ago.

[...] Pilate was the prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 26–36. He served under Emperor Tiberius Claudius Nero. Herod Antipas was tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, a client state of the Roman Empire. He ruled from 4 BC to 39 AD.

2500|$|In 1903, such a moth was {{discovered}} in Madagascar by Lionel Walter Rothschild and Karl Jordan. This confirmed Darwin's prediction. The moth was named Xanthopan morganii praedicta. [...] The subspecific epithet praedicta was given {{in honor of the}} fact that Darwin predicted its existence, though the subspecies was later determined to be invalid (it is identical to the mainland form of the species). In 1873 William Alexander Forbes wrote an article in the journal Nature asking readers if they knew of the moth predicted by Darwin. A reply to the question was first made that same year by Hermann Müller. He announced that his brother Fritz Müller had discovered a moth with a proboscis of [...] long, but it {{was discovered}} in Brazil and so was not a candidate for pollinating A.sesquipedale. Although Darwin learned of Müller's finding he did not live to see the discovery of Xanthopan morganii. Even after the 1903 discovery however, news of Xanthopan morganii praedicta didn't immediately disseminate. A second inquiry into the existence of the pollinator moth was made in the January 30, 1907 issue of the journal Nature by E. W. Swanton. Presumably still unaware of Rothschild and Jordan's discovery, Wallace responded stating that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable pollinator in Madagascar, but that he had heard of one from East Africa with a long enough proboscis.|$|E
2500|$|As seen by Radu R. Rosetti, Kalinderu appears [...] "sententious, ridiculous, {{but very}} much {{appreciated}} by the King". Reportedly, {{he worked for}} free at the crown domains, refusing to collect his salary: [...] "The only rewards he desires are peasant blessings and his playing billiards with His Majesty." [...] The king's appreciation was strictly contextual, a fact noticed by the politician Ion G. Duca: although Kalideru [...] "entertained illusions" [...] that he was personal friends with Carol, the latter [...] "made sure to dispel it"; the courtier could be the king's [...] "servant and useful instrument, but never his friend." [...] Reportedly, Carol also ordered Kalinderu to admonish Crown Prince Ferdinand and Princess Marie for their lavish spending. The future Queen Marie was much amused by Kalinderu, describing him as [...] "little, round, with a short beard and a pronounced Semitic nose; one of his eyes sparkled wickedly, showing an unusually sharp intelligence". She recalled a visit with him to Windsor Castle, where [...] "it was truly amusing to see the short gentleman very pleased with himself, catching everything with his glimpse, weighing, judging, taking the measure of people and things, with that small, penetrating, almost wicked eye". Even when meeting Queen Victoria, his eye [...] "roved throughout, as if he feared missing something". When he was shown the castle's art treasures, he observed them [...] "with the superior air {{of a man in}} the <b>know,</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man who was familiar with valuable collections".|$|E
