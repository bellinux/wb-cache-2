5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, <b>electrical</b> <b>breakdown</b> occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E

To reduce these losses an idea was proposed to ferry aircraft instead—fly them over the ocean. It was a breath-taking proposal. In 1940 transoceanic flying was raw and new.

40|$|Crosslinked {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) {{is used as}} {{underground cable}} insulation due to its outstanding electrical properties and high temperature dimension stability. XLPE is often made by peroxide initiated crosslinking of low density polyethylene (LDPE). The introduction of unsaturations, i. e. vinyl groups, into LDPE has a major effect on the crosslinking performance. Peroxide radicals trigger a reaction of the vinyl groups, hence forming crosslinks with the radical reactivity preserved, in contrast to ordinary combination crosslinking where the radicals are consumed as the crosslink is formed. The main object of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} influence of two crosslinking mechanisms and increasing crosslink density on selected electrical properties. Two LDPEs crosslinked via mainly combination crosslinking or mainly reacted vinyl groups, respectively, were used. The electrical mechanisms investigated were water treeing, electrical treeing and <b>electrical</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Treeing are fairly slow degradation mechanisms that form under electrical stress, making high voltage insulating materials more susceptible to <b>electrical</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Water trees are tree shaped structures consisting of water filled voids, whereas electrical trees consists of hollow tubes that grow by local degradation of the polymer via partial discharges. The polymer morphology changes significantly at increasing crosslinking densities in both LDPEs, i. e. the degree of crystallinity decreases and the morphology transforms from consisting of fully developed spherulites to an axialitic structure, thereafter to randomly distributed lamella stacks. Water tree growth is significantly enhanced at increasing crosslink density, which is believed to be accounted for by the morphology change and increasing amount of amorphous areas. A corresponding effect could be seen for the growth of electrical trees. No distinct morphology dependence could however be established for the inception of electrical trees. Crosslinking with different peroxides and the addition of various antioxidants alters the electrical properties, which emphasizes the importance of a controlled polymeric system when used as an insulating material in power cables. These findings can be used to produce tailor-made polymeric insulation materials to maximize the electrical performance of power cables...|$|R

In this paper, we presented a resonant composite accelerating cavity, which utilizes a periodic structure with a dielectric sphere located at a spherical conducting cavity center. The {{presence of the}} dielectric sphere in {{the central part of}} the resonance cavity shifts the magnetic fields maximum from regions close to the metallic wall to the dielectric surface, which strongly lowers the skin effect losses in the wall. By using the existing ultra-low loss Sapphire dielectrics, we made theoretical analyze and numerical calculations by MATLAB, and further make simulated calculation by CST for comparison. The results show that all field components at the metallic wall are either zero or very small, and therefore one can expect the cavity to be less prone to <b>electrical</b> <b>breakdowns</b> than the traditional cavity.

The measurements of barrier height Bφ and grain size reveal that the variation of grain size {{was not the only}} reason for the change of electrical properties of the sample doped with In 2 O 3 and, the improvement of nonlinear coefficient α may mainly attribute to the increase of barrier height. Some energy levels of different state defects on the grain boundary were obtained and the energy about 0. 15 eV detected here of all the samples may be attributed to the activation of +xiSn.

Extensive studies of their origins are necessary to reduce parasitic power dissipation in solar cells. Simple measurement techniques are desirable to distinguish between fabrication-induced shunts and shunts caused by <b>electrical</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> e. g. due to opacity. We investigated shunts in a micromorph silicon thin film solar module by means of dark (DLIT) and illuminated lock-in thermography (ILIT). We derived their electrical characteristics from thermography images by varying the bias voltage. A classification of the defects indicated several types of shunts with different electrical properties. For optimisation processes of solar cells or quality management issues {{it is important to}} know the exact location of a shunt or defect. State-of-the-art thermography approaches enable only a lateral localisation of shunts. This is sufficient for single junction solar cells, but not for multi junction solar cells like micromorph tandem solar cells, where a shunt can occur in the amorphous or microcrystalline layer or both. We present a measurement technique based on ILIT which relates a shunt to its original layer in a tandem solar cell.
