30|$|There {{have been}} few early {{attempts}} to dope indium-rich GaInN and InN p-type using Mg, but they were unsuccessful [19]. The high electron concentration requires a high Mg doping level to achieve compensation. However, increasing Mg concentration results in a higher defect density. This <b>degrades</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> and crystal quality. Furthermore, {{the presence of an}} n-type surface conducting channel screens out the effect of doping of the bulk layer with Mg. However, Jones et al. have recently demonstrated p-type doping using capacitance-voltage (C-V) profiling measurements [20]. They also observed a small photoconductivity signal in Mg-doped GaInN in the entire composition range [21]. Further evidence for successful p doping of In-rich GaInN has been reported by various groups recently [22, 23].|$|R

30|$|We have {{investigated}} the degradation characteristics of the high-performance metasurface polarizer. The prepared metasurface exhibited a high extinction ratio {{of the order of}} 10, 000. We noted that the high performance has degraded gradually. To clarify the origin of this degradation, we {{have investigated}} <b>the</b> effects of <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> on <b>the</b> extinction ratio. Two models were presented to describe <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology.</b> One models a rough surface by a combination of a periodic curve and a Gaussian white noise, while the other models <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> by randomly distributed nanoparticles. Both models indicated that the high performance did not <b>degrade</b> by <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> roughness. This is because the high extinction ratio is governed by Babinet’s principle, resulting in the robustness of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology.</b> We have also investigated the relation between the extinction ratio and the increase in metallic loss because of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> roughness, which showed drastic degradation of the extinction ratio. The spectral feature of the blue-shift was also reproduced by the numerical calculation, indicating that the degradation is due to the increase in the metallic loss. From this result, we find that the metal deposition should be conducted to reduce the scattering and grain boundary losses that are related to the roughness. Throughout the numerical calculation, we have found that the low transmittance has a high sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology,</b> while <b>the</b> high transmittance does not have the high sensitivity. By utilizing these findings, we proposed that the extinction ratio can be enhanced by varying the thicknesses of the metallic layers. This study paves a way {{for the development of a}} metasurface with a high performance and stability toward time degradation.|$|R

One key issue that affects the application of wear debris analysis for machine condition monitoring is whether the morphology of the wear particles accurately depicts their original states and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> of <b>the</b> components from which the particles separate. This study aimed to investigate the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> of wear debris in relation to change in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> of wear components in sliding wear process.

40|$|Thin film solar cells, which {{consist of}} {{multiple}} layers {{such as the}} PIN layers and the Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) layers, are playing a more and more {{important role in the}} overall solar cell market owing to the potential of improving light conversion efficiencies (currently on the order of 10 % for production modules). Over the last decade, it has been widely recognized that <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> at each interface, which is characterized by surface root-mean-square roughness and slope, has crucial influence on the light conversion efficiency of thin film solar cells. Therefore, precisely shaping <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphologies</b> of different layers in thin film solar cells during the thin film deposition process is a promising way to improve solar cell efficiency. Despite its importance, the computational modeling and control of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology,</b> especially of <b>the</b> root-mean-square <b>surface</b> mean slope, during the thin film deposition process and its application to improve solar cell performance have not received enough attention.
