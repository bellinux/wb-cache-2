Despite the fact that several papers have examined the effect of IAS/IFRS on equity and debt markets, only few have focused on Greece. The present thesis uses both polled and panel data (fixed and random effects techniques) analysis techniques. Using data from 181 Greek companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, the results show that firstly, IAS/IFRS adoption and earnings management are negatively related suggesting that Greek companies tend to use fewer discretionary accruals after IAS/IFRS adoption as a way of earnings management. Secondly, the adoption of IAS/IFRS lowered the cost of debt of Greek companies implying that the increased quality as well as quantity of accounting disclosures reduces the uncertainty regarding a company‟s default risk and the mis-coordination between companies and suppliers, which in turn enables companies to borrow at better terms. Finally, the results indicate that IAS/IFRS adoption increased the <b>gearing</b> <b>level</b> of Greek companies, implying that the decreased uncertainty and risk of a company through IAS/IFRS adoption, enhances the company‟s borrowing bargain power and subsequently its <b>gearing</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R

40|$|Gears {{are widely}} used in gearbox to {{transmit}} power from one shaft to another. Gear crack {{is one of the}} most frequent gear fault modes found in industry. Identification of different <b>gear</b> crack <b>levels</b> is beneficial in preventing any unexpected machine breakdown and reducing economic loss because gear crack leads to gear tooth breakage. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis method for identification of different <b>gear</b> crack <b>levels</b> under different working conditions is proposed. First, superhigh-dimensional statistical features are extracted from continuous wavelet transform at different scales. The number of the statistical features extracted by using the proposed method is 920 so that the extracted statistical features are superhigh dimensional. To reduce the dimensionality of the extracted statistical features and generate new significant low-dimensional statistical features, a simple and effective method called principal component analysis is used. To further improve identification accuracies of different <b>gear</b> crack <b>levels</b> under different working conditions, support vector machine is employed. Three experiments are investigated to show the superiority of the proposed method. Comparisons with other existing <b>gear</b> crack <b>level</b> identification methods are conducted. The results show that the proposed method has the highest identification accuracies among all existing methods...|$|R

50|$|The {{front wheel}} drive {{prototype}} was unstable, however, {{because of the way}} the engine was set far ahead of the front axle, and high above the front-wheel drive power train, in what was a relatively light weight car. Setting the engine further back in relation to the front wheels would have involved a level of re-engineering for which neither time nor money were available. The decision was therefore taken to switch to a rear wheel drive configuration. The late decision led to issues with the gear box, however, which could not be redesigned at this stage and was simply switched round to allow for the fact that the drive shaft pointed in the opposite direction to that previously envisaged. For the driver, this gave rise to a back to front gear change, with first and third speed <b>gear</b> <b>level</b> positions nearer the driver and second and fourth positions facing the front of the car.|$|E
5000|$|Galaxy of Heroes allows {{players to}} collect {{characters}} from the Star Wars universe, create teams with them, {{and use them}} to fight in turn-based battles. There are multiple ways to collect characters: some are given to players immediately, whereas others are gained via game play or as in-game rewards in the form of shards that are earned by players to unlock and or promote their characters. Shards can either be earned from battles or bought from a shop. The shard amount needed for the character to be unlocked will also correspond to their starting star level, which can range from one to five stars. Characters can be promoted to a max of seven stars with each additional star increasing their power. There are also training droids to level up characters. Gear, mods, and ability parts can all upgrade characters. The maximum level cap in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is 85, which was changed from the previous level cap of 80 (previously 70). The maximum <b>gear</b> <b>level</b> has not yet been determined, for the gear required to reach higher levels is not available in many places.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Since {{there are}} {{backlash}} friction and time-varying stiffness, {{the characteristics of}} gear pair has strong nonlinearity. When a gear has faults such as pitting, spalling and tooth breakage, there are often some nonlinear characteristics as super-harmonics or sub-harmonics along with vibration signal. These characteristics will cause some difficulty for fault diagnostics, so {{it is necessary to}} study the mechanism of nonlinear vibration. Fourier expression was used to describe time-varying stiffness, a factor was used to depict <b>gear</b> fault <b>level</b> and nonlinear dynamics model for <b>gear</b> fault <b>level</b> was established. Simulation results show that, with certain friction and rotating speed, the nonlinear vibration has direct relationship with rotating speed and gear friction and has no direct relationship with fault types...|$|R

40|$|Using panel data methodology, the {{determinants}} of capital structure in 34 Australia listed property trusts (A-REITs) are investigated for the period 2003 - 2008.

Tangibility {{is found to be}} insignificant and property sector effects are inconsistent in various models. Furthermore, industry specific factors of stapled management structure and international operations have significant negative signs, showing that A-REITs with these features should have lower <b>gearing</b> <b>levels.</b> The signs of the determinants show that both pecking order theory and the trade-off theory are at work in explaining the capital structure of A-REITs, although more evidence exists to validate the latter theory.

40|$|Does the 2007 / 08 market crisis herald {{the end of}} risk {{modeling}} and the empirical method? This paper supports the hypothesis that recent risk modeling problems were caused {{by the use of}} inappropriate risk models which are fixable rather than fundamentally flawed. An extensive analysis including the sub-prime crisis shows that GARCH-based risk measures offer a potential solution to these problems. The paper also explores some risk modeling issues that arose during the crisis such as the appropriate choice of sample size and how to incorporate dynamic feedback effects into a risk model used for stress-testing. I illustrate a stress-testing method that applies the GARCH approach but results in relatively stable capital requirements preferred by practitioners. This method appears to address some of the concerns raised by regulators with respect to stress-testing practices during the market turbulence and would result in more conservative <b>gearing</b> <b>levels</b> for financial institutions. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{machines}} {{designs for}} traction application {{are concerned with}} paying particular attention to power density and efficiency. Therefore, this paper is focused on applying Bees algorithm (BA) for optimal design of Brushless Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (BLPMSM) for propulsion application. The analytical approach for the motor magnetic circuit is performed using the radial instantaneous magnetic field distribution in the airgap under specified loading condition; {{taking into account the}} magnetic core saturation and motor overall performance. The design aims to maximize the power density. Therefore, the optimisation objective function is formed to minimise motor weight and maximise efficiency. While the Bees Algorithm (BA) is applied to search for the optimum design parameters; the optimised design is then verified using Finite Element Method (FEM). Comparing with an existing machine, called here basic motor; the obtained results show that motor weight can be reduced by approximately 20 %, while motor output power is kept constant.

40|$|Commercial {{property}} {{is a physical}} asset class that forms {{an important part of}} the capital market universe. Due to illiquidity and high value thresholds, commercial property investment generally requires considerable equity and debt funding. Whilst debt funding can improve property investment returns, it substantially increases the level of risk. Over 28 years, on Australian data, the research showed the average indicative property floating and fixed lending rates were similar, in a range of 9. 3 % - 10. 1 % per annum. This compared to average desmoothed commercial property total returns of 10. 2 % per annum which included two periods of negative returns (March 1989 - September 1993 and September 2007 - September 2009). Overall, the application of high debt levels (80 % leverage) can lead to a 30 % improvement to annual commercial property total returns (13. 3 %), although the risk (volatility) is increased five-fold (11. 4 % to 57. 3 %) and can lead to a wide (280 %) performance range. In demonstrating the impact of <b>gearing</b> <b>levels</b> on desmoothed total property return performance, recognition is required that the management of debt and the associated stability of future property income is a central part of a property investment strategy...|$|R
