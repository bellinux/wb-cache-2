25|$|Cattle {{are large}} quadrupedal {{ungulate}} mammals with cloven hooves. Most breeds have horns, {{which can be}} {{as large as the}} Texas Longhorn or small like a scur. Careful <b>genetic</b> <b>selection</b> has allowed polled (hornless) cattle to become widespread.|$|E
25|$|A Norwegian {{study found}} that height gains were {{strongly}} correlated with intelligence gains until the cessation of height gains in military conscript cohorts {{towards the end of}} the 1980s.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show the}} {{usefulness}} of multiobjective <b>genetic</b> rule <b>selection</b> as a postprocessing procedure in data mining for pattern classification problems. First we extract a prespecified number of rules using a data mining technique. Then we apply multiobjective <b>genetic</b> rule <b>selection</b> to the extracted rules. Experimental results show that multiobjective <b>genetic</b> rule <b>selection</b> significantly decreases the number of extracted rules while improving their classification accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004. This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} bases upon which ethical assessments of parental <b>genetic</b> trait <b>selections</b> {{for their children}} can be made. It argues that if parents engage in <b>genetic</b> trait <b>selections,</b> they must act to expand their child's range of open futures, not to constrict their child's range of open futures or to differentially shift their child's range of open futures. It contends that other proposed distinctions, including distinctions between normal and diseased states and between treatment selections and enhancement selections, do not provide a sound basis for making ethical assessments of parental <b>genetic</b> trait <b>selections.</b> It contends that children {{have a right to}} an open future that parents hold in trust for their children and that parents must respect in making <b>genetic</b> trait <b>selections.</b> It considers examples of possible parental <b>genetic</b> trait <b>selections</b> regarding children's hearing, height and visual acuity. Finally, it addresses a number of concerns about and objections to this proposed basis for ethical assessment and to parental <b>genetic</b> trait <b>selection</b> generally but concludes that none of these concerns or objections are fatal the approach that if parents use parental <b>genetic</b> trait <b>selection,</b> they must do so in ways that expand their child's range of open futures...|$|R
40|$|One {{advantage}} of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms over classical approaches {{is that many}} non-dominated solutions can be simultaneously obtained by their single run.

25|$|Attempted {{explanations}} {{have included}} improved nutrition, {{a trend toward}} smaller families, better education, greater environmental complexity, and heterosis (the occurrence of offspring with more pronounced phenotypical traits from mixing the genes of its parents). Another proposition is the gradual spread of test-taking skills. The Flynn effect has been too rapid for <b>genetic</b> <b>selection</b> to be the cause.|$|E
25|$|Gut flora in cattle include methanogens {{that produce}} methane as a {{byproduct}} of enteric fermentation, which cattle belch out. The same volume of atmospheric methane has a higher global warming potential than atmospheric carbon dioxide. Methane belching from cattle can be reduced with <b>genetic</b> <b>selection,</b> immunization, rumen defaunation, diet modification and grazing management, among others.|$|E
25|$|Whichever {{method is}} used, the {{introduction}} of recombinant DNA into the chosen host organism is usually a low efficiency process; that is, {{only a small fraction}} of the cells will actually take up DNA. Experimental scientists deal with this issue through a step of artificial <b>genetic</b> <b>selection,</b> in which cells that have not taken up DNA are selectively killed, and only those cells that can actively replicate DNA containing the selectable marker gene encoded by the vector are able to survive.|$|E

40|$|In vitro-selected RNA aptamers are {{potential}} inhibitors of disease-related proteins. Our laboratory previously isolated an RNA aptamer that binds with high affinity to human transcription factor NF-κB. This RNA aptamer competitively inhibits DNA binding by NF-κB in vitro and is recognized by its target protein in vivo in a yeast three-hybrid system. In the present study, yeast <b>genetic</b> <b>selections</b> {{were used to}} optimize the RNA aptamer for binding to NF-κB in the eukaryotic nucleus. Selection for improved binding to NF-κB from RNA libraries encoding (i) degenerate aptamer variants and (ii) sequences present at round 8 of 14 total rounds of in vitro selection yielded RNA aptamers with dramatically improved in vivo activity. Furthermore, we show that an in vivo-optimized RNA aptamer exhibits specific “decoy” activity, inhibiting transcriptional activation by its NF-κB target protein in a yeast one-hybrid assay. This decoy activity is enhanced by {{the expression of a}} bivalent aptamer. The combination of in vitro and in vivo <b>genetic</b> <b>selections</b> was crucial for obtaining RNA aptamers with in vivo decoy activity...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>selection</b> and terminations: The {{ethics of}} {{preimplantation}} genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits {{was the subject of}} 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics. There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be [...] "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{depicts a}} world where <b>genetic</b> <b>selection</b> for {{increased}} health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified 'control naturals' are a carefully managed and protected minority. Dueling and the carrying of arms is a socially accepted way of maintaining civility in public; a man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic utopia; the [...] "economic dividend" [...] is so high that work has become optional. The chief economic problem is in fact using up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost less than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but this has the side effect of further increasing productivity {{a decade or more}} later, so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.|$|E
30|$|Manipulation of stand {{density and}} choice of genetic {{material}} are two key mechanisms through which forest managers can influence tree growth and wood properties. Past silvicultural practices in New Zealand have been characterised by early thinning to relatively wide spacing, while tree improvement programmes have primarily focussed on growth and form.

40|$|Optimal antenna {{selection}} algorithm of {{multicast transmission}} can {{significantly reduce the}} number of antennas and can acquire lower complexity and high performance which is close to that of exhaustive search. An asynchronous multicast transmission mechanism based on <b>genetic</b> antenna <b>selection</b> is proposed. The computational complexity of <b>genetic</b> antenna <b>selection</b> algorithm remains moderate while the total number of antennas increases comparing with optimum searching algorithm. Symbol error rate (SER) and capacity of our mechanism are analyzed and simulated, and the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism can achieve better SER and sub-maximum channel capacity in wireless multicast systems.

40|$|During protein synthesis, the {{ribosome}} undergoes conformational transitions between functional states, requiring communica-tion between distant {{structural elements}} of the ribosome. Despite advances in ribosome structural biology, identifying the pro-tein and rRNA residues governing these transitions remains a significant challenge. Such residues can potentially be identified genetically, given the predicted deleterious effects of mutations stabilizing the ribosome in discrete conformations and the ex-pected ameliorating effects of second-site compensatory mutations. In this study, we employed <b>genetic</b> <b>selections</b> and experi-mental evolution to identify interacting mutations in the ribosome of the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus. By direct <b>genetic</b> <b>selections,</b> we identified mutations in 16 S rRNA conferring a streptomycin dependence phenotype and from these derived second-site suppressor mutations relieving dependence. Using experimental evolution of streptomycin-independent pseudorevertants, we identified additional compensating mutations. Similar mutations could be evolved from slow-growing streptomycin-resistant mutants. While somemutations arose close {{to the site of}} the original mutation in the three-dimensional structure of the 30 S ribosomal subunit and probably act directly by compensating for local structural distortions, the locations of others are consistent with long-range communication between specific structural elements within the ribosome. The ribosome is the universal protein synthesis factory and acentral component of the cellular machinery linking genotype and phenotype. Ribosomes from all sources are composed of sev-eral large RNA molecules and a number of small ribosomal pro...|$|R
5000|$|Cultural traits {{alter the}} social and {{physical}} environments under which <b>genetic</b> <b>selection</b> operates. For example, the cultural adoptions of agriculture and dairying have, in humans, caused <b>genetic</b> <b>selection</b> for the traits to digest starch and lactose, respectively. [...] As another example, {{it is likely that}} once culture became adaptive, <b>genetic</b> <b>selection</b> caused a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information. This refinement may have further influenced the way culture is stored and the biases that govern its transmission.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a statistical model in a genome-wide microarray-based yeast genetic screen performed by imposing different <b>genetic</b> <b>selections</b> on thousands of yeast mutants in parallel. A mixture model is fitted to data obtained from oligonucleotide arrays hybridized to 20 -mer oligonucleotide ``barcodes'' and a procedure based on the fitted model is used to search for mutants differentially represented under experimental and control conditions. The fitted stochastic model provides a way to assess uncertainty. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model by applying it to the problem of screening for components of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway and identified known components of the NHEJ pathway. ...|$|R

40|$|A hydrolytic {{catalytic}} antibody, generated {{against a}} nitrophenyl phosphonate transition state analogue, has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli {{for use as}} a model system to demonstrate the feasibility of using <b>genetic</b> <b>selections</b> to enhance catalytic activity. Conditions were found that permit the secretion of active recombinant antibody into the periplasm of a strain of E. coli deficient in the biotin biosynthetic genes (delta bio-gal). A number of substrates were synthesized that, upon hydrolysis by the antibody, yield free biotin, which is required for cell growth. The substrates and selections can be used to identify mutants of the antibody with altered activities. This approach should be generalizable to a wide number of hydrolytic reactions including the selective cleavage of peptide, polysaccharide, phosphodiester, and ester bonds...|$|R
40|$|A longstanding {{quest of}} {{developmental}} biology {{has been to}} understand the molecular switches that determine which sets of genes are expressed in selected differen-tiated cell types. Since regulation of gene expression is predominantly {{at the level of}} mRNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1), the problem initially becomes one of defining the protein factors that establish and maintain a gene in a transcriptionally active state within the appropriate cell lineage. In mammalian systems, dissection of gene regu-latory pathways using the power of <b>genetic</b> <b>selections</b> to identify regulatory proteins remains a largely elusive goal. Consequently, much of our current knowledge of such processes in complex eukaryotes is derived from bio-chemical characterization of transcriptional activator pro-teins, especially those that target specific genes by com...|$|R
40|$|In {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} method of introducing DNA into Pyrococcus furiosus, we discovered a variant within the wild-type population that is naturally and efficiently competent for DNA uptake.

We have demonstrated {{the use of this}} strain, designated COM 1, for genetic manipulation. Using <b>genetic</b> <b>selections</b> and counterselections based on uracil biosynthesis, we generated single- and double-deletion mutants of the two gene clusters that encode the two cytoplasmic hydrogenases.
