Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and {{have the freedom to}} release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E

He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, his wife said, “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to your initial aspiration. <b>Do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> like, and do not worry about your wife and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E

500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You can <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're {{not going to get}} it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue of}} torture on {{the series was}} {{discussed}} by President Bill Clinton who stated {{that he does not}} feel there is a place in U.S. policy for torture, but [...] "If you're the Jack Bauer person, you'll <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> do and you should be prepared to take the consequences." [...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E

Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you {{have something to say about}} the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E

500|$|... "Road to Rhode Island" [...] was {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire and was written by Gary Janetti. It featured guest appearances from Victoria Principal as Dr. Amanda Rebecca, Danny Smith and Wally Wingert as various characters. This was the first episode directed by Povenmire. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom for directing episodes. Povenmire said that MacFarlane would tell him, [...] "We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. <b>Do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want. I trust you." [...] Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him have fun. Several years after the episode was written, in DVD commentary for the eighth and ninth season of the show, Gary Janetti, the writer of the episode, recalled that the original title of the episode {{was intended to be}} simply [...] "Brian & Stewie", but was changed by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who wanted there to be a [...] "Road to" [...] episode each season. The name of the episode was then changed to [...] "Road to Rhode Island", with the original name later being used for the landmark 150th episode of the show, also entitled [...] "Brian & Stewie", and written by Janetti.|$|E

She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} you had to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> {{have to do to get}} me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E
