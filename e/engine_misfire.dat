25|$|Despite a {{retirement}} at Crosby on lap 6 of the 1930 Junior TT race, {{this was followed}} by winning his first TT race, the Lightweight, riding an AJS motorcycle at an average race speed of 64.71mph. The Senior TT race was another retirement for Guthrie on lap 2 at the Creg-ny-Baa with an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Canto proved {{once again}} his worth as an {{endurance}} driver {{teaming up with}} Glenn Seton at the endurance rounds in a DJR Falcon. The pair finished ninth at Bathurst even with an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 2014 saw {{him take}} his 17th TT {{win in the}} second sidecar race. He led the first race by more than 20 seconds until an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> caused him to stop on the final lap.|$|E
5000|$|Knock sensors {{have been}} {{eliminated}} by utilizing the [...] "ionic current" [...] measuring system. Using the ionic current system, <b>engine</b> <b>misfires</b> as well as knock can be measured simultaneously. The ionic current is measured by passing a low voltage across the spark plugs immediately following the ignition spark.|$|R
50|$|On lap 174 Lloyd Ruby's <b>engine</b> <b>misfired</b> {{allowing}} Joe Leonard to {{take the}} lead in the Lotus 56 Turbine. Leonard, however, suffered a flameout on the lap 191 restart, and rolled to a silent and shocking halt. Bobby Unser in the venerable piston-powered Offenhauser, inherited the lead, and despite gear linkage trouble, went on to win his first of three Indy 500 victories.|$|R
5000|$|Williams driver Derek Bell {{suspected}} the <b>engine</b> <b>misfiring</b> problems that had plagued Clark's car all weekend. Sims had confirmed to Bell that the engine issues {{had not been}} resolved before the race, and Bell later said, [...] "I could see it: he goes through that curve, the engine cuts out, the thing gets itself sideways as a result, the engine suddenly cuts back in when he’s out of shape... who knows?" ...|$|R
50|$|Red Bull's Verstappen had <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> {{problems}} {{and did not}} set a qualifying time {{until late in the}} session, 1.5 s slower than his teammate in fifth. Verstappen was trying for an improved time when Giovinazzi crashed and was consequently eliminated in 19th place, though he was scheduled to start from 17th on the grid.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 131. The seventh caution of {{the race}} flew on lap 136 when Tony Stewart got loose and spun down onto pit road and Ryan Blaney, trying to avoid hitting him, made contact with the wall. Edwards had an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> under the caution and fell from second to 12th.|$|E

The Senior TT race was another retirement for Guthrie on lap 2 at the Creg-ny-Baa with an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{eliminate}} the need of NOx and particulate treatment in contemporary diesel engines, the cylinder compression ratio is reduced to 14.0:1. Cold engine start is achieved via multi-hole piezo injectors with 3 programmable injection patterns, and adoption of ceramic glow plugs. <b>Engine</b> <b>misfiring</b> is prevented via variable valve lift at exhaust, which opens exhaust valves during the intake stroke, which increases engine air temperature. The SKYACTIV-D also uses a two-stage turbocharger, in which one small and one large turbo are selectively operated, according to driving conditions.|$|R
50|$|In stark {{contrast}} to , no one driver emerged as dominant {{in the early stages}} of the 2010 season. Fernando Alonso won the opening race of the season in Bahrain after Sebastian Vettel's <b>engine</b> <b>misfired,</b> with Alonso becoming just the sixth Ferrari driver to win on debut for the Italian team. Reigning World Champion Jenson Button claimed victory in Australia for the second year in succession, whilst Vettel won in Malaysia, setting up a unique situation that would last for the rest of the season whereby no driver would win a race while leading the World Championship.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1962, {{the name}} Kosmos {{was given to}} Soviet {{spacecraft}} which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth parking orbit as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn {{with a duration of}} roughly 4 minutes. If the <b>engine</b> <b>misfired</b> or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} {{preventive}} maintenance performed on an automobile, tune-ups can prevent myriad problems from occurring on a vehicle. The filters replaced can clog with use and prevent flow, starving {{the engine of}} fuel or air. Spark plugs have a recommended service lifetime of either 30,000 miles or, {{in the case of}} platinum or iridium plugs, 60,000 to 100,000 miles (96,000 to 160,000 km), and old spark plugs may cause <b>engine</b> <b>misfire.</b>|$|E
50|$|The little DB-Panhards had an {{extraordinary}} run, that of owner-driver René Bonnet winning the S-750 class {{ahead of its}} sister car, and finishing 5 laps clear of the OSCA winning the bigger S-1100 class. They were on course for the coveted Index of Performance win, but a bad <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> meant it used too much fuel on its very last lap. The streamlined Panhard won the Index by the tiniest fraction on a countback.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Honda {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the EPA to extend the warranties and offer free services for 1.6 million 1995 Civics and 1996-1997 model year Acuras, Accords, Civics, Preludes, and Odysseys, because Honda had disabled an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> warning light that would have otherwise directed drivers to seek repairs for the misfires. Honda was required to spend a total of $267 million on the warranties, service, pollution reduction projects, and $12.6 million in civil penalties.|$|E
40|$|Factors {{determining}} {{the success or}} failure of combustion initiation using a glow plug have been investigated through experimental work on a single cylinder, common rail diesel engine with a geometric compression ratio of 15. 5, and a quiescent combustion bomb with optical access. A glow plug was required to avoid <b>engine</b> <b>misfires</b> when bulk gas temperature at the start of injection was less than 413 C. The distance between the glow plug and the spray edge, the glow plug temperature, and the bulk gas temperature were important factors in meeting two requirements for successful ignition: a minimum local temperature of 413 C and a minimum air/fuel vapour equivalence ratio of 0. 15 – 0. 35...|$|R
50|$|Having led both {{practice}} sessions, Tarquini {{took his}} second consecutive pole {{position of the}} season, leading a Honda 1-2-3 with Monteiro and Michelisz behind. Tom Boardman stopped just after leaving the pit lane {{for the first time}} when his <b>engine</b> <b>misfired,</b> he had already had a new engine fitted after his crash in Marrakech and then required another new engine after free practice two. Five minutes into the first part of qualifying, Darryl O'Young ran wide, crashed his ROAL Motorsport BMW into the barriers at turn nine and brought out the red flags. The session resumed half an hour later once the barriers had been repaired and after Huff topped the times before the stoppage, Tarquini went {{to the top of the}} times by the end of Q1. Thompson, Fernando Monje and Marc Basseng failed to get through to the second session for the first time in 2013.|$|R
50|$|A race ECU {{is often}} {{equipped}} with a data logger recording all sensors for later analysis using special software in a PC. This can be useful to track down <b>engine</b> stalls, <b>misfires</b> or other undesired behaviors during a race by downloading the log data and looking for anomalies after the event. The data logger usually has a capacity between 0.5 and 16 megabytes.|$|R
50|$|At the restart on lap 49 Whincup {{led from}} Tander, Courtney, Lowndes, Caruso, Steven Johnson, Mark Winterbottom, Rick Kelly and Paul Dumbrell. Fabian Coulthard turned Todd Kelly into a spin and Jonathon Webb also punting Greg Murphy into a spin. Alex Davison {{came to a}} halt with his portion of track blocked. All continued. Coulthard {{received}} a drive-through penalty. Top four pulled steadily away. Will Davison retired with an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> after having climbed {{to the edge of the}} top ten after his qualifying accident left him buried in the grid.|$|E
5000|$|Lined up, as was Le Mans tradition, {{according}} to effective engine capacity, it was Tom Cole in the Allard {{who was the}} first to get going. Last to get away was Fangio’s Gordini with an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire.</b> Sommer overtook a dozen cars to lead {{at the end of the}} first lap, ahead of Cole, Meyrat’s Talbot, Peter Whitehead in the new Jaguar and Trintignant in the supercharged Gordini. [...] On lap 2 Cunningham slid “Le Monstre” into the Mulsanne sandbank and had to spend 15 minutes digging it out By the fifth lap, Rosier had his Talbot up to third and Chinetti had the other big Ferrari up to fifth.|$|E
5000|$|Prost got {{a horror}} start and {{was down in}} 9th {{at the end of}} the first lap with BBC {{commentator}} and [...] World Champion James Hunt noting as early as lap 2 that his Honda engine was badly misfiring. Prost was later lapped by his team mate going into Woodcote in a move that also saw Senna take the lead for the first time from Berger. Prost suffered his first DNF of the season when he retired on lap 24 citing an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> and poor handling, though in complete contrast to his win in France a week earlier, he was attacked in the French press, many of whom felt he had simply given up.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,490 Kosmos {{satellites}} {{had been}} launched. The spacecraft do not form a single programme, but instead consist {{of almost all}} Soviet and Russian military satellites, {{as well as a}} number of scientific satellites, and spacecraft which failed during or immediately after launch, but still reached orbit. Most Soviet and subsequently Russian military satellites were given Kosmos designations. Spacecraft include optical reconnaissance satellites, communications satellites, early warning missile defence spacecraft, nuclear-powered radar reconnaissance satellites, anti-satellite weapons and their targets, navigation satellites and technology demonstrators. Some scientific spacecraft such as Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik, Bion and Meteor satellites were also given Kosmos designations.The designation is given only to satellites which are in Earth orbit. Typically, Soviet Lunar and planetary missions were initially put into a low Earth parking orbit along with an upper stage, which would later burn for around four minutes to place the spacecraft into a cislunar or a heliocentric orbit. If the <b>engine</b> <b>misfired</b> or the burn was not completed, the probes which would be left in Earth orbit would be given a Kosmos designation.Control systems for 152 spacecraft which were later assigned Kosmos designations were developed and manufactured by NPO Electropribor (Kharkiv).|$|R
50|$|All {{versions}} of the GMC V6 used a six-throw crankshaft, which when combined with the 60 degree included cylinder angle, produced a smooth running engine without any need for a balance shaft. Spark plugs were located on the inboard side of the cylinder heads and were accessed {{from the top of}} the engine. This position reduced the likelihood of water being splashed on to the spark plugs and causing the <b>engine</b> to <b>misfire</b> or stall. GMC V6 engines were noted for durability, ease of maintenance and strong low RPM torque.|$|R
50|$|Hill and Stewart {{lined up}} seventh and tenth {{for the final}} race {{of the year in}} Mexico, both cars leaking oil in {{practise}} caused by a leaking oil pressure relief valve that was easily fixed. In the race Hill's <b>engine</b> was <b>misfiring</b> from the start and lasted 18 laps, while Stewart moved up to third trailing smoke as another leak slowly drained all the oil from the engine, retiring after 26 laps. After being second and fifth in the Championship after six rounds in the P261, Hill and Stewart ended the season without adding to their points in fifth and seventh place.|$|R
50|$|Juno highly {{elliptical}} initial {{polar orbit}} takes it within 4200 km {{of the planet}} and out to , far beyond Callisto's orbit. An eccentricity-reducing burn, called the Period Reduction Maneuver, was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit. Originally, Juno was expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months {{before the end of}} its mission. Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns, mission managers announced on February 17, 2017, that Juno would remain in its original 53-day orbit, as the chance of an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high. Juno will now complete only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.|$|E
50|$|The Zakspeed {{team made}} its début with the 841 {{in the second}} race of the season at the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, having missed the opening race in Brazil. Former RAM driver Jonathan Palmer drove the car and took 23rd place in qualifying. In the race, however, he {{collided}} with Williams' Keke Rosberg at the start, terminally damaging the suspension. At the next race in San Marino, Palmer qualified a highly respectable 17th, but failed to take the start with an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire.</b> The following race at Monaco brought the 841 its first finish in 11th place. However, {{this would be the}} team's only finish in 1985, as a series of mechanical problems led to Palmer retiring from the next five consecutive races that he took part in.|$|E
50|$|Since 2010, Abbeyfield School {{had taken}} part in the UKAYRoC competition. In the first year only one team was entered. The team passed {{qualification}} flights and proceeded to the finals, finally coming 9th overall. The following year, two teams were entered, Quantum and Enigma. Both teams {{made it to the}} final, but Enigma suffered from an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire,</b> and only came 15th. Quantum, had a successful launch, and came 5th overall. In 2012, three teams were entered Enigma, Quantum and Omega. Both Omega and Enigma qualified for the UK finals with both teams managing successful launches that placed them in 3rd and 4th positions respectively. All three teams made it to the 2013 finals. In 2015 a team from the school came second, and in 2016 one team came second and one won first overall.|$|E
5000|$|Prost {{was passed}} on lap nine by Nigel Mansell, leading a Grand Prix {{for the first}} time, when Prost's TAG <b>engine</b> was <b>misfiring</b> and he was delayed by both Corrado Fabi's stalled Brabham and Michele Alboreto's about-to-be-lapped Ferrari just before the tunnel (Prost {{actually}} hit a marshal who was pushing Fabi's car away but thankfully with no serious injury). Mansell pulled away from Prost at around two seconds per lap, before going off six laps later on the run up to Casino Square after hitting a painted white line, damaging his car and retiring from the race.|$|R
50|$|For {{the next}} eleven laps Arnoux, Scheckter, Villeneuve, Laffite and Jabouille ran nose-to-tail, with Regazzoni a distant sixth. Then, on lap 13, Arnoux's <b>engine</b> began to <b>misfire,</b> leading to his retirement. Scheckter thus regained the lead, with Villeneuve dutifully {{following}} him. Later in the race, Laffite and Jabouille also suffered engine failures, promoting Regazzoni to third.|$|R
50|$|The Englishman drove {{under the}} flag 34 seconds ahead of {{teammate}} Ginther, repeating BRM's season-opening sweep at Monaco. New World Champion Clark took the final podium spot when he overtook Brabham, whose <b>engine</b> had been <b>misfiring</b> {{for much of}} the race. It was Hill's first American win, but one that he would repeat in 1964 and 1965.|$|R
5000|$|Liquid gasoline, being denser than air, is {{slower than}} air {{to react to}} a force applied to it. When the {{throttle}} is rapidly opened, airflow through the carburetor increases immediately, faster than the fuel flow rate can increase. This transient oversupply of air causes a lean mixture, which makes the <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> (or [...] "stumble")—an effect opposite to that which was demanded by opening the throttle. This is remedied {{by the use of}} a small piston or diaphragm pump which, when actuated by the throttle linkage, forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat. This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip-in. Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume or duration by some means. Eventually, the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that pump output is reduced; this reduction of the accelerator pump shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed.|$|E
50|$|The race {{started in}} light drizzle, making the new track surface treacherously greasy. As usual, Moss was lightning-quick and first {{off the line}} in his Aston Martin. Hawthorn’s more {{powerful}} Jaguar blasted past {{him on the back}} straight and led {{at the end of the}} first lap. On lap three, Paul Frère got it sideways in the narrow Esses and spun his Jaguar. Fairman, close behind in the sister car, slammed on the brakes and also spun, then de Portago arrived unsighted and with nowhere to go broadsided Fairman. All three cars got going again: Frère limped on but came to a halt on the Mulsanne straight. De Portago got a bit further but the Ferrari’s oil cooler was smashed. Fairman got to the pits but the damage was too severe to repair. Ten minutes gone and three works entries were already eliminated. Hill’s Ferrari barely managed to skate through his teammate’s oil, but soon his clutch started to fail. More drama occurred minutes later when Hawthorn came in from the lead with an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire.</b> It was eventually traced to a hairline crack in a fuel line - the delay and repair cost an hour, and 21 laps, and dropped the remaining works Jaguar out of contention.|$|E
50|$|Gardner {{began his}} racing career in 1977 {{at the age}} of 18, riding a {{second-hand}} Yamaha TZ250 bike in the Australian championship and finishing second on debut at Amaroo Park. He went on to record his first win a few weeks later at Oran Park Raceway. In 1981 Gardner was hired by Mamoru Moriwaki to race in the Australian Superbike championship aboard the Moriwaki Kawasaki Z1s. Gardner and co-rider John Pace qualified their Moriwaki Kawasaki Z1 on pole position at the prestigious 1981 Suzuka 8 Hours, ahead of all the major factory racing teams. Fellow racer, Graeme Crosby gave Gardner his first opportunity to race in Europe. Although Crosby was contracted to ride for Suzuki, he decided to sponsor Gardner to compete in the British Superbike championship riding Kawasakis run by the British Moriwaki concession owned by Crosby. On the way to Europe, Gardner rode the Moriwaki Kawasaki to an impressive fourth-place finish at the 1981 Daytona Superbike race behind Yoshimura Suzuki riders Crosby, Wes Cooley and Honda's Freddie Spencer. Moriwaki and Gardner proceeded to compete in the British championship, winning their first race in England. Gardner entered the final race of the season with a chance to win the title but, an <b>engine</b> <b>misfire</b> relegated him to third place overall in the championship.|$|E
50|$|Bowe {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for the 1984 Australian Grand Prix at Calder Park in Melbourne and led {{the race for the}} first 18 laps before a loose spark plug lead caused the 4 cyl Ford <b>engine</b> to <b>misfire</b> and he was passed by defending race winner Roberto Moreno of Brazil who {{went on to win the}} race. Bowe finally stopped on lap 33 and rejoined in 13th place. He would fight his way back to 6th place by the end of the race (2 laps down), setting the 3rd fastest race lap behind Moreno's Ralt and the similar car of Formula One driver Andrea de Cesaris.|$|R
50|$|Muller, Huff and Menu {{finished}} the second free practice {{session in the}} same order as Chevrolet continued to dominate practice. Dahlgren was fourth in the Volvo and Tom Coronel was fifth in the leading BMW. Tarquini was the quickest SUNRED car in sixth but team mate Monteiro didn't set a competitive lap time during the session having suffered from a <b>misfiring</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At 4pm {{the race}} was started under dark clouds by Prince Bernhard, consort of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, and an avid motor-racing fan. It came as no {{surprise}} when the mighty 375’s of González, Marzotto and Manzon stormed away in 1-2-3 formation at the start, with Moss, Rolt and Wharton (who had a startline collision) in close pursuit. After only five laps the first heavy downpour arrived, negating the Ferrari power advantage. By {{the end of the first}} hour, González and Marzotto and Moss had a gap over Rolt, and Manzon. The rest of the field was already a lap down. Forty minutes later on lap 22, still in heavy rain, Moss managed to take the lead, starting the to-and-fro battle between the two marques. Wharton had been held up in the first hour with a blocked fuel filter and over the next couple of hours, the other two Jaguars suffered <b>engine</b> <b>misfires</b> giving the Ferraris a lap’s lead over the field. Walker stopped out on the track for 50 minutes, but the Moss/Walker car would not be staging an epic comeback this year. Meanwhile, Behra’s Gordini and Fitch’s Cunningham were regularly trading places in the top-10, mimicking the disc-brakes versus power battle at the front. However soon after 7pm, Behra pitted with ignition problems and then stopped out on the track beyond Mason Blanche. He pushed the car all the way back to the pits to get going again, but it eventually retired in the middle of the night.|$|R
