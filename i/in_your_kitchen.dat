I say prize because I never heard of such a chance being offered to a doctor's wife in a country town. Now {{what are you going to}} do about it, Kitty? If your regard for your husband's physical condition is not sufficient to make you look on this matter as I do, think of his soul.

5000|$|A Consumer Reports article {{criticized the}} 2010 study, calling into {{question}} {{the small sample size}} of bags examined in the study and the questionable danger of the type and amount of bacteria found. Michael Hansen, senior staff scientist at Consumers Union, stated [...] "A person eating an average bag of salad greens gets more exposure to these bacteria than if they had licked the insides of the dirtiest bag from this study". But Hansen notes that there are some reminders to take away from the study. It’s easy to spread bacteria from meat, fish, or poultry to other foods - <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>kitchen</b> or in your grocery bags. So he does think it’s wise to carry those items in disposable bags. Reusable bags are fine for most everything else, but it’s a good idea to wash them occasionally.|$|E
