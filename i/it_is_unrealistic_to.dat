25|$|One of {{the central}} points made by critics of canal expansion, most {{prominently}} former canal administrator Fernando Manfredo, is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> attempt to predict canal usage trends over a generation, improbable to expect that US imports from China {{will continue to grow}} for a generation as they have the past few years, and irresponsible to bet Panama's financial future on such a projection.|$|E
25|$|The EIB is {{presently}} implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16 bytes wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey {{up to three}} transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the system clock rate the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions {{on each of the}} four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions * 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks per transfer). While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> simply scale this number by processor clock speed. The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints which are discussed in the Bandwidth Assessment section below.|$|E

5000|$|... : Foreign Ministry {{spokesman}} Andrei Popov {{stated that}} his government believes the situation arose from an unwillingness {{on the part}} of nuclear powers to disarm themselves and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect non-nuclear states to not develop their own deterrent when threatened by states with such arms. Belarus called upon the states concerned to return to negotiations.|$|R
50|$|Awdry's {{complaints}} were directed at {{two aspects of}} the episode in particular. One <b>was</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> have a railway running through a forest, and that sparks from an engine's funnel could cause a wildfire. Britt Allcroft, the producer of the series, countered this aspect by claiming {{that she had seen}} a number of lines do the same thing.|$|R

2500|$|The 2008 Democratic Party Platform {{acknowledges}} a [...] "special {{relationship with}} Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a clear, strong, fundamental {{commitment to the}} security of Israel, our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy." [...] It also included: It is {{in the best interests of}} all parties, including the United States, that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel. To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel. All understand that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect the outcome of final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, {{theories}} of nucleation and growth have {{to invoke the}} thermodynamics of fluctuations.

50|$|In April 1944, Hill's {{opposite}} number, Colonel Chichayev, {{complained that}} SOE had done practically nothing {{and that the}} Soviets no longer had any need for them. At the same time, SOE was frustrated by NKVD's refusal to co-operate in Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly with the Polish underground army. Hill could not really <b>be</b> blamed: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect SOE and NKVD to co-operate successfully.|$|R
50|$|The Auld Report (2001) {{commented that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect the social {{composition}} of magistrates {{to be close}} to that of the general population. This was partly because many people found it difficult to obtain support from their senior managers to be released for magisterial duties, and because of other reasons relating to employment. Therefore, the bench would never be a true cross-section of society.|$|R

5000|$|Routier was {{represented}} at trial by prominent lawyer Douglas Mulder. Defense attorneys {{said that there}} was no reason why she would have killed her children. They said that the case did not have a motive, a confession or any witnesses. They asserted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> accuse her of staging a crime scene. Her attorneys advised her not to appear on the witness stand, but she testified anyway and [...] "withered under cross-examination by prosecutor Toby Shook." ...|$|R

He appeared on The Tyra Banks Show {{with his mother and}} sister, saying he wanted to dispel rumors. Remarking on Bristol's public appearances to promote sexual abstinence, Johnston told The Early Show that [...] "abstinence is a great idea" [...] but said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to work for teens.

25|$|The {{origins of}} the Chevaline {{requirement}} grew from the conclusion of several British governments that {{in the event of}} a Soviet nuclear attack on the UK alone, as had been threatened in late 1950s by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and Prime Minister Nikolai Bulganin <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect that the US would retaliate against the Soviet Union and risk an attack on major American cities. That conclusion by successive British governments was the basis of their justification given to the British people for an independent nuclear retaliatory capability.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect {{business}} to voluntarily commit the resources required for full sustainable accounting implementation. For financing {{the implementation of}} sustainability accounting and reporting one option would be to use environmental taxes to raise revenue and to discourage negative environmental impacts. Once the sustainability accounting system is established tax rates could be linked to (sustainability) performance outcomes to encourage the transition to sustainability at the organizational level.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an age of}} big business, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> {{think only}} of markets of the {{classical}} kind. Big businesses set their own terms in the marketplace, and use their combined resources for advertising programmes to support demand for their own products. As a result, individual preferences actually reflect the preferences of entrenched corporations, a [...] "dependence effect", and {{the economy as a}} whole is geared to irrational goals.|$|E

5000|$|The two concepts, however, are {{not always}} cleanly contrasted, since the notion of {{equality}} is complex. Some analysts see the two concepts not as polar opposites but as highly related such {{that they can not}} be understood without considering the other term. One writer suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> think about equality of opportunity in isolation, without considering inequalities of income and wealth. Another agreed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible to understand equality without some assessment of outcomes. A third writer suggested that trying to pretend that the two concepts were [...] "fundamentally different" [...] was an error along the lines of a conceit.|$|R
2500|$|Nailatikau's outspoken {{calls to}} tackle the AIDS crisis have {{attracted}} controversy. On 22 November 2005, he called on people to recognize the reality that promiscuity existed, and that safe sex needed to be promoted to combat the associated AIDS risk. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> deny promiscuity and just promote abstinence, he considered, adding {{that this was a}} matter of life and death. He also called on churches to face the reality that promiscuity existed among their own congregations, and to meet the problem [...] "head on" [...] and play a part in promoting the use of condoms.|$|R
50|$|Opponents of {{this change}} believe that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect any change to come to current provincial boundaries, and hence prefectures are here to stay, {{at least in the}} short term. Moreover, they claim that the sheer size of provinces (which, {{according}} to them, do not need to be shrunk) means that prefectures are needed as an intermediary level. Finally, they defend the establishment of prefecture-level cities by arguing that it helps in encouraging urbanization, and cooperative development of entire regions.|$|E

Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect the tissue to heal completely in a similarly short time period. Gains in gingival attachment may occur slowly over time, and ongoing periodontal maintenance visits are usually recommended every three to four months to sustain health. The frequency of these later appointments is key to maintaining the results of the initial scaling and root planing, especially in the first year immediately following treatment.|$|E

In the case of Flight 981 however, the airline did not have a ground engineer on duty {{at the time of the}} departure, and the flight engineer for Flight 981 failed to check the door. Although French media outlets called for Mahmoudi to be arrested, the crash investigators stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect an untrained, low-wage earning baggage handler who could not read the warning sticker to be responsible for the safety of the aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|As an administrator, in his {{capacity}} as the chairman of the protest committee of the Greater New York Bridge Association (GNYBA), Kaplan was able to steer between extreme views of the Proprieties. An older group of players tended to regard the Proprieties as pious nonsense, believing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> demand that players bid and play in tempo: problems arise that require time to consider. A younger group demanded that violations of the proprieties be made part of a player’s record. (Such violations can include, for example, fumbling with a doubleton on defense: a singleton would be played promptly, with no trace of indecision.) ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{criticism}} of the Pleistocene rewilding is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> assume that communities today are functionally similar to their state 10,000 years ago. Opponents argue {{that there has been}} more than enough time for communities to evolve in the absence of mega-fauna, and thus the reintroduction of large mammals could thwart ecosystem dynamics and possibly cause collapse. Under this argument, the prospective taxa for reintroduction are considered exotic and could potentially harm natives of North America through invasion, disease, or other factors.|$|E
50|$|F. necrophorum {{is also a}} {{cause for}} {{lameness}} in sheep. Its infection is commonly called scald. It can last for several years on land used by either sheep or cattle, and is found on most land of this type throughout the world. Due to its survival length in these areas, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> try to remove it. Sheep most often get scald due to breakage or weakness of the skin surrounding the hoof. This can occur due to strong footbaths, sandy soils, mild frostbite, or prolongened waterlogging of a field, and results in denaturing of the skin between the cleats.|$|E
50|$|Others {{have argued}} that without taking into account both the {{architecture}} of the human brain, and embodiment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> replicate accurately the processes which take place during language acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic actions. There have thus been suggestions that while robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit from strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their processes and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in situated human-machine interaction, and that the concept of multisensory integration be extended to cover linguistic input and the complementary information combined from temporally coincident sensory impressions.|$|E
50|$|In Stammler's {{view the}} law {{should be seen as}} one of the {{regulating}} standards for the social economy, in which people cooperate to meet their needs through production and exchange of goods and services. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> wrong to think that law is made by arrangements to reduce economic pressure or conflicts, since the law is a fundamental to the existence of the economy.Stammler thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> wait for the law to eventually adjust itself to changes {{in the structure of the}} economy, as the Marxists would assert. The class struggle showed that the adjustments were not being made.If the law were constantly being adjusted to deal with new social stresses there would be no conflict.|$|R
50|$|Several {{potential}} barriers {{exist for}} employing sector-based work force development strategies.

25|$|Lavoisier {{urged the}} {{establishment}} of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unrealistic</b> <b>to</b> expect them to change their traditional practices.|$|R
