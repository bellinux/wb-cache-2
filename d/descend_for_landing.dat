40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} {{is to make a}} preliminary evaluation of the information derived from distinct modes of RADARSAT- 1 images (Standard and Fine) acquired over the Manaus city during different passes (ascending and <b>descending)</b> <b>for</b> <b>land</b> use and land cover mapping. In addition, aspects related to the influence of sensor (incidence angle, look-azimuth and spatial resolution) and target (surficial roughness, moisture, type of terrain, etc) were also evaluated. The chosen test-site is the Manaus city, capital of Amazonas State, Brazilian Amazon Region. The investigation has allowed to produce a semi-detailed map of the urban land use and <b>land</b> cover units <b>for</b> the Manaus area. This research has also shown that tone and texture were the dominant image attributes in the interpretation process, controlled by target (mainly surface roughness and moisture) and sensor parameters (look-azimuth, incidence angle and spatial resolution) which expressed distinct backscattering responses from the thematic classes.

5000|$|The article {{says that}} both the LSAM and the lunar CEV would carry a crew of four. Griffin has {{subsequently}} stated that the entire crew would descend to the lunar surface, leaving the CEV unoccupied.

The crew would return to the CEV and jettison the LSAM, and then the CEV's engine would put the crew on a course for Earth. Then, much like Apollo, the service module would be jettisoned and the CEV would <b>descend</b> <b>for</b> a <b>landing</b> via a system of three parachutes.

50|$|All {{fixed-wing}} aircraft have some capability to glide with no engine power; that is, {{they do not}} sink straight down like a stone, but rather continue to glide moving horizontally while <b>descending.</b> <b>For</b> example, with a glide ratio of 15:1, a Boeing 747-200 can glide for 150 km from a cruising altitude of 10,000 m. After a loss of power, the pilot’s goal is to fly the descending aircraft to the most suitable landing spot within gliding distance, and then land with {{the least amount of}} damage possible. The area open <b>for</b> potential <b>landing</b> sites depends on the original altitude, local terrain, the engine-out gliding capabilities of the aircraft, original airspeed and winds at various altitudes.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test whether {{rotational}} knee kinematics during dynamic pivoting activities are predictive of subjective functional outcome (IKDC, Lysholm), objective laxity scores (KT max), and activity levels (Tegner) in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Methods: Thirty-one patients with single-bundle ACLR were evaluated prospectively with 3 D-motion analysis during (1) descending a stairway and pivoting and (2) landing from a jump and pivoting. The side-to-side difference of tibial rotation range of motion (SSDTR) between the ACLR and the contralateral intact knee was calculated for the pivoting phase of each task. Linear regression models were applied with SSDTR, for each task predictors of the subjective IKDC score, Lysholm score, anterior tibial translation, and Tegner activity level. Results: SSDTR <b>for</b> <b>descending</b> and <b>landing</b> were predictive of the IKDC subjective score (R 2 = 0. 46, p < 0. 001 and R 2 = 0. 40, p < 0. 001, respectively) with "medium" effect sizes and of the Lysholm score (R 2 = 0. 13, p < 0. 05 and R 2 = 0. 09, n. s.) with "small" to "none" effect sizes. SSDTR was not predictive of anterior translation or Tegner activity level (n. s.). Conclusions: Restoring rotational kinematics during dynamic pivoting activities after ACLR is predictive of functional outcome. The ability of the athlete after ACLR to control tibial rotation during pivoting activities may be predictive of functional outcome. Level of evidence: Case series study.
