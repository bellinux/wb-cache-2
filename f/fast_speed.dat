25|$|Considered by the {{citizens}} of Georgia {{to be the most}} powerful Confederate warship because of its <b>fast</b> <b>speed</b> of 7 knots, as well as its armament of four Brooke rifles, the Atlanta was difficult to maneuver. Special difficulties were caused by its 16-feet draft in the shallow waters surrounding Savannah. Another problem was the scarce airflow of its tight, armored roof, which caused profound heat and humidity. The Atlanta suffered profuse leaking. The ship's helm was already difficult to steer because it was simply unwieldy: the ship frequently stalled into sand banks {{along the side of the}} river. Webb marshaled the CSS Atlanta, though, removing the boat of unnecessary comfort - including sanitation and ventilation, as well as fully outfitting it with weaponry. Webb also had to deal with inexperienced sailors, most of whom were recruited from the Confederate Army around the mountainous regions of Georgia. For instance, his pilots arrived just two weeks before the ship engaged in the Battle of Wassaw Sound.|$|E

500|$|After a few {{sessions}} in the Bahamas, engineer Rhett Davies left following {{an argument with}} the producer over the <b>fast</b> <b>speed</b> of recording. Steven Stanley, who since the age of17 had engineered for musicians such as Bob Marley, stepped in to cover the workload. He is credited by Frantz with helping create the track [...] "Once in a Lifetime", which was later released as a single. A Lexicon224 digital reverb effects unit, obtained by engineer and mixer Dave Jerden, was used on the album. The machine {{was one of the}} first of its kind and able to simulate environments such as echo chambers and rooms through interchangeable programs. Like Davies, Jerden was unhappy with the fast pace at which Eno wanted to record sonically complicated compositions, but did not complain. The basic tracks focused wholly on rhythms and were all performed in a minimalist method using only one chord. Each section was recorded as a long loop to enable the creation of compositions through the positioning or merging of loops in different ways.|$|E
500|$|After making landfall, the hurricane's <b>fast</b> <b>speed</b> enabled it {{to still}} bring strong winds and impacts well inland. In South-Central Texas, the {{tropical}} cyclone {{was considered the}} worst of the entire 20th century. On August30, despite being situated over the Austin and San Antonio metropolitan areas, the storm still retained maximum sustained winds of at least 50mph (80km/h). In Floresville, Texas, the winds damaged numerous buildings. Similar effects occurred in Atascosa County and Seguin, Texas, where trees were uprooted and additional buildings were damaged. [...] In Seguin, the passing storm was considered the worst since the 1886 Indianola hurricane, [...] which also moved rapidly inland. In New Braunfels, Texas, damage was confined to trees, while in Austin, Texas power lines were downed by the strong winds. San Antonio saw the brunt of the storm's impacts in South-Central Texas. Gusts reaching as high as 70mph (110km/h) battered the city for at least five hours, causing extensive damage to infrastructure, as well as causing numerous power outages. Hundreds of trees were uprooted, and the resulting damage was considered the worst since 1899. Despite being held to the ground by 8ft (2.4m) stakes, the strong winds still managed to damage 70of the 75planes at Alamo Field. Total estimated damages in the city amounted to $300,000.|$|E
