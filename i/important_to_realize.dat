25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{that the}} word problem is in fact {{solvable}} for many groups G. For example, polycyclic groups have solvable word problems since the normal form of an arbitrary word in a polycyclic presentation is readily computable; other algorithms for groups may, in suitable circumstances, also solve the word problem, see the Todd–Coxeter algorithm and the Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm. On the other hand {{the fact that a}} particular algorithm does not solve the word problem for a particular group does not show that the group has an unsolvable word problem. For instance Dehn's algorithm does not solve the word problem for the fundamental group of the torus. However this group is the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups and so has a solvable word problem.|$|E

40|$|Optimization of InAs {{critical}} {{coverage is}} <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>realizing</b> controlled growth in quantum dot devices. Substrate misorientation {{can change the}} value of critical coverage but also creates more uniform quantum dots in both size and distribution. Uniform quantum dots are advantageous in concentrator photovoltaic devices due to increases in sub bandgap response. Concentration photovoltaic devices are designed to compete on a cost per watt basis with other terrestrial photovoltaic devices. This benefit can only be utilized if the fabrication process is also cost effective. Concentration devices rely on dense thick Au grid finger design to reduce series resistance, which can add to processing costs. This work explores GaAs p-i-n photovoltaic devices grown via organometallic vapor phase epitaxy with InAs quantum dots using the Stranski-Krastanov growth method on substrates misoriented 6 ° off (100) in the [110] direction and 2 °off (100) in the [110] direction. Both preliminary test and devices structures were created in order to study device performance through external quantum efficiency, and current-voltage behavior, as well as material properties through atomic force microcopy and photoluminescence. Results of this work show that 2 ° [110] sample results in lower critical coverage {{as compared to the}} 6 ° [110] (approximately 1. 8 ML verses approximately 2. 1 ML). The 6 ° [110] substrate also showed a more uniform density and size distribution of QDs. In addition, the standard electroplating process was evaluated and improved for better metal adhesion and safer lab practices. Metal adhesion was improved and safer lab practices were implemented. Finally, concentration devices were fabricated using the new electroplating process and tested up to 600 suns at the NASA Glenn Research Center. These results are <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>realizing</b> the full benefits of QD structures such as increased optical absorption. Results show the baseline devices performed to the designed specification while more investigation in needed within the QD samples in order to evaluate the cause of increased internal series resistance...|$|R

Intermetallics are another class of refractory materials which may hold some promise for high-temperature microreactor development. In this paper, a new method of forming microchannel arrays from thin layers of intermetallics is demonstrated. This method has the advantage of eliminating volumetric shrinkage due to binder removal.

In this paper, the development of a comprehensive model of the longitudinal dynamics of generic hypersonic vehicle with an outward-turning, two-dimensional inlet is described.
