5|$|Shazly {{then went}} southward to 7th Division's {{bridgehead}} in Third Army's sector, where traffic was almost at a standstill. Shazly met with 7th division commander Brigadier General Badawy, who informed {{him of the}} bridge-laying problems experienced by 19th Division's engineers further south, leading all Third Army supplies and reinforcements to be sent over 7th Division's already congested bridges, creating a solid traffic jam. Despite Sunday's lull, the situation had not yet improved. This created complications, as soldiers and tank crews lost contact with their units and consequently <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> their designated positions. Many troops were low on supplies, and some even returned {{to the west bank}} of the canal to replenish their food and water supply.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film {{acquired}} the film {{rights of the}} Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film {{in order to keep}} the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled The Fantastic Four, had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{knew that}} Ott {{had no way}} out from Alessandria, but he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Melas's position. Following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the Austrian general might try to escape, Bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending Louis Desaix with Divisional General Jean Boudet's {{division}} (6,000 men) south to Novi Ligure and Divisional General Jean François Cornu de La Poype (3,500 men) north on the other bank of the Po. Further north, from Vercelli to Lake Maggiore, were stationed the divisions of Antoine de Béthencourt and Joseph Chabran and, further to the rear, north of Piacenza, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's division. Bonaparte's view was confirmed when General Claude Victor-Perrin, supported by Divisional General Joachim Murat’s cavalry, swiftly evicted FML Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough’s Austrian brigade from Marengo village that afternoon. Victor then deployed divisional generals Gaspard Amédée Gardanne and Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin's divisions along the Fontanone stream. Austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the French, {{but the lack of}} pontoons and time forced the Austrians to cross the river Bormida and then launch a single, direct assault across the Fontanone bridge.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E
5|$|Both Task Forces {{needed to}} refuel, but TF 17 {{finished}} first and Fletcher took Yorktown and her consorts northward toward the Solomon Islands on 2 May. TF 11 {{was ordered to}} rendezvous with TF 17 and TF 44, the old ANZAC Squadron, further west into the Coral Sea on 4 May. The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying Tulagi on 3 May. Alerted by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, Fletcher decided to attack Japanese shipping there the following day. The air strike on Tulagi confirmed {{that at least one}} American carrier was in the vicinity, but the Japanese <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> its location. They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans, but without result. One H6K flying boat spotted Yorktown, but was shot down by one of Yorktowns Wildcat fighters before she could radio a report. US Army Air Force (USAAF) aircraft spotted Shōhō southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May, but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers, which were refueling. That day, Fletcher received Ultra intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation Mo near Bougainville Island, and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion. It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May. Based on this information, Fletcher planned to complete refueling on 6 May and to move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea {{to be in a position}} to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May.|$|E

He testified that he was not aware of the existence of the technical capacity in Libya for monitoring this kind of storage, either during the epidemic or currently. Montagnier testified that during his first visit, the health authorities in Libya and the management of the Benghazi hospital showed serious concern over the infection, and that at the time they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the cause of the epidemic's spread.|$|E

Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E

25|$|Soult marched {{south on}} 30 January 1809, aiming for Portugal. After being {{repelled}} in his initial attempt {{to cross the}} Minho River in mid-February, his forces marched to Ourense and crossed the bridge there. Soult's cavalry crushed a Spanish brigade at La Trepa on 6 March and the II Corps entered Portugal on the 9th. At the Battle of Braga on 20 March, the French routed a Portuguese army consisting of a few regulars and 22,000 militia. The First Battle of Porto on the 29th was another lopsided French victory marked by terrible Portuguese loss of life. But despite being established in Porto, Soult found his communications cut by regular and irregular Portuguese forces under General Francisco Silveira and he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the whereabouts of Lapisse.|$|E
25|$|Nolte {{argued that}} the vast {{majority}} of Germans had no knowledge of the 'Holocaust while it was happening Nolte claimed that the genocide of the Jews was Hitler’s personal pet project, and that the Holocaust was the work of only a few Germans who were entirely unrepresentative of German society Contradicting the American historian Raul Hilberg, who claimed that hundreds of thousands of Germans were complicit in the Holocaust, from high-ranking bureaucrats to railway clerks and locomotive conductors, Nolte {{argued that the}} functional division of labour in modern society meant that most people in Germany <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how they were assisting in genocide. In support of this, Nolte cited the voluminous memoirs of German generals and Nazi leaders, such as Albert Speer, who claimed to have no idea that their country was engaging in genocide during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Now without {{income and}} any {{prospect}} {{of returning to}} Yugoslavia, Peter II and Alexandra resolved to leave Claridge's Hotel {{and moved to a}} mansion in the Borough of Runnymede. Abandoned by the British government, they settled for a time in France, between Paris and Monte Carlo, then in Switzerland at St. Moritz. Increasingly penniless, they ended up leaving Europe and in 1949, they settled in New York City, where the former King hoped to complete a financial project. Still penniless, the couple was forced to sell Alexandra's necklace of emeralds and others pieces of her jewelry to pay their accumulated debts. In addition to these difficulties was {{the fact that they were}} unable to manage a budget. As she herself wrote in her autobiography, Alexandra <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the value of things and she quickly proved incapable of maintaining a home.|$|E

25|$|Murray {{noted in}} his diary (25 August) that GHQ had moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin and that I Corps was being heavily engaged by night – making no mention of what II Corps were up to. When 4th Division arrived (25 August) Snow’s orders were to help prepare a {{defensive}} position on the Cambrai-Le Cateau position, as GHQ <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the seriousness of the}} situation facing II Corps. 4th Division was eventually able to participate in the Battle of Le Cateau. The news that Smith-Dorrien planned to stand and fight at Le Cateau reached GHQ at 5am on 26 August – French was woken from his sleep, and insisting that Murray not be woken, sent Smith-Dorrien an ambiguous message that he had “a free hand as to the method” by which he fell back, which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to fight.|$|E
25|$|Since those {{involved}} with the production <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure. Nine other puppets—including Santa and young Rudolph—were given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded. In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic. Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project. The figures have been shown at conventions since then.|$|E
25|$|The abbey {{was large}} and {{important}} among Augustinian houses and seems to have reached a zenith under Henry III. However, it was also from this time that it sometimes overstepped or abused its privileges. In 1221, for example, a jury at Shrewsbury complained that a servant of the abbot, Anian from Preston Gubbals, had been caught red-handed with loot from a robbery but had been extracted from gaol so that the abbot could try him in his own court. The jurors <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the outcome of the}} case. However, relations with royal authority were generally good. In 1242 the king sent the abbot, then Richard of Shrewsbury, a gratuity of 20 marks. Three years later Henry stayed at the abbey on his way to Chester and the abbot gave 40 shillings towards the marriage of the infant Princess Margaret. Around the same time, a jury commissioned by John Biset, Justice in Eyre, decided the abbot need not expeditate his dogs (i.e. remove their claws), as his lands were originally of the royal demesne.|$|E
