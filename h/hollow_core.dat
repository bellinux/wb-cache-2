5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the <b>hollow</b> <b>core,</b> as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E

Comparison between the ORR catalytic {{activity of the}} electrocatalysts with <b>hollow</b> <b>cores</b> and those of Pt solid and Pt hollow nanoparticles has been obtained using the rotating disk electrode technique.

25|$|The rock {{comprising}} {{the bulk of}} a boulder is riddled with large cracks called septaria that radiate outward from a <b>hollow</b> <b>core</b> lined with scalenohedral calcite crystals. The process or processes that created septaria within Moeraki Boulders, and in other septarian concretions, remain an unresolved matter for which {{a number of possible}} explanations have been proposed. These cracks radiate and thin outward from the centre of the typical boulder and are typically filled with an outer (early stage) layer of brown calcite and an inner (late stage) layer of yellow calcite spar, which often, but not always, completely fills the cracks. Rare Moeraki Boulders have a very thin innermost (latest stage) layer of dolomite and quartz covering the yellow calcite spar.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the cold-box process uses a binder that is {{hardened}} {{through the use}} of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. amine gas) or odorous (i.e. SO2), so special handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that <b>hollow</b> <b>core</b> can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is sodium silicate which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.|$|E

ILM built miniatures in various scales, with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot.

The cockpit windows were made from faceted glass so that accurate reflections could be filmed.

2500|$|Starting in 1844, Rodman {{began running}} {{experiments}} {{to overcome the}} size limitations of cast iron cannon due {{to the way they}} were made. Up to that time, all cannon barrels made of iron were cast solid and then cooled only on their outside, resulting in uneven cooling when the metal contracted toward the barrel's outer surface. This process also [...] "created internal strains and structural irregularities," [...] and these problems were even more prevalent in large bore castings, especially on any actual openings in the cannon that were designed. Made in this way, the cannons could crack during the cooling process, break apart during shipment, or worse burst as they were fired. Although it took him years, Rodman developed a way to solve these drawbacks. He found that if he cast the iron around a <b>hollow</b> <b>core</b> and then applied a steady stream of water within the barrel for cooling, a much more reliable and stronger product was made. His method, and the result, has been described as: [...] "Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Rodman's manufacturing method, now known as the 'wet chill process', forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior." [...] Doing this forced the thickest material {{toward the center of the}} barrel, and Rodman would then patent this invention.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary device}} was a COBRA Deuterium-Tritium gas-boosted atomic bomb made by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, a very compact MK 7 device. This boosted fission device was {{tested in the}} Upshot Knothole Climax event and yielded [...] (out of 50–70 kt {{expected}} yield range), so that the planned operation Domino could be cancelled before the coming presidential election. The implosion system was quite lightweight at , because it eliminated the aluminium pusher shell around the tamper and used the more compact ring lenses, a design feature shared with the Mark 5, 12, 13 and 18 designs. The explosive material of the inner charges (I.C. for short) in the MK 7 was changed to the more powerful Cyclotol 75/25, instead of the Composition B used in most stockpiled bombs at that time, as Cyclotol 75/25 was denser than Composition B and thus could generate {{the same amount of}} explosive force in a smaller volume (it actually provided 13% more compressive energy than Comp B). The composite uranium-plutonium COBRA core was levitated in a type-D pit. COBRA was Los Alamos most recent end-product of design work on the very important [...] "new principles" [...] of the <b>hollow</b> <b>core.</b> A copper pit liner encased within the weapon-grade plutonium inner capsule prevented DT gas diffusion in plutonium, a technique first tested in Greenhouse Item.

2500|$|Paxton's roofing system {{incorporated}} his elegant {{solution to}} the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering - a patented design now widely known as a [...] "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a <b>hollow</b> <b>core,</b> allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.|$|E
