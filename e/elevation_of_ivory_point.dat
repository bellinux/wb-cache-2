40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} {{the origin of the}} diamond shaped pattern and composition <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> <b>of</b> the African elephant. Fragments <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> and tusks were obtained through the National Parks Board from the Kruger Park, Addo Elephant Park, Kaokoveld, Caprivi, Etosha, Kavango and Tembe Elephant Park. Polished surfaces were prepared in different planes and examined with light and electron microscopical techniques. Analyses of the inorganic composition were performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, ion selective electrodes and inductively coupled optical emission spectroscopy. The total amino acid composition was determined with the aid of an amino acid analyser. Morphological investigations showed the distinctive diamond shaped pattern <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> to be caused by the sinusoidal surface to pulpal course followed by odontoblastic tubules. This course is the result of pressure which builds up between tightly packed odontoblasts on their centripetal course along an ever decreasing pulpal circumference during formation <b>of</b> <b>ivory.</b> A total <b>of</b> 17 elements were detected in the inorganic fraction <b>of</b> <b>ivory,</b> some in concentrations as low as 0. 25 ^g/g. The concentrations of calcium, magnesium, fluoride, cobalt and zinc showed statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0. 007) between selected regions and may prove valuable in distinguishing chemically between ivory from different geographical locations.
