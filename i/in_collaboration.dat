40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{localization}} of <b>collaboration</b> <b>in</b> knowledge creation {{by using the}} data on Japanese patent applications. Applying distance-based methods, we obtained the following results. First, collaborations are significantly localized at the 5 % level with a localization range of approximately 100 km. Second, the localization of <b>collaboration</b> is observed <b>in</b> most technologies. Third, the extent of localization was stable from 1986 – 2005 despite extensive developments in information and communications technology that facilitate communication between remote organizations. Fourth, the extent of localization is substantially greater <b>in</b> inter-firm <b>collaborations</b> than <b>in</b> intra-firm <b>collaborations.</b> Furthermore, <b>in</b> inter-firm <b>collaborations,</b> the extent of localization is greater <b>in</b> <b>collaborations</b> with small firms. This result suggests that geographic proximity mitigates the firm-border effects <b>in</b> <b>collaborations,</b> especially for small firms. 基盤研究(S) = Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} factors {{affecting}} firms’ decisions concerning whether {{to collaborate with}} universities in their region or elsewhere, {{and the level of}} investment <b>in</b> the <b>collaboration.</b> Building upon an original survey of a representative sample of firms in the Italian region of Piedmont, the paper examines the effect of firm and collaboration characteristics (including the type and diversity of each collaboration’s objectives) on the location of the university partners and on the investment <b>in</b> university-industry <b>collaborations.</b> We find that firms that are smaller, less engaged in international markets, less vertically integrated, and that engage <b>in</b> <b>collaborations</b> with universities <b>in</b> order to solve organizational problems, tend to collaborate more with regional universities. Firms tend to invest more <b>in</b> <b>collaborations</b> focused only on R&D activities with nearby universities, though the maximum amount spent <b>in</b> a <b>collaboration</b> was with a foreign university. ...|$|R
