The B's eastward extension to Holborn {{to connect to}} the GN was permitted, but the extension to Parsons Green was rejected following objections from hospitals in the Fulham Road, which were concerned that vibrations from trains might affect their patients. The B link from Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross was rejected {{on the grounds that}} it involved sharp turns and steep gradients to avoid public buildings in the area. The merger with the GN and name change were permitted. The GN's extension to Temple was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk who owned the land under which it would have run. The abandonment of the route north of Finsbury Park was permitted.|$|E

Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
