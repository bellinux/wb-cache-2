40|$|Abstract Background Determining the {{mechanisms}} by which transposable elements move within a genome increases {{our understanding of how}} they can shape genome evolution. Class 2 transposable elements transpose via a 'cut-and-paste' mechanism mediated by a transposase that binds to sites at or near the ends of the transposon. <b>Herves</b> {{is a member of the}} hAT superfamily of class 2 transposons and was isolated from Anopheles gambiae, a medically important mosquito species that is the major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. <b>Herves</b> is transpositionally active and intact copies of it are found in field populations of A gambiae. In this study we report the binding activities of the <b>Herves</b> transposase to the sequences at the ends of the <b>Herves</b> transposon and compare these to other sequences recognized by hAT transposases isolated from other organisms. Results We identified the specific DNA-binding sites of the <b>Herves</b> transposase. Active <b>Herves</b> transposase was purified using an Escherichia coli expression system and bound in a site-specific manner to the subterminal and terminal sequences of the left and right ends of the element, respectively, and also interacted with the right but not the left terminal inverted repeat. We identified a common subterminal DNA-binding motif (CG/AATTCAT) that is critical and sufficient for <b>Herves</b> transposase binding. Conclusions The <b>Herves</b> transposase binds specifically to a short motif located at both ends of the transposon but shows differential binding with respect to the left and right terminal inverted repeats. Despite similarities in the overall structures of hAT transposases, the regions to which they bind in their respective transposons differ in sequence ensuring the specificity of these enzymes to their respective transposon. The asymmetry with which the <b>Herves</b> terminal inverted repeats are bound by the transposase may indicate that these differ in their interactions with the enzyme. </p...|$|R

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} are being considered as genetic drive agents for introducing phenotype-altering genes into populations of vectors of human disease. The dynamics of endogenous elements will assist {{in predicting the}} behavior of introduced elements. Transposable element display was used to estimate the site-occupancy frequency distribution of <b>Herves</b> in six populations of Anopheles gambiae s. s. The site-occupancy distribution {{data suggest that the}} element has been recently active within the sampled populations. All 218 individuals sampled contained at least one copy of <b>Herves</b> with a mean of 3. 6 elements per diploid genome. No significant differences in copy number were observed among populations. Nucleotide polymorphism within the element was high (π = 0. 0079 in noncoding sequences and 0. 0046 in coding sequences) relative to that observed in some of the more well-studied elements in Drosophila melanogaster. In total, 33 distinct forms of <b>Herves</b> were found {{on the basis of the}} sequence of the first 528 bp of the transposase open reading frame. Only two forms were found in all six study populations. Although <b>Herves</b> elements in An. gambiae are quite diverse, 85 % of the individuals examined had evidence of complete forms of the element. Evidence was found for the lateral transfer of <b>Herves</b> from an unknown source into the An. gambiae lineage prior to the diversification of the An. gambiae species complex. The characteristics of <b>Herves</b> in An. gambiae are somewhat unlike those of P elements in D. melanogaster...|$|R

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} {{have proven}} to be invaluable tools for genetically manipulating a wide variety of plants, animals, and microbes. Some have suggested that they could be used to spread desirable genes, such as refractoriness to Plasmodium infection, through target populations of Anopheles gambiae, thereby disabling the mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. To achieve this, a transposon must remain mobile and intact after the initial introduction into the genome. Endogenous, active class II transposable elements from An. gambiae have not been exploited as gene vectors/drivers because none have been isolated. We report the discovery of an active class II transposable element, <b>Herves,</b> from the mosquito An. gambiae. <b>Herves</b> is a member of a distinct subfamily of hAT elements that includes the hopper-we element from Bactrocera dorsalis and B. cucurbitae. <b>Herves</b> was transpositionally active in mobility assays performed in Drosophila melanogaster S 2 cells and developing embryos and was used as a germ-line transformation vector in D. melanogaster. <b>Herves</b> displays an altered target-site preference from the distantly related hAT elements, Hermes and hobo. <b>Herves</b> is also present in An. arabiensis and An. merus with copy numbers similar to that found in An. gambiae. Preliminary data from an East African population are consistent with the element being transpositionally active in mosquitoes...|$|R

5|$|John von Neumann, {{working with}} Oskar Morgenstern {{on the theory}} of games, broke new {{mathematical}} ground in 1944 by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed-point theory to economic analysis. Their work thereby avoided the traditional differential calculus, for which the maximum–operator {{did not apply to}} non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in cooperative game theory, game theorists Lloyd S. Shapley, Martin Shubik, <b>Hervé</b> Moulin, Nimrod Megiddo, Bezalel Peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the fair prices in cooperative games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.|$|E

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} are DNA sequences {{with a unique}} ability to change their genomic location. Transposable {{elements are}} fascinating because {{of their ability to}} move, and their ubiquitous presence and contribution to the evolution of all prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Their mobility properties have made them extremely useful as molecular tools in the laboratory. Transposable elements have also been proposed to be useful as genetic drive agents to introduce phenotype-altering genes in natural populations of mosquitoes, to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Presented in this thesis are studies on the behavior and evolution of two endogenous Class II transposable elements, <b>Herves</b> and Topi in natural populations of Anopheles gambiae, a species seriously being considered for population modification using genetic manipulation. In Chapters 2 and 4, results from the analysis of copy number, activity, and nucleotide sequence as well as structural diversity of <b>Herves</b> and Topi elements, respectively in 5 - 6 An. gambiae populations in Africa are described. In Chapter 3, studies to identify and assess the activity of the natural variants of <b>Herves</b> transposase in An. gambiae are described. 	 The results from these studies show that both <b>Herves</b> and Topi elements have long histories in An. gambiae with Topi present in An. gambiae earlier than <b>Herves.</b> <b>Herves,</b> but not Topi, is still active in natural populations of An. gambiae with more than one active form of <b>Herves</b> transposase responsible for its activity. Both the elements, despite their long history in An. gambiae, have a very high percentage of individuals with complete forms of the element. This observation is an unusual feature of these elements, which would not be predicted for elements with such a long history. The presence of complete and active forms of <b>Herves</b> and Topi, elements with long histories in An. gambiae, argues against the possibility of rapid accumulation of deleted forms of transposable elements as a general feature of their evolution. 	 Better understanding of the behavior and evolution of Class II transposable elements in An. gambiae shows that Class II transposable elements still hold promise as a genetic drive agent for this particular species...|$|R

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter <b>Hervé</b> Bazin on February 9, 1929, {{was a turning}} point that {{marked the beginning of the}} VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) and RNA interference (RNAi) {{are excellent}} genetic tools {{that could help}} control the incidence and spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, etc. This study aimed to 1) understand the RNAi mechanism in Culex quinquefasciatus, which {{will be used to}} study genes involved in pathogen transmission and will help reveal role of RNAi in antiviral immunity in this species; and 2) characterize the DNA sequences that regulate <b>Herves</b> transposase binding, which will help us understand its pre- and post-integration behavior within the host. By using the white eye-pigmentation gene as a marker for RNAi function we demonstrated that introducing dsRNA into embryos of Cx. quinquefasciatus induces a specific functional RNAi response, which silenced the white gene, consequently allowing a white-eye phenotype to be produced in the hatched larvae and adults. Sequence-specific knockdown of key RNAi components was achieved by introducing the homologous dsRNA into embryos of Cx. quinquefasciatus. We found ago 2 -mediated slicing to be more critical than dcr 2 -mediated dicing for the functional RNAi response in Cx. quinquefasciatus. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the previously reported results that RNAi components for small RNA biogenesis are present in Cx. quinquefasciatus. In addition, we found important differences in the number and the expression of ago genes, the predicted domain architecture of Dcr, and the RNAi response between Cx. quinquefasciatus and the model organism D. melanogaster. Transposition of Class II TEs is regulated by both cis-acting sequences and trans-acting host factors. In this study, we used purified <b>Herves</b> transposase to characterize the specific DNA-binding sites of the <b>Herves</b> transposase. The purified active <b>Herves</b> transposase showed site-specific binding to the subterminal and terminal sequences of the L- and R- ends of the element, respectively. Furthermore, the transposase bound strongly with the R-TIR but failed to bind to the L-TIR.
