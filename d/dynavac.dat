40|$|The Demonstration Model (DM) Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) {{was tested}} at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) during September and October, 1999. The LHP system {{was placed in}} the <b>Dynavac</b> 36 in. chamber in Building 4. The test lasted for about 6 weeks. The LHP was built, designed, and {{manufactured}} at Dynatherm Corporation, Inc. In Hunt Valley, MD according to GSFC specifications. The purpose of the test was to evaluate the performance of a propylene LHP for the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) instrument application...|$|E
30|$|Four substrata {{surfaces}} {{were analyzed}} using SEM to demonstrate the versatility of the technique: 150  nm-thick thin titanium films (prepared as described previously (Wang et al., 2008), dragonfly (Hemianax papuensis) wings, standard polystyrene petri plates (Cellstar, Greiner Bio-One) and silicon wafers. Prior to analysis, all samples were rinsed with 70 % ethanol and then MilliQ H 2 O, except {{in the case of}} the dragonfly wings, which were rinsed with water, as ethanol would damage the waxy surface structures of the wing. The dragonfly wings and small excised pieces of polystyrene were also coated with ~ 10  nm of gold using a <b>Dynavac</b> CS 300 prior to electron microscopy in order to make the surfaces conductive (Mitik-Dineva et al., 2009; Truong et al., 2009).|$|E
30|$|Sodium nitrite (10  mM) {{dissolved}} in 50  mM PBS (pH  7.4) was mixed with glucose 50  mg/mL. The THCPSi NPs were then {{added to this}} buffer solution at different concentrations (ranging from 0.05 to 0.2  mg/mL). Subsequently, the suspension was sonicated for 5  min to ensure particle dispersion and then stirred for 2  h. Upon NO incorporation, the THCPSi NPs were centrifuged at 8, 000 RCF for 10  min for collection. Finally, after removing the supernatant, the THCPSi NP pellet was dried by heating at 65 °C overnight. The drying temperature was held at 70 °C to avoid glucose caramelization [23, 33, 34]. An alternative drying procedure, overnight lyophilization (FD 1 freeze dryer, <b>Dynavac</b> Co., MA, USA), was also assessed, {{as described in the}} text [23].|$|E
