40|$|The main {{components}} of the LHC, the next world-class facility in high-energy physics, are the twin-aperture high-field superconducting cryomagnets to be installed in the existing 26. 7 -km long tunnel. After installation and alignment, the cryomagnets have to be interconnected. The interconnections must ensure the continuity of several functions: vacuum enclosures, beam pipe image currents (RF contacts), cryogenic circuits, electrical power supply, and thermal insulation. In the machine, about 1700 interconnections between cryomagnets are necessary. The interconnections constitute a unique system that is nearly entirely assembled in the tunnel. For each of them, various operations must be done: TIG welding of cryogenic channels (~ 50 000 welds), induction soldering of main superconducting cables (~ 10 000 joints), ultrasonic welding of auxiliary superconducting cables (~ 20 000 welds), mechanical assembly of various elements, and installation of the multi-layer insulation (~ 200 000 m 2). Defective junctions could be very difficult and expensive to detect and repair. Reproducible and reliable processes must be implemented together with a strict quality control. The interconnection activities are optimized taking into account several constraints: limited space availability, tight installation schedule, high level of quality, high reliability and economical aspects. In this paper, the functions to be fulfilled by the interconnections and the various technologies selected are presented. Quality control at different levels (component/ interconnect, subsystem, system) is also described. The <b>interconnection</b> <b>assembly</b> sequences are summarized.

40|$|Considerable {{interest}} {{exists in}} the process known as the pin-in-paste, or the Alternative Assembly and Reflow Technology (AART) process. The AART process allows for the simultaneous reflow of both odd-form and through hole devices as well as surface mount components. This process has several advantages over the typical mixed technology process sequence that includes wave soldering and/or hand soldering, often in addition to reflow soldering. The advantages include, {{but are not limited}} to, the following: multiple operations can be condensed into one comprehensive process; fewer pieces of equipment, materials, and personnel are necessary; a reduction in cost and cycle time can be realized; the high defect rate associated with wave soldering may be reduced; and it eliminates one or more thermal process steps thereby improving solderability, electronic component reliability, etc. Numerous issues must be considered before implementing a high-yield AART process. A high-yield process requires a scientific understanding and a systematic examination of materials, design, and process related factors on proper <b>interconnection</b> formation and <b>assembly</b> reliability. For example, solder paste selection and component resin choice are important material characteristics. Component body design and stencil aperture design are critical parameters in the design area.

40|$|The {{integration}} and miniaturization {{trend of the}} electronic packaging leads to much finer pitch of the device and package lead terminations. Several reliability concerns and issues that were previously not encountered are now surfacing. The objective of this thesis work is to investigate {{the reliability of the}} package-to-board interconnection from the perspective of solder joint metallurgy. It was carried out with several advanced packages such as CSP, WLCSP and leadless ceramic packages on organic laminate PWBs using tin-silver-copper based <b>interconnection</b> materials. The <b>assemblies</b> were subjected to several loading conditions and levels such as thermal, mechanical, and environmental stresses. As expected, the board level reliability (BLR) of electronic assemblies strongly depended on microstructure and morphology of the solder joints. Dispersion strengthening effect of the intermetallic compounds (IMCs), coarsening of the IMC particles, strain rate hardening, solder fatigue, and recrystallization of Sn grains in the highly stressed areas were observed. These were found to directly impact Pb-free solder joint reliability. Appropriate thermal aging can improve joint reliability up to 50 % due to coarsening of the IMC particles. In addition, other factors such as dissolution of metals, interfacial reactions, IMC spalling, and cross interaction of surface materials on {{the two sides of the}} joints were also observed and discussed. The effects can be expressed as a series of interactive relationships: materials (pad surface materials and solder alloy composition) and/or soldering process lead to microstructure change in bulk solder and/or at interface, which in turn leads to joint reliability variation...|$|R
40|$|Submitted {{on behalf}} of EDA Publishing Association ([URL] audienceA new ISM (image sensor module) WLP (wafer level package) for reflow process is designed, {{fabricated}} and tested. The ISM WLP is composed of polymer bonding layer, glass cap wafer for particle free process and CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) chip wafer which has micro via hole interconnection. During the last decades, WLP is highlighted as the next generation ISM Package method for many advantages like high yield (particle free process), small form factor (3 D <b>interconnection),</b> low <b>assembly</b> cost and so on. Nevertheless these benefits, there are some problems like micro via hole fabrication, low temperature insulation process (inside hole), bottom side oxide etching, warpage control according to wafer level bonding using different material, and whole process temperature limitation for micro lens damage. Among various fabrication methods for ISM package, COB (Chip on board), COF (Chip on film), and L, T contact WLP from ShellCase are generally used. In case of COB and COF package, it has difficulty in particle control during assembly process. In case of ShellCase type WLP has very complicated fabrication process. Additionally, most of above package has disadvantage in size point of view. Through suggested ISM WLP using through interconnection via, wafer level fabrication & packaging technology is realized. It can not only solve problems of conventional packaging structures but also tremendously reduce the manufacturing & assembly cost (include time) of ISM package and realize real chip scale package. Based on sensor size, 3. 67 X 3. 42 X 0. 39 (H) mm 3 WLP is designed. During the parametric study using commercial 3 -D simulation programs, silicon thickness, polymer bonding layer thickness, and glass thickness were chose the effective factor. And considering the optical and electrical analysis, we decide the parameter : silicon thickness is 0. 1 mm, polymer bonding layer thickness is 0. 04 mm, and glass thickness is 0. 25 mm.

40|$|The identification, {{adoption}} and utilisation of reliable <b>interconnection</b> technology to <b>assembly</b> crystalline silicon solar cells in photovoltaic (PV) module {{are critical to}} ensure that the device performs continually up to 20 years of its design life span. With report that 40. 7 % of this type of PV module fails at interconnection coupled with recent reports of increase in such failure in the tropics, the review of interconnection technologies employed in crystalline silicon solar cells manufacture has become imperative. Such review is capable of providing information that can improve the reliability of the system when adopted which in turn will increase silicon PV module production share more than the current value of 90. 956 %. This review presents the characteristics of interconnect contacts in conventional cells and other unconventional crystalline silicon cells. It compares series resistance, shadowing losses and the induced thermo-mechanical stress in the interconnection for each interconnection technique employed. The paper also reviews interconnection technologies in these assemblies and presents a comparison of their concept, cell type, joint type, manufacturing techniques and production status. Moreover, the study reviews and discusses the material and technological reliability challenges of silicon solar cells interconnection. The review identifies laser soldering technology as one which has the potential of making interconnection with higher reliability when compared with conventional soldering technology. It was found that this technology supports the current design trend of thinner, wider and cheaper crystalline silicon solar cells significantly whilst producing interconnection that experience relatively lower induced thermo-mechanical stress. The authors recommend that wider acceptance and usage of laser soldering technology could improve the performance and consequently extend the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of photovoltaic modules in general and particularly the ones which operates in the tropics.

40|$|Purpose - In {{the past}} 15 years {{stretchable}} electronic circuits {{have emerged as}} a new technology {{in the domain of}} <b>assembly,</b> <b>interconnections</b> and sensor circuits and assembly technologies. In the meantime a wide variety of processes with the use of many different materials have been explored in this new field. The purpose of the current contribution is for the authors to present an approach for stretchable circuits which is inspired by conventional rigid and flexible printed circuit board (PCB) technology. Two variants of this technology are presented: stretchable circuit board (SCB) and stretchable mould interconnect (SMI). Design/methodology/approach - Similarly as in PCB 17 or 35 Am thick sheets of electrodeposited or rolled-annealed Cu are structured to form the conductive tracks, and off-the-shelf, standard packaged, rigid components are assembled on the Cu contact pads using lead-free solder materials and reflow processes. Stretchability is obtained by shaping the Cu tracks not as straight lines, like in normal PCB design, but as horseshoe shaped meanders. Instead of rigid or flexible board materials, elastic materials, predominantly PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), are used to embed the conductors and the components, thus serving as circuit carrier. The authors include some mechanical modeling and design considerations, aimed at the optimization of the build-up and combination of elastic, flexible and rigid materials towards minimal stress and maximum mechanical reliability in the structures. Furthermore, details on the two production processes are given, reliability findings are summarised, and a number of functional demonstrators, realized with the technologies, are described. Findings - Key conclusions of the work are that: supporting the metal meanders with a flexible carrier prior to embedding in an elastic substrate substantially increases the reliability under mechanical stress (cyclic uniaxial stretching) of the stretchable interconnect and the transition areas between rigid components and stretchable interconnects are the zones which are most sensitive to failure under mechanical stress. Careful design and technology implementation is necessary, providing a gradual transition from rigid to flexible to stretchable parts of the circuit. Originality/value - Technologies for stretchable circuits, with the same level of similarity to standard PCB manufacturing and assembly, and thus with the same high potential for transfer to an industrial environment and for mass production, have not been shown before...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{high-performance}} computing {{systems have been}} driving the need for advanced packaging solutions such as high-density 2. 5 D interposer packages with escalating pitch, performance, and reliability requirements for off-chip interconnections. The objectives of this research are to design, develop and demonstrate novel, manufacturable, solder-based <b>interconnection</b> and <b>assembly</b> technologies at 20 µm pitch, addressing the scalability limitations of conventional Cu pillars in terms of thermomechanical reliability, thermal stability and power-handling capability. Pitch scaling with solders {{is accompanied by a}} necessary reduction in solder volume and subsequent increase in the volumetric contribution of intermetallics, raising serious concerns for stress management and reliability. Fine control of interfacial reactions is, therefore, key in extending solder-based interconnections to finer pitches and constitutes the first challenge addressed in this thesis. Intermetallic formation is primarily governed by the assembly process and the surface metallurgy that reacts with the solder, with the specific challenges and associated research tasks defined below. From assembly perspective, pitch scaling brings a shift from conventional reflow to thermocompression bonding. Leading-edge TC-NCP (thermocompression with non-conductive paste) processes, first established by Amkor, have shown high promises for fine-pitch assembly at 40 µm pitch and below. Through dynamic control of the temperature gradient in the assembled package, TC-NCP enables shorter reaction times and improved solder collapse and assembly yield. However, thermocompression processes inherently have to be customized for any given package design, with no existing guidelines for process design. A fundamental understanding of TC-NCP is, therefore, required to design thermal and force profiles that provide accurate control over the reaction. This is the objective of the first research task. Finite element modeling of the heat transfer in TC assembly considering tool – materials – package interactions was first established and validated experimentally to provide guidelines for optimization of assembly profiles. The developed methodology was applied to design the bonding profiles used to build all specimens in this thesis. This research also enabled the first demonstration of thermocompression assembly on high-density, ultra-thin glass substrates. Intermetallic growth in solder interconnection systems has also been traditionally controlled through the reacting surface metallurgy applied on the substrate pads. Over the last decade, standard ENEPIG (electroless Ni – electroless Pd – immersion Au) finish has been the metallurgy of choice in high-end applications for its outstanding reliability. However, the typically high thicknesses of Ni in ENEPIG limits its pitch scalability and degrades its high-frequency performance. Novel, Ni-free, metallic surface finishes are, therefore, required {{to meet the needs of}} emerging high-performance systems and form reliable interconnections at 20 µm pitch with less than 10 µm solder height. With such limited solder volume, risks of Au embrittlement and subsequent joints failure are also increased. The second research task addresses these challenges with the design of a new metallurgical system for reliable, ultra-short Cu pillar interconnections, based on the novel electroless Pd autocatalytic Au (EPAG) finish supplied by Atotech GmbH. The EPAG composition was optimized based on a comprehensive study including wettability testing, analysis of interfacial reactions, shear testing and thermal cycling. The optimal finish composition yielded a unique reaction with formation of a single intermetallic, resistant to Au embrittlement. Cu pillar assemblies with the optimized EPAG composition exhibited a 3 x improvement in fatigue life compared to assemblies with standard ENEPIG with less than 10 µm solder height, demonstrating potential scalability of the Cu pillar technology to 20 µm pitch. With further reduction in solder volume to achieve finer pitches, the solder is expected to fully react into intermetallics, if not during chip-level assembly itself, then during subsequent process steps. Solid-liquid interdiffusion (SLID) bonding has been proposed and extensively researched as an alternative technology to form all-intermetallic joints with improved pitch scalability, power handling capability and thermal stability. However, the adoption of existing SLID technologies has been limited to date due to reliability concerns, notably related to voiding, and manufacturability and cost challenges due to low assembly throughput. This last technical challenge was addressed in the third research task with the design and demonstration of a void-free, manufacturable SLID technology. In the proposed metastable SLID technology, the Cu 6 Sn 5 metastable phase was isolated using Ni diffusion barrier layers, enabling full conversion into void-free intermetallics with highest interdiffusion rates. Metastable SLID was demonstrated, for the first time, at pitches down to 20 µm on Si and glass substrates, with superior shear strength of 90 MPa, outstanding electromigration resistance at 105 A/cm 2, good thermal stability after 1000 h high temperature storage at 200 ℃ and excellent thermomechanical reliability.

40|$|The PhD {{activity}} {{described in}} this Thesis {{was focused on the}} study of metal-oxide wide-bandgap materials, aiming at fabricating new optoelectronic devices such as solar-blind UV photodetectors, high power electronics, and gas sensors. Photocurrent spectroscopy and DC photocurrent time evolution were used to investigate the performance of prototypes under different atmospheres, temperatures and excitation wavelengths (or dark conditions). Cathodoluminescence, absorption spectroscopy, XRD and SEM were used to assess structural, morphologic, electrical and optical properties of materials. This thesis is divided into two main sections, each describing the work done on a different metal-oxide semiconductor. 1) 	MOVPE-grown Ga 2 O 3 thin films for UV solar-blind photodetectors and high power devices The semiconducting oxides, among them Ga 2 O 3, have been employed for several decades as transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrodes for fabrication of solar cells, displays, electronic, and opto-electronic devices. The interest was mainly confined to such applications, as these materials tend to grow intrinsically n-type, and attempts to get an effective p-type doping has consistently failed. The key requirements of TCO electrodes are indeed high electrical conductivity and good transparency, while crystallographic perfection is a minor issue. Furthermore, for a long period no high-quality substrates and epi-layers were available, which in turn impeded the development of a truly full-oxide electronics. Recently, Ga 2 O 3 has attracted renewed interest, as large single crystals and high-quality homo- and hetero-epitaxial layers became available, which paved the way to novel application areas. Our research group spent the last two years in developing a low temperature (500 - 700 °C) MOVPE growth procedure to obtain thin films of Ga 2 O 3 on different substrates (Dept. of Physics and IMEM-CNR at UNIPR). We obtained a significant result growing on oriented sapphire epitaxial films of high crystalline, undoped, pure phase -Ga 2 O 3 (hexagonal). The crystallographic properties of this phase were investigated by XRD, in order to clarify the lattice parameters of the hexagonal cell. First design and development of solar blind UV photodetectors based on -phase was carried out and the optoelectronic performance is evaluated by means of photocurrent spectroscopy. The UV-response is adequately fast and reliable to render this unusual phase a subject of great interest for future applications. The availability of a hexagonal phase of Ga 2 O 3 stable up to 700 °C, belonging to the same space group of gallium nitride, with high crystallinity and tunable electrical properties, is intriguing in view of the development of nitride-based devices, by taking advantage of the more favorable symmetry and epitaxial relationships with respect to the monoclinic β-phase. In addition, annealing at temperatures higher than 700 °C demonstrate that the hexagonal phase converts totally in the monoclinic one. 2) 	ZnO nano-tetrapods: charge transport mechanisms and time-response in optoelectronic devices and sensors Size and morphology of ZnO at the nanometer scale {{play a key role in}} tailoring its physical and chemical properties. Thanks to the possibility of growing zinc oxide in a variety of different nanostructures, there is a great variety of applications, among which gas sensors, light emitting diodes, transparent conducting oxides, solar cells. Even if the operation of ZnO nanostructure-based devices has been recently demonstrated, the mechanisms of charge transport in these assembly is still under debate. The candidate performed an accurate investigation by photocurrent spectroscopy and DC-photocurrent time evolution of electrical response of both single-tetrapod and tetrapod-assembly devices. During the research done for this thesis, a thermal activation energy enables the performance of samples at high temperatures (above about 300 °C). The energy barrier is related to the leg-to-leg <b>interconnection</b> in the <b>assembly</b> of nanotetrapods. Percolation mechanisms are responsible for both the very slow photo-response (minutes to hours or days) and the significant persistent photocurrent. Below the bandgap energy, electronic states were investigated but their contribution to the photocurrent are two-three order of magnitude lower than the band edge. Such devices are suitable for employ in photodetectors as well as in gas sensors, provided that the mechanism by which the photo-current is generated and gas adsorption on the surface modify the conductivity of the material are known...|$|R
