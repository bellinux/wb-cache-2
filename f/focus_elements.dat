40|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. In section 2, I argue that sentences with de/bu and sentences with the Modal nenggou/bu-nenggou are semantically interpreted the same way. Section 3 shows that de/bu and the Modal {{are different in}} their syntactic behavior when interacting with four constructions, passive constructions, ba-constructions, <b>focus</b> <b>elements</b> and manner adverbs, in which de-constructions display blocking phenomena, whereas nenggou- constructions work perfectly with these four constructions. In addition, two constructions, dou- quantifications and A-not-A questions, which are well-known as being derived by undergoing LF movement, are found affected by the same blocking effects as de-constructions when interacting with passive constructions, ba-constructions, <b>focus</b> <b>elements</b> and manner adverbs. The status of de/bu is discussed in section 4 where I provide the history of de/bu and I argue that de/bu are an X level category projecting as De and {{that the relationship between}} De and the Modal is built by LF movement. I further discuss two possibilities, either an XP or an X movement, for de/bu to be licensed by undergoing LF movement. Section 5 examines the four constructions that cause the intervening effects in de-constructions in detail and I argue that the LF movement involved in de-constructions should be analyzed as a head movement rather than an XP/A-bar movement. Section 6 discusses the co-occurrence of de/bu and the Modal in. Finally, section 7 briefly summarizes the analysis and provides a brief discussion of implication of this analysi...|$|E

40|$|In Ilonggo (an Austronesian {{language}} spoken in the Philippines), the article aŋ {{is known to}} mark constituents with "emphasis". To accommodate this quality of "emphasis)), the literature on Ilonggo morphosyntax has classically labeled aŋ as either a topic marker (Wolfenden 1975) or a focus marker (Wolfenden 1971, Spitz 2001). I demonstrate that aŋ does not fit exclusively into either of these functions, but that it {{plays a role in}} the articulation of both topics expressions and focus marking. To evaluate the claims that aŋ is a topic marker or a focus marker, I apply Lambrechtls (1994) theory of information structure. This theory asserts that topical denotata (entities) are coded through topic expressions, which include lexical NPs and unaccented pronouns which establish a topic relation between the denotatum and the proposition of the sentence. Focus denotata are coded through focus marking, which are prosodic and morphosyntactic markers that establish a focus relation between the denotatum and the proposition. Aŋ is capable of expressing three types of topic expressions: lexical NPs with a reference-oriented function (aŋ sapat, 'the animar), role-oriented "optional)) lexical NPs (which can be dropped if assumed in context), and role-oriented specified pronouns (aŋ duwa sila, 'the two of them This functional capacity is partially attributed to mls inherently non-implicit nature; aŋ can only appear before explicitly stated lexical NPs and pronouns that have been preceded by specifiers. Aŋ's role in focus marking is ultimately unclear. Aŋ does appear within constituents that refer to <b>focus</b> <b>elements,</b> as shown in (Cb) : However, it is presently impossible to determine if V itself is marking constituents with focus, or if phrases preceded by aŋ are simply viable targets for some presently invisible focus marking (i. e. prosodic accents). Despite these unknown variables, it is established that aŋ can certainly appear in constituents that express <b>focus</b> <b>elements.</b> Through this analysis, I ultimately prove that the titles "topic marker)) and "focus marker)) are inherently inaccurate in describing how aŋ contributes to the articulation of information structure in Ilonggo. The mechanisms for expressing topic and focus appear to be more nuanced and complex than the use of a single grammatical marker...|$|E

40|$|Serbo-Croatian (SC) is a {{language}} with very free word order; almost any permutation {{of words in}} a sentence is allowed. There are surprising exceptions to this: clitics and multiple wh-fronting. The order of clitics with respect to other elements in a sentence is very rigid. Clitics have to occupy the second position (2 P) in a sentence, where 2 P is roughly either after the first word or after the first phrase. Wh-phrases also have restrictions on the positions {{in which they can}} occur in a sentence. In most cases, no wh-element can remain in-situ. This thesis is a study of word order in SC, both of its freedom and restrictions on it, within the Minimalist Program. Various word orders in SC correlate with particular information structure and prosodic properties. Paying a close attention to them reveals two different types of word reordering: one to remove nonpresupposed elements from the position where a new information focus element needs to be, in order to receive the main sentential stress by the NSR, as formulated in Zubizarreta (1998) (defocalized phrase displacement), and the other one to move identificational (Kiss 1998) <b>focus</b> <b>elements</b> into positions in which they can be licensed (focus movement). I show that defocalized phrase displacement structures are not derived only by syntactic mechanisms, but that PF plays a role too, in the form of deciding which copy of an element is pronounced. There is no optional movement in syntax, appearances of optionality are derived by virtue of pronouncing the relevant copy of an element, as decided by the NSR. Focus movement, whose subcase, I show, is multiple wh-fronting, involves movement of focused elements into discourse oriented projections in overt syntax. These <b>focus</b> <b>elements</b> have to be licensed also prosodically, and PF considerations of stress assignment help explain why there is no appearance of optionality here. When it comes to the second position cliticization, evidence is presented that the 2 P requirement must be a matter of PF, and not syntax. A PF filter put forth in Boškovi 2 ̆ 6 cacute; (1997) ensures the pronunciation of just those copies that will result in the 2 P placement. ...|$|E

40|$|This book explores sets of {{movement}} cases in medieval Italian from 1200 to 1315.

40|$|This {{study of}} therapists’ {{experiences}} of transformation arose from {{reflections on the}} longing for change which motivates many clients to seek therapy and draws many therapists to the profession of counselling/psychotherapy. Therapy research typically focuses on outcomes and change processes, but the nature of transformational experiences, particularly for therapists, is not well documented. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate therapists’ experiences of personal and professional transformation, including my own. It therefore involved a personal quest for individuation. An autoethnographic account of the parallel research and individuation processes is interwoven with a dialogical analysis of research conversations with seven experienced counsellors/psychotherapists. The initial conversations were video-recorded and an adaptation of Interpersonal Process Recall was used to facilitate joint discussion of the recordings. Selected key moments were analysed dialogically. My experience as researcher was documented by recording dreams, drawing and reflexive writing. These artefacts provided data for the autoethnographic account. Psychotherapy theories and practices, particularly Jung’s (1960) concept of the collective unconscious and method of active imagination, offered a lens through which the data were viewed. The study demonstrated that transformational experience often required an intersubjective relationship to enable shifts in perspective or new ways of being. Dynamic relational processes therefore became significant elements of transformation. The research conversations demonstrated processes facilitative of transformation as well as resistance. Building on Stern’s (2004) concept of moments of meeting, the study suggests the significance for lasting change of additional intersubjective events identified as moments of not-meeting, reflective moments of meeting and shared interest <b>focus.</b> <b>Elements</b> contributing to transformation were identified as firstly the connection of thinking with feeling and secondly reflection on the connection within a relational matrix, leading to integration and potentially to transformative action. The nature of transformational experience was found to involve transcending polarised states or positions, enabling movement towards a third perspective. The antithesis of transformation, referred to here as –T, was noted in some professional contexts. The implications for therapeutic practice and other relational settings, and for therapy education, research and the professional social context, are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{accounts}} of preverbal subjects in Spanish and European Portuguese (EP) {{in the literature}} have debated the syntactic position of these elements. According to some analyses, preverbal subjects are canonical arguments appearing in an A-position (e. g. Goodall 2001, 2002; Suñer 2003 for Spanish; Duarte 1997; Costa 2004 for EP). Other analyses propose that preverbal subjects are non-arguments appearing in a left-peripheral - perhaps CLLD - A 2 ̆ 7 -position (e. g. Uribe-Etxebarria 1990, 1995; Ordóñez 2 ̆ 6 Treviño 1999 for Spanish; Barbosa 1996, 2000 for EP). Although Galician is an ideal language for insight on this debate due to linguistic ties with EP and political ties with Spain, Gupton (2006) obtained inconclusive results regarding the status of preverbal subjects in Galician. As the literature on Galician lacks descriptions of preferred word orders according to discourse context, I collected quantitative and qualitative experimental data to describe the syntax-information structure interface in Galician. The vast majority of speakers of this minority language are Spanish-Galician bilinguals with (self-reported) high levels of competency in both languages. This is of relevance because a variety of bilinguals, including heritage speakers, attrited L 1 speakers, {{and those who have}} been claimed to have incompletely acquired the heritage language have been shown to exhibit instability and optionality at the linguistic interfaces, in particular at the syntax-discourse pragmatics interface (e. g. Hulk 2 ̆ 6 Müller 2000; Sorace 2005 among numerous others), which is the subject of investigation in this dissertation. The data collected indicate a marked preference for SVO {{in a wide variety of}} discourse contexts, a preference that differs from those claimed to apply in similar contexts in Spanish (e. g. Ordóñez 1997, Zubizarreta 1998, Casielles 2004). Assuming that the presence of clitics implies the projection of f (Raposo 2 ̆ 6 Uriagereka 2005) and the extension of the preverbal field into the left periphery, the cliticization data gathered for Galician in main clauses, subordinate clauses and recomplementation contexts suggest a number of preverbal positions in which preverbal subjects, affective phrases, and Topic elements may appear, one of which I suggest is Spec, DoubledFceP, following Martín-González (2002), but with proposed modifications. The data also suggest necessary modifications for López 2 ̆ 7 s (2009) syntax-information structure interface proposal in Romance, which suggests a reduced, syncretic left-peripheral position (Spec, FinP) in which CLLD Topics, wh- elements, and Fronted <b>Focus</b> <b>elements</b> appear and are assigned [+c] (contrastive) by the Pragmatics module. Within the preverbal architecture I propose, preverbal subjects and other left-peripheral elements coincide, but in a variety of syntactic positions. Therefore, for pragmatic feature assignment to successfully assign [+c], Pragmatics must distinguish between preverbal subjects and other left-peripheral phrases...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have tested Bengali adult native speakers’ word order choices with respect to {{information}} structure and have compared their preferences to the Bengali native children acquirers. The study shows that Bengali word order scrambling is available in various type of sentences like declaratives, wh-questions and focus constructions. The scrambling {{is not at all}} optional in this language; in contrast it works as a diagnostic to determine the information structure of the sentence. According to the findings of this research, Bengali adults’ word order preferences for declarative sentences {{are not the same as}} wh-questions. Moreover, information structure in Bengali motivates the adults to choose different word orders for the focus constructions with respect to wh-questions. For example, large numbers of Bengali adults prefer to put the focus element after the verb while they do not prefer the same thing for wh-questions. However, preverbal base generated and preverbal scrambling <b>focus</b> <b>elements</b> are also prominent in the adult data. In fact, Bengali language allows in-situ contrastive focus (i. e. focus element is base generated) and scrambling contrastive focus (i. e. focus element is moved from its base position). Therefore, Bengali adults use both of these techniques to produce contrastive focus. Since most of the adults prefer scrambling to produce contrastive focus constructions, we can say that the contrastive focus scrambling bear strong information packaging and therefore the constituents of a sentence are rearranged in different word order. The study also revealed that in almost all cases, Bengali children pick up the technique of correlating information structure and word order scrambling quickly and regarding word order choices, they behave in the same way as the adults. However most of the children in our experiment prefer in-situ contrastive focus. Considering all limitations of our experiment we can say that Bengali children acquire the technique of in-situ focus early in compare to the other way of constructing contrastive focus. In this study, we have designed a set of experiments to test the correlation between the word order scrambling and the information structure. Since it is necessary to find out the factors behind this correlation, one experiment has been designed for the adults and the other has been designed for the children. The main objective of these experiments is to collect natural responses from the Bengali adults and the children. Even though two experiments are not entirely identical with each other, we only consider the conclusive data-values to get a relatively concrete result. The present study is concluded with an assumption that the study should be conducted in future with a larger amount of data. As a result, it will be possible to get more convincing answer...|$|E
