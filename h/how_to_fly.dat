He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with the rank of wing commander and on much better pay. On 6 June 1952 the Brahams sailed to Canada. Braham was immediately appointed staff officer for operations and training at Air Defence near Montreal. He taught aircrew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly,</b> carry out interceptions and fight in all types of weather. He flew the fast Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck on 39 occasions and North American F-86 Sabre as well as the Lockheed T-33. Altogether he flew 193 times with the RCAF.

The headquarters of the U.S. Park Police, which patrol this portion of the parkway, is located off this exit along MD193. MD193 provides access to College Park, which is home to the College Park Airport, a 1909 airport where the Wright Brothers taught the U.S. Army <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> an airplane, and the University of Maryland, College Park, a public educational institution established in 1862. At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard Space Flight Center, the first NASA space flight center opened in 1958 that contributed majorly to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world owned by the United States Department of Agriculture. The parkway's only interchange within the center is at Powder Mill Road, south of Capitol College.|$|E
5|$|Outside of hockey, Gardiner enjoyed several {{different}} hobbies. During one off-season from the Black Hawks, Gardiner began taking flying lessons from his former teammate Konrad Johannesson.

25|$|While {{living in}} Lorain, Ohio {{and working in}} a factory, Barr first learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> {{aircraft}} in 1946 {{as part of a}} Piper club. She had dropped out of Oberlin College the year before in order to find a job to pay for flying lessons. After completing her training, she obtained a job training others to be commercial pilots. During the end years of World War II, she decided to help build aircraft for the war, which led to her moving to New York City and joining a aircraft mechanic school. This also involved acting alongside members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots to assist in transporting war goods and planes across the US. The end of the war resulted in the Barrs moving to Susanville, California in 1949, and setting about running and improving the Susanville airport. After obtaining her certification in 1957, she obtained the position of FAA Pilot Examiner for Lassen County.

40|$|The {{capability}} of the Space Transportation System (STS), the Space Shuttle, to support crew tended and free flyer research in low Earth orbit has opened new possibilities for science in space. For the first time, research equipment can be put into orbit routinely, operated in either a shirtsleeve environment or exposed to space, {{and then returned to}} the investigator. NASA, operator of the Shuttle, has implemented a variety of programs to ensure that anyone with a worthy research idea can take advantage of this opportunity. Investigators ranging from high school students to renowned space scientists have already used the Shuttle as a platform for making Earth, atmospheric, and astronomical observations; for performing space plasma physics measurements; and for exploring the effects of microgravity on living organisms and physical processes.
