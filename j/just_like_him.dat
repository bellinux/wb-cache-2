25|$|The Bhagavata Purana gives a {{somewhat}} different account of Durvasa's birth. In this version, Atri performed severe penance to propitiate the Supreme Being {{in order to obtain}} a son by Anasuya who would be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>Him.</b> Pleased with him, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva blessed the sage that portions of themselves would be born as his sons. In due course, Anasuya bore Soma(Brahma's incarnation), Dattatreya (Vishnu's incarnation) and Durvasa (Shiva's incarnation).|$|E
25|$|In 1867, {{his father}} was {{appointed}} prebendary and rector of Tibohine, and {{the family moved to}} neighbouring Frenchpark, in County Roscommon. He was home schooled by his father and his aunt due to a childhood illness. While a young man, he became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language. He was influenced in particular by the gamekeeper Seamus Hart and the wife of his friend, Mrs. Connolly. He was crushed when Hart died (Douglas was 14) and his interest in the Irish language, which was the first language he began to study in any detail, as his own undertaking, flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin a number of times and realised that there were groups of people, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward and old-fashioned.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, James F. Masterson {{proposed}} {{two categories}} for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet. Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects {{in the quality}} of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in DSM-IV and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist {{is more likely to be}} described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the borderline in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.|$|E

6000|$|She <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> {{well enough}} {{apparently}} not to {{wish to see}} him hang, but that was all. And this suddenly struck him as ridiculous, paltry, and childish, a silly bravado which caused him to laugh. Perhaps she desired to save him publicly at slight cost to herself, in order that she might yet occupy one day the position which she had so avowedly coveted since her childhood--that of Duchess of Wessex! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For shame, father," [...] said Martha, [...] "that {{must not}} be. Master Grahame will kindle his own fire, or {{wait till the}} char-woman comes {{to do it for}} <b>him,</b> <b>just</b> as <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> best." ...|$|R
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and just let the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "The Wave" [...] {{begins with the}} aliens' {{spaceship}} crashing to Earth. The camera then hovers over a playground where dozens of children appear to be dead. Several policemen arrive at the scene and begin to remove the bodies by putting them in wheelbarrows. Meanwhile, Jean Noel is seen running on a desert road. The policemen then begin to dig graves for the corpses. Jean Noel then spots another specimen who looks <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> and the two begin to run. They are soon joined by more specimens before arriving at the playground. By chanting at the policemen, the specimens appear to mind control them into dance. Jean Noel continues to run and stops {{when he sees the}} crashed spaceship. The video ends with the band's jackalope logo.|$|E

5000|$|Nadir's Big Chance (1975) was a {{major change}} from the {{preceding}} In Camera. Whilst In Camera is characterised by extremely intense and complex songs and even has some musique concrète on it, Nadir's Big Chance contains anticipations of punk rock. In a 1977 radio interview, John Lydon of the Sex Pistols played two tracks from the album and expressed his admiration for Hammill in glowing terms: [...] "Peter Hammill's great. A true original. I've <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for years. If you listen to him, his solo albums, I'm damn sure Bowie copied {{a lot out of}} that geezer. The credit he deserves, just has not been given to him. I love all his stuff".|$|R
500|$|... "John Wayne Gacy, Jr." [...] {{documents}} {{the story of}} the 1970s Chicago-based serial killer of the same name. Several lyrics make explicit references to events in his life: [...] "hen the swingset hit his head" [...] refers to an event in Gacy's childhood, when a swing hit his head and caused a blood clot in his brain; [...] "He dressed up like a clown for them / with his face paint white and red" [...] alludes to the nickname given to Gacy—the [...] "Killer Clown"; and [...] "He put a cloth on their lips / Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth" [...] references Gacy's use of chloroform to subdue and molest his victims. The song ends with the narrator turning inward with the lyrics: [...] "And in my best behavior, I am really <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> / Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid." [...] Stevens stated in a 2009 interview with Paste that [...] "we're all capable of what [...] did." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jonathan Collier, who is a huge boxing fan. Knowing that {{the people on the}} {{internet}} would [...] "give them grief", the writers went to a lot of effort to explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title. A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder. Lucius Sweet is a parody of boxing promoter Don King, and is voiced by Paul Winfield, who had previously played King in HBO's 1995 biopic Tyson. In the script, Sweet was described as [...] "A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King". The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line, [...] "He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King – and he looks <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> too!". King was asked to guest star, but turned the part down. Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson. The name came from George Meyer, who went to high school with a boy named Drederick Timmins, which Meyer thought was a cool name. Tatum having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that, {{at the time of the}} episode's production, Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape. Homer is at one point referred to as [...] "The Southern Dandy" [...] as a reference to the old-time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames.|$|E
2500|$|In Ozzy's book [...] "Diary of a Madman: Ozzy Osbourne - The Stories Behind the Songs" [...] it says [...] "Always on {{the lookout}} for a bright, new talent, Ozzy spotted a guitarist who plays like a motherfucker" [...] {{referring}} to Joe Holmes who had previously worked with David Lee Roth and was a pupil of Randy Rhoads. While on tour, Rhoads would himself take classical guitar tuition and [...] arrange workshops in which he gave lessons to young players. [...] "It's really spooky." [...] said Ozzy, [...] "because when Joe plays the Randy Rhoads stuff, he plays <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> - it's like I can see Randy's fingers." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rick Harte {{had started}} Ace of Hearts Records in 1978. He tooled around {{town in a}} spiffy little Volvo sports car, living beyond the means of his modest job at a hi-fi store. [...] "Rick had money", {{explains}} Jim Coffman, who later managed Mission of Burma. [...] "He didn't {{have to worry about}} a lot of things." [...] Harte didn't have cutting-edge taste, but he could read people's reactions to bands very well. He was a familiar figure in the clubs and had the money, the talent, and the inclination to records bands. And on top of it, people <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "He's <b>just</b> a really good guy," [...] says Prescott. [...] "I couldn't say a bad word about him if someone had a knife to my throat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} part of it all, Lucy. If I did not <b>like</b> <b>him</b> I should not mind it half so much. It is <b>just</b> because I <b>like</b> <b>him</b> so very much that I am so very unhappy. His hair is just the colour of Aunt Emmeline's big shawl." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Fallout", Claire's father reveals {{that he knew}} about her powers long before {{she was aware of}} them. He {{acknowledges}} doing things he was not proud of to keep her safe, and tells Claire that Sylar had been taken care of, but that she must keep silent about her powers because she is in danger from others like him. Bennet later meets with Sylar, confined in a prison cell, and tells him that the cell is keeping his powers suppressed. Sylar taunts Bennet telling him that Bennet is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> [...] In their next confrontation Bennet turns the taunt back at Sylar telling him how they plan to study him to determine what makes him [...] "tick." [...] Sylar boasts that he would escape and kill Claire, taking her healing abilities. Eden suggests using her powers to persuade Sylar to kill himself, but Bennet declines (though briefly tempted), as he takes orders from someone higher up. Bennet later takes Claire to the police station, where she is interviewed about Jackie's murder. Officer Parkman is unable to read the thoughts of Claire or her father, since the Haitian is hiding behind a nearby corner. Afterwards, Bennet orders the Haitian to wipe the memories of his son and Claire's friend, Zach. [...] When Claire finds out {{that the two of them}} have lost all memory of her powers she rings her father in a panic. [...] It is left open whether it is only then that he orders the Haitian to wipe Claire's memories or whether he has already done so.|$|E

Pri also defends him to Tia who <b>just</b> does not <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> (Actually, the attraction between Tia and Ranvir is hinted at but Tia backs off when she realises Pri's interest in him.) ...|$|R
5000|$|From 1946 to 1970, Elson {{broadcast}} for the White Sox exclusively. He {{missed out}} on calling the 1959 World Series—the Chisox' first since 1919 and Elson's first since 1943—on the national NBC broadcast because NBC Sports president Tom Gallery (who'd grown up with him in Chicago) <b>just</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> He was, however, allowed to call the Series on the White Sox' flagship radio station, WCFL. He called games for the Oakland Athletics in 1971 before returning to Chicago, where he teamed with Lloyd Pettit on Chicago Black Hawks NHL broadcasts. (He had previously called Black Hawks games in the late 1930s.) ...|$|R

50|$|Park asks Taub who's more paranoid; {{the patient}} or her. He replies he doesn't think {{the patient has}} a mental illness and tells Park not to let House get to her. However, Park says she doesn't think the team respects her and Chase doesn't even try to hide it. Taub says Chase <b>just</b> <b>likes</b> working with <b>him</b> and does respect her. Foreman {{interrupts}} them and asks to speak to Taub.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then rest easy," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "I know the guy, {{and how to}} handle him. You <b>just</b> watch <b>him</b> <b>like</b> he's {{watching}} you, Mr. Mershone, and if anything happens you skip as lively as a flea. I can use that two hundred in my business." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Weeks, The Jimmy sent Alan Thistle... {{to talk to}} Lip in the hospital. Thistle persuaded Lip not {{to testify}} against Louie and {{everything}} was dropped. After all, Louie was also a good moneymaker. No reason to send a profitable bookmaker away for attempted murder. A few days later, however, Louie {{decided he wanted to}} kill Alan Thistle {{for no other reason than}} he <b>just</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> But Jimmy told him he couldn't.

5000|$|Hoskins {{commented on}} the dispute, saying that [...] "Jake was seen as someone who was never {{prepared}} to give the whole story and relied on public sentiment after the World Cup to support his cause as a martyr...

5000|$|Drawn from Drury's {{interviews}} with Nixon {{and his political}} and White House staff, Courage and Hesitation also contains photographs by Fred J. Maroon. Impressed by Maroon's photography of Washington, D.C., Nixon had granted the photographer's request {{for access to the}} White House in 1970. Maroon later wrote, [...] "After Kennedy and Johnson nobody seemed to be running stories on the Nixon White House. The big news magazines <b>just</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> so I proposed a book." [...] He continued photographing Nixon through the President's 1974 resignation, but except for what was published in Courage and Hesitation Maroon did not publish most of his Nixon work until his 1999 book The Nixon Years, 1969-1974, White House to Watergate.|$|R
