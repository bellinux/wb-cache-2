Zorn later formed the Painkiller project with ambient dub producer Bill Laswell on bass guitar and Mick Harris on drums, which also collaborated with Justin Broadrick on some work.

This study compared the performances of MQL <b>grinding</b> by using castor oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, and palm oil as base oils. A K-P 36 numerical-control precision surface grinder was used to perform plain <b>grinding</b> on a workpiece material with a high-temperature nickel base alloy. A YDMâ€“III 99 three-dimensional dynamometer was used to measure <b>grinding</b> force, and a clip-type thermocouple was used to determine <b>grinding</b> temperature. The <b>grinding</b> force, <b>grinding</b> temperature, and energy ratio coefficient of MQL <b>grinding</b> were compared among the seven vegetable oil types. Results revealed that (1) castor oil-based MQL <b>grinding</b> yields the lowest <b>grinding</b> force but exhibits the highest <b>grinding</b> temperature and energy ratio coefficient; (2) palm oil-based MQL <b>grinding</b> generates the second lowest <b>grinding</b> force but shows the lowest <b>grinding</b> temperature and energy ratio coefficient; (3) MQL <b>grinding</b> based on the five other vegetable oils produces similar <b>grinding</b> forces, <b>grinding</b> temperatures, and energy ratio coefficients, with values ranging between those of castor oil and palm oil; (4) viscosity significantly influences <b>grinding</b> force and <b>grinding</b> temperature to a greater extent than fatty acid varieties and contents in vegetable oils; (5) although more viscous vegetable oil exhibits greater lubrication and significantly lower <b>grinding</b> force than less viscous vegetable oil, high viscosity reduces the heat exchange capability of vegetable oil and thus yields a high <b>grinding</b> temperature; (6) saturated fatty acid is a more efficient lubricant than unsaturated fatty acid; and (7) a short carbon chain transfers heat more effectively than a long carbon chain. Palm oil is the optimum base oil of MQL <b>grinding,</b> and this base oil yields 26. 98 N tangential <b>grinding</b> force, 87. 10 N normal <b>grinding</b> force, 119. 6 Â°C <b>grinding</b> temperature, and 42. 7 % energy ratio coefficient...|$|R
