25|$|Some men shave their heads, {{either as}} a <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> because they find a shaved head {{preferable}} to the appearance of male pattern baldness, or in order to attain enhanced cooling of the skull – particularly for people suffering from hyperhidrosis. A much smaller number of Western women also shave their heads, often as a fashion or political statement.|$|E
25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 {{in a suit}} jacket and tie. The mannish appearance, uncharacteristic (in photographs) half-smile, and the knowing look in the picture has caused later commentators to wonder whether Dolores was signalling {{that she was a}} lesbian, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that she was and her appearance at this time may simply have been a <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b> The photograph appeared, slightly changed, on the cover of Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture by Laura Doan in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Things {{started to}} change when during the European renaissance, the high heel became a status symbol worn by both male and females from the higher social statuses. Catherine de' Medici, a Franco/Italian noblewoman, pioneered the use of heels as a <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b> Catherine de Medici is {{believed}} to have worn them to impress the French court when she wed the Duke of Orleans, the future king. It {{is believed to be the}} first instance when heels were worn however, this reference may be apocryphal, as the development of heels did not begin to come about until the late 1580s, based on iconographic evidence and extant pieces. Two hundred years later King Louis XIV of France decreed that only nobility could wear heels, and that only members of his specific court could wear red ones. Seventeenth-century portraits of King Louis XIV depict the various intricate heels worn by the king and they were often decorated with miniature battle scenes.|$|E
25|$|Rizk {{was born}} in Beirut in a Christian household, to a Lebanese father and Hungarian mother. Her mother was married to Rossi, an Italian prior to marrying Rizk's father.

She {{was the first woman}} from the Middle East and the fourth woman from Asia to win the title. In the pageant, she made a memorable <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> by wearing a very revealing top and hotpants. The 1972 Miss Universe pageant was held in Cerromar Beach Hotel in Dorado, Puerto Rico. On 30 May 1972, a month before the pageant telecast, 17 Christian pilgrims from Puerto Rico along with other victims, were killed during an attack at the Lod Airport in Israel (now Ben Gurion International Airport). The massacre was perpetrated by three members of the Japanese Red Army on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Due to the possible retaliation from the massacre, Rizk was not allowed to attend the Miss Universe Pageant to crown her successor in Puerto Rico.|$|E
500|$|The fine clothes {{donated by}} the King, which Dover wore when he presided over the Games, were not just a <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> but also a {{political}} one. The feather in Dover's hat was a [...] "flag of defiance to virtue" [...] in Puritan eyes, and even the starch probably used in the washing of his ruff was evil, according to the Puritan writer Philip Stubbes. He described starch as [...] " [...] certain kind of liquid matter... wherein the Devil hath learned them [...] to wash and die their ruffs".|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the contact}} lens market is likely to grow due to the {{increasing}} occurrence of eye-related conditions such as astigmatism, hypermetropia and myopia.

500|$|Nipple {{piercing}} {{may have}} been a sign of masculinity for the soldiers of Rome. Nipple piercing has also been connected to rites of passage for both British and American sailors who had traveled beyond a significant latitude and longitude. Western women of the 14th century sometimes sported pierced as well as rouged nipples left visible by the low-cut dresses fashionable in the day. It is widely reported that in the 1890s, nipple rings called [...] "bosom rings" [...] resurfaced as a <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> among women of the West, who would wear them on one or both sides, but if such a trend existed, it was short-lived.|$|E
500|$|Evangelical pastor Rick Warren {{delivered}} the invocation for the inaugural ceremony, {{followed by a}} performance by vocalist Aretha Franklin, who sang [...] "My Country, 'Tis of Thee".

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Arthur Pierson, and was produced by Glenn Goodwin, while Wayne Isham {{was in charge of}} photography.

The most prominent among her fashion accessories were the crucifixes she wore as earrings and necklaces. Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In reality, she was trying to find a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|E

5000|$|Culture jamming {{is a form}} of subvertising. [...] Many culture jams are {{intended}} to expose questionable political assumptions behind commercial culture.

500|$|Robert Brunner, Apple's head of {{industrial}} design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook [...] "so {{it would be}} as easy to use and carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers of the time and also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were beige or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed {{in the middle of the}} computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create a <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: [...] "It says something about the identity of the person who is carrying it".|$|E
500|$|Time placed Gaga {{on their}} All-Time 100 Fashion Icons List, stating: [...] "Lady Gaga {{is just as}} notorious for her {{outrageous}} style as she is for her pop hits [...] has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles, Kermit the Frog dolls, and raw meat." [...] Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef. Partly awarded {{in recognition of the}} dress, Vogue named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 and Time named the dress the <b>Fashion</b> <b>Statement</b> of the year. Attracting the attention of worldwide media, it was also criticized by the animal rights organization PETA, which found it offensive. The meat dress was displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in 2012, and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as Madonna: The First Album with a {{different}} artwork created by photographer George Holy. The cover features Madonna in similar style of dress to the original cover but this time with crucifix as her earrings. Madonna's trademark style was catching on as a <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> among club kids and fans, with her crucifix accessories becoming the jewelry of the moment. Madonna said that wearing a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star". Madonna dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good until {{the release of the}} album. In an interview with Time magazine, Madonna said: [...] "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [...] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn't until my first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions." ...|$|E
50|$|Godard {{likewise}} {{portrays the}} role that certain objects and organizations — such as Mao's Little Red Book, the French Communist Party, and other small leftist factions — play in the developing ideology and activities of the Aden Arabie cell. These objects and organizations appear to become ironically fetishized as entertainment products and <b>fashion</b> <b>statements</b> within a modern consumer-capitalist society — the very society which the student radicals hope to transform through their revolutionary project.|$|R
50|$|To {{adapt to}} the bright <b>fashion</b> <b>statements</b> of the 1960s, La Perla {{launched}} a lingerie line based on colorful, floral and checked patterns alongside the more traditional white, black and nude.

In 1978, La Perla launched its stretch lace sets, echoing the fashion of the day with its clinging dresses and natural flowing lines.|$|R
50|$|A {{major theme}} in Westerfeld's {{work is the}} idea of free {{thinking}} or questioning authority. In Uglies, the protagonist Tally rebels against her society's rules first with harmless pranks and eventually by leaving the city altogether. She finds a group of runaway uglies who refuse to conform to social norms that includes undergoing cosmetic surgery. Similarly, So Yesterday examines popularity and why certain trends are considered 'cool.' The novels praises innovators who think outside the box and come up with new <b>fashion</b> <b>statements</b> entirely on their own.|$|R
500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{also helped}} popularize {{political}} subject matter in hip hop music, as it epitomized the resurgence in black consciousness among African-American youths {{at the turn}} of the 1990s, amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during the Bush administration and South African apartheid. Black consciousness became the prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts, exemplified by X-Clan's cultural nationalism on their debut album To the East, Blackwards, the revolutionary, Black Panther-minded The Devil Made Me Do It by Paris, and the Five Percenter religious nationalism of Poor Righteous Teachers' debut Holy Intellect. Christgau wrote in 1990 that Public Enemy had become not only [...] "the most innovative popular musicians in America if not the world" [...] but also [...] "the most politically ambitious. Not even in the heyday of [...] Clash has any group come so close to the elusive and perhaps ridiculous '60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music." [...] Their music on the album inspired leftist and Afrocentric ideals among rap listeners who were previously exposed to more materialist themes in the music. Reeves said it introduced black consciousness to the [...] "hip-hop youth" [...] of the [...] "post-black power generation", [...] "as leather African medallions made popular by rappers like P.E. replaced thick gold chains as the ultimate <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> ... P.E.'s million seller sat at the front of a full-blown black pride resurgence within rap".|$|E

50|$|Designer {{handbags}} in ostrich leather {{are extremely}} popular as many luxury designers such as Prada, Hermès, Smythson, Bottega Veneta and Gucci, {{continue to make}} <b>fashion</b> <b>statements</b> with their wares made of exotic skins. Louis Vuitton has also popularized the use of ostrich skins, especially part of their runway collections. In 2006, the classic Louis Vuitton Keepall 50 special ordered in an ostrich skin was $10,800. Although such items are expensive, women seek them out because they are simply beautiful and different. It is quite easy to recognize an ostrich handbag.|$|R
5000|$|Aside from Rosanna (or Osang), [...] "Startalk" [...] {{also gave}} a big break to {{a trio of}} {{newcomers}} anonymously known as Steve, Fayatollah and Pepita. The new loud segment hosts handled [...] "Startalk"'s tabloid segment [...] "T! The Tigbak Authority" [...] where they criticize the senseless headlines printed on tabloid and the <b>fashion</b> <b>statements</b> of the movie/TV stars during awards night. Fayatollah later on became a regular fixture in other GMA shows while Pepita posed for FHM magazine last August 2003. Steve has become the regular voice-over of the show since his inclusion.|$|R
5000|$|... 1920s youth {{used the}} {{influence}} of jazz to rebel against the traditional culture of previous generations. This youth rebellion of the 1920s went hand-in-hand with fads like bold <b>fashion</b> <b>statements</b> (flappers), women smoking cigarettes, free talk about sex, and new radio concerts. Dances like the Charleston, developed by African Americans, suddenly became popular among the youth. Traditionalists were aghast at what they considered the breakdown of morality.
