5|$|Like other U.S. states, the {{structure}} of the government of South Dakota follows the same separation of powers as the federal government, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The structure of the state government <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in the Constitution of South Dakota, the highest law in the state. The constitution may be amended by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|Omaha <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> on a grid plan, with 12 {{blocks to}} the mile with a north-to-south house {{numbering}} system. Omaha is {{the location of a}} historic boulevard system designed by H.W.S. Cleveland who sought to combine the beauty of parks with the pleasure of driving cars. The historic Florence and Fontenelle Boulevards, as well as the modern Sorenson Parkway, are important elements in this system.|$|E
50|$|Streets <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{east and}} west, avenues <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> running north and south. Streets {{increment}} in number as travel heads northward. Avenues increment alphabetically as travel proceeds west. The {{whole of the}} Caswell Hill community <b>is</b> also <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in a grid pattern.|$|R
50|$|The town <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> by Maxwell Woodhull on September 30, 1857. An {{addition}} <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1867, {{and another}} in 1870. That same year, the town was incorporated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first section}} of this {{historic}} district is known as Official Plat of Government Lot 2 and it <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1886. [...] Prospect Park Second Plat <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> the following year and it was corrected in 1888. The final section, Glen Baily Plat, <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1922. The period of historical significance ends in 1937 when Hickman Road was cut through to Sixth Avenue.|$|R
5|$|The palace is a two-storey {{building}} of seven bays, with three gables over alternating bays, {{two of which}} are supported by buttresses. There is an attic beneath the coped gables and surmounted by octagonal chimney stacks. The interior <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> with a hall, solar and gallery with an undercroft. It has flagstone floors and a 16th-century stone fireplace.|$|E
5|$|The site core <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> around eight plazas. Some of the {{structures}} were restored by the United Fruit Company; most of these border Plazas 1 and 2. Structures 1 and 2 are pyramid temples. Structures 4, 6 and 10 are palace structures, long buildings with internal chambers and benches used as residences and for administrative purposes.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{similar to}} other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
25|$|Ashley Park Golf Club <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in the 1890s, but {{ceased to}} exist prior to 1918. Burwood Park Golf Club <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in the 1890s in the half-century-old {{breakaway}} bounds of Hersham, and continues.|$|R
50|$|The Goodwood Golf Course <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1901. Chichester/Goodwood Airport, {{also on the}} estate, {{was built}} during World War II. Goodwood Circuit <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> around the {{perimeter}} of the airfield by Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond in 1948.|$|R
50|$|The area <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> at {{very low}} densities as local {{authority}} housing but the city employed private architects for its design - Reginald Fairlie and Reid and Forbes. It <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> from 1921 and took around three years to complete.|$|R
5|$|The Beiyue temple <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> on a north-south axis {{featuring}} six extant buildings. From {{south to}} north, the buildings are: a gate, an octagonal building called the Tianyi Pavilion (天一阁) {{that was built}} during the Ming Dynasty, two more gates, and the Dening Hall (德宁殿). A large platform {{in front of the}} Dening Hall now features the remains of stone sculptures, but was formerly the site of another hall. According to signs at the temple, many of the buildings were rebuilt in the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} elements are often {{displayed in a}} periodic table that <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with {{the same number of}} valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of observing cosmological factors is also {{seen on the}} other side of the world. The Forbidden City in Beijing <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: North, South, East, West and Centre. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing. One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the circumpolar stars. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as feng shui.|$|E
5|$|The {{limestone}} {{building has}} a slate hipped roof. It is rectangular with a projecting doric portico entrance and an extension to the rear. The interior <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in a U shape, {{with the larger}} Ball Room and Tea Room along either side with the octagonal Card Room at the end. The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with pictures by Thomas Gainsborough, Allan Ramsay (artist), Edwin Long and William Hoare.|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} gate from this palace, which was earlier {{the main gate}} and which has carved ornamentation, leads to the royal baths and then to an elegant small dwelling unit built within a garden in typical Mughal architectural style; this had been built exclusively for Rai Parveen, the female escort of the Raja Indrajit; her large-size portrait in a revealing and seductive attire adorns hall in this Mahal. She was a poet and musician. The building is a double storied structure built with bricks, rising to {{the height of the}} trees in the well tended garden called Anand Mahal. The garden <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> with octagonal flower beds and has good network of water supply. There are niches in the Mahal which permit natural light to the main hall and smaller rooms.|$|E
5|$|The house <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{around a}} large central hall {{connecting}} the mansion's two gabled end-pieces, which was used for dining. The other major rooms {{on the ground floor}} are the withdrawing room {{to the right of the}} hall, and the buttery and kitchen to the left; there is also a small entrance porch at the main Hospital Street entrance. The first floor has five main rooms: the upper hall (never open to the roof) and four solars (private upper rooms, some of which would have contained beds), as well as a small chapel. The attic is divided into five rooms and provided servants' accommodation.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} topics covered by Banglapedia {{includes}} political geography, religion, literature, art and architecture, folk practices and institutions, indigenous and colonial administration, politics, society, economy, ethnicity, and the sciences. All 64 districts of Bangladesh, as well as 451 upazilas, have been described in details ranging from topographical accounts {{to the number of}} dairy farms and hatcheries. Over 2,000 single- and four-colour illustrations depict Bangladeshi art and architecture, everyday life, cities and villages and personages. It has about 2,100 cross-references, cartographic information, tables and statistics. It <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in alphabetical order and is prefaced by an essay by the Chief Editor. There is a section explaining how to use the Banglapedia, which clarifies issues such as date systems, contributors, cross references, and headings.|$|E

5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} elements in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E
5|$|Don meets Rachel {{for dinner}} {{to make amends}} for the meeting. During the dinner, Don says he is living life to extract {{the maximum amount of}} {{pleasure}} as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel recognizes in Don the element of the disconnected outsider, for whom the world <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> like a puzzle waiting to be solved. The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co-workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a waitress rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this rejection and Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she invites him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty (January Jones), whom he has made no mention of thus far in the episode. He checks on their two sleeping children as she watches admiringly from the doorway.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge at}} Deeping Gate carries the date 1651, {{and is a}} Grade II* listed stone {{structure}} with three round arches. After the remains of Deeping High lock and Deeping Low lock, there is a junction where the old course, the Maxey Cut, the South Drain and the Folly River, also a drain, meet. The river is officially navigable below this point. Through Crowland and Cowbit {{to the edge of}} Spalding, the river <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> with washlands, which were historically used as pasture, because the river was allowed to flood the land when tidal levels prevented the water discharging into the sea. The river is bounded on the north and west by a bank, while the New River, a drainage channel to the south and east of it, is bounded by another bank. The land between the channels forms Crowland High Wash, Crowland Fodder Lots and Cowbit Wash. The southern bank is variously named Corporation Bank, Wash Bank and Barrier Bank. These wash lands were designed to be flooded in extremis, although the building of the Coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete.|$|E
