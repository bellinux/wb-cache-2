Shooting {{took place in}} several locations-Westchester, New York, Washington, D.C., New Jersey, and the Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn areas of New York City. Interior shots were filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City. Stern would do his radio show from 6:00 a.m. until around 10:30 a.m. and travel to the set straight after to resume shooting. Make up would last three to four hours, followed by filming until as late as 9:00 p.m. At one point, filming only took place from Thursday to Monday and lasted until 11:00 p.m. A temporary apartment {{was built on the}} Silvercup lot for Stern to live in while shooting took place in order to remove the need for him to commute to and from his family home in Long Island.

40|$|Many {{articles}} {{have been written}} concerning Moses and scholarship generally regards him as a divinely ‘elected’ leader of Judaism. The principle of parsimony has contributed a great deal towards united and simplified explanations {{of what kind of}} leader Moses was. For many biblical scholars, Moses possessed a wide array of skills and thus stands out as the foremost personality of the pre-Christian world. He headed a race comprising slaves and led them out of servitude in Egypt in what were exceedingly trying circumstances, to their promised land. However, if we apply the thinking of Plato, Schopenhauer or even Wittgenstein, we should apply a principle of specification and look at different types of discourse. This paper consequently approaches and examines the role of Moses as a leader from both theological and managerial perspectives. It is proposed that while Moses {{is considered to be a}} great leader of God’s elect people, the Hebrews, his managerial skills informs many of the modern day management principles despite his actions being embedded in the theological and cultural world in which <b>he</b> <b>operate...</b>|$|E
