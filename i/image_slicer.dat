The SPIFFI field-of-view consists of 32 × 32 pixels which are rearranged with an <b>image</b> <b>slicer</b> to a form a long slit. Based on the 3 D slicer concept with plane mirrors, an enhanced <b>image</b> <b>slicer</b> was developed. The SPIFFI <b>image</b> <b>slicer</b> consists of two sets of mirrors, called the small and the large slicer.

The modifications to the 3 D slicer concept affect the angles of the plane mirrors of small and large slicer and lead to an improved slit geometry with very little light losses. At a mirror width of 0. 3 mm the light loss is < 5 %. All reflective surfaces are flat and can be manufactured with a high surface quality.
