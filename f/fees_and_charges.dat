25|$|California Proposition 218 Local Initiative Power {{relating}} to the reduction or repeal of local taxes, assessments, <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{subsequently}} led to {{the passage}} of California Proposition 218 in 1996 ("Right to Vote on Taxes Act") that constitutionally requires voter approval for local government taxes and some nontax levies such as benefit assessments on real property and certain property-related <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
25|$|Section 6 of Article XIII D {{contains}} the detailed {{procedures and requirements}} applicable to property-related <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges.</b> These procedures and requirements are designed to ensure that any property-related fee or charge levied by a local agency is a legitimate fee or charge and not an unlawful tax imposed without voter approval.|$|E

Bike sharing schemes may be administered by government entities, nonprofit private organisations, or via public-private partnerships.|$|E
25|$|Taxation in the United Kingdom {{may involve}} {{payments}} {{to at least}} two different levels of government: local government and central government (HM Revenue & Customs). Local government is financed by grants from central government funds, business rates, council tax, and, increasingly, <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> such as those from on-street parking. Central government revenues are mainly from income tax, national insurance contributions, value added tax, corporation tax and fuel duty.|$|E
25|$|The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association {{argued that}} the court should look beyond mere {{dictionary}} definitions of “sewer” to examine the legal {{meaning of the term}} in the specific context of how that term is used in Proposition 218. The Association also observed that numerous California statutes differentiated between storm drainage and sewerage systems, including a specific statute that legally authorizes many local governments to levy <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> for storm drainage or sewerage systems.|$|E

25|$|CRA {{approved}} real average tariff {{increases of}} 5 to 10 {{percent per year}} in the service areas of the private company AdeM over the period 2002–07, applying a tariff indexation formula. However, after adjustment for inflation tariffs barely increased. Due to the contract structure, the limited inflation-adjusted increases benefited the public asset holding company FIPAG, not the private operator. FIPAG’s financial performance improved steadily {{as a result of the}} tariff increases. The water company for Maputo has to pay a regulatory fee to CRA, and all licensed water companies have to pay water abstraction charges to the central government for pumping water from rivers or the ground. These <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> are added to the water tariff.|$|E
25|$|The state's {{budget was}} {{released}} on 21 September 2006. It included 1,600 public service job axings despite an election pledge of only 400, however none of the redundancies will be forced. It also included increases in some <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> such as victims of crime levies and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) charges. There were increases in funding for health, schools, police and prisons, and the Department of Public Prosecutions. The 2007–2008 budget released on 13 June 2007 saw additional spending on Transport, Energy and Infrastructure, Health, Families and Communities, and Justice portfolios such as transport initiatives including revitalisation of the rail network, commencement of the $1.7 billion Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital, funding for mental health reform including the delivery of health services, and funding for new commitments to law and order policies.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{every single}} {{operation}} showed a clear profit {{on a full}} costing basis, i.e. inclusive of all overhead costs, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The managing director's authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, i.e. excluding overheads, was outweighed by {{the risk of having}} an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared actual costs and revenues with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring aircraft commanders to pay for all operating expenses other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as ground handling fees, technical support services and catering supplies.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges).</b> Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory interest rate cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E
500|$|Northallerton School's roots can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 1322. [...] Originally sited near the Parish Church, its initial role was to train boys in grammar and song. The school flourished in the 17th century under the mastership of Thomas Smelt, and notable alumni of that period include theologian George Hickes, historiographer royal Thomas Rymer, John Radcliffe, doctor to King William of Orange and theologian Thomas Burnet. The school {{struggled}} in the 19th century and almost closed {{at the start of the}} 20th century with the number of pupils in single figures. However following the 1902 Education Act the North Riding Education Committee resolved to build and restructure the grammar school. To that end a new school was built near the Thirsk Road, which opened in 1909 with 104 pupils, half of whom were girls, the first time that they had been admitted. The school expanded throughout the 20th century. Following the 1944 Education Act, the school entry was based on the Eleven plus exam with all <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> being abolished. In 1973 the grammar school merged with the Secondary Modern Allertonshire School, which opened in 1941, with the Allertonshire taking pupils aged 1114 and the grammar school ages 1418. By 1976 the comprehensive system was adopted and in 1994 the grammar school was renamed Northallerton College to better reflect the school's role in the community. In 2015 Northallerton College merged with Allertonshire School to become a full secondary school, and continues to operate over both former school sites.|$|E
