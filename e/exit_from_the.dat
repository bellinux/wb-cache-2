5|$|After the 1963 season, {{the team}} fell apart. A roster filled with mostly older {{veterans}} plus some bad personnel moves (e.g. the dispatching of Rosey Grier, Sam Huff, and Don Chandler) {{lead to a}} quick <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of the standings. The Giants finished 2–10–2 in 1964, beginning an 18-season playoff drought.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E

5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E

5|$|In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At {{a stroke}} MacGregor lost his {{main source of}} income {{and the support of}} the {{influential}} Bowater family. His choices were, Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria's death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be in his mind unacceptably dull. His only real experience was military, but the manner of his <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Army would make a return there awkward at best.|$|E
