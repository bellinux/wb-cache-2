5000|$|In South Africa, {{the term}} Coloured (also known as Bruinmense, Kleurlinge or Bruin Afrikaners in Afrikaans) {{used to refer}} to {{individuals}} who possess some degree of sub-Saharan ancestry, but not enough to be considered black-African under the law of South Africa. Under Apartheid law there were seven categories of Coloured people: Cape Coloured, Cape Malay, Griqua, Indian, Chinese, or other Asiatic, and Other Coloured - the aim of subdivisions was to enhance the meaning of the larger category of Coloured by making it all encompassing. In contemporary society, however, to redress the unfair privileges of the past Apartheid regime the policy of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) was adopted to level the economic playing <b>field.</b> <b>BEE</b> policy favored indigenous Black Africans for employment, scholarships, government contracts and loans, whereas before such opportunities were strictly reserved for the White minority. Suddenly, the racial hierarchy of the past were reversed; those who suffered the greatest injustices were put first on the list for advancement. African women were of top priority with African men close behind, next came Coloured women followed by Coloured men. Subsequently, Indian men followed Indian women. Legally and politically speaking, all people of color were classified “black” in the non-racialist terms of anti-Apartheid rhetoric of the Black Consciousness Movement. [...] In addition to European ancestry, they may also possess Asian ancestry from immigrants from India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, China and/or Saint Helena. As an interesting note, because Indians did not fall within the definitions of either European or African but were people of color they were classed as “coloureds.” [...] Based on the Population Registration Act to classify people, laws were put in place prohibiting mixed marriages. Therefore, many people that were descendants of the [...] "Asian" [...] category were able to legally intermarry with [...] "mixed-race" [...] people because they shared the same nomenclature. There was extensive combining of these diverse heritages in the Western Cape, but in other parts of southern Africa, the coloured usually were descendants of two primary ethnic groups - primarily Africans of various tribes and European colonists, with generations of coloured forming families.|$|E
40|$|Social insects aggressively {{defend their}} nest and {{surrounding}} against non-nestmates, which they recognize by an unfamiliar profile of aliphatic hydrocarbons on the cuticle. Prominent exceptions are communal nest aggregations of stingless bees. Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are also unique in possessing cuticular terpenes which {{are derived from}} tree resins and {{have not yet been}} reported for any other insect. We showed experimentally that sesquiterpenes from the body surface of the communal nesting bee Tetragonilla collina reduced aggression in otherwise aggressive bees which did not have sesquiterpenes themselves. In the <b>field,</b> <b>bee</b> species nesting in aggregations with T. collina often lack sesquiterpenes in their own cuticular profiles. These species show little aggression towards T. collina, whereas it can be heavily attacked by non-aggregated species that also possess cuticular sesquiterpenes. We conclude that appeasement by sesquiterpenes represents a novel mechanism to achieve interspecific tolerance in social insects...|$|E

Some mortality accured in <b>field</b> <b>bees,</b> but it was not very high and hives were not weakened and brood was not affected. It is considered that DDT emulsion, if applied before bees visist a flowering brassica crop, will cause only slight mortality.

Overall, A. cerana populations in northern Vietnam are significantly morphologically different than from those in Thailand.

40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are {{the main}} pollinating agents for {{numerous}} plants and fruit trees and hence, {{play a key role}} in agriculture and more generally in the maintenance of ecological biodiversity. They are mostly affected farm animals by pesticides. Indeed, pesticides work in two ways to reduce bee populations. First, many pesticides used in crop production are highly toxic to these social insects. Second, the use of herbicides can reduce the acreages of useful plants for the bee activity. Pesticides damages to honey bee colonies take different forms. Honey bees may be poisoned when they feed on nectar or pollen contaminated by pesticides. Bees may also be poisoned when they fly through a cloud of pesticide dust or spray or walk on treated parts of plant. Sometimes, colonies in the hives can be directly affected, but most commonly only <b>field</b> <b>bees</b> are killed or have their physiological functions altered. Toxicity and hazards of 158 pesticides to Apis and non-Apis bees are well reviewed in a study of Devillers et al. (2003). Honey and bee products have the image of being natural, healthy and clean.

It is {{not considered to be}} the cause of Isle of Wight disease of bees. The quarantine against the importation of honey bees into the United States, except from Canada, is based on the probable effect this pest might have on the beekeeping industry. The rediscovery of an external acarapis mite in the United States in 1959, raised the question as to the actual relationship of acarapis mites to bees. The two external mites, Acarapis dorsalis Morgenthaler and Acarapis externus Morgenthaler were subsequently found to be widely scattered in Canada and the United States without any visible symptoms of injury to the bees. It is concluded that they must have been present for many years before any quarantine was levied. The external mites can be distinguished from A. woodi by morphological as well as ecological characters. No evidence of A. woodi was found, and none has ever been reported from either the United States or Canada. The lengths of the developmental periods and the number of forms per individual bee infested were studied.

40|$|International audienceThe global {{atmospheric}} circuit {{generates a}} permanent electric field between the Earth surface and outer atmosphere (Rycroft et al., 2000). The ground and plants conductively linked to it are negatively charged (Bowker and Crenshaw, 2007), whereas animals build up positive charge {{as they move}} in contact with air molecules (Jackson and McGonigle, 2005). Electric fields emanating from plants and pollinators, such as bees, are believed to promote pollination by enabling pollen grains to " jump " from flowers to pol-linators and vice versa (Corbet et al., 1982). Two recent studies reveal that bees not only detect these electric fields but also learn to discriminate them, indicating that electroreception should be seriously considered alongside vision and olfaction when studying bee behavior and ecology. Writing in Science, Clarke et al. (2013) demonstrated that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) detect electric fields around plants and learn {{to use them to}} decide whether or not to visit flowers. Using a Faraday pail to measure electric <b>fields</b> generated by <b>bees</b> and plants, the team described how a bee visit temporarily modifies the electric charge of (Petunia) flowers, suggesting that floral electric properties could be used by future visitors to assess the reward value without necessarily needing to probe the flower. To explore this possibility, the authors used differential conditioning in which bees were trained to associate an electrically charged feeder (30 V) with a sucrose reward (CS+) and an uncharged feeder with an aversive quinine solution (CS−). After extensive training (50 trials), bees chose the rewarding feeder in around 80 % of trials. Similar levels of performance were observed when bees were trained with two feeders carrying the same charge but different electric field patterns (homogeneous vs. bull's eye shape), indicating that these insects can learn both the magnitude and geometry of an electric <b>field.</b> <b>Bees</b> learned to perform even better in discrimination tasks if the two feeders differed both in color (shade of green) and their electric field pattern compared to if they differed only in color. Natural electric fields around flowers may therefore contribute to the multimodal sources of information that bees use to learn and memorize floral rewards, in conjunction with color, pattern, shape, texture...|$|R
