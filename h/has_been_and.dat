5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were {{made over the}} years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H.

The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor for the formation of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft. Neptunium has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons.|$|E
5|$|They {{meet with}} the Valtian ambassador, Chancellor Alrik (Mickey Cottrell), who is uninterested in the {{marriage}} and wants to pursue trade agreements. With the arrangements made, Picard visits Kamala to say goodbye; she tells him that she has permanently bonded with him instead of Alrik. Kamala explains that he has changed her for the better, and will continue in her duty for her people to marry Alrik. At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala {{down the aisle and}} watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds have returned to the planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room. When asked how he resisted Kamala, the expression on Picard's face reveals how much of a struggle it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>and</b> how much he feels he has lost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we discuss some modeling, simulation, {{implementation}} and test issues, with respect {{to the development of the}} GaAs system detector based on a microstrip configuration for medical application. The chosen strip architecture has simple electrodes structure and low channel-capacitance. Different basic strip schemes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed <b>and</b> devised. To reduce the coupling between strip, a structure in which every strip-detector is surrounded by guard-ring <b>has</b> <b>been</b> considered <b>and</b> the performance <b>has</b> <b>been</b> evaluated. Detector fabrication <b>has</b> <b>been</b> completed <b>and</b> test phase <b>is</b> now under way: to this purpose a suitable test environment <b>has</b> <b>been</b> devised <b>and</b> test strategies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> planned...|$|R
