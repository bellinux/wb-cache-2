5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet. As with the earlier Fuji-class battleships, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom. They were ordered {{as part of the}} Ten Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid <b>for</b> <b>from</b> the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895.|$|E

5|$|Hatsuse, {{named after}} the Hase-dera temple, which was famous for its maple trees, was ordered {{as part of the}} 10 Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid <b>for</b> <b>from</b> the £30,000,000 {{indemnity}} paid by China after losing the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895.

5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay <b>for</b> <b>From</b> Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations. In particular, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up programme, {{with the construction of}} six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core. These ships were paid <b>for</b> <b>from</b> the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
50|$|He {{was one of}} the {{two members}} of {{parliament}} <b>for</b> Westminster <b>from</b> 1779 to 1780, a member <b>for</b> Lostwithiel <b>from</b> 1781 to 1784, <b>for</b> Okehampton <b>from</b> 1785 to 1790, and <b>for</b> Radnor <b>from</b> 1794 to 1799.|$|R
50|$|He was Member of Parliament (MP) <b>for</b> Horsham <b>from</b> 1818 to 1820 (while {{below the}} age of 21), <b>for</b> Steyning <b>from</b> 1820 to 1824, <b>for</b> Kidderminster <b>from</b> 1835 to 1837, and <b>for</b> Poole <b>from</b> 1837 to 1852.|$|R

5|$|In 1948, the ACLU {{prevailed in}} the McCollum v. Board of Education case, which {{challenged}} public school religious classes taught by clergy paid <b>for</b> <b>from</b> private funds. The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms. In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of secular music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, <b>for</b> <b>from</b> three to six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E
5|$|London {{became the}} largest and most populous {{metropolitan}} area in the world during the Victorian era, and trade within the British Empire—as well as the standing of the British military and navy—was prestigious. Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage. Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies. Two decades later, in World War II, the United Kingdom was again one of the Allies. At the end of the Phoney War, Winston Churchill became the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation, and there was a speeding up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel. Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. The UK's NHS provided publicly funded health care to all UK permanent residents free at the point of need, being paid <b>for</b> <b>from</b> general taxation. Combined, these changes prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{forged a}} highly {{successful}} career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award <b>for</b> <b>From</b> Here to Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward {{the end of his}} career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy's death Sinatra's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.|$|E
5|$|The climactic {{underwater}} {{battle was}} shot at Clifton Pier and was choreographed by Hollywood expert Ricou Browning, who had worked on Creature From the Black Lagoon in 1954 and other films. He {{was responsible for the}} staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath the Disco Volante and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in the onslaught. Voit provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for product placement and film tie-in merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Russhon, who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey <b>for</b> <b>From</b> Russia with Love (1963) and at Fort Knox for Goldfinger (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the Disco Volante. Russhon, using his position, was also able {{to gain access to the}} United States Navy's Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, used to lift Bond and Domino from the water at the end of the film. Filming ceased in May 1965, and the final scene shot was the physical fight on the bridge of the Disco Volante.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{was first}} {{performed}} on 13 June 1997 at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall during the 50th Aldeburgh Festival. Sally Burgess {{was accompanied by}} the ENO Contemporary Opera Studio conducted by Nicholas Kok. The companion piece was the chamber opera The Country of the Blind which Turnage had composed relatively quickly {{in order to make}} up a full programme after Twice had turned out much shorter than originally intended. To Turnage's surprise, ENO decided to follow up the original four performances, split between Snape Maltings and the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with a staging at its main home in the London Coliseum. This production was premiered on 20 October 1997 with Susan Bickley as the soloist and with Kok again conducting. In this context it was a companion piece <b>for</b> <b>From</b> the House of the Dead, an opera set in a Siberian prison camp.|$|E
