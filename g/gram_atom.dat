Various {{amounts of the}} polycations were added to Na-kaolinite, Na-mont-morillonite, and a Na-soil clay and {{the effect on the}} flocculation of the clay and electrophoretic mobility compared. Flocculation occurred just before zero net charge was obtained. Addition of further polycation resulted in the dispersion of clay with a net positive charge. The A 1 polycations possessed a high positive charge (0. 49 per <b>gram</b> <b>atom</b> of Al), and their interaction with the clays indicated a planar shape. Adsorption of AI polycations decreased markedly the cation-exchange capacities of the kaolinite and the soil clay but had little effect on surface areas determined by low-temperature N 2 adsorption. The Fe polycations were spheres 10 - 100 A in diameter with a positive charge of 0. 2 per <b>gram</b> <b>atom.</b> The surface areas of the kaolinite and the soil clay were substantially increased by the addition of the Fe polycations but their cation-exchange capacities were reduced by one fifth. A 1 polycations increased the surface areas of the montmorillonite (o 300 m 2) presumably b propping open the interlamellar spaces and rendering the a-b planes accessible for nitrogen adsorption. The A 1 polycations in intedamellar spaces prevented collapse to 14 A on heating to 150 ~ There was no evidence of regular interlayer Fe as might be anticipated from the size of the spheres...|$|E

40|$|A cadmium-binding protein was {{isolated}} from {{roots of the}} grass Agrostis gigantea Roth. Heat-stable proteins were chromatographed on the anion exchanger QAE-Sephadex A- 25. The major cadmium fraction was purified further by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 75 in 1 molar KCl buffer. The resulting protein preparation was light brown, had an apparent molecular weight of 3700, contained 29 % cysteine and close to 4 <b>gram</b> <b>atoms</b> cadmium/mole. The cadmium:cysteine ratio was 1 : 2. 7. Spectroscopic measurements indicated cadmium-thiolate coordination.

40|$|Cd-binding protein was {{extracted}} from tomato roots and purified on QAE-Sephadex A- 25 and on Sephadex G- 75 in 1 molar KCl buffer. The protein preparation was light brown and contained predominantly Cd and {{small amounts of}} Zn and Cu. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6. 9 removed the brown material from protein which now bound mostly Cd and some Cu. The apparent molecular weight was 3, 100 daltons in high ionic strength medium (1 molar KCl buffer) and 21, 500 daltons at low ionic strength. Ionic strength also affected the apparent molecular weight of the Cd-binding protein in crude root extracts. The protein contained 26 % cysteine, 53 % glutamic acid/glutamine, and 2. 8 <b>gram</b> <b>atoms</b> (Cd+Zn+Cu) /mole. The (Cd+Zn+Cu) :cysteine ratio was 1 : 2. 3.

Two “biochemicals,” succinate and acetate, were also tested for comparison. Yields were calculated on the basis of grams of cells obtained per mole of substrate utilized, <b>gram</b> <b>atom</b> of carbon utilized, mole of oxygen consumed, and equivalent of “available electrons” in the substrates.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{lipoxygenase}} isoenzymes {{were identified in}} developing soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill cv Provar) seeds and two have been partially characterized. In a study of lipoxygenase level in developing soybean seeds, the enzyme content increased markedly during development. Comparisons of the lipoxygenases from mature soybean seeds and immature seeds by isoelectric focusing, chromatofocusing, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mapping identified two categories of isoenzyme. The isoenzymes from immature seeds were found by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to be isolated {{at least in part}} as the high spin iron(III) or active form of the enzyme in contrast to lipoxygenases from mature seeds which were isolated as electron paramagnetic resonance silent, high spin iron(II) species. The discovery of increased levels of lipoxygenases during seed development and their isolation in an active form suggests that the enzyme may play a physiological role during the maturation process. The incorporation of iron- 59 from the nutrient medium into lipoxygenase during culture of immature seeds was indicative of de novo synthesis of the enzyme. The efficiency of the iron uptake was high, as indicated by the level of radioactivity found in the enzyme (one <b>gram</b> <b>atom</b> of iron per mole of lipoxygenase) ...|$|E
40|$|Bacteroides fragilis is a gram negative, {{anaerobic}} rod, that is {{a member}} of the normal colonic microflora of most mammals, and it is the anaerobe most commonly isolated from human soft-tissue infections. During the past decade, strains of B. fragilis that produce an enterotoxin have been implicated as the cause of diarrhea in a number of animals, including humans. The extracellular enterotoxin has been purified and characterized as a single polypeptide (Mr ~ 20, 600) that causes rapid morphological changes in human colon carcinoma cell lines, particularly, HT- 29. This dissertation research began in 1993 with the purpose of determining how this enterotoxin, termed fragilysin, causes diarrhea. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a signature zinc-binding consensus motif (His-Glu-Xx-Xxx-His-Xxx-Xxx-Gly-Xxx-Xxx-His/Met) characteristic of metalloproteinases. Sequence analysis showed close identity with metalloproteinases within the zinc-binding and Met-turn regions. Purified fragilysin contained 1 <b>gram</b> <b>atom</b> of zinc per molecule, and it hydrolyzed a number of proteins, including gelatin. Optimal proteolytic activity occurred at 37 °C and pH 6. 5. Activity was inhibited by metal chelators but not by inhibitors of other classes of proteinases. When fragilysin is injected into ligated ileal and colonic loops of animals, there is significant tissue damage and a subsequent dose dependent fluid response...|$|E
40|$|Formate {{dehydrogenase}} H from Escherichia col contains multiple redox centers, {{which include}} a molybdopterin cofactor, an iron-sulfur center, and a selenocysteine residue (SeCys- 140 in the polypeptide chain) that is essential for catalytic activity. Here we show that addition of formate to the native enzyme induces a signal typical of Mo(V) species. This signal is detected by electron pm etc resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Substitution of 77 Se for natural isotope abundance Se leads to transformation of this signal, indicating a direct coordination of Se with Mo. Mutant enzyme with cysteine substituted at position 140 for the selenocysteine residue has decreased catalytic activity and exhibits a different EPR signal. Since deternation of the Se content of wild-type enzyme indicates 1 <b>gram</b> <b>atom</b> per mol, we conclude {{that it is the}} Se atom of the SeCys- 140 residue in the protein that is coordinated directly with Mo. The amino acd sequence flanking the selenocysteine residue in formate dehydrogenase H is s r to a conserved sequence found in several other prokaryotic molybdopterin-dependent enzymes. In most of these other enzymes a cysteine residue, or in a few cases a serine or a selenocysteine residue, occurs in the position corresonding to SeCys- 140 of formate dehydrogeme H. By analogy with formate dehydrogenase H in these other enzymes, {{at least one of the}} ilgands to Mo should be provided by an amino acid residue of the protein. This igand could be the Se of a selenocysteine residue, sulfur of a cysteine residue, or, in the case of a serine residue, oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Most sulfosalts may be {{regarded}} as intermediate phases on joins between simple sulfide components (e. g., all lead sulfbismuthinides lie on the PbS-Bi 2 Sa join). Many of the structures are characterized by subunits whose individual structures {{are similar to those}} of the component simple sulfides (e. g., galena-like and stibnite-like layers in the lead sulfantimonides). Therefore, as a first approximation one may estimate the properties of many sulfosalts in terms of mixtures of the simple sulfides. Recent work has shown that the free energy of reaction from the end-member sulfides, AGra, for more than 20 sulfosalts is usually less negative than the hypothetical ideal free energy of mixing and that the standard free energy of formation, AG ø, per <b>gram</b> <b>atom</b> of sulfur in the formula may be represented as: AG ø = (NaAGa øq- [...] . NiAGi ø) q- (1. 2 4 - 0. 8) (NaRT In N • q- [...] . NiRT In N 0 where Ni is the mole fraction of the i-th simple sulfide component, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in kelvins. The first term is far larger than the second. Esti-mates made for compounds in which the structural environment for the metals is quite different from that in the end-member sulfides, e. g., enargite, are subject o the greatest uncertainty. The estimated free energies may permit prediction of solubilities to a precision sufficient for many purposes, e. g., for H. C. Helgeson's computer-modeled hydrothermal systems. One may introduce some predictive capability into experimental design and anticipate some aspects of phase diagrams. This is especially true for redox reactions such as the behavior of proustire in the oxidized zone or the partial reduction of jamesonire to antimony q- galena q- pyrrhotite. However, other aspects, such as the prediction of the configuration of joins, e. g., PbS-As 2 Sa, requires greater precision than the present rough estimates...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves [153]- 162. xiii, 162 l illus., tablesBeef (steer) liver {{mitochondrial}} amine oxidase {{was prepared}} {{according to the}} method reported earlier (Adv. Pharmacol., 6, Part A, 43, 1968). In addition to the usual preparation with high activity, (component 2, specific activity of 8, 000) another component of the enzyme (component 1) with lower activity (specific activity 3, 000) was isolated (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., submitted). Studies were made on some {{physical and chemical properties}} of these two components. The amine oxidase components were bright yellow in color; they were thermolabile, and unstable at room temperature. The rate of inactivation of component 2 was faster than that of component 1. The optimum pH for activity was found to be 9. 2. Both the components were non-competitively inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Metal chelators like cuprizone, 8 -hydroxyquinoloine, o-phenanthroline inhibited the enzyme components. Ammonia or aldehyde reagents did not have significant effects on the activity. Both the components had almost the same substrate specificity. The molecular weights of the enzyme component 1 was found to be 400, 000 by the gel filtration technique, 396, 000 ± 10, 000 on the basis of Stoke's radius, sedimentation coefficient, and partial specific volume, and 425, 000 ± 10, 000 on the basis of sedimentation diffusion method. These values for component 2 were 1, 300, 000, 1, 195, 000, and 1, 355, 000, respectively. The sedimentation coefficients of component 1 and component 2 were 14. 4 ± 0. 3 and 20. 6, respectively. Metal analyses of the enzyme yielded 1 <b>gram</b> <b>atom</b> of copper per 400, 000 grams or 3 gram atoms of the metal per mole of component 2. Other metals, such as cobalt, iron, manganese, and molybdenum were examined and found to be either absent or insignificant (J. Biol. Chem., 241, 2774, 1966). Both the components of the mitochondrial enzyme were found to be flavoproteins. This was amply proved (1) from their riboflavin content as determined microbiologically, and spectrophotometrically (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 23, 324, 1966), (2) from a steady increase of riboflavin during purification processes, and (3) from the spectrum of flavo-peptide obtained from pronase digest of the enzyme. Besides, the prosthetic group was found to contain ribose (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 29, 562, 1967), adenine and phosphorus in integral values suggesting that the "flavin prosthetic" group was a flavin adenine dinucleotide of unknown structure. Accordingly, component 1 contained 4 and component 2 contained 12 FAD or FAD-like substance per mole, respectively. Examination of the sulfhydryl groups revealed that components 1 and 2 of the enzyme contained 28 and 86 titratable sulfhydryl residues, respectively in their molecules, and that they were not directly involved in enzyme catalysis. In addition, the enzyme was found to contain 24 and 106 moles of phospholipid in components 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, it appeared that the high molecular weight component was the native form from which the small molecular component arose during the purification of the enzyme, although no interconversions were observed with the purified enzyme preparations...|$|E
