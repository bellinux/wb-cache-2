Le Brocquy later died, in 2012. The Edge had brought le Brocquy's work to Steinberg's attention, and she became convinced that his paintings could be interpreted through dance. The music for Cold Dream Colour is composed by The Edge in collaboration with Paul Chavez (known for his experimental electronic compositions under the project name <b>FeltLike).</b> Besides sharing in the choreography and lighting design for the work, Steinberg also staged a solo dance as well as a duet with her sister. Oguri also had roles as choreographer and dancer. The work had its US première at REDCAT in Los Angeles in 2012; a review in the Los Angeles Times said that [...] "Visceral expressionism and a prodigious visual beauty coalesced ... a striking visual success", but that it was less certain whether the nature of le Brocquy's paintings had been conveyed to the less-familiar American audience. Excerpts from Cold Dream Colour were performed at the Guggenheim Museum's Works & Process series for two nights in 2013 in New York, with Irish broadcaster John Kelly moderating a discussion of the work with its creators. The US Cold Dream Colour was presented by Arcane Collective, a production company that Steinberg and Oguri had co-founded in Spring 2011.

5000|$|Paul Chavez (born July 1, 1964) is an American {{composer}} {{of dance}} music, and a sound designer for installation and theater. He often composes under the project name <b>FeltLike.</b> Chavez {{has worked in}} the Los Angeles, California area since 1990 where he did some of his first works at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions [...] where he started as a sound engineer. Chavez's music is influenced by the minimalism of Steve Reich and Paul Dresher and the experimental music of Robert Ashley and Laurie Anderson. His work has been featured at the REDCAT Theater in Los Angeles (part of the Walt Disney Concert Hall) and his recent score for the Arcane Collective's dance work Cold Dream Colour was created in collaboration with U2's The Edge. [...] Chavez has developed a style of composition over the past twenty years that involves creating the initial sound score independently from the choreography. The score is then brought together with the dance just prior to the performance and a sound collage is created. Often the work is mixed and modified live during the dance performance using multiple playback sources such as multitrack computers, CDs, and live instruments.|$|E
50|$|This {{evergreen}} tree {{grows up}} to 40 meters tall and usually up to a meter wide, sometimes up to 1.5 meters or more. The trunk is straight and cylindrical with fissures and flaking bark. The sap is honey-colored and turns red in time. The branches are in whorls. The leathery leaves {{are up to}} 31 centimeters long by 9 wide. The blades have pointed tips, heart-shaped bases, and thick midribs. They are hairless on top and coated with rusty, <b>feltlike</b> hairs on the undersides. The leaves usually bear signs of insect damage, a feature so common it is considered characteristic of the species. The flowers are arranged in dense, rusty panicles up to 15 centimeters long. The individual flowers are difficult {{to see in the}} tight panicle until the stamens develop, being only about a millimeter long. The flowers are hairy and fragrant. The fruit is a rounded drupe reaching over 3 centimeters long and wide, borne in clusters. It is hairy brown when new, turning yellow-orange, and has cartilaginous flesh that dries woody. It contains a black seed with a red aril which resembles that of nutmeg. The fruit ripens over a long period continuing into the next flowering season, which begins around October.|$|E

40|$|Cells {{in culture}} exposed to cytochalasin D (CD) rapidly undergo a long-sustained tonic contraction. Coincident with this {{contracture}} the thin microfilaments of the cortex become compacted into <b>feltlike</b> masses. The ravelled filaments of these masses remain actinlike and bind heavy meromyosin; {{they are not}} disrupted or disaggregated, but rather, appear to represent a contracted state of the microfilament apparatus of the cell cortex. On continued exposure to CD, 'myoid ' bundles, containing thick, dense filaments, and larger fusiform or ribbonlike, putatively myosinoid, aggregates may appear. These appearances are interpreted as consequences {{of a state of}} hypercontraction without relaxation induced by CD. They do not occur in CD-treated cells prevented from contracting by inhibitors of energy metabolism, and are readily reversible on withdrawal of CD. Extensive ordered arrays of thin microfilaments develop in cells which are reextending during early recovery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The human cornea was {{studied by}} using {{transmission}} and scanning electron microscopic techniques. The human corneal epithelium had {{five to six}} cell layers which had sparse accumulation of cytoplasmic organelles. Cell-to-cell junctions in the corneal epithelium were desmosomes, gap junctions and tight junctions of the outermost apical cell layer which also had a second membrane specialization, microplicae. The attachment of basal cells to the subjacent stroma was mediated by the adhesion complex, comprising hemidesmosornes, basement membrane, and the anchoring fibrils. Bowman's layer was an acellular zone, consisting of collagen fibrils densely woven in a random manner into a <b>feltlike</b> matrix. The lamellar stroma was comprised of flattened bundle of collagen fibrils oriented in a parallel manner. Descemet's membrane had two distinct regions, the anterior fetal layer and the posterior layer which appeared as amorphous matrix. The corneal endothelium was a single layered, low cuboidal cell which contained prominent mitochondria. Studies of this- morphological characteristics of normal cornea will be helpll in {{a better understanding of}} the pathological processes of various corneal diseases...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Light and {{electron}} microscope immunohistochemical methods {{were used to}} study the distribution of several proteins in rat skeletal muscle. The aims were to identify components of muscle fiber basement membrane and to compare the small fraction (0. 1 %) of the basement membrane that extends through the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction with the remaining, extrasynaptic portion. Synaptic basement membrane is functionally specialized and plays important roles in neuromuscular function and regeneration. Laminin, fibronectin, Collagen IV, Collagen V, and a collagenous protein (high-salt-soluble protein [HSP]) are all present in muscle fiber basement membrane. Laminin and Collagen IV are concentrated in basal lamina (the <b>feltlike,</b> inner layer of the basement membrane) and are shared by synaptic and extrasynaptic regions. Fibronectin, also present synaptically and extrasynaptically, is present in basal lamina and in the overlying reticular lamina. Collagen V and HSP are present throughout extrasynaptic basement membrane but are absent from synaptic sites; HSP is concentrated in the reticular lamina and on the outer surface of the basal lamina. These results, together with experiments reported previously (Sanes and Hall, 1979, /. Cell Biol. 83 : 357 - 370), provide examples of three classes of components in muscle fiber basement membranesynaptic...|$|E
40|$|Some {{time ago}} the Leyden Museum {{received}} from Mr. Jackson Demery, the Liberian correspondent of Dr. Büttikofer, a small consignment of beetles collected at Robertsport, Grand Cape Mount (Western Liberia). Among these beetles I found {{a certain number}} of specimens (males and females) of a Cetoniid which was not yet represented in previous consignments received from that country 1). This species proved to be Coenochilus maurus Fabr., of which a description with figures and synonymy 2) is given by Westwood in his splendid »Thesaurus Entomologicus Oxoniensis” (p. 34, pl. XI, figs. 5 and 5 a). As, however, Westwood has derived the description from a single specimen (the Fabrician type) and the figure drawn from an other (Gory’s typical specimen) whereas I myself have several males and females before me, I can state that Westwood is wrong in supposing the small notch in the lateral margins of the prothorax (see fig. 5) to be due to an injury: it is very distinct in almost all our specimens; the minute circular impressions on the disc before the middle, however, are much less constant: in several of my specimens they are wanting, in others they are four in number and irregularly arranged. As to the legs Westwood says: »the posterior margin of the four hind legs is clothed with luteous hairs”, but this is not correct: the posterior margin (under side) of the fore- and middle legs (femora) is clothed with luteous hairs, which are much more densely set (<b>feltlike)</b> in the male than in the female. — The middle of the abdomen is flattened in the male, convex in the female, the pygidium transverse in the male, more triangular in the female, and the calcaria of the hind tibiae are more slender and acute in the male, broader and more obtuse in the female...|$|E
