He argued that if Acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported <b>Fampridine</b> SR's development”.

5000|$|... 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP, INN <b>fampridine,</b> USAN dalfampridine) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C5H4N-NH2. The molecule {{is one of}} the three isomeric amines of pyridine. It is used as a research tool in characterizing subtypes of the potassium channel. It has also been used as a drug, to manage some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and is indicated for symptomatic improvement of walking in adults with several variations of the disease. It was undergoing Phase III clinical trials , and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the compound on January 22, 2010. <b>Fampridine</b> is also marketed as Ampyra (pronounced [...] "am-PEER-ah," [...] according to the maker's website) in the United States by Acorda Therapeutics and as Fampyra in Europe.

40|$|ObjectiveThe aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>fampridine</b> on verbal fluencies in MS patients and to compare the supposed cognitive effect with the gait effect. DesignOur study was a prospective monocentric open label trial. Thirty-one MS patients were included (42 % primary progressive MS, 45 % secondarly progressive MS, 13 % relapsing-remitting MS) with a mean EDSS of 5. 43. Assessments of verbal phonological and semantic fluencies were repeated twice (within one week) before <b>fampridine</b> treatment, and twice after <b>fampridine</b> treatment. Gait velocity was measured before and after <b>fampridine</b> treatment. Post-hoc analyses were performed in order to limit the impact of the practice effect. ResultsVerbal fluencies were significantly improved by <b>fampridine</b> treatment (P< 0. 05). Phonological fluency showed greater improvement than semantic fluency after <b>fampridine</b> treatment. No significant difference on verbal fluency performance was observed between gait responders and non-responders groups. ConclusionThe results suggest a specific cognitive effect of treatment with <b>fampridine.</b> There is an improvement in verbal influences mainly phonological, which implies an action on executive functions...|$|E

30|$|Fifty pwMS were {{included}} in this study. The PERSEPP scale and the GaitRite system were used to evaluate QoL and gait respectively.

30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the <b>fampridine</b> effect in terms of gait and HRQoL should bring new insights into its direct and indirect role in individuals with MS. Therefore, this study proposed (1) to evaluate the contribution of <b>fampridine</b> in the HRQoL of individuals with MS and (2) to determine if improvements in HRQoL are more important for walk respondents than for those who seem not to respond to <b>fampridine.</b>|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to explore the {{short-term}} effects of <b>fampridine</b> in the HRQoL of patients with MS and then to determine if the so-called walking respondents seem to better benefit from <b>fampridine</b> treatment in terms of HRQoL. First of all, our results pointed out that <b>fampridine</b> can improve HRQoL in patients with MS as well as their gait. Secondly, contrary to what we could expect, HRQoL improved in both non-respondent and respondent groups. However, for the same rate of overall improvement in HRQoL in both groups, the HRQoL sub-indices that showed significant improvement after treatment were different between the two. This suggests that, as <b>fampridine</b> acts primarily on neurological function, benefits could be perceived differently in groups with different motor impairments.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Gait {{impairment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} disabling symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). <b>Fampridine,</b> has demonstrated a positive effect on gait speed in PwMS after 14 days of treatment but the long-term effects have not yet been demonstrated. This study reviews the long-term effects of <b>fampridine</b> on gait in PwMS. SUMMARY: This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. Studies were considered long term if treatment exceeded 28 days. From the 498 studies identified, 18 (2, 200 patients) fulfilled all eligibility criteria. Only 3 studies followed-up patients for > 1 year and one of these showed a non-significant improvement in the gait speed.

30|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the contribution of <b>fampridine</b> on the QoL of pwMS and to determine if improvements in QoL are best associated with walk respondents.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{our study}} showed that {{patients}} with MS improved their HRQoL after <b>fampridine,</b> suggesting a real benefit in their lives. Both non-respondent and respondent groups improved their HRQoL although important effects were seen only in the respondent group. To finish, the contributions to overall HRQoL improvement seem different after <b>fampridine</b> between the non-respondent and respondent groups. The Fatigue and Relationship difficulties indices contributed significantly to overall improvement for HRQoL in the respondent group whereas, in the non-respondent group, it was Time perspective that seemed to better contribute to overall improvement in HRQoL.|$|E
30|$|Considering that an {{improvement}} in walking or functioning capacities may encompass several objectives (e.g., velocity, endurance, dexterity, comfort), recent studies took into account other tests related to MS symptoms (e.g., gait, arm function, fatigue) and found that <b>fampridine</b> may impact on capacities beyond walking function (Allart et al. 2015; Pavsic et al. 2015). Allart et al. (2015) found that 74  % of patients with MS could potentially benefit in some way from <b>fampridine.</b> This was particularly true for fast walkers who completed the T 25 FW in less than 8  s.|$|E
30|$|Studies {{have shown}} that MS {{symptomatic}} treatment by <b>fampridine</b> (4 -aminopyridine) is associated with improvements in walking and muscle strength (Allart et al. 2015; Rabadi et al. 2013; Hobart et al. 2013; Goodman et al. 2009, 2010), and possibly with cognition (Jensen et al. 2014), vision, fatigue and spasticity (for a review see Jensen et al. 2014). Indeed, <b>fampridine</b> is a potassium channel blocker which reduces the leakage of ionic current through these channels, prolonging repolarization and thus, enhancing action-potential formation in demyelinated axons (Targ and Kocsis 1985). Presumably, by enhancing action-potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and neurological functions could be ameliorated (Jensen et al. 2014; Hayes et al. 2004). In recent phase III studies, Goodman et al. (2009, 2010) investigated the <b>fampridine</b> effect on the walk of individuals with MS during a timed 25 -foot walk test (T 25 FW). Improvement in walking velocity (≈ 25  % from baseline) was found for 35 – 43  % of the individuals in the interventional group.|$|E
30|$|However, this {{prospective}} non-randomized study presents several limitations. First of all, {{the absence}} of a placebo group might have overestimated the <b>fampridine</b> effect in HRQoL. However, in phase III <b>fampridine</b> clinical trials, the percentage of patients who met the responder criterion in the placebo group was around 9  % in motor and cognitive outcomes suggesting a weak placebo effect (Goodman et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2014). Secondly, despite the effort to use a specific validated HRQoL questionnaire, at the moment there is no threshold that we could consider as MICD for the PERSEPP. This should be suitable for the non-respondent group whose medium effect sizes were found. Third, in spite {{of the importance of the}} HRQoL, it is important to be aware of the bias related with self-report questionnaires, which can be influenced by memory deficits or the desire to please the health-care provider. To finish, as with the majority of studies, the <b>fampridine</b> effect was assessed during a short distance test (i.e., the T 25 FW found for several studies). Although its applicability in clinical practice, this gait test represents neither the range of everyday gait activities (e.g., walking long distances or up and down stairs) nor the participations that result from the walking activity (e.g., going for a walk, shopping, social activities). A recent European multicenter study found that long walking tests were more appropriate than short walking ones in detecting clinically meaningful improvement (Baert et al. 2014). The choice of a gait tests may influence the responder group allocation. The encouraging results of the <b>fampridine</b> on HRQoL should be confirmed by a larger randomized double blind placebo controlled trials.|$|E
30|$|Taking into {{consideration}} HRQoL, significant medium effects {{were found for}} all patients with MS. Both groups of non-respondents and respondents presented quite similar values at baseline and after <b>fampridine</b> for all indices (no significant difference between groups). However, the contribution of sub-indices to the Overall index seems different between groups. Indices with {{a significant difference in}} the respondent group were Fatigue and Relationship difficulties. These indices seem more related to physical components (see the items of PERSEPP Baroin et al. 2013), suggesting an association with gait improvement on the basis of spatiotemporal parameters. In more detail, the Fatigue index is related to tiredness levels and the rest time of a patient. The respondent group showed the most improvement for this index and scored 18 – 22 percentage points more than the baseline, unlike the non-respondent group which still scored the same value as the baseline. It is probable that <b>fampridine</b> has an important role in fatigue as previously suggested in a study which demonstrated a decrease in general fatigue intensity after <b>fampridine</b> (Allart et al. 2015). The second index, Relationship difficulties, concerns more specifically the interactions with others (work, family, and partner/spouse). Improvement in walking velocity (even if it still very low in the respondent group) is one of the best predictors of a person’s independence (Fritz and Lusardi 2009) and related to fall risk (Hars et al. 2013; Cattaneo et al. 2002). This improvement is noted at Post 2 (21  days after <b>fampridine)</b> and it is only after some time with gait improvement that patients are able to observe a change in their social lives.|$|E

30|$|The {{non-respondent}} {{group in}} turn showed {{improvement in the}} Time perspective index.

Time perspective seems associated with cognitive functioning (Ernst et al. 2014) or depressive tendencies (Baroin et al. 2013), which may both be modulated by <b>fampridine.</b>|$|E
30|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that, based {{exclusively}} on walking velocity, only some patients respond with clear clinical benefits to <b>fampridine</b> treatment (Goodman et al. 2009, 2010; Jensen et al. 2014).

30|$|Even if walking {{disorders}} {{are considered the}} main symptoms of patients with MS, it is well recognized {{that they do not}} reflect all the facets that patients consider important in their life. Fatigue, relationship difficulties or sleep {{disorders are}} many other examples of a person’s experience with MS. These symptoms could be influenced by walking disorders which in turn could be treated by <b>fampridine</b> (as per the ANSM guidelines) and thus assessed by specific HRQoL and spatiotemporal gait parameters.|$|E
30|$|From the {{perspectives}} of gait and HRQoL, even after classifying patients into non-respondent and respondent groups, we found an improvement. However, large effect sizes for different spatiotemporal gait parameters and HRQoL indices were found for the respondent group. Furthermore, the respondent group surpassed the threshold of Minimally Important Clinical Difference (MICD) reported by Coleman et al. (2012) (i.e., for walking velocity d =  0.49). In spite of this fact, the non-respondent group was nearly {{twice as fast as}} the respondent group and should not be selected for <b>fampridine</b> treatment. As suggested by a previous study (Allart et al. 2015), fast walkers seem to benefit less from <b>fampridine</b> based on walking velocity as a unique point of view. It is important to bear in mind that, even in this non-respondent group, gait velocity was still impaired when compared with normative values. Indeed, the walking velocity assessed in the fast condition in this study for the non-respondent group corresponds to the velocity of a group of women (n =  5013) aged 10  years more and at their self-selected velocity as reported in the Bohannon and Andrews meta-analysis (Bohannon 2006).|$|E
30|$|For all patients, <b>fampridine</b> had {{significant}} effects (p =  0.05 – 10 − 4, d =  0.25 – 0.45) on the Overall, Relationship difficulties, Fatigue, Time perspective and Symptoms QoL indices and for gait parameters (p =  0.05 – 10 − 4, d =  0.17 – 0.38). Non-respondents scored significant effects (p <  0.05 – 0.01, d =  0.32 – 0.41) for Overall, Time perspective and Symptoms QoL indices, whereas respondents scored significant effects (p <  0.05 – 0.01, d =  0.51 – 0.8) for Overall, Relationship difficulties, Fatigue and Symptoms.|$|E
30|$|According to {{the gait}} {{velocity}} evolution (%) between Pre 1 and Post 1 (i.e., before 14  days after <b>fampridine</b> treatment {{as recommended by}} the ANSM), patients were then classified into two groups: respondents whose gait velocity improved (in the fast condition) by over 25  % related to the baseline and non-respondents whose gait velocity did not improve by over 25  %. This conservative threshold corresponds to the average improvement that was maintained throughout the treatment period in the Goodman et al. (2009) study.|$|E
40|$|Herbert R Henney III, Andrew R BlightAcorda Therapeutics, Inc, Hawthorne, NY, USAAbstract: Walking {{impairment}} is {{a clinical}} hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) {{that has been}} under-recognized as a therapeutic target for pharmacologic intervention. The development and approval of dalfampridine extended release tablets (dalfampridine-ER; known as prolonged-, modified, or sustained-release <b>fampridine</b> outside the USA), 10 mg taken twice daily, to improve walking in patients with MS, fills a previously unmet need. In three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, dalfampridine-ER improved walking speed in approximately one-third (37 %) of treated patients, and average walking speed on therapy among these responders improved by approximately 25 % relative to baseline. Walking-speed improvement among responders was clinically significant, as determined by a statistically significant improvement in the patient-reported 12 -item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale. Long-term extension studies indicate that responders were able to maintain benefits, compared with nonresponders over prolonged periods of treatment. Dalfampridine-ER was generally well tolerated. Dizziness, insomnia, balance disorder, headache, nausea, urinary tract infection, and asthenia were the most common adverse events. Although the incidence of seizures appeared to be dose related, among patients treated with dalfampridine-ER in the three trials, the rate of seizures was 0. 25 %. These efficacy and safety data suggest that dalfampridine-ER can be a useful and clinically relevant addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium {{for the management of}} MS symptoms and disabilities. Because of its narrow therapeutic index and potential for seizures, it is especially important in the clinical setting to adhere to the dosing recommended in the approved labels.

30|$|To finish, {{it seems}} that there is no convincing {{clinical}} profile of patients’ responsiveness to <b>fampridine</b> with our study. The EDSS was the only clinical factor which was significantly different between the non-respondent and respondent groups. The only difference was that individuals in the non-respondent group were categorized as “Disability precludes full daily activities” whereas those in the respondent group were categorized as “Assistance required to walk”. This difference was not found in previous studies which did not identify any predictive factors for effectiveness (Allart et al. 2015; Goodman et al. 2009, 2010) in spite of the EDSS mean values which had in all cases a worse value in the respondent group.|$|E
