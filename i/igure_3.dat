40|$|Subsurface {{investigations}} were {{undertaken in}} permafros t a r e a s {{in connection with}} the engineering design of two potential major mining developments in the eas te rn Canadian Arctic. These a r e the Asbestos Hill and the Baffinland I ron Pro jec ts (Figure 1). Asbestos Hill is located in the northernmost par t of the Province of Quebec, 30 mi les from Hudson Strai t in the continuous permafros t zone. The project i s owned by Asbestos Corporation Limited and included in the init ial plans, provisions for a mine, an adjacent t rea tment plant to produce 100, 030 tons of asbes tos f ibre annually, a nearby townsite fo r a n initial population of 503 people, a 40 mile gravel road f r o m the Asbestos Hill plant s i te to Deception Bay, an inlet of Hudson Strai t, where a wharf and storage facil i t ies were proposed (~ i g u r e 2). Site investigations required for foundation design of the various buildings and facil i t ies of this project took place intermittently between 1962 and 1964. The Baffinland I ron Development is located at Mary River in northern Baffin Island, 303 mi le s north of the Arct ic Circle, and i s the property of Baffinland I ron Mines Limited. Engineering site inve stiga-tions were c a r r i e d out in the Spring of 1965 f o r a prel iminary design and feasibilit) :. study. In i t s present layout, the project consis ts of mining and crushing facil i t ies a t Mary River for an init ial production of 2, 300, 003 tons of high grade d i rec t shipping o r e per yea r, a townsite f o r 1, 000 people, a 60 mile ra i l road, a wharf, extensive s torage and reclamation installations a t Milne Inlet (F <b>igure</b> <b>3)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{piece of}} i ron single crysta l about 2 mm in d iam-eter and 10 mm long {{was used for}} the exper iments descr ibed below. One end of this rod was {{sharpened}} to a t runcated wedge by gr ind ing and then etching with hydroch lor ic acid. A smal l permanent magnet (coercive force about 300 Oersted) was at tached {{to the other end of}} the specimen as ind icated in Fig. 1. In this way the magnet ic induct ion of the sample was kept saturated. To s tudy e lectron dif fraction, an e lectron beam about 0. 05 mm in cross section was a l lowed to graze the edge of the specimen (Fig. 1). The magnet ic de-flection of the inc ident beam can be measured by observ ing the shift in posi t ion of the di f fract ion pattern. The pat tern f rom the i ron crysta l was meas-ured wi th respect to the invar iant posit ion of the pat tern f rom a nonfer romagnet ic gold foil. The pat-terns f rom the crysta l and the foil were super imposed by means of a double exposure technique (1). The pat tern obta ined f rom an unmagnet ized sample (the same i ron crysta l w i th the permanent magnet removed) is shown in Fig. 2. The spots f rom the i ron crystal fa l l on r ings which are concentr ic w i th r ings due to the gold foil. Most of the spots are actua l ly located on r ings produced by the gold, due to the near coincidence of the in terp lanar spacings of i ron and gold; this indicates that the specimen contains no major in terna l stresses. F <b>igure</b> <b>3</b> shows the pat tern obta ined f rom the magnet ized sample. The spots due to the iron have shi f ted re lat ive to the reference gold pat tern; the shift shows the magnet ic Lorentz effect. Orientation [...] Figures 2 and 3 show that the inc i-dent beam was perpend icu la r to the (111) p lane of the iron single crysta l as wel l as to the magnet ic induct ion Bo~l perpend icu la r to the (0 i l) plane.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of neutron {{irradiation}} on the critical current density Jc of isotopically pure polycrystalline Mg 11 B 2 samples. For fluences in the range 1017 - 1018 cm- 2, Jc is enhanced and its dependence on magnetic field is significantly improved: we demonstrate that, in this regime, point-like pinning centers are effectively introduced in the system proportionally to the neutron fluence. Instead, for larger fluences, a strong suppression of the critical temperature accompanied by a decrease of both the upper critical field Bc 2 and Jc is found.
