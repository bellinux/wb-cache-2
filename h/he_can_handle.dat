(a sequel to 2010's Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai). Critical {{reaction to the}} film and Khan's portrayal of a gangster was mixed. While Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express found him unconvincing, NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee wrote, [...] "He provides evidence that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> {{a wider range of}} roles than he is usually allowed to play." [...] Also that year, he starred opposite Kareena Kapoor in Punit Malhotra's romantic comedy Gori Tere Pyaar Mein, a critical and commercial failure.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like other}} sandbox games, the player uses melee attacks, guns, and {{explosives}} {{to fight the}} opposing forces, and can run, climb buildings, jump across rooftops, or use vehicles to navigate the city. Crackdown features a series of character-based skills that can be upgraded to increase specific traits {{that can be used}} in combat, driving, or on-foot agility. These skills include: [...] "Agility", which increases the Agent's ability to jump, run, and swim; [...] "Driving", affecting how well <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> a vehicle and uprades it [...] "Explosives", which affects the power and range of explosive weapons and explosive power [...] "Strength" [...] that increases the Agent's strength, namely by increasing his ability to lift and throw, as well as how hard he can strike an opponent and increses health and [...] "Firearms", which improves the character's aptitude with weapons. Crackdowns skills make few concessions to realism: character abilities are similar to those of comic book superheroes or cartoon characters. This concept is further highlighted by the ink-like outlines drawn around in-game characters.|$|E
2500|$|The two collaborated for {{the second}} of four times on the 1954 hit Rear Window, widely {{considered}} one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Stewart portrays photographer L.B. [...] "Jeff" [...] Jeffries, loosely based on Life photographer Robert Capa, who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg. Jeffries gets into more than <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle,</b> however, when he believes he has witnessed a salesman (Raymond Burr) hiding evidence of a murder, and when his glamorous girlfriend (Grace Kelly), at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime, eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery. Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart is led by Hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses. It was a landmark year for Stewart, becoming the highest grossing actor of 1954 and the most popular Hollywood star in the world, displacing John Wayne. Hitchcock and Stewart formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film, which later {{became the subject of}} a Supreme Court case Stewart v. Abend (1990).|$|E

[...] He was {{referred}} to in 1919 as [...] "the best all around athlete Yale has produced, having won his varsity letter when at Yale, in three branches of sport -- football, baseball and crew." [...] In addition to football and basketball, Sharpe was also a fine baseball player and a skilled gymnast. [...] In 1900, The New York Times noted that [...] "Sharpe of Yale {{is as good a}} first baseman as he is a halfback, which is saying a good deal." [...] In 1915, Dr. A.C. May, a noted athletic trainer, rated Sharpe as [...] "the greatest living all round athlete today." [...] May supported his selection as follows:"Look at him once and you will see the reason for his success. [...] He is 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weights 196 pounds. [...] He is evenly proportioned and owes his build, not to athletics, but in gymnastics, and he owed his athletic success not to his build so much as his ability to handle his body, which he developed in the gymnasium. [...] <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> himself on the bars and rings and other apparatus with as much skill as he can play football or other sports. [...] He can turn a backward and forward flip and he knows the other tricks of a gymnast. ... Sharpe could row, run a fine relay, jump, put the shot, and, in fact, do about anything on the athletic field." ...|$|E
2500|$|The colt {{began his}} 2016 {{campaign}} in the Grade 3 Kisaragi Sho (a trial race for the Satsuki Sho) on 7 February over 1800 metres at Kyoto. He started the 1/5 favourite against eight opponents and won by {{three and a half}} lengths and a head from Les Planches and Leukerbad. In the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 17 April Satono Diamond was made the 1.7/1 favourite ahead of the Japanese champion two-year-old colt Leontes in an eighteen-runner field. Before the race Ikee commented on the colt's physical progress and added [...] "he’s very stable mentally and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> any kind of race". After racing in mid-division the favourite made a forward move in the straight but was slightly hampered in the closing stages and finished third behind Dee Majesty and Makahiki. Ikee later said that the tactics employed had been [...] "a mistake", commenting [...] "this colt is big and has long limbs and he’s not able to take small steps". On 29 May, in front of a 140,000 crowd at Tokyo Racecourse, Satono Diamond was one of eighteen colts to contest the 83rd running of the Tokyo Yushun and started second favourite behind Dee Majesty. He was positioned several lengths behind the early leaders before moving up to dispute the lead in the straight but in a very close finish he was beaten a nose by Makahiki with Dee Majesty half a length away in third place.|$|E

Now I know you have a dozen tugs and a score of barges, and I thought you might set him on at once. He would make a good second hand on one of your large boats.

60|$|It is {{sometimes}} said {{by those who}} understand neither {{the nature of the}} highest Criticism nor the charm of the highest Art, that the pictures that the critic loves most to write about are those that belong to the anecdotage of painting, and that deal with scenes taken out of literature or history. But this is not so. Indeed, pictures of this kind are far too intelligible. As a class, they rank with illustrations, and, even considered {{from this point of view}} are failures, as they do not stir the imagination, but set definite bounds to it. For the domain of the painter is, as I suggested before, widely different from that of the poet. To the latter belongs life in its full and absolute entirety; not merely the beauty that men look at, but the beauty that men listen to also; not merely the momentary grace of form or the transient gladness of colour, but the whole sphere of feeling, the perfect cycle of thought. The painter is so far limited that it is only through the mask of the body that he can show us the mystery of the soul; only through conventional images that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> ideas; only through its physical equivalents that he can deal with psychology. And how inadequately does he do it then, asking us to accept the torn turban of the Moor for the noble rage of Othello, or a dotard in a storm for the wild madness of Lear! Yet it seems as if nothing could stop him. Most of our elderly English painters spend their wicked and wasted lives in poaching upon the domain of the poets, marring their motives by clumsy treatment, and striving to render, by visible form or colour, the marvel of what is invisible, the splendour of what is not seen. Their pictures are, as a natural consequence, insufferably tedious. They have degraded the invisible arts into the obvious arts, and the one thing not worth looking at is the obvious. I do not say that poet and painter may not treat of the same subject. They have always done so and will always do so. But while the poet can be pictorial or not, as he chooses, the painter must be pictorial always. For a painter is limited, not to what he sees in nature, but to what upon canvas may be seen.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the century}} the Fidelity Magellan Fund had well over $100 billion in assets under management. For quite some time it was the single largest mutual fund in the world.

By the time Stansky retired in 2005, the assets under management for Magellan were back down to $52.5 billion. Harry Lange took over Magellan and promptly changed the portfolio to reflect his view on the market. Today about 25 per cent of Magellan is invested in companies based outside the US.

Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White.
