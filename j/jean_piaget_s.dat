40|$|This {{proposal}} presents {{strategies for}} teaching English {{as a foreign}} language for beginners using Aesop s fables as a pedagogical resource. Communication is the new organizing principle for the EFL classroom; however, it also demands knowledge of certain linguistic and learning principles that guide language development. The Generative Grammar of Noam Chomsky explains us how the speakers-listeners of a linguistic community are able to communicate and interpret utterances using an innate competence. Besides, learning and psychological theories such as: Howard Gardner s Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory, <b>Jean</b> <b>Piaget</b> <b>s</b> Theory of Cognitive Development, and Abraham Maslow s Hierarchy of needs allow us to develop adequate strategies for the students level, preferences, and needs. Fables have been regarded as moral tales for children for a long time, {{but they may be}} useful in an EFL setting due to their didactic nature. They present the language {{in such a way that}} students attention istrapped. Finally, a practical model of three lesson plans finishes this proposal. Licenciado en Ciencias de la Educación.
