40|$|Accurately {{quantifying}} total {{greenhouse gas}} emissions (e. g. methane) from natural systems such as lakes, reservoirs and wetlands requires the spatial-temporal measurement of both diffusive and ebullitive (bubbling) emissions. Traditional, manual, measurement techniques provide only limited localised assessment of methane flux, often introducing significant errors when extrapolated to the whole-of-system. In this paper, we directly address these current sampling limitations and present a novel multiple robotic boat system configured to measure the spatiotemporal release of methane to atmosphere across inland waterways.

Of most interest is the possibility for variable-rate application of crop inputs and ameliorants at the within-field scale, mainly due the dominance of inorganic fertiliser and pesticides in the variable costs budget. Variable-rate application options will be governed by quantifiable yield and soil variability along with the operational specifications of the application technology. However, the current accuracy in monitoring and application technology suggests variable-rate application is best served in Australia by the discrimination of significantly different production zones, followed by directed <b>exploratory</b> <b>sampling,</b> and then treatment or experimentation depending on the site-specific nature of the causes of variability. A process for delineating potential management zones is provided that is based on differences in yield, soil electrical conductivity and elevation information.

In 2000, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Systematics Laboratory began an exploratory trawling program to document nekton diversity at BSM and its vicinity. Here, we summarize eight <b>exploratory</b> <b>sampling</b> cruises conducted between 2000 and 2014, and describe the cephalopod biodiversity and assemblage structure around BSM. Over the course of 174 deep–midwater and 56 bottom tows, 5088 cephalopods were identified, measured, and documented. In total, 77 species were collected at BSM; 75 species were collected from midwater tows and 28 from benthic tows. Rarefaction curves did not reach an asymptote, suggesting that additional sampling will collect more species. Seventeen species accounted for 75 % of the total midwater and bottom catch, including: Illex illecebrosus (n[*]=[*] 605), Magnoteuthis magna (n[*]=[*] 568), Abraliopsis morisii (n[*]=[*] 518), Abralia redfieldi (n[*]=[*] 358), Mastigoteuthis agassizii (n[*]=[*] 336), Histioteuthis reversa (n[*]=[*] 273), Taonius pavo (n[*]=[*] 239), Haliphron atlanticus (n[*]=[*] 195), Brachioteuthis beanii (n[*]=[*] 160), Ornithoteuthis antillarum (n[*]=[*] 153), Pterygioteuthis gemmata (n[*]=[*] 141), Pyroteuthis margaritifera (n[*]=[*] 120), Vampyroteuthis infernalis (n[*]=[*] 101), Chiroteuthis veranyi (n[*]=[*] 33), Bolitaena pygmaea (n[*]=[*] 30), Graneledone verrucosa (n[*]=[*] 11), and Stauroteuthis syrtensis (n[*]=[*] 29).

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that parrots (Psitacifformes) are generalist apex frugivores, they have largely been {{considered}} plant antagonists and thus neglected as seed dispersers of their food plants. Internal dispersal was investigated by searching for seeds in faeces opportunistically collected at communal roosts, foraging sites and nests of eleven parrot species in different habitats and biomes in the Neotropics. Multiple intact seeds of seven plant species of five families were found in a variable proportion of faeces from four parrot species. The mean number of seeds of each plant species per dropping ranged between one and about sixty, with a maximum of almost five hundred seeds from the cacti Pilosocereus pachycladus in a single dropping of Lear’s Macaw (Anodorhynchus leari). All seeds retrieved were small (< 3 mm) and corresponded to herbs and relatively large, multiple-seeded fleshy berries and infrutescences from shrubs, trees and columnar cacti, often also dispersed by stomatochory. An overview of the potential constraints driving seed dispersal suggest that, despite the obvious size difference between seeds dispersed by endozoochory and stomatochory, {{there is no clear}} difference in fruit size depending on the dispersal mode. Regardless of the enhanced or limited germination capability after gut transit, a relatively large proportion of cacti seeds frequently found in the faeces of two parrot species were viable according to the tetrazolium test and germination experiments. The conservative results of our <b>exploratory</b> <b>sampling</b> and a literature review clearly indicate that the importance of parrots as endozoochorous dispersers has been largely under-appreciated {{due to the lack of}} research systematically searching for seeds in their faeces.

The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to characterize salvageable water resources in the semi-arid Tucson basin and to evaluate appropriate treatment and control methods and management procedures for reuse of these salvageable waters. A preliminary inventory of salvageable water resources in the Tucson basin indicated a conservatively estimated annual total of 30, 000 acre-feet available, as follows: municipal system effluents, 25, 000 acre-feet; industrial cooling effluents, 1, 000 acre-feet; urban runoff, 2, 000 acre-feet; and industrial processing waters and other minor sources, 2, 000 acre-feet per year. The City water utility has ample information on hand regarding quality of municipal effluents; data collected during this study are sufficient to define representative quality of industrial effluents; and presently developed processes evidently are adequate for the control and treatment of salvageable waters. However, little was known of the quality of urban runoff in this semi-arid environment, and efforts were directed toward <b>exploratory</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis as indicators of potential problem areas in runoff quality. A ground-water recharge investigation at the Rillito Creek recharge site near Tucson produced a mathematical model which can be used to represent fluctuations of ground-water levels resulting from line-source recharge. Findings can be applied to alternative management schemes in the utilization or storage of salvaged waters. Initial formulation of management alternatives by examination of local salvaged-water subsystems appeared not to require elegant mathematical solution but rather an improved system framework defining community objectives and criteria for salvaged water allocation...|$|E
40|$|River {{ecosystems}} integrate all {{the changes}} that occur throughout the territory of their basin and for this is why {{they are among the}} most threatened and altered ecosystems in the world. This loss of habitat has direct consequences on the organisms inhabiting them. Freshwater fish are the most threatened group of vertebrates on the planet. Therefore, we must prioritize their protection implementing effective management strategies capable to ensure the conservation of riverine habitats and species. Nevertheless, there is a big gap of knowledge involving these ecosystems and biota, hindering their management. This lack of knowledge is especially significant in the Neotropics, where the greatest diversity of freshwater fish of the planet water is found. Unfortunately, these highly biodiverse areas are exposed to great threats that are destroying their habitats. These facts point out the Tropical Andes as a particularly biodiverse but seriously threatened region whose conservation should be prioritized. However, management plans must be based on appropriate ecological studies, providing reliable biological information and guaranteeing the development of appropriate conservation strategies. In the light of this critical knowledge gap, this thesis aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a sampling methodology that aspires to be versatile, inclusive and simple, testing it in different biogeographic contexts. Thus, five river basins (two in the Pyrenees and three in the Tropical Andes) were analyzed conducting electrofishing surveys, collecting aquatic macroinvertebrates, characterizing river habitat and applying environmental quality indices. One of our main goals was to study the freshwater ecological processes and its influence on the distribution of fish communities. Additionally, we evaluated the integrity of river ecosystems, trying to understand the consequences of human impacts on the biota. One of the most common strategies for the protection of ecosystems and species is the creation of protected areas. The Biosphere Reserves aspire to protect biodiversity and promote the sustainable development of the communities inhabiting them. Nevertheless, the scarcity of available biological information and the lack of studies that evaluate the effectiveness of these protected areas may be hindering the successful management and conservation of rivers and fish inside them. Our results point out that, although some Biosphere Reserves are partially fulfilling their protective function, their management strategies should be revised and their action plans adapted to the new available scientific information. Our sampling campaigns provided us with a better understanding of the ecology of poorly known rivers and fish, and the methods proved to reliability to diagnose ecological integrity. Nevertheless, due to time and budged limitations, we could only visit once each of the basins, hindering our interpretation of their complex reality. However, the obtained data allows us to emphasize the urge of prioritizing the protection of the headwaters of the Tropical Andes. They still remain very well preserved, they provide invaluable and irreplaceable ecosystem services and host a large number of fish species endemic to each of the basins. In addition, given the increasing anthropogenic impacts threatening these ecosystems, it is mandatory to delve into ecological studies to understand the natural reference conditions of these rivers, necessary to the appropriate development of management policies and restoration. This urge for knowledge highlights the necessity to continue with <b>exploratory</b> <b>sampling</b> campaigns, aspiring to cover the large knowledge gaps we are facing, and to guarantee the effectivity of the conservation biology.

The scan included SNPs in 677 of 1, 270 known or predicted genes; each gene contained one or more markers, about half (48 %) of which represented putative functional mutations. In general, the initial testing was performed in a white case-control sample from the St. Louis area, with 419 LOAD cases and 377 age-matched controls. Markers that showed significant association in the exploratory analysis were followed up in several other white case-control sample sets to confirm the initial association. Of the 1, 397 markers tested in the <b>exploratory</b> <b>sample,</b> 69 reache...|$|R
30|$|Listening {{to their}} arguments, the Chinese {{capitalism}} ethos {{appears to be}} close to how social scientists have described Western capitalism, wherein employees are autonomous, flexible, creative and individualistic.

The white-collar workers we met set down clear requirements when it comes to choosing a job.

In today’s China, while industrial workers are fighting for decent salaries after decades of marginalization, white-collar workers are also making new demands of their employees in terms of the quality of their jobs and lives. A hypothesis to be confirmed by further studies is that for highly skilled workers, sought after by employers, what is at stake in a job is not so much its status, but its quality and the lifestyle it implies.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis, "The Analysis of 24 Month Old Chilďs Playing Interaction in His Family Background" (which {{is a part}} of granťs task number: 406 / 01 / 0220, whose solver is Doc. PhDr. L. Šulová, CSc.) has {{two main}} parts. The {{theoretical}} part comprises four bigger chapters, the first one includes different aspects of the family theme, the second one deals with early chilďs interactions and relationships in hi s family, the third part focuses on toddler' s development characteristics, the fourth part deals with chilďs play and playing interactions. Empirical part presents results of a research, which aim was to look into and compare (quantitatively and qualitatively) playing interactions of 2 year old child with his mother, father (possibly older sibling) in family. For the analysys of videorecording the computer program V. I. P., which was developed for solving grant's task GA ČR by Ing. T. Hrdlička, was used. Some differences within single playing pairs and also within whole research group have emerged. The results are related only to the <b>exploratory</b> <b>sample...</b>|$|R
