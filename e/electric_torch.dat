5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an <b>electric</b> <b>torch</b> looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.|$|E
2500|$|Empire Dawn {{departed}} Suez on 14 August for Aden, {{arriving on}} 18 August and departing {{four days later}} for Durban, South Africa, where she arrived on 4 September. She departed the next day on {{what was to be}} her final voyage. She was in ballast, bound for Trinidad where she was to load bauxite and then sail to New York. On 11 September, Empire Dawn was attacked by the German raider Michel west of Cape Town, South Africa. Her position was [...] Although Empire Dawn indicated that she had surrendered, and the crew were abandoning ship, the shelling continued. She was sunk with the loss of 20 of her 41 crew. The survivors were rescued by Michel. They were transferred to , and later [...] which took them to Singapore, where they were handed over to the Japanese as prisoners of war. The continued shelling after the ship had surrendered was considered to be a war crime. Michels captain Helmuth von Ruckteschell was found not guilty on this charge at his trial held at the Curio Haus in Hamburg, Allied-occupied Germany, from 5–21 May 1947. It was shown that the surrender was flashed in Morse Code by <b>electric</b> <b>torch,</b> the light from which was demonstrated in Court to be too weak to be seen in daylight and amongst the flashes of explosions. Von Ruckteschell was convicted on three other charges and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, subsequently reduced to seven years. Von Ruckteschell died in prison on 24 June 1948. Those lost on Empire Dawn are commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial in London.|$|E
60|$|The fall {{itself was}} {{scarcely}} a dozen feet. He picked himself up, his shoulder bruised, his head swimming a little. His <b>electric</b> <b>torch</b> was broken to pieces upon the stone floor. He was simply {{in a black}} gulf of darkness. Suddenly a gleam of light shone down. A trap-door above his head was slid a few inches back. The flare of an <b>electric</b> <b>torch</b> shone upon his face, a man's mocking voice addressed him.|$|E

60|$|They {{waited until}} the things were brought. Afterwards they locked the door. Cecil went to a drawer {{and took out a}} couple of <b>electric</b> <b>torches,</b> one of which he handed to Forrest. Then he went to the wall, and after a few minutes' groping, found the spring. The door swung open, and a rush of unwholesome air {{streamed}} into the room. They made their way silently along the passage until at last they reached the sunken chamber.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a gas shielded <b>electric</b> arc welding <b>torch</b> having a detachable gas cup extension {{which may be}} of any desired configuration or length. The gas cup extension assembly is mounted on a standard <b>electric</b> welding <b>torch</b> gas cup to enable welding in areas with limited access. The gas cup assembly has an upper tubular insert that fits within the gas cup such that its lower portion protrudes thereform and has a lower tubular extension that is screwed into the lower portion. The extension has a rim to define the outer perimeter of the seat edge about its entrance opening so a gasket may be placed to effect an airtight seal between the gas cup and extension. The tubular extension may be made of metal or cermaic material that can be machined. The novelty lies {{in the use of}} an extension assembly for a standard gas cup of an <b>electric</b> arc welding <b>torch</b> which extension assembly is detachable permitting the use of a number of extensions which may be of different configurations and materials and yet fit the standard gas cup...|$|R
50|$|A. C. Wells & Co. {{began in}} Cheetham, Manchester. Their first product was {{a range of}} engineer's lamps, simple {{cast-iron}} wick lamps that were widely used before <b>electric</b> battery <b>torches.</b> This type of lamp was not very bright and their limited light has been blamed for several engineering failures and losses of life, where an inspection was poorly carried out, owing to poor light.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{development}} of this concept {{has resulted in the}} [...] "air-spike". This is formed by concentrated energy, either from an <b>electric</b> arc <b>torch</b> or a pulsed laser, projected forwards from the body, which produces a region of low density hot air ahead of the body. This has the advantage over a structural aerospike that the air density is lower than that behind a shock wave providing increased drag reduction.|$|R
60|$|He took an <b>electric</b> <b>torch</b> {{from his}} pocket, and both men drew a little breath of relief {{as the light}} flashed out. Cecil climbed on to a chair and closed the window. Forrest glanced at the clock.|$|E

6000|$|The Christmas of 1914 found England, whose {{landscape}} had hitherto {{been almost}} as peaceful and soldierless as Massachusetts, already far gone {{along the path}} of transformation into a country full of soldiers and munition makers and military supplies. The soldiers came first, on the well-known and greatly admired British principle of [...] "first catch your hare" [...] and then build your kitchen. Always before, Christmas had been a time of much gaiety and dressing up and prancing and two-stepping at the Dower House, but this year everything was too uncertain to allow of any gathering of guests. Hugh got leave for the day after Christmas, but Teddy was tied; and Cissie and Letty went off with the small boy to take lodgings near him. The Van der Pants had hoped to see an English Christmas at Matching's Easy, but within three weeks of Christmas Day Mr. Van der Pant found a job {{that he could do}} in Nottingham, and carried off his family. The two small boys cheered their hearts with paper decorations, but the Christmas Tree was condemned as too German, and it was discovered that Santa Claus had suddenly become Old Father Christmas again. The small boys discovered that the price of lead soldiers had risen, and were unable to buy <b>electric</b> <b>torches,</b> on which they had set their hearts. There was to have been a Christmas party at Claverings, but at the last moment Lady Homartyn had to hurry off to an orphan nephew who had been seriously wounded near Ypres, and the light of Claverings was darkened.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{emission}} spectroscopy techniques based on {{evaluation of the}} plasma emission coefficients have been adopted for the measurements of plasma parameters of ARCs immersed into water and for determining potential active species and their distribution in the plasma. An <b>electric</b> ARC <b>torch</b> in argon has been considered working in non-transferred mode to produce the plasma. The resulting plasma jet is neither homogeneous nor stable one which makes it especially difficult for the OES measurements. So, the approach has been applied relying upon relative intensity of lines in the plasma total emission spectra and some general data on the plasma behaviour. The measurement results give a rather realistic picture of plasma parameters and spatial distributions of active species in the plasma jet with an admixture of water...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a coaxial extending metal mirror reflector attached to the electrode housing or gas cup on a welding <b>torch.</b> An <b>electric</b> welding <b>torch</b> with an internal viewing system for robotic welding is provded with an annular arc light reflector to reflect light from the arc back onto the workpiece. The reflector has a vertical split or gap in its surrounding wall to permit the adjacent wall ends forming the split to be sprung open slightly to permit the reflector to be removed or slipped onto the torch housing or gas cup. The upper opening of the reflector is slightly smaller than the torch housing or gas cup and therefore, when placed on the torch housing or gas cup has that springiness to cause it to clamp tightly on the housing or gas cup. The split or gap also serves to permit the feed of weld wire through to the weld area...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods of}} the cooling diamond from the gas phase have been {{developed}} and the main methods include the {{methods of the}} position of diamond coatings (DC) using an <b>electric</b> arc plasma <b>torch</b> whose advantages include the high cooling rate, up to 900 #mu#m/h.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{numerical}} modeling of the plasma <b>torch</b> <b>electric</b> arcs with water vortex stabilization and combined stabilization of arc by argon flow and water vortex. The axisymmetric model includes the arc discharge {{area between the}} near-cathode region and the outlet nozzle of the plasma torch. Thermal, electrical and fluid-dynamic characteristics as well as power losses of such arc has been studied for the range of currents 150 - 500 A. It was proved that addition of argon increases the plasma velocity but does not influence substantially the plasma temperature. The energy losses transferred radially from the arc by conduction and radiation range from 65 to 30 % of the input power. The amount of reabsorbed radiation, calculated by the partial characteristics method, divided to the total divergence of radiation flux is 35 - 26 % for hybrid torch and 25 - 16 % for water torch. The calculated velocities and temperatures show good agreement with experiments...|$|R
