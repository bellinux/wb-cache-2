40|$|An {{analysis}} of formal requirements and methodological concepts of <b>admission</b> <b>procedures</b> applied in German Master {{programs in the}} library and information science field Inspired by the Bologna process, LIS Master programs now come with quite different admission criteria and <b>admission</b> <b>procedures.</b> Purely formal criteria – like e. g. the grade of an earlier degree – were replaced by university-specific <b>admission</b> <b>procedures</b> which differentiate by program related criteria. Ranking of applicants is now determined by scores related to working experience, by subject-based qualification, and by relevant criteria from the labour market. Interviews and assessments have been introduced as {{the second stage of}} the <b>admission</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper gives a comprehensive overview on the different concepts applied to LIS Master programs at universities in Germany...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the admission process to prison. The paper begins by outlining some of the current views on the effects of imprisonment and the adjustment of the inmate to prison life. Gofiman in particular has identified the important part played by <b>admission</b> <b>procedures</b> in depriving the individual of his personal identity and immersing him in the institutional system. The authors studied the <b>admission</b> <b>procedures</b> at two penal establishments to see how far these showed the characteristics described by Gofrman as being 'fairly standard in total institutions'. The paper describes how the study was conducted, and gives an account of the <b>admission</b> <b>procedure</b> at the institutions. In their findings the authors try {{to assess the impact of}} this system on the inmate, and its significance within the total social system of the institution. The study casts doubt on the general applicability of Goffman's hypothesis, but at the same time shows that the <b>admission</b> <b>procedure</b> has a potential for introducing the inmate to his new environment in a constructive way, which is not being realized within the present system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of two different <b>admission</b> <b>procedures</b> (high school grades/scholastic aptitude test (SAT) versus high school grades/SAT + interview) to a program in professional psychology on students' and supervisors' experiences of the group climate in psychotherapy supervision groups during an eighteen-month clinical practicum. A self-rating scale constructed to measure experiences of group climate in group supervision in psychotherapy was used. The results showed that students who were admitted based on the alternative <b>admission</b> <b>procedure</b> reported that their supervision groups had a more beneficial climate compared to those who were admitted based on high school grades/SAT. The evaluation suggested that admission via interviews together with high school grades/SAT is a good alternative to traditional <b>admission</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
