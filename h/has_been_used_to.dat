5|$|RNAi <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> genetically {{engineer}} {{plants to}} produce {{lower levels of}} natural plant toxins. Such techniques {{take advantage of the}} stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
5|$|RPI has {{acquired}} several significant downtown properties, {{such as the}} Gurley and Rice buildings and Proctor's Theater, and renovated them to make homes for programs such as its Lighting Research Center, now housed in Gurley.
