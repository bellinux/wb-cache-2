5|$|Cumberland {{is part of}} the CTA's Blue Line, {{which runs}} from O'Hare Airport to {{downtown}} Chicago and <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> It is the third inbound station from O'Hare on the Blue Line and is situated between the Rosemont and Harlem stations. Blue Line trains serve Cumberland 24 hours a day every day; trains operate roughly every 7 to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, with longer headways of up to 30 minutes at night. The station is approximately seven minutes from O'Hare, 31 minutes from Clark/Lake in the Loop, and 52 minutes from <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> 1,304,280 passengers boarded at Cumberland in 2011.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not the}} end of the controversy. A letter {{campaign}} led to {{the name}} of the park being changed to Whirls End State <b>Forest</b> <b>Park</b> in 1936; opponents of the new name launched another letter-writing campaign to revert the name to Worlds End State <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> This matter was brought before the State Geographic Board, which supervised the official naming of places. The board ruled that the name be changed once again to Worlds End State <b>Forest</b> <b>Park</b> in 1943. The word Forest was dropped on November 11, 1954, when the park was officially named Worlds End State Park by the Pennsylvania Geographic Board. This has been the official name ever since, but the names Whirls End and Whirls Glen are still used, and are synonymous with Worlds End.|$|E

5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of <b>Forest</b> <b>Park,</b> which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move {{in and out of the}} park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E

5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as <b>Forest</b> <b>Park</b> was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 and 16million years ago, in the Middle Miocene, eruptions of Columbia River basalts from {{volcanic}} vents {{in eastern}} Oregon and Washington flowed {{across much of}} northern Oregon, sometimes reaching the Pacific Ocean. Although these basalts have been mapped in the West Hills under Marquam Hill, Hoyt Arboretum, and the steepest slopes of <b>Forest</b> <b>Park,</b> they flowed around but did not completely cover the Waverly Hills Formation in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E

In response, St. Louis improved its water system and established a Board of Health to regulate polluting industries.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s and 1910s, St. Louis began a {{building}} program that created parks and playgrounds in several deteriorating residential neighborhoods. Parks Commissioner (and former professional tennis player) Dwight F. Davis continued {{the development of}} recreational facilities during the early 1910s by expanding tennis facilities and building a public 18-hole golf course in northwest <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> The St. Louis Zoo was constructed in <b>Forest</b> <b>Park</b> in the early 1910s {{under the leadership of}} Mayor Henry Kiel. Since the 1890s, St. Louis had attempted to control its air pollution problems with little success, but damage to buildings and flora made the issue more visible during the 1920s. Problems came to a head with the 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky and lasted for three weeks. A ban on burning low-quality coal solved the problem in December 1939, and the addition of natural gas for heating assisted homeowners in making the transition to cleaner fuels by the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|SR104 was {{established}} during the 1964 state highway renumbering as {{the successor to}} several state highways: SSH9E between Discovery Bay and Port Gamble, PSH21 between Port Gamble and Kingston, SSH1W in Edmonds, and SSH2B between Edmonds and Lake <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b> The highway between Port Gamble and Kingston {{was established}} in 1915 as part of State Road21, which extended south to Bremerton. During {{the creation of the}} Primary and secondary state highways in 1937, State Road21 was re-designated as PSH21 and extended south to Gorst. SSH9E was also established, connecting US101 and PSH9 in Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow, along with SSH1W from US99 and PSH1 in Lynnwood through Edmonds to US99 and PSH1 in Woodway, following the route of an unpaved road built in the 1890s. SSH2B was created in 1937 to serve as a connector between US99 and PSH1 in Shoreline to a branch of PSH2 in Lake <b>Forest</b> <b>Park.</b>|$|E

5|$|At a Missouri state {{constitutional}} convention in 1875, delegates {{from the region}} agreed on a separation plan.
