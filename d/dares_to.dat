Guido, in keeping his promise to tell of all Troilus' valorous deeds, {{describes}} many incidents. Troilus is usually victorious but is captured in an early battle by Menestheus before his friends rescue him. This incident reappears in the imitators of Guido, such as Lefevre and the Laud and Lydgate Troy Books.|$|E
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|The novel centres on the {{character}} of Katinka Bai, a quiet, sensitive young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. The marriage is barren, and she remains isolated. Almost subconsciously, she passionately longs after something undefinable. Even after the arrival of Huus, a neighbour with whom she begins to establish a promising relationship, she is unable to fulfill her passion, although {{for the first time in}} her life she falls in love. In the small provincial community where they live, neither she nor Huus <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> break the conventions they know, sad as it all may be. When they realize they cannot take their attachment any further, they decide to separate and Huus leaves the country. At the end of the novel, as at the beginning, Katinka stands by the wayside, observing life glide by.|$|E

5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E

Yet other people, particularly the Marquis of Steyne, find it impossible to believe that Crawley is unaware of Becky's tricks. Steyne in particular believes Rawdon is fully aware Becky is prostituting herself, and believes Rawdon is going along with the charade in the hope of financial gain.|$|E

25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E
25|$|Lou has a tempestuous {{relationship}} with her children-in-law Kathy and Arthur, blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing he does is ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou isn't adverse to speaking her mind or scolding her family if she disapproves of their actions, but she soon comes to celebrate her grandson Martin's (Jon Peyton Price) birth – although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. She is a strict traditionalist and moralist but she believes in strong family-values most of all, and will defend her family if any outsider <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> criticise them. She provides a warm shoulder to cry on when 16-year-old Michelle finds out she is pregnant in late 1985 and is supportive of her favourite grandchild, Ian, on his plans {{to work within the}} catering trade rather than following in his father's footsteps in a more masculine occupation. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for some tests and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes.|$|E

500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E

[...] The Denver Post reported that after the song's release, Spears' mother Lynne thanked Norman for writing the song, [...] "because {{it was all she}} wanted to say to her daughter." [...] On the week of September 19, 2008, [...] "Britney" [...] peaked at number twenty-eight on Billboard Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E
500|$|Postwar {{economic}} {{troubles in}} western Massachusetts {{led to an}} uprising known as Shays's Rebellion, which began in 1786. Small farmers, angered by high taxes and debts, armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in two counties. Governor James Bowdoin sent four thousand militiamen {{to put down the}} uprising, an action supported by Adams. His old political ally James Warren thought that Adams had forsaken his principles, but Adams saw no contradiction. He approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government, as had happened during the American Revolution, but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government, where problems should be remedied through elections. He thought that the leaders of Shays's Rebellion should be hanged, reportedly saying that [...] "the man who <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death".|$|E

500|$|Those {{within the}} regime {{are also a}} mix of fictional {{characters}} and real people. President Balaguer is real, but the entire Cabral family is completely fictional. According to Wolff, Vargas Llosa [...] "uses history {{as a starting point}} in constructing a fictionalized account of Trujillo's [...] "spiritual colonization" [...] of the Dominican Republic as experienced by one Dominican family. The fictional Cabral family allows Vargas Llosa to show two sides of the Trujillo regime: through Agustin, the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation; through Urania, the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind. Vargas Llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non-fictional, especially those of the Goat himself. According to literary scholar Richard Patterson, [...] "Vargas Llosa's expands all the way into the very [...] "dark area" [...] of Trujillo's consciousness (as the storyteller <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> conceive it)." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Desha, the {{outgoing}} governor, {{refused to believe}} that his party had lost the election.

Metcalfe's opponents made slights on the quality of his stone work and his views on the Old Court-New Court controversy. When told about these charges, Metcalfe remarked [...] "They may say what they like about my views, but the first man that <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> attack my character, I will cleave his skull with my stone hammer, as I would cleave a rock." [...] As word of this remark spread, Metcalfe was given the nickname [...] "Old Stone Hammer." [...] Despite his threats to remain in the governor's mansion until the legislature convened, Desha respected the will of the people, and left the residence on September 2, 1828.|$|E
500|$|RPGFan's Ken Chu, despite {{finding the}} camera's {{movement}} speed awkward and disliking {{some aspects of}} the graphics, found the characters [...] "reasonably strong" [...] and generally praised the gameplay. He rounded off the review by saying that, because if its difficulty, it may put off more casual RPG players, but that other players [...] " [...] strongly recommended to check it out." [...] GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann generally shared these points of praise with other reviewers, despite finding some aspects of gameplay potentially unbalanced and the graphics unappealing, said that [...] "if [...] can manage to get over these flaws, you'll find an RPG that <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> be different, but not at the sake of an interesting story and exciting gameplay." [...] A common point of praise with reviewers was the improved localization when compared to that of Persona, although opinions on the voice acting varied and faults in the grammar were mentioned.|$|E

[...] Mark Kermode from the BBC said that the film is a [...] "pretty solid and ambitious adaptation of a very complex book", but he criticised the post-converted 3D. Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film [...] out of 4 stars and said [...] "While Deathly Hallows: Part 2 offers long-promised answers, it also <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> pose some eternal questions, and it'll stay with you after the final chapter has closed."

500|$|Later reviews {{were able}} to judge the series based on full seasons. While the acting, set design, costuming, art {{direction}} and cinematography continued to be praised, some reviewers disfavored the writing, especially of Season 1, saying [...] "the plot momentum is often virtually non-existent" [...] or as [...] "sometimes gripping but mostly boring." [...] Other reviewers pointed out that Carnivàle may [...] "demand more from its audience than many are willing to invest. [...] Without paying close attention, it's tempting {{to assume that the}} show is unnecessarily cryptic and misleading." [...] Carnivàle story was surveyed as long and complex, [...] "and if you don't start from the beginning, you'll be completely lost." [...] IGN DVD's Matt Casamassina, however, praised the show in two reviews, writing that the [...] "gorgeously surreal" [...] first season [...] "dazzles with unpredictable plot twists and scares", and that the [...] "extraordinary" [...] second season was [...] "better fantasy – better entertainment, period – than any show that <b>dares</b> <b>to</b> call itself a competitor." ...|$|E
500|$|A lack of [...] "eye-popping unpredictability [...] its predecessors" [...] and {{difficult}} controller positions disappointed 1UP.com, but the website still called WarioWare: Smooth Moves a [...] "welcome addition to any Wii library".

GamesRadar shared this sentiment, noting that although the game's single-player mode is only several hours long, its multiplayer mode is the [...] "definite Wii party experience" [...] for up to 12 people.
