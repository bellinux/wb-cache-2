This paper analyzes the participation of renewable generators in the Spanish intraday market. First, {{the organization of the}} intraday market and the short-term market mechanisms influencing <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> <b>are</b> described. After that, day-ahead and intraday market prices, as well as <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> volumes, <b>are</b> used to study the behavior of market agents in the Spanish intraday market. Regarding renewable generators, the influence of support schemes on the behavior of these agents in the intraday market is also analyzed. This paper shows that the Spanish intraday market has effectively contributed to renewable generation balancing. Despite this, market distortions have incentivized some renewable generators to arbitrate between the day-ahead and intraday markets, giving rise to higher system costs. Based on the presented analysis, it is argued that these distortions need to be removed from short-term markets to incentivize market parties, especially intermittent generators, to reduce forecast errors over time, improving economic efficiency and avoiding the use of costly balancing actions performed by the System Operator. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to show that a combination of renewable energy sources with energy storage systems, which provide frequency containment reserves FCR (also called primary frequency control), improves the performance of both systems. This double benefit comes out in a reduction of <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> for the storage system and a leveled power injection of the renewables. Considering the regulations that apply for battery storage systems to provide FCR in Germany, interaction with other units is essential to guarantee availability of the system. This interaction is usually performed market based by <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> or by flexible power generation or consumption combined with the storage system. This paper, however, showed the benefits of interaction with fluctuating renewable energy sources. Energy storages and renewables were clustered to a common grid connection point to utilize the fluctuations of the renewable power generation directly for battery management. Simulation results based on sample photovoltaic and wind profiles showed the double benefit of the configuration. <b>Intraday</b> <b>trading</b> <b>was</b> reduced by 33 % up to 57 %.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> {{patterns}} of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the London Stock Exchange. ETFs {{have been shown to}} be characterised by much lower bid–ask spread costs and by lower levels of information asymmetry than individual securities. One possible explanation for <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> patterns <b>is</b> that concentration of trading arises at the start of the trading day because informed traders have private information that quickly diminishes in value as trading progresses. Since ETFs have lower trading costs and lower levels of information asymmetry we would expect these securities to display less pronounced intraday patterns than individual securities. We fail to find that ETFs are characterised by concentrated trading bouts during the day and therefore find support for the argument that information asymmetry is the cause of intraday volume patterns in stock markets. We find that ETF bid–ask spreads and volatility are elevated at the open but not at the close. This lends support to the “accumulation of information” explanation that sees high spreads and volatility at the open as a consequence of information accumulating during a market closure and impacting on the market when it next opens...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical benchmark model for national intraday adjustment needs under consideration of fundamental drivers, market concentration and portfolio internal netting. The benchmark model {{is used to}} calculate the intraday market outcomes if (i) large and small players as well as transmissions operators trade and (ii) only large players and transmission system operators trade. Transaction costs may prevent the competitive fringe from intraday market participation. The theoretical national <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> volumes <b>are</b> calculated with market data from three European countries with auction-based intraday markets (Italy, Portugal, Spain) and four countries with continuous intraday markets (Denmark, France, Germany, United Kingdom).

Market frictions, such as non-trading effects, bid/ask spreads, other transaction costs, etc., may be detected by direct measurement, or by indirect identification. Direct measurement of frictions <b>is</b> difficult as <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> data <b>are</b> unavailable in the case of most of the emerging CEE stock markets.

We jointly model price movements and trades of three different investor classes: foreign institutions, domestic institutions and retail investors on the Helsinki Stock Exchange over the period of 2000 till 2004. Consistent with Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000), we find that foreign institutions tend to engage in momentum based trading strategies, while domestic institutions and retail investors are contrarian. Foreign institutions and retail investors respond to the same day stock price movements {{and those in the}} immediately preceding intervals. Negative feedback trading by domestic institutions is evident up to lags of several days.

The four merging algorithms: Truncation, Weighted mean, median and all-combinations algorithm are compared with Dropdown algorithm, which is being used widely by the trading firms.

40|$|This {{research}} tested whether wavelet based algorithms {{can improve}} the performance of <b>intraday</b> share <b>trading</b> algorithms. The trading algorithms investigated, each consisted of two parts: the first part performed share price prediction {{and the second part}} traded based on the prediction. All the trades in the shares BTI, MTN, NPN and SBK through 2013 on the JSE with the associated time stamps, transaction share prices and volumes, served as the basic sample. The sample was further reduced by using end-of-interval transaction share prices at intervals of one, two, five and ten minutes throughout the trade days. Three types of prediction algorithms were employed: auto regressive moving average (ARMA), wavelet-ARMA and wavelet regressive algorithms. The wavelet based algorithms were further broken down by using up to six different levels of scales in each of the algorithms. These algorithms were fitted using the first half year of data while the tests were conducted on the second half year of data. Two <b>trade</b> algorithms <b>were</b> created by the researcher: One algorithm for buyand- sell and another for short-and-close. Both algorithms used the predicted share price one and two intervals ahead as input and took transaction cost into account. The trade algorithms entered the market daily after opening time and exited the market before closing time. The wavelet based algorithms were not found to improve the accuracy of share price prediction. However, in agreement with previous research, wavelet based algorithms were found to improve the accuracy of predicting the direction of the share prices. The wavelet based algorithms were also found to improve trading performance. Short-and-close algorithms outperformed buy-and-sell. None of the <b>intraday</b> <b>trade</b> algorithms <b>were</b> found to outperform buy-and-hold over the test period. This study contributes to academic research regarding the manner in which wavelet based and ARMA algorithms were combined, the application of a wavelet-regressive prediction method to financial time series and the application of wavelet based trading algorithms on an intraday time scale.

This thesis analyses the trading behaviour and the price determinants in the Nordic <b>intraday</b> market. <b>Trading</b> behaviour <b>was</b> analysed by examining the trading pattern, the number of trades and volume.

40|$|Abstract This study {{consists}} introductory {{survey and}} three essays where investors' trading responses to interim earnings announcements are studied using Finnish data. The essays are individual papers, but their topics are closely connected since they address the trading response from different angles. The essays progress from an aggregated {{to a more}} detailed examination. The first essay was conducted on daily data, whereas {{the second and third}} consist of <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> data. In all three essays information asymmetry is assumed to affect trading behavior around interim earnings announcements. The first article contains empirical findings regarding the effect of interim earnings announcements on investors' trading policy using Finnish data. The aim of the paper is to investigate empirically the role of pre-disclosure information asymmetry and the information content in explaining volume responses to interim earnings announcements. Evidence is provided that the <b>trading</b> volume response <b>is</b> positively associated with the information content and to some extent with the level of pre-disclosure information asymmetry. The results are in line with the theoretical trading volume proposition. However, the significance levels are lower than in similar US studies and the association between positive and negative news is slightly asymmetric. The second article finds evidence from the Helsinki Stock Exchange that the widely documented U-shape pattern in trading activity - namely heavy trading in the beginning {{and at the end of}} the trading day and relatively light trading in the middle of the day - is affected by an anticipated information event (i. e. interim earnings announcement). Before the announcement day, <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> more concentrated at the close. This is consistent with investors' heterogeneous willingness to bear expected overnight risk, which is especially prevalent before an announcement. Moreover, a slight increase on the open is evident after the announcement day. Evidence is also provided that the change in <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> behavior <b>is</b> associated with announcement-related factors, such as the range of analysts' earnings forecasts, the magnitude of unexpected earnings and firm size. Furthermore, this association is evident to some extent during the transition between trading and non-trading regimes. The third study examines whether the permanent price effects of individual <b>trades</b> <b>are</b> greater before or after an interim earnings announcement on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. If the permanent price effects are greater before the announcement this would suggest that investors believe that some traders are better informed before the interim earnings announcement than after. Using permanent price effects as a measure of price adjustment for private information, tests were performed to see whether price adjustments are greater in pre-announcement periods than in post-announcement periods. The results, based on interim earnings releases for the period 1993 to 1997 by HSE-listed firms, suggest that large trades do indeed produce greater permanent price effects before an announcement than after it. This suggests that large trades associated with price changes (especially uptick trades) before an announcement send a stronger signal to other investors than similar trades after the announcement. For small <b>trades</b> the results <b>were</b> insignificant...|$|R

40|$|This study {{involves}} a detailed {{discussion on the}} estimation of intraday time-varying volume synchronised probability of informed trading (VPIN), a proxy for levels of informed trading and flow toxicity, followed by intraday analysis on its impact of the behaviour of <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> in a limit order book (LOB) market. The variation of VPIN used is closely based on the original from Easley, Lopez de Prado and O’Hara (2010), using trade volume imbalance information. This study shows that different capitalisation stocks exhibit different VPIN characteristics. Previous studies on other variations of PIN have looked at its determination on price movements, and whether a lead-lag relationship exists. This study examines if VPIN {{has an effect on}} several of <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> factors in the Australian market, being a LOB.

40|$|Abstract Market {{microstructure}} {{studies of}} <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> patterns have established {{that there is}} a regular pattern of high volumes near both the open and close of the trading day. O'Hara (1995) points out the many difficulties in specifying all the necessary elements of a strategic model for determining and attaining an equilibrium describing intraday patterns. We develop an autonomous agent-based market microstructure simulation with both informed agents and uninformed liquidity-motivated agents. Both types of agents can learn when to <b>trade,</b> but <b>are</b> zero-intelligence on all other behavior. We do not impose an equilibrium concept but instead look for emergent behavior. Our results demonstrate that trading patterns can arise in such a model as a result of interactions between informed and uninformed agents even though the agents are non-strategic and not fully rational. As long as there is rudimentary social or individual learning, uninformed liquidity-motivated agents can coordinate to avoid trading with informed agents and suffering adverse selection losses. The extent and pattern of coordination between uninformed agents depends on the learning specification, the percentage of informed agents and the degree of cooperation/competition among the informed agents.

40|$|A {{significant}} body {{of research}} exists documenting that REITs perform differently from other types of equity securities, although the reasons for these differences are unclear. This study examines the <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> behavior of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Specifically, intraday REIT returns, volume, trading activity, and bid/ask spread are examined {{in an attempt to}} better understand the patterns of intraday information flow for a sample of REITs trading on the NYSE. After controlling for differences in market capitalization, share price, and institutional holdings, this paper analyzes differences between REITs and non-REITs, and between REITs that are widely held by institutions and those that are not. The results suggest that, as a group, REITs exhibit lower average volumes and number of trades than do similar non-REITs. In addition, the findings suggest that mortgage REITs trade at spreads that are wider. Surprisingly, the analysis of institutional ownership suggests that equity REITs that are widely held by institutions exhibit the largest divergence from non-REITs in terms of both <b>intraday</b> <b>trading</b> activity and volume, {{but at the same time}} trade closer to non-REITs in terms of bid/ask spread. Overall, the results of this study confirm that REITs are treated differently by investors than similar non-REITs, and the institutional ownership findings suggest that <b>trading</b> activity <b>is</b> less important as a determinant of REIT performance than is the level of institutional ownership. ...|$|R
30|$|This project {{proposes a}} novel process to coordinate, {{allocate}} and settle energy transactions {{in a district}} multi-carrier energy system. The process operates in a decentralized way, fully on-chain. The mechanism allows a custom dynamic tariff setting model. It leaves producers {{the freedom to choose}} their preferred pricing strategy for profit maximization. A price-availability-based allocation system guarantees that consumers pay only the lowest possible cost for their energy. An incentive mechanism is introduced. Each device reacts for the common good of the community and follows the principle of relieving the operation burden of the grid. Game-theory based strategy provides a feedback loop for devices to make better decisions with limited information. The agility it provides is essential in the <b>intraday</b> <b>trading.</b> This design <b>is</b> implemented for the Ethereum blockchain and tested with real consumption and production profiles of electricity and heating systems. Three pricing strategies, namely zero-intelligence pricing, inversed-production pricing, and game-theory based pricing, are compared and evaluated. An analysis of the energy consumption and operation cost of such systems is performed in the end. The design incentivizes the access to local green energy with minimized cost. In general, the degree of price’s influence on energy consumers depends on their connectivity to energy suppliers. Consumers have more stable green supply from the community when they have a better connectivity. By choosing a competitive pricing strategy, households pay significantly less than in a determined pricing case. Battery plays an inevitable role in providing stability in the system shaving the peak. To make the operation more sustainable, the system needs more storage or other forms of renewable energy that do not share a similar production pattern with PVs.|$|R
