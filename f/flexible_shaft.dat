2500|$|Another, different, bit {{also called}} an {{installer}} bit {{has a very}} long <b>flexible</b> <b>shaft,</b> typically up to [...] long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of spring steel instead of hardened steel, {{so it can be}} flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through studs from a light switch box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{weapon is}} {{described}} as an [...] "air-cooled, electrically powered, rapid firing weapon." [...] All portions of the firing cycle are powered this way so the unit requires an external power source. Other important features are the reciprocating barrel and cam assembly that drive the other components of the system. All phases of the weapon cycle are positively controlled by the drum cam assembly in which a planetary gear train is enclosed, responsible for reducing the motor's high speed to the desired rate for the gun. The 5/8 horsepower 28 Volts DC motor is mounted on the turret bracket and drives the drum cam through a <b>flexible</b> <b>shaft</b> in order to isolate it from the weapon's recoil. The weapon accepts linked ammunition, which was fed from rotary drums {{in the case of}} the M5 and M28 systems, and from boxes {{in the case of the}} XM9 systems. [...] The M5 could also use a box magazine.|$|E

2500|$|Flex is also {{correlated}} to player strength; stronger players will often prefer stiffer flexes, {{as they have}} a sufficient amount of strength to fully bend (and thus maximize potential energy) using such shafts, [...] whereas younger players and players with less strength will generally have more success using more <b>flexible</b> <b>shafts</b> which {{they are capable of}} bending to their optimal degree.|$|R
