5|$|The {{majority}} of Shamrock Rovers supporters originate from the Southside of Dublin, but the club attracts fans {{from across the}} city and country. Since its foundation, the club has maintained a proud Irish identity, and their supporters reflect this in the <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners</b> they display. Their support base contains a number of clubs dedicated to supporting the team at away games. It also contains an ultras group, {{which was the first}} formed in Ireland, the SRFC Ultras, who produce choreographed displays of support at games. They have connections with other European groups including supporters of Roma, Hammarby and Panathinaikos.|$|E

25|$|Bolshevism and {{the threat}} of a Communist-inspired {{revolution}} in the U.S. became the overriding explanation for challenges to the social order, even such largely unrelated events as incidents of interracial violence. Fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in form of display of certain <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners.</b> The First Red Scare effectively ended in mid-1920, after Attorney General Palmer forecast a massive radical uprising on May Day and the day passed without incident.|$|E
25|$|The main Russian {{army was}} then allowed to retreat, as Shuisky {{preferred}} not to reengage in hostilities – despite {{the advice of his}} other commanders to the contrary. Meanwhile, the Polish forces were exhausted and more interested in looting the camp and (according to Podhorecki) did not attempt to stop the Russians. According to another account by Nagielski, they pursued the retreating Russians, inflicting several thousand casualties. The Poles took much loot and trophies, from luxury goods (gold, silver, furs) to military equipment (including all 11 Russian artillery pieces) to war trophies (several command <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines, {{like the}} Romans before them, {{used a variety}} of <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners,</b> {{primarily}} to denote different military units. These were generally square or rectangular, with a number of streamers attached. Most prominent among the early Byzantine flags was the labarum. In the surviving pictorial sources of the middle and later Empire, primarily the illustrated Skylitzes Chronicle, the predominating colours are red and blue in horizontal stripes, with a cross often placed in the centre of the flag. Other common symbols, prominently featuring on seals, were depictions of Christ, the Virgin Mary and saints, but these represent personal rather than family or state symbols. Western European-style heraldry was largely unknown until the last centuries of the Empire.|$|E

25|$|As a response, Ulster loyalists held street protests {{throughout}} Northern Ireland. They see the Council's {{decision as}} part of a wider 'cultural war' against 'Britishness' in Northern Ireland. On the night of the vote, protesters tried to storm City Hall. Throughout December and January, protests were held almost daily and most involved the protesters blocking roads while carrying Union <b>Flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners.</b> Some of these protests led to clashes between loyalists and the police, sparking riots. Rioters attacked police with petrol bombs, bricks, stones and fireworks; police responded with plastic bullets and water cannon. Alliance Party offices and the homes of Alliance Party members were attacked, while Belfast City Councillors were sent death threats. According to police, some of the violence was orchestrated by high-ranking members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Loyalists also put up thousands of Union flags in public places, which has further heightened tension.|$|E
25|$|Lu Xun once advised Sun Quan to {{eliminate}} local bandit forces in Jiangdong first {{because they would}} hinder him in his aims to achieve supremacy over China. Sun Quan heeded Lu Xun's words and appointed him as a Commandant of the Right Section (右部督) under him. Fei Zhan (費棧), a bandit chief in Danyang Commandery, had received an official appointment from Cao Cao, a leading warlord who was also the de facto head of the Han government. Cao Cao had secretly instructed Fei Zhan to instigate the Shanyue tribes in Jiangdong to cause trouble for Sun Quan. In response, Sun Quan sent Lu Xun to attack Fei Zhan. Lu Xun had a much smaller army as compared to Fei Zhan, but he deceived the enemy into thinking that he had more troops. He prepared more <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners,</b> spread out his war drums, ordered his men to sneak into the valleys at night and beat the drums loudly, so as to create an illusion of an overwhelming army. He emerged victorious over Fei Zhan.|$|E
25|$|The Museo Caracas (also Museo Santana, or Museo Crillo) {{is located}} on the ground floor, though one of the rooms is reached via a narrow wooden stairway. The ground floor {{contains}} works by Venezuela's most celebrated painters and many other historic artifacts. Four of the Palacio's rooms are used for exhibiting some 3,000 artifacts of artistic or historic interest. In Room 2, there are paintings of two of Venezuela's historic presidents: Joaquín Crespo (1841–1898) by Arturo Michelena and, just to the left, José Tadeo Monagas (1784–1868) by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Room 3 displays many of Santana's small carved figures representing Venezuelan celebrities from the early 20th century. Room 4 displays <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners</b> including one from 1533 which belonged to the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro. General Antonio José de Sucre presented it to Bolívar when he freed Venezuela from Spanish rule. Room 5 displays paintings by Venezuela's historic artists including Armando Reverón, Emilio Boggio, Rafael Monasterios, Federico Brandt and Manuel Cabré. Miniature paintings of the rural scenes drawn by Raul Santana are also on display. Bolivar is depicted in the heavens on a ceiling mural.|$|E

25|$|Later, Huang Zhong {{heard that}} Cao Cao's forces were {{transporting}} food supplies to Beishan (北山), so {{he led a}} group of soldiers, including some of Zhao Yun's men, to seize the supplies. Huang Zhong did not return after a long time so Zhao Yun led tens of horsemen in search of Huang. Zhao Yun encountered Cao Cao's forces and engaged them in battle but was outnumbered {{and was forced to}} retreat back to his camp, with Cao Cao's men in pursuit. Zhang Yi, one of Zhao Yun's subordinates, wanted to close the gates to prevent the enemy from entering. However, Zhao Yun ordered the gates to be opened, all <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners</b> to be hidden, and the war drums silenced. Cao Cao's forces thought that there was an ambush inside Zhao Yun's camp so they withdrew. Just then, Zhao Yun launched a counter-attack and his men beat the war drums loudly and fired arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao's soldiers were shocked and thrown into disarray. Some of them trampled on each other while fleeing in panic, and many of them fell into the Han River and drowned.|$|E
25|$|In the elections, the TDP {{allied with}} the Sanjaya Vichara Manch party and decided to field educated {{candidates}} who had a good name in the society and were not indulging in corruption, which was an innovative political concept at the time. NTR himself decided to contest from two assembly constituencies, Gudivada and Tirupati. NTR used many innovative ways of campaigning, such as being the first politician in India to use rath yatras for campaigning. However, it was MGR who had started the opentop van campaigning for elections, as {{it was felt that}} he can address the roadshows {{as an alternative to the}} mammoth meetings, which involves large amount of money as well as manpower. For this, he used a modified Chevrolet van which was given the name of Chaitanya Ratham. In this, NTR travelled across the state of Andhra Pradesh, crisscrossing all the districts. With his son Nandamuri Harikrishna, also a film actor, driving the van, NTR notched up over 75,000 kilometres during his campaign, a distinctive sight with the van's yellow party <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners</b> and NTR sitting on top of the vehicle hailing the crowds. NTR campaigned for restoring the dignity of the Telugu people and advocated the forming a closer bond between the government and the common people, going into the elections with the slogan, Telugu Vari Atma Gauravam (lit. Telugu people's self-respect).|$|E
25|$|New {{industries}} {{emerged from}} the 16th century onwards. The woodlands had {{been a source of}} firewood for London during the mediaeval period. A small-scale woodenware industry; making shovels, brooms, spoons and chairs, began around 1538 and its expansion was accompanied by the planting of beechwoods between 17th and 19th centuries. Straw plaiting was seen as home-based work for the wives and daughters of labourers from the 18th century. Straw was also imported from Italy to produce the superior 'Tuscan plait' traded at a Saturday market for the Luton and Dunstable hat trade and remained the major cottage industry until around 1860, providing employment for women and girls some of whom attended a 'plait-school' in Waterside. Lace making developed in the 16th century as a cottage industry and was valued for its quality. Chesham specialised in black lace. The industry declined in the 1850s due to mechinisation in Nottingham. Between 1838 and 1864 silk-spinning, powered by a steam-driven mill in Waterside was started to make use of unemployed lace workers. This trend was relatively short-lived as changes in fashion and the growth of the railways resulted in competition from elsewhere for the valuable London markets. However one exception was the firm of George Tutill, which specialised in high-quality banners and was responsible for three-quarters of those made for trade unions. The firm is still a going concern still specialising in <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to consider proper textile storage in the design plan of your storage facility.

500|$|A state {{coat of arms}} {{may exist}} {{independently}} of the seal, but the reverse is not generally the case. A seal contains a coat of arms or other devices whereas a state coat of arms constitutes the bulk of a seal, except for the wording identifying it as the [...] "Great Seal of the State of..." [...] A [...] "seal" [...] {{has been described as}} the design impressed on public or legislative official documents, whereas a coat of arms generally appears for illustrative purposes. Examples include <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners,</b> and state militia uniform caps and buttons, as well as specifically-designed regimental coats of arms for U.S. Infantry Regiments (e.g., Coats of arms of U.S. Infantry Regiments), and National Guard [...] units.|$|E
500|$|Along {{the railing}} of all ships, most {{prominently}} {{on the large}} carracks and the Galley Subtle, there are rows of banners displaying various heraldic designs, including the English royal arms, one or three fleur-de-lis of the French arms, Saint George's crosses and Henry VIII's monogram ("HR") in gold on blue, {{what appears to be}} the Tudor rose, and the green and white of the House of Tudor. The depictions of the <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners</b> on the ships are in a heraldic and military sense considered to be roughly accurate but not entirely consistent. A kind of system of command among the various vessels is apparent in how flags are displayed on the masts, but it does not appear to have been carried through systematically.

500|$|Although Dong {{had been}} trained in Western painting, he chose a folk art style for The Founding of the Nation, using bright, {{contrasting}} colors {{in a manner similar}} to that in New Year's prints popular in China. [...] He stated in 1953, [...] "the Chinese people like bright, intense colors. [...] This convention is in line with the theme of The Founding Ceremony of the Nation. [...] In my choice of colors I did not hesitate to put aside the complex colors commonly adopted in Western painting as well as the conventional rules for oil painting." [...] Artists in the early years of the People's Republic, including Dong, sought to satisfy Chinese aesthetic tastes in their works and so depicted their subjects in [...] bright original color, avoiding complex use of light and shadow on faces as in many Western paintings. [...] By European standards, the painting's colors are overly intense and saturated. [...] The color vermilion was used for large areas of the columns, the carpets, and the lanterns, setting a tone for the work. [...] The blooming flowers, the <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>banners,</b> and the blue and white sky all give the painting a happy atmosphere—a joyful, festive air, as well as giving [...] "cultural sublimity", appropriate for a work depicting the founding of a nation.|$|E
