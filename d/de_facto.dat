At the time of disintegration, many warlords tried to enthrone {{themselves}} or rule the khanate jointly; however, there had been powerful <b>de</b> <b>factos</b> {{in all parts of the}} Mongol Empire before. The empire and the states that emerged from it were born and shaped in part from the heavy influence of roving bandits.

Roving bandits, contrary to the concept of stationary bandits offered by Mancur Olson, extract from region to region and stay mobile. Warlords in Mongolia could be characterized by this title because of the Mongol Empire's lack of definitive borders and consistent expansion and conquest during the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|R

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{stabilizing}} fragile states is often tied with good governance {{and public service}} delivery for constituents and international development partners. Post-conflict states face higher challenges in delivering public service and good governance when compared to non-post-conflict counterparts due to reduced state capacity in reform implementation, the absence of human capital, the presence of donor organizations, and legacy local governing systems. For example, in post-conflict Sierre Leonne, public service delivery bypassed weak civil service institutions through donor-led aid projects in fields such as healthcare delivery. The resulting formation of parallel mechanisms arrives {{at the cost of}} building state capacity and citizen accountability. [...] Pre-conflict governance structures with traditional or administrative authority, such as the control held by Afghan warlords, historically weaken the delivery of public service and good governance in local regions with a <b>De</b> Jure-De <b>Facto</b> Gap.

ABSTRACT: On {{reviewing the}} scientific {{data on the}} long-acting beta-agonists, it is pointed out they {{do not meet the}} goals they were synthetized â the regular use as maintenance therapy. The fact that they do not possess anti-inflammatory properties is a great handicap because that is exactely the aim of long-term asthma therapy. More than bronchodilation, one would be interested that long-acting beta-agonists could prevent the excessive airway narrowing under inbalatory agression. However, it has been observed that its regular administration decreases the protection against inhaled methacholine, histamine and allergen, and that it does not protect against exercise bronchooonstriction. Futhermore, they induce tolerance to Salbutamol bronchodilation. The usefulness of this drugs seems, therefore, to be scarce. They should not, in any circunstance, be administered as monotherapy. If for mild and moderate asthma we easily find other options, we remain, beside the nocturnal asthma prevention, with its use in more severe cases of asthma as presumable potentiator of corticosteroids.

40|$|From 1963 when it {{was filed}} to 1982 when the United States Supreme Court ruled on it, the {{important}} but understudied, civil rights and equal educational opportunity case of Crawford v. Los Angeles City Board of Education encapsulated and propelled the legal and political framework of an era. This dissertation is the first full scale history {{of the case and}} the political, social, and legal discourse around it since 1991. In this dissertation I argue that what began as a school desegregation lawsuit under the framework of a straightforward black-white binary, transformed dramatically over nearly two decades due to demographic and economic shifts in the city, as well the decision-making processes within two powerful institutional contexts at the Los Angeles City Board of Education and the courts. These contexts, in turn, generated new political identities, ideologies, and actors through the process of various forms of decision-making during the struggle over school desegregation. Los Angeles’ racial politics changed markedly by 1982 because racial and ethnic groups managed to carve out political spaces and concessions from these two institutions, but the political coalitions in the city were characterized by a condition of fragmented diversity, marked by racial coalitions that emanated out of political fissures among and within racial and ethnic communities. However, these influential political and legal institutions created the context and the parameters under which these new actors could operate, delineating who would participate in the political and legal arenas over education policy generally, and Crawford specifically. For example, as the case progressed through the courts, these institutions would legitimize the participation of individuals and groups – as members of official committees or intervenors – over others. On the ideological front, these institutions shaped the debate over the meaning of equal educational opportunity, compensatory education, bilingual/bicultural education, and <b>de</b> jure/de <b>facto</b> segregation. These institutions also dictated and in some cases co-opted many transformative events and circumstances, including the student demonstrations of 1968 {{and the rise of the}} anti-busing coalitio...|$|R
