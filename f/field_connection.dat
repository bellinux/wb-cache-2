40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} a possible role of the solar magnetic field in the formation of the stationary solar wind (SW). An analysis of the SW proton velocities measured by Ulysses for the period of ~ 1. 5 activity cycle in combination with SW speed IPS-observations as well as the XUV corona images and solar magnetic field data has been performed. The main result of this study is the finding of inverse relation between the SW speeds and solar magnetic field strengths: the stronger the closed magnetic fields the slower the solar wind and vice versa, that points to direct interactions of the solar wind plasma flows with solar magnetic fields. Thus, solar magnetic fields are responsible not only for the solar corona formation via plasma trapping and heating but also for the SW velocity ranging.

The fieldline to fieldline displacements follow a power law distribution with typical displacements of just a few Mm. Three loops visible in emulated Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE) filters are analysed in detail and found to have significantly different heating rates and distributions thereof, one of them showing a small scale heating event. The dynamical structure is complicated even though all the loops are visible in a single filter along most of their lengths. None of the loops are static, but {{are in the process of}} evolving into loops with very different characteristics. Differential Emission Measure (DEM) curves along one of the loops illustrate that DEM curves have to be treated carefully if physical characteristics are to be extracted.

40|$|The six Painlevé {{equations}} {{were introduced}} {{over a century}} ago, motivated by rather theoretical considerations. Over the last several decades, these equations and their solutions, known as the Painlevé transcendents, {{have been found to}} play an increasingly central role in numerous areas of mathematical physics. Due to extensive dense pole fields in the complex plane, their numerical evaluation remained challenging until the recent introduction of a fast ’pole field solver ’ (Fornberg and Weideman, J. Comp. Phys. 230 (2011), 5957 - 5973). The fourth Painlevé equation has two free parameters in its coefficients, as well as two free initial conditions. The present study applies this new computational tool to the special case when both of its parameters are zero. We confirm existing analytic and asymptotic knowledge about the equation, and also explore solution regimes which have not been described in the previous literature.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the time dependent parallel heat transport equation modeling heat pulses driven by power modulation in 3 -dimensional chaotic magnetic fields are presented. The numerical method {{is based on the}} Fourier formulation of a Lagrangian-Green's function method that provides an accurate and efficient technique for the solution of the parallel heat transport equation in the presence of harmonic power modulation. The numerical results presented provide conclusive evidence that {{even in the absence of}} magnetic flux surfaces, chaotic magnetic field configurations with intermediate levels of stochasticity exhibit transport barriers to modulated heat pulse propagation. In particular, high-order islands and remnants of destroyed flux surfaces (Cantori) act as partial barriers that slow down or even stop the propagation of heat waves at places where the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>connection</b> length exhibits a strong gradient. Results on modulated heat pulse propagation in fully stochastic fields and across magnetic islands are also presented. In qualitative agreement with recent experiments in LHD and DIII-D, it is shown that the elliptic (O) and hyperbolic (X) points of magnetic islands have a direct impact on the spatio-temporal dependence of the amplitude of modulated heat pulses...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} magnetospheric {{electrons}} from Jupiter into interplanetary space is modulated by the Jovian rotation period. The Voyager 1 and 2 observations {{showed that the}} modulation period agrees on the average with the synodic period of Jupiter (9 h 55 m 33. 12 s), but over intervals of weeks it can differ from the synodic period by several minutes. The lack of exact synchronization is attributed to changes of the plasma population in the Jovian magnetosphere. The Jovian modulation {{appears to be a}} persistent feature of the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere and the disappearance of the modulation away from Jupiter is attributed to interplanetary propagation conditions. This leads to the following limits on the diffuse coefficient for interplanetary electrons: kappa perpendicular is or = 8 x 10 to the 19 th power sq cm/s and kappa parallel is or = 10 to the 21 st power sq cm/s.

The 13 -month intensity variation results from the synodic interplanetary magnetic field conection of earth to Jupiter. Direct compariosn of intensity-time flux profiles for the years 1976 - 1984, about 7 synodic Jovian electron seasons, shows that the intensity envelope of peak electron flux at GEO {{does not appear to be}} correlated to the observed 13 month intensity envelope of relativistic electron flux in the interplanetary region near earth. A persistent 13 -month variation of GEO flux is not obvious, thus indicating that the intensity of electron flux at GEO is not directly and soley related to the intensity of Jovian electron flux near earth.

This methodology is based on the temporary application of an external voltage between an external anode located on the concrete and the rebar connected as cathode.

The migration of ionic inhibitors to the rebar could be considered during the connection of an electric field to favour the regeneration of the passive film.

In this paper, the effect of confining the grout that surrounds isolated, single reinforcing bars on the bond strength between the bar and the grout is investigated. Grout-filled steel pipe splices with different parameters and geometrical design were prepared and loaded in axial tension until failure. The test specimens are described and the test results are presented, with discussion and analysis in light of existing theory. The experimental results show that a generic and inexpensive reinforcing bar splice for <b>field</b> <b>connection</b> of precast concrete members can be achieved using grout-filled standard steel pipe.
