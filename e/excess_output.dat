Technology shocks provide the most significant contribution to output volatility. The stockout-avoidance motive is also important.

Governments in large, developed countries such as the United States {{and members of the}} European Union intercede in the markets for agricultural goods to ensure that their domestic farmers are not excessively harmed by fluctuations in the prices of their goods or increases in competition from abroad.

The European Union similarly has established measures to protect its own farmers. While farmers benefit from these protective measures, other groups are affected adversely.

The {{purpose of this article}} is to develop a questionnaire that captures the time lost from work due to a health problem and job and workplace characteristics so that the value of productivity loss to society can be calculated. MethodsFirst, a questionnaire battery was developed by selecting items from existing productivity questionnaires. Next, items with similar content were identified and duplications were eliminated. Third, the draft questionnaire's feasibility was pretested in a focus group (n = 15). Finally, after appropriate refinements, its applicability was tested in 140 employed patients with rheumatoid arthritis recruited from a cohort in the United Kingdom. Multipliers relating the wage to marginal productivity were also derived using the questionnaire. ResultsThe final questionnaire includes items on employment status; absenteeism; presenteeism; unpaid work; and job characteristics, which includes questions on team dynamics, availability of substitutes and their substitutability, time sensitivity, and compensation mechanisms. The importance of incorporating these questions demonstrated that when one employee was absent, or present at work but unable to work at full capacity, the consequent output loss could exceed the output of the employee alone. Multipliers were shown to be greater than one and represented the <b>excess</b> <b>output</b> loss. ConclusionsThe new questionnaire enabled the job and workplace characteristics to be captured so that the actual productivity loss at the societal level attributable to absenteeism and presenteeism could be valued...|$|E
40|$|The diminished {{excretion}} of creatinine in progressive {{muscular dystrophy}} {{is a more}} striking and specific phenomenon than the excess excretion of creatine, marked though this is. While creatinuria is invariably encountered in all cases of long-standing dystrophy, {{the extent to which}} the excretion of creatinine is decreased provides a more reliable indication of the severity of the disease since an <b>excess</b> <b>output</b> of creatine may occur physiologically in normal human subjects and in many pathological conditions not known to be associated with muscle disease. In progressive muscular dystrophy the residual muscle mass, as inferred from the excretion of creatinine, provides a useful index of the state of the disease at any given time. Although there is excessive creatinuria in progressive muscular dystrophy, there is no evidence that a deprivation of methyl stores occurs through a loss of urinary creatine. The loss of methyl groups contained in the excess creatine is, under ordinary conditions of diet, almost exactly compensated for by a drop in the excretion of methyl groups in the urinary creatinine. Testosterone propionate, administered over variable periods of time, resulted in the retention of creatine both in normal male children and in male children with progressive muscular dystrophy, as shown in the normal subjects by a diminution in creatine output, and in both by an excess creatinuria for variable periods of time following withdrawal of the hormone. An increase in the excretion of creatine in progressive muscular dystrophy occurred following the administration of methyl testosterone. Neither testosterone propionate nor methyl testosterone appeared to effect any consistent change in the output or urinary creatinine. No effects on the excretion of creatine and creatinine were observed following the prolonged administration of concentrate of gonadotropic and thyrotropic principles of the hypophysis, or from the administration of desoxycorticosterone acetate to patients with progressive muscular dystrophy. Except in one case, in which marked improvement was observed following the administration of testosterone propionate, no effects on the clinical course of the patients with progressive muscular dystrophy were observed as a result of treatment by any of the various hormones employed in this study...|$|E
40|$|In early 1997, the {{recently}} formed National/New Zealand First coalition government embarked upon an Employment Strategy {{which was to}} generate extensive structural upheaval in the New Zealand public service. In short order, the largest government department was dismantled, a second was much reduced, and three new bureaucracies were created. This dissertation searches for {{the causes of the}} trajectory and outcomes of those institutional reforms. Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, the thesis explores the motives of the senior politicians and officials involved in the Employment Strategy, tests the relative influence of those actors over decision-making, and examines the bearing which institutional arrangements within the political executive had on the course and consequences of the Employment Strategy. Two theoretical approaches are used {{to make sense of the}} data. The rational choice case for bureaucratic change proposes that the institutional shape of the public sector is a function of instrumental bureaucratic conduct. Specifically, budget-maximisation is assumed to result in an increasing number of government departments, each consuming an expanding budget and producing <b>excess</b> <b>output.</b> The orthodox economic model provides a poor explanation of the Employment Strategy. The bureau-shaping model (Dunleavy, 1991), on the other hand, which employs a revised rational choice maximand to explain the influence of officials on bureaucratic reform, has more explanatory potential. The assumption that senior officials are motivated to shape the institutional parameters of their departments, rather than to maximise budgets, generates valuable insights regarding the structural revisions in question. Nonetheless, a bureau-shaping analysis cannot explain the variation in officials' preferences which marked the Employment Strategy, or the influence which Cabinet ministers had on the resolution of key policy debates. Those limitations point to the value of the second theoretical tradition used in the study. Historical institutionalism combines human agency and institutional context in a single account of political outcomes. The analysis in this thesis accommodates optimising behaviour, but explains it in the context of the institutions of the political executive which mediated decision-making during the Employment Strategy. However, neither rational choice nor historical institutionalism can fully account for the process and institutional results of the Employment Strategy. The thesis advocates a rapprochement between the proponents of individual agency and those who emphasise structural context and historical particularity. For the first time, this dissertation extends the existing new institutionalist literature and articulates a theoretical pathway to that end...|$|E

40|$|An acardiac twin {{pregnancy}} {{is a rare}} but serious complication of monochorionic twinning and consists of an acardiac twin and a pump twin. The acardiac twin is a severely malformed fetus that lacks most organs, particularly a heart, but grows during pregnancy because it is perfused by the developmentally normal pump twin via a set of arterioarterial and venovenous placental anastomoses. Pump twins die intrauterine or neonatally in about 50 % of the cases. Because the effects of an acardiac mass on the pump twin's development arc incompletely known, methods for outcome prognosis are currently not available. We sought to derive simple relations for the pump twin's <b>excess</b> cardiac <b>output</b> and decreased oxygenation and to use available clinical cases for a preliminary test of the model.

40|$|Background: Acardiac monochorionic twins lack cardiac {{function}} but grow by passive perfusion of {{the pump}} twin's deoxygenated arterial blood through placental arterioarterial (AA) and venovenous (VV) anastomoses and by hypoxia-mediated neovascularization. Pump twins therefore must continuously increase their cardiac output which may cause heart failure. Our aims were: to adapt our twin-twin transfusion syndrome model for acardiac twin pregnancies, to simulate pump and acardiac twin development, {{and to examine}} the model for early prognostic markers of pump twin survival. Methods: We used an infinite acardiac placental resistance, based on placental dye injection studies and simulations, suggesting the AA-Acardiac-VV series resistance determines the pump twin's <b>excess</b> cardiac <b>output.</b> Pump and acardiac development were expressed by the pump's <b>excess</b> cardiac <b>output</b> versus its normal value, represented by pump/acardiac umbilical venous diameter (UVD) ratios. Results: UVD ratios distinguish between AA-VV anastomoses that do and do not cause hydropic pump twins. Pump twins can handle relative larger acardiac perfusion at later than earlier gestation. Both VV and acardiac resistances are significantly smaller than the AA resistance, based on respectively clinical data and acardiac blood volumetric growth. Conclusion: Our simulations support clinical results which show that UVD ratios aid in the prediction of pump twin risk. The AA anastomosis controls the future of both the pump and the acardiac. Correlation between acardiac size and pump twin risk is secondary to the AA size but remains clinically usable. These factors may aid {{in the development of}} methods for pump twin prognosis and the promotion of selective clinical interventions...|$|R
