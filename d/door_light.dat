40|$|Abstract — An Incubator is an {{apparatus}} for maintaining an infant, especially {{one that is}} ill or born before the usual gestation period. Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters is very often necessary {{for the evaluation of}} health conditions, diagnostic reasons and the detection of life or health threatening events. For infants, especially, who cannot provide any feedback about discomfort or health complaints it is an important issue to collect objective data under everyday conditions. This research work provides design of embedded device for real time monitoring of infants. The Embedded device includes sensors for Door Security, Light Intensity, Voice detection of incubator for the continuous monitoring of infants under clinical and home conditions. It will allow the early detection of potential life threatening events. The device would involve DSPIC microcontroller (Part no: 330011 is used for transmitting the audio signals, from the incubator, the microcontroller will generate control signals for the given parameters. The system will monitor the 3 parameters <b>Door,</b> <b>Light,</b> Audio / voice of the baby that he/she is ok or crying. The Door parameter provides an Intruder bell it will gives alarm/Led indication if any person will come at the place /Room of baby by breaking the sensor.

The master thesis was performed during 2015 / 2016 and {{is part of a}} product development project at Clas Ohlson aiming to develop a new kind of solar powered out <b>door</b> <b>light.</b> Clas Ohlson have limited experience with in house product development, and this project could be a pilot project to evaluate future in house product development. This projects main focus is the creative parts of the product development process and the detail development. The product developed resulted in a product with high customisation potential in many aspects including aesthetic, mounting, electronic and packaging. The resulting material, such as CAD-files, is handed over to Clas Ohlson for them to adjust if necessary in order to take the result in to production. The starting point is the company ́s desire to comply with one of their main objectives: provide sustainable products. The desire was for me to develop a solar powered outdoor light. The result is a module based system which can be expanded in multiple ways, from changing the function, to changing the appearance. In the chapter results you also find a suggested launch plan showing the width of the presented solution and the many opportunities the end user would have to upgrade their product without generating excessive waste. ...|$|E
40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witswatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science Johannesburg February 2013 Foraging {{is an essential part}} of an animal’s everyday life, during which it has to balance out many costs and rewards while making decisions on where, what, when and how to forage. The aim of my study was to investigate how different cost/benefit foraging scenarios affect foraging decisions in captive Bushveld gerbils. The foraging behaviour of Bushveld gerbils was studied in four experiments to establish the effect of cost/benefit scenarios on their foraging behaviour, specifically I tested i) how much gerbils will work for seeds of different quality; ii) how seed presentation (piled/scattered) influences foraging behaviour; and iii) the effect of potential predation risk on foraging decisions. Initial seed preference studies for five commercially available seeds (sunflower, sorghum, oats, maize and wild rice) indicated that the gerbils displayed individual seed preferences, and this information was then used to tailor the experiments to the preferences of individual gerbils. The experimental apparatus consisted of 2 joined tanks, one of which, the experimental tank, was designed to impose a cost (weighted door) to access reward (food). The weight of the door was altered to create a low cost <b>door</b> (<b>light</b> door) or a high cost door (heavy door) that was individually tailored to the gerbils by using their individual body weights to create a heavy door approximately the same weight as the gerbil. Most and least preferred seeds were used to create a high reward and a low reward, respectively. Using the door in combination with the preferred seeds, 4 treatments were created, namely, low cost low reward, low cost high reward, high cost low reward, and high cost high reward. These treatments were run in 4 different experiments that were designed to assess the decisions Bushveld gerbils made during foraging. My results indicated that the gerbils employed foraging strategies which, firstly, favoured a reduced cost, possibly linked to reduced energy expenditure, and secondly, gaining the highest rewards. The gerbils consumed less in high cost and low reward treatments, and consumed more in low cost and high reward treatments. The data also revealed that the presentation of the seeds influenced foraging decisions, where seed consumption and exploratory behaviour differed when seeds were piled rather than scattered, depending on the cost/reward structure. Under potential predation risk, the gerbils employed predator avoidance strategies by using cover more and reducing foraging, indicating they were trading-off foraging against predation risk. Demand curves generated to assess decision-making indicated that the gerbils made consistent decisions except under particular circumstances, such as when there was a large difference in food value and cost. Ultimately, my study showed that Bushveld gerbils change their foraging decisions in a predictable way to exploit low cost and high reward situations. Their decision-making was largely inelastic, indicating that foraging decisions were similar under different circumstances, except when there is a large discrepancy between the qualities of seeds presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Out <b>door</b> <b>lighting</b> {{in most of}} {{the rural}} and urban areas in India are not energy efficient. As it is the {{indispensable}} part of the rural and urban infrastructure. Hence there is tremendous potential for the improvement and proper maintenance without altering present out <b>door</b> <b>lighting</b> system. This paper focuses on the problems like power saving, power theft, security, and immediate response to problems. Here we suggest a system which can monitor and control power continuously. An experimental system of wireless sensor network can be developed to study the feasibility for out door monitoring and control system. It also helps to design a highly secured and efficient system which can save power, as is the prime demand to meet the present increasing power needs. The important phenomenon of the paper is to consider the prime things while designing new system, that can read, corrects and as well as control utilization of power efficiently. This system consists of a base station (also called as control center) and a sensor node at each of the remote station (also called as feeder enable box). The base station monitors and controls all out <b>door</b> <b>lights</b> at real-time. This paper presents a modern and secured street lighting control system with Embedded system based AC regulator system for lighting applications. The system guarantees energy savings due to power dimming options to avoid unnecessary glowing of bulbs during night hours according to traffic safety and lighting comfort and ON OFF timings in the morning & evening hours...|$|R
