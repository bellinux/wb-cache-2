For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E

After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film <b>is</b> <b>wonderful.</b> While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E

Radcliffe {{received}} a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was [...] "not that important" [...] to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: [...] "Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing," [...] wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|E

In the film, Ryder plays May Welland the fiancée of Newland Archer (Day-Lewis). The film, set in the 1870s, was principally filmed in New York and Paris. Her role in this movie won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress {{as well as an}} Academy Award nomination in the same category. Although not a commercial success, it received critical praise. Vincent Canby in the New York Times wrote; 'Ms Ryder <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> as this sweet young thing who's hard as nails, as much out of ignorance as of self-interest.' Ryder was set to star in Broken Dreams with actor River Phoenix. The project was put on hold due to his untimely death in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Darryl is {{initially}} unsuccessful in {{his attempts to}} win Charlie over, but Anderson hinted that her character would fall for him. She said, [...] "I think the way Steve [...] has played Brax, there is definitely enough there for Charlie {{to see that he}} has a heart and to see the good side in him as well." [...] Discussing the plot in which Charlie tried to keep Ruby away from Casey, Anderson said, [...] "I think she's also telling herself to stay away from Brax, but Charlie can't get him out of her head." [...] Colin Vickery of The Daily Telegraph said Darryl had turned Charlie's [...] "safe police world" [...] upside down, and Anderson told him, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. There is this element of danger that brings excitement along with it." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "fun and flirty" [...] and said it shows another layer to Charlie, as it has brought out her fun side. The arrival of Darryl's ex-girlfriend Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) causes Charlie and Darryl to split. However, Vickery said it was obvious that Charlie cannot stay away from Darryl for long.|$|E

[...] "Anything that makes fashion entertaining and glamorous and interesting <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> for our industry. So I was 100 percent behind it." [...] Streep said Wintour was [...] "probably more upset by the book than the film". Anna Wintour’s popularity skyrocketed after her portrayal in The Devil Wears Prada. She was happy with the portrayal she got from Meryl Streep that did not place her in a position of complete villainy in which she felt was an unfair representation of her. [...] Meryl Streep said she did't base her character in the The Devil Wears Prada on Anna Wintour, instead saying she was inspired by men she had known previously: [...] "Unfortunately you don't have enough women in power, or at least I don't know them, to copy." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} criticism, cast members' {{performances}} were usually well received – in particular, Palmer's portrayal of Akeelah. Ebert said, [...] "The movie depends on her, and she deserves its trust." [...] Hornaday opined that [...] "Palmer's Akeelah is that cinematic , {{the kid who}} is cute without being too cute, sympathetic without being cloying, and believable without being tiresome." [...] Evening Chronicle stated Palmer does it [...] "with effortless grace" [...] and that she [...] "carries the film and doesn't strike a single wrong emotional note." [...] Fuchs felt {{that most of the}} film's strengths [...] "have to do with Palmer's winning performance." [...] Ingman declared Atchison's [...] "ensemble <b>is</b> <b>wonderful,</b> and his star, Palmer, is a fantastically assured young actress who conveys Akeelah's maelstrom of 11-year-old feelings with no apparent effort." [...] Turan complimented how Fishburne and Bassett's [...] "presence and ability give this film a welcome integrity." [...] Mohan stated, [...] "Although Fishburne and Bassett can do these roles in their sleep, the kids are actually quite engaging." [...] Tourmakine felt there were [...] "fine performances all around" [...] and that Fishburne and Bassett [...] "lend fine support in utterly believable roles".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A−, finding it [...] "is, like many episodes {{of this season}} before it, a bit of mess, a melange of concepts which don't always taste so great together". Handlen felt that the episode began with an [...] "iffy" [...] premise which more closely resembled an episode of The X-Files, but by its end had managed to make it something more distinct and separate. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, writing that it was [...] "an episode that pays {{lip service to the}} Group's interest in this case to merely go back to the same old [...] "killer of the week" [...] conceit". However, Gibron felt that [...] "the acting <b>is</b> <b>wonderful,</b> and the actual story very moody and atmospheric". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Pest House" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman praised guest star Massee's performance, and felt that the script was [...] "great fun", noting that it worked as a more serious version of the 1996 film Scream.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} between his return from Paris in 1908 and the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music. For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals, which generated publicity and royalties. In 1910 his music featured at two {{of the largest and most}} prestigious festivals, with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month. The leading British music critics of the time, J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian, were strong in their praise. The former wrote of the fantasia, [...] "The work <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> because it seems to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling. Throughout its course one is never sure whether one is listening to something very old or very new". Langford declared that the symphony [...] "definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers". Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams's largest-scale work was the first version of A London Symphony (1914). In the same year he wrote The Lark Ascending in its original form for violin and piano.|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} {{has worked with}} screenwriter David S. Goyer on all his comic-book adaptations. Wally Pfister was the cinematographer for all of Nolan's films from Memento to The Dark Knight Rises. Embarking on his own career as a director, Pfister said: [...] "The greatest lesson I learned from Chris Nolan is to keep my humility. He is an absolute gentleman on set and he <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> to everyone — from the actors to the entire crew, he treats everyone with respect." [...] Lee Smith has been Nolan's editor since Batman Begins, with Dody Dorn editing Memento and Insomnia. David Julyan composed the music for Nolan's early work, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provided the music for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Zimmer scored The Dark Knight Rises, and has worked with Nolan on his subsequent films. Zimmer has said his creative relationship with Nolan is highly collaborative, and that he views Nolan as [...] "the co-creator of the score". The {{director has}} worked with sound designer Richard King and sound mixer Ed Novick since The Prestige. Nolan has frequently collaborated with special-effects supervisor Chris Corbould, stunt coordinator Tom Struthers first assistant director Nilo Otero, and visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin. Production designer Nathan Crowley has worked with him since Insomnia (except for Inception). Nolan has called Crowley {{one of his closest}} and most inspiring creative collaborators. Casting director John Papsidera has worked on all of Nolan's films, except Following and Insomnia.|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington <b>is</b> <b>wonderful.</b> [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E
500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
