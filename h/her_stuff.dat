500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of <b>her</b> <b>stuff</b> and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E

BET writer Dominique Zonyeé {{spoke on the}} track, calling it a [...] "high energy, boastful song in which Azealia struts <b>her</b> <b>stuff</b> while reminding you that competitors have nothing on her". Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound thought that the song had [...] "the potential to a true club banger". Vanyaland writer Michael Marotta described the track as [...] "brooding and menacing", going on to describe Banks' delivery, [...] "Banks slices through her verses {{in a way that}} recalls the magic she first flashed on the still-lethal 2011 track '212'". In a positive review, Chris Thomas from HipHopWired complimented the track, writing [...] "The Harlem native waxes poetics with a dexterous flow. Her rhymes are laden with braggadocios lines about her boss status". In a mixed review, Kevipod from Direct Lyrics complimented the song's instrumental, but was critical of Banks' vocals, writing [...] "'Heavy Metal and Reflective' possesses a hard-hitting, menacing beat courtesy of Lil Internet and a lot of stale rapping by Azealia", while also commenting on the need for a more mainstream song from Banks' [...] "if she really wants to put her career together again". Robbie Daw from Idolator panned the track, describing the song as [...] "trap-lite trash", recommending that Banks spends more time [...] "actually focus on not making shit music".|$|E

Laura Schreffler of Daily Mail concluded that [...] "one very big thing is noticeably missing" [...] in the video, referring to Beyoncé's pregnancy. However, Schreffler praised her look and outfits which were getting [...] "racier and racier".

[...] Nakisha Williams of BET praised the [...] "flashy looks Beyoncé chose to get her 'Party' on". Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post praised the [...] "pretty glamorous trailer park affair" [...] and the party in the video saying that it's a [...] "party you wish you were invited to."

2500|$|The I Am... World Tour {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from critics. Mike Ross of the website Jam! gave Knowles' [...] "spectacular" [...] performance 4.5 out of 5 stars stating that she proved she could sing traditional R {{if she wanted}} with the cover of Etta James' [...] "At Last". He further noted that the show had [...] "high-production bells... {{a wide range of}} musical styles... a remarkable vocal range, and of course the riveting presence of the star herself." [...] Stephanie Classen of The Star Phoenix remarked, [...] "Beyoncé doesn't really need the bells and whistles of a big stadium show, but it sure makes for an unforgettable concert." [...] Additional praise was received from Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press who graded her [...] "lavishly produced" [...] performance 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "In Sasha-mode... Knowles is raw energy convincingly expressing a live hard/work hard ethos with every shimmy and nimble vocal trill... But Beyoncé... showed feeling ... with more ballad-y numbers" [...] further noting that her split-personality [...] "bounces back and forth" [...] throughout the show. Alice Jones of The Independent noted that whether Knowles performed power balladry, dancehall or electro songs, [...] "she sings her heart out" [...] and further praised the [...] "astonishingly high-energy show, the ambitious choreography barely grazing her perfect, lung-busting vocals which run from caramel smooth to honeyed foghorn". She concluded her review by saying, [...] "Watching Beyoncé sing and strut <b>her</b> <b>stuff</b> can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating. She takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes, [...] "there is a breathtaking elegance in her acute desire to entertain" [...] further saying that [...] "the whole point of the dazzling show was to make you ask how she does it. Not just physically, but organizationally." [...] Ratliff also praised Knowles' [...] "hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference." [...] Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of The Belfast Telegraph described the show as [...] "incredible... mind blowing... electrifying". [...] A writer of Evening Chronicle wrote that Knowles proved she was the best entertainer [...] "with a two-hour set packed with bling, glamour and, most importantly, enthusiasm", further praising her for singing the songs live [...] "hit every note" [...] while dancing to her choreography. The writer further chose the performances of [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights during the show describing Knowles' vocals as [...] "incredible". Similarly, Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times chose the same songs as highlights during the show, further saying that [...] "Halo" [...] was the most memorable moment of the night. She also praised Knowles' [...] "enviable" [...] dancing skills, compared her with Dionne Warwick but noted that, [...] "Her brilliant performance, which was only let down by weaker, less melodic songs such as Get Me Bodied or Upgrade U, was matched by spectacular production and audio visuals." [...] Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger also wrote that [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] were as [...] "riveting as anything that had come before", further choosing the performances of [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] as other highlights. Lustig described the show as a [...] "bona fide pop spectacle" [...] noting that many of the songs which were performed had futuristic themes. Jim Farber from the Daily News viewed the tour as [...] "a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops" [...] and added that [...] "Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point".|$|E

50|$|Most stories {{focus on}} {{the daily lives of}} the main {{characters}} and occasionally on the secondary characters; the humour usually uses various types of repetitions, allusions, appeals to the nonsense, paranomasias, sarcasm and metalanguage. The stories with Monica and Jimmy Five revolve around the conflict between the two. Jimmy Five is a troublemaker and bully who always tries to scold Monica or steal <b>her</b> <b>stuffed</b> bunny to give knots in its ears (usually having Smudge or another boy accomplice), always having Monica get her revenge by hitting him with <b>her</b> <b>stuffed</b> bunny, often leaving him bruised and with black eyes. Often Jimmy Five makes plans against her with various traps, sometimes using Franklin's inventions or talking Smudge into helping, but he always loses to Monica at the end.|$|R

60|$|In {{another moment}} she had {{discovered}} the trail she had made overnight and that morning by dragging firewood. It was now a shallow soft white trench. Instantly her despair and fatigue had gone from her. Should she take a load of wood with her? she asked herself, {{in addition to the}} weight behind her, and had a better idea. She would unload and pile <b>her</b> <b>stuff</b> here, and bring him down on the sledge closer to the wood. She looked about and saw two rocks that diverged with a space between. She flashed schemes. She would trample the snow hard and flat, put her sledge on it, pile boughs and make a canopy of blanket overhead and behind. Then a fire in front.|$|E
60|$|She {{found the}} camping-place {{piled high with}} drifted snow, which had invaded tent and hut, and that some beast, a {{wolverine}} she guessed, had been into the hut, devoured every candle-end and the uppers of Trafford's well-greased second boots, and had then gone {{to the corner of}} the store shed and clambered up to the stores. She made no account of its depredations there, but set herself to make a sledge and get her supplies together. There was a gleam of sunshine, but she did not like the look of the sky, and she was horribly afraid of what might be happening to Trafford. She carried <b>her</b> <b>stuff</b> through the wood and across the ravine, and returned for her improvised sledge. She was still struggling with that among the trees when it began to snow again.|$|E
60|$|It {{was hard}} then {{not to be}} frantic in her efforts. As it was, she packed <b>her</b> <b>stuff</b> so loosely on the {{planking}} {{that she had to}} repack it, and she started without putting on her snowshoes, and floundered fifty yards before she discovered that omission. The snow was now falling fast, darkling the sky and hiding everything but objects close at hand, and she had to use all her wits to determine her direction; she knew she must go down a long slope and then up to the ridge, and it came to her as a happy inspiration that if she bore to the left she might strike some recognizable vestige of her morning's trail. She had read of people walking in circles when they have no light or guidance, and that troubled her until she bethought herself of the little compass on her watch chain. By that she kept her direction. She wished very much she had timed herself across the waste, so that she could tell when she approached the ridge.|$|E
