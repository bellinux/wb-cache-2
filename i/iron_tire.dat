As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the rail. Wagon wheels naturally did not have a flange. They were made of wood, with an <b>iron</b> <b>tire.</b> Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed." [...] In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said [...] "the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof".|$|E
50|$|The first bicycle wheels {{followed}} {{the traditions of}} carriage building: a wooden hub, a fixed steel axle (the bearings were located in the fork ends), wooden spokes and a shrink fitted <b>iron</b> <b>tire.</b> A typical modern wheel has a metal hub, wire tension spokes and a metal or carbon fiber rim which holds a pneumatic rubber tire.|$|E
50|$|Situated at {{a natural}} gorge of the Whippany River, several {{hydraulic}} powered forges existed, predating {{the establishment of}} the ironworks by Stephen Vail and two business partners. Vail became sole owner of the works in 1815 and expanded it, producing a variety of agricultural and industrial machinery. The ironworks innovated the first durable <b>iron</b> <b>tire</b> for railroad locomotives in January 1836. With changing industrial trends and a decline in the flow of the Whippany River, the ironworks were shut down in 1873, its equipment being sold to ironworks in Brooklyn, Coatbridge, Scotland. The remains of the factory buildings burned in 1908, and the few surviving walls and foundations remain unrestored.|$|E
50|$|One of Canada's first {{automobiles}} was manufactured at Hopewell, Nova Scotia in 1898, named 'The Victorian'. The {{car was a}} two passenger buggy with <b>iron</b> <b>tires,</b> chain drive, and tiller steering.|$|R

50|$|The typical wagon with 40 to 50 in {{diameter}} wheels could easily move {{over rough ground}} and rocks without high centering and even over most tree stumps if required. The wooden wheels were protected with an iron rim (tire) typically about 1.5 in wide. These iron tires were installed hot so they would shrink tightly onto the wood wheel when they cooled. Nevertheless, it was often necessary to use wooden wedges to keep the iron rim on or soak the wheel in water. The dry desert air sometimes dried the tires so much the <b>iron</b> <b>tire</b> was prone to fall off. Wagon wheels could often be repaired by blacksmiths found along the way or replaced with an abandoned wagon's wheel but otherwise if damaged the wagon usually had to be abandoned. Some damaged wagons were salvaged by cutting the wagon in half and converting the front or rear half of the wagon into a two-wheeled cart. Most of the wagons had a large toolbox, mounted on the left side, usually containing an ax, wagon jack, ropes, short handled shovel, wheel chains for securing the wheels for steep descents and extra chain to hook up another team if double teaming was required for steep ascents and other tools often needed or used. The wagon jack was used for raising each wagon wheel. Then the large axle nut could be unscrewed and the wheel removed for greasing which was required periodically. The wheels were greased {{with a mixture of}} tar or pine resin and lard contained in a covered wooden bucket or large ox horn often hanging from the rear axle to keep its greasy contents away from other goods. Starting with at least one gallon of wagon grease was recommended. On a wagon there was essentially no reverse or brakes and the turning radius was nearly always greater than 125 ft so the teamsters had to think about how to extract the wagon and his team from wherever they went.|$|E
50|$|The first bicycle race is popularly held to {{have been}} a 1,200 meter race on the 31 May 1868 at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, Paris.

5000|$|In {{conjunction}} with this skill, extensive woodland on the Jura mountains {{around the town}} provided the raw material for charcoal, a form of carbon free of sulphur and other impurities that make most coal unsuitable for iron working. Extensive woodland was an asset, as it takes many trees to make a relatively small amount of iron goods. In 1763, the owners, the Péry family, produced more than 15,000 scythes and more than 60,000 <b>iron</b> <b>tires</b> for the wheels of vehicles.|$|R
50|$|As the horse-drawn {{carriage}} {{was replaced}} by the car and lorry or truck, and speeds increased, the need for smoother roads and less vertical displacement became more apparent, and pneumatic tires were developed to decrease the apparent roughness. Wagon and carriage wheels, made of wood, had a tire {{in the form of an}} iron strip that kept the wheel from wearing out quickly. Pneumatic tires, which had a larger footprint than <b>iron</b> <b>tires,</b> also were less likely to get bogged down in the mud on unpaved roads.|$|R

5000|$|According to Dupuit (1837), rolling {{resistance}} (of wheeled carriages with wooden wheels with <b>iron</b> <b>tires)</b> is approximately {{inversely proportional to}} the square root of wheel diameter. This rule has been experimentally verified for cast iron wheels (8" [...] - 24" [...] diameter) on steel rail and for 19th century carriage wheels. But there are other tests on carriage wheels that do not agree. Theory of a cylinder rolling on an elastic roadway also gives this same rule These contradict earlier (1785) tests by Coulomb of rolling wooden cylinders where Coulomb reported that {{rolling resistance}} was inversely proportional to {{the diameter of the}} wheel (known as [...] "Coulomb's law").

50|$|In the 1860s, the Michaux family, Parisian coach builders, {{developed}} a new drive mechanism, placing pedals and cranks on an enlarged wooden front wheel with <b>iron</b> <b>tires,</b> which was mounted on a heavy steel frame. The credit for their innovative crank and pedals remains in dispute. Pierre Lallement, a Michaux mechanic, claimed to have collaborated with Ernest Michaux, while Henry Michaux told in March 1893 in the newspaper L'Éclair how his brother Ernest, together with their father Pierre have developed the idea in 1861 after modifying a draisine brought for repairs. The design was an adaptation of the crank-handles the two inventors had seen on a grinding wheel. In any event, Pierre Michaux's factory started producing crank-and-pedal driven velocipedes : two the first year, 142 the following year.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the boneshaker {{was similar to the}} dandy horse: wooden wheels with <b>iron</b> <b>tires</b> and a framework of wrought iron. As the name implies it was extremely uncomfortable, but the discomfort was somewhat ameliorated by a long flat spring that supported the saddle and absorbed many of the shocks from rough road surfaces. The boneshaker also had a brakea metal lever that pressed a wooden pad against the rear wheel. The front wheel axle ran in lubricated bronze bearings, and some had small lubrication tanks that would wick oil from soaked lamb's wool into the bearings to help them run smoothly. Like the High Wheel bicycles that became popular later in the 19th century, boneshakers were front-wheel drive, but in comparison they had smaller wheels (only about 1m), and were heavy, with a lightweight model weighing 30 pounds or more.|$|R
5000|$|One early design, predating 1869 was the Andrews Quadracycle, {{built by}} Andrews of Dublin, Ireland. It {{was made from}} one inch-square iron and was {{propelled}} with foot levers that moved in a long horizontal ellipse. The Sawyer Quadricycle was introduced in 1855 and featured lighter construction, wooden wheels, <b>iron</b> <b>tires</b> and front-wheel steering via a tiller. Like the Andrews Quadracycle it was moved by foot levers driving the rear axle. Starley's Coventry Rotary Quadracycle was introduced in 1885 and used conventional bicycle-style rotary pedals instead of foot levers for drive. It was developed from Starley's Coventry Rotary Tricycle design and featured tandem seating for two. The Rudge Quadracycle of 1888 is described as the first modern practical four-wheeler. It had much lighter construction than earlier models, seated three riders in tandem and was steered by levers from the front seat.|$|R

It is often said that The Brute Force Steel Band was the first steelpan band to record an album anywhere. Steel Orchestras have evolved to using highly technical instruments costing up to US$1500.00 for one instrument. These pans are meticulously honed out of the steel drum, sunken and burned over a hot fire, chromed and tuned. This process was perfected in Trinidad and Tobago and exported to Antigua & Barbuda through various collaborations between several of the bands in both island-nations.|$|R
