25|$|Clued In - In this mini-game, a {{character}} is slowly {{drawn on the}} screen while clues are presented to guide players. In this game, players have to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> character is being drawn on the screen.|$|E
25|$|This segment, which {{appeared}} during Livinia Nixon's {{time on the}} show, featured footage from movies or TV shows sent in by viewers, which contained a mistake or blooper of some sort (such as a production error). Audience members had to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the mistake was.|$|E

25|$|The game borrows its {{elements}} from the Scene It? DVD game franchise and is hosted by Genie {{from the film}} Aladdin who introduces and gives results for each round. Each game contains 15 rounds and takes about 30–40 minutes to play. Some rounds require watching clips without the sound, and some where players have to answer trivia questions about Disney films, and some where players have to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the artist is drawing. Disney Think Fast is currently the only game developed by Magenta Software that has been released for the Wii.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
25|$|Disney Think Fast is a trivia game show-based game. Each game can {{be played}} with up to four players which players can play as various Disney {{characters}} including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. The game also includes 4 stages, including Ocean Grotto, Regent's Park, Hawaiian Beach and The Pridelands. Each game takes about 30–40 minutes and contains 15 rounds. Some rounds require players having to watch movie clips without the sound, some where players have to answer multiple-choice Trivia Questions about Disney Movies, and some where players have to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the artist is drawing. There are over 5,000 questions, and each one has 2-4 multiple choice answers. Players get more points for correct answers as the rounds increase, and in later rounds, players get penalized for choosing wrong answers.|$|E

25|$|The script {{laid out}} quite {{specifically}} how characters were {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose how to bring these directions to life. For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> technical adjustments had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E
500|$|They wrote, recorded, and emailed music {{back and}} forth to each other before working {{together}} in a rehearsal space in East London. When he first read them, Smith found Croft and Sim's lyrics to be [...] "purposely ambiguous so people can relate to them", saying in an interview for Uncut, [...] "I mean… if I listen carefully, I do know about their lives intimately so I can <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> they’re about. But they don’t even tell each other what they’re singing about." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but <b>guess</b> <b>what,</b> I don't take care of myself.|$|E

500|$|Q. David Bowers said of {{the sudden}} passage of the {{legislation}} [...] "We can only <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> happened behind the scenes". Carothers wrote that Kasson had opposed nickel coinage, but nevertheless introduced the bill for it during the rush of {{the final day of}} the congressional session, [...] "There was no report and no explanation... The influences that brought about the passage of the measure in this fashion were never revealed." [...] Numismatic historian Don Taxay suggested that by March 3, 1865, [...] "the wide circulation of the bronze cent and two-cent piece had made a three-cent coin superfluous." ...|$|E
500|$|Cannon Fodder 2 {{retains the}} same {{mechanics}} and core gameplay of its predecessor, prompting reviewers to say: [...] "It's still as wonderfully playable as it ever was", and to acknowledge [...] "all the amazing control and playability" [...] of the original. Reviewers {{complained about the}} lack of plot, with Amiga Power stating: [...] "There's little explanation as to why you're doing this [...] and absolutely none in the game. As a result, the game doesn't hang together." [...] AUI called the plot [...] "pointless", while Amiga Computing called it a [...] "slight problem", saying [...] "you have to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> {{is going on in the}} game because there's no plot explanation [...] it's all very confusing!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Roth, [...] "My friend Jeff, {{who plays}} the killer pilgrim – {{we grew up in}} Massachusetts, we were huge slasher movie fans and every November we were waiting for the Thanksgiving slasher movie. We had the whole movie worked out: A kid who's in love with a turkey, and then his father killed it, and then he killed his family and went away to a mental {{institution}} and came back and took revenge on the town. I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, <b>guess</b> <b>what,</b> we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'" [...] "Shooting the trailer was so much fun," [...] Roth has stated, [...] "because every shot is a money shot. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd. It's just so wrong and sick that it's right." ...|$|E

500|$|Karen Allen, who {{previously}} appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark, reprises {{the role of}} Marion Ravenwood (under the married name of Marion Williams). Frank Darabont's script introduced the idea of Marion returning as Indiana's love interest. Allen was not aware her character was in the script until Spielberg called her in January 2007, saying, [...] "It's been announced! We're gonna make Indiana Jones 4! And <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> You're in it!" [...] Ford found Allen [...] "one of the easiest people to work with [...] ever known. She's a completely self-sufficient woman, and that's part of the character she plays. A lot of her charm and the charm of the character is there. And again, it's not an age-dependent thing. It {{has to do with}} her spirit and her nature." [...] Allen found Ford easier to work with on this film, than in Raiders.|$|E
500|$|... "The Job" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur. It was {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis, who had, around the same time, directed The Office actor John Krasinski in the 2007 film License to Wed. Script reading for the episode took place on a beach during the filming of the season's twenty-third episode, [...] "Beach Games". Actress Kate Flannery remarked that [...] "we were so excited that we almost had another hot dog eating contest. Not. It's a great script. Lots of questions answered. Lots. The Office fans have been anxiously awaiting a one-hour episode, and <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> You got it." [...] The original cut of the episode was an hour and twelve minutes long, {{and had to be}} edited down to forty-two minutes of screentime. It was the second Office episode to fill the entire hour timeslot; the first was the third-season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas".|$|E
500|$|Coming from a {{relatively}} Catholic district, Neal {{has a more}} conservative record {{on the issue of}} abortion than other Massachusetts representatives. He said in 2010, [...] "I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I'd keep Roe v. Wade and restrict it, I've always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [...] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I'm mixed and <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> That's where the American people are." [...] He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction abortion procedure illegal in most cases. During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, restricting government funding of abortion. On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.|$|E

500|$|Once in the maze, The Nameless One converses with Ravel, {{who asks}} him, [...] "What {{can change the}} nature of a man?" [...] — a {{question}} that plays a prominent role throughout the game. Ravel is pleased with The Nameless One's answer because he offers his own thoughts; she claims she has killed many men in the past who, instead of giving their own answers, tried to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> her answer might be. As the conversation progresses, Ravel explains that, in a past life, The Nameless One had asked her to make him immortal; however, the ritual she performed was flawed, causing him to lose his memory each time he died. She reveals that the mortality she separated from him was not destroyed, and that {{as long as he was}} alive, his mortality must still be intact. She does not know where his mortality is, but suggests that the fallen deva Trias might.|$|E
500|$|For the cutscenes, the {{localization}} team {{took into}} account that the animation {{had been done to}} the Japanese lines, so they made sure that the English script matched the already set lip flaps and timing. Because the Japanese voice acting was not yet recorded when Hsu worked on the English dub script, she used her imagination to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the Japanese voice acting would be like based on the script; this was made easier due to her familiarity with [...] "standard anime conventions" [...] from frequently watching anime. For some dialogue, she wrote alternative lines, as the footage had not yet been finished, and the script could be interpreted in different ways: in one scene, where Phoenix speaks on the phone, Hsu had him follow the line [...] "It's for this very reason I returned" [...] with either [...] "Time to bring it to an end" [...] or [...] "To put an end to it all"; she used the former because of how there was a dramatic pause between the two lines.|$|E
500|$|The episode's action {{revolves}} around the practical joke involving the cake and, in particular, viewers' attempts to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> has caused injury, as {{they know that the}} paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are [...] "ticking time-bomb". Angela is the central character, and is similar to a more anxious version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but aspirational, fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as [...] "appalling", [...] "tiresome", an [...] "irritating tit" [...] and [...] "an insufferable booby". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: [...] "Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and caring for a wife whose love for him has long gone." [...] Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.|$|E
