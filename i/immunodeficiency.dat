5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. <b>Immunodeficiency</b> occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, <b>immunodeficiency</b> can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined <b>immunodeficiency,</b> acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|Human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus {{infection}} and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired <b>immunodeficiency</b> syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{can also}} be {{inherited}} or 'acquired'. Chronic granulomatous disease, where phagocytes have a reduced ability to destroy pathogens, {{is an example of}} an inherited, or congenital, <b>immunodeficiency.</b> AIDS and some types of cancer cause acquired <b>immunodeficiency.</b>|$|E
40|$|Partial T-cell <b>immunodeficiencies</b> {{constitute}} a heterogeneous cluster of disorders {{characterized by an}} incomplete reduction in T-cell number or activity. The immune deficiency component of these diseases is less severe {{than that of the}} severe T-cell <b>immunodeficiencies</b> and therefore some ability to respond to infectious organisms is retained. Unlike severe T-cell <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> however, partial <b>immunodeficiencies</b> are commonly associated with hyper-immune dysregulation, including autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and elevated IgE production. This causative association is counter intuitive-immune deficiencies are caused by loss - of - function changes to the T-cell component, whereas the coincident autoimmune symptoms are the consequence of gain-of function changes. This Review details the genetic basis of partial T-cell <b>immunodeficiencies</b> and draws on recent advances in mouse models to propose mechanisms by which a reduction in T-cell numbers or function may disturb the population - dependent balance between activation and tolerance. status: publishe...|$|R

ESID has two sister societies: The International Nursing Group for <b>Immunodeficiencies</b> and the International Patient Organisation for Primary <b>Immunodeficiencies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> are {{clinically}} and epidemiologically important, {{despite their}} low prevalence, {{due to the}} associated risk of high morbidity and mortality. Most commonly encountered primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> include humoral immune system deficiencies, cellular immune system defects, combined <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> phagocyte system defects, complement system defects. Classical clinical findings of <b>immunodeficiencies</b> include recurrent, severe infections which {{do not respond to}} treatment or which progress with complications as well as tendency to develop infections with low virulence microorganisms. Moreover, they may present with autoimmunity, autoinflammatory or hemaphagocytic syndromes. Congenital diseases usually start in early childhood and lead to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis may be life saving and allow increasing quality of life, genetic counseling or prenatal diagnosis. Considering primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> more frequently in differential diagnosis and early immunological evaluation would lead to early diagnosis of these patients and allow them to reach early treatment or preventive measures...|$|R
5|$|The human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV) is {{the virus}} that – when the {{infection}} is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired <b>immunodeficiency</b> syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E

5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of <b>immunodeficiency</b> in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe <b>immunodeficiency</b> and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E

5|$|The human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV) is a {{lentivirus}} (a {{subgroup of}} retrovirus) that causes HIV infection {{and over time}} acquired <b>immunodeficiency</b> syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs {{during periods of}} severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{and risk}} factors that {{predispose}} to pneumonia include smoking, <b>immunodeficiency,</b> alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease.

40|$|Increased risk of {{developing}} autoimmune manifestations has been identified in different primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> (PID). In such conditions, autoimmunity and immune deficiency represent intertwined phenomena that reflect inadequate immune function. Autoimmunity in PIDs {{may be caused by}} different mechanisms including defects of tolerance to self-antigens, and persistent stimulation {{as a result of the}} inability to eradicate antigens. This general immune dysregulation leads to compensatory and exaggerated chronic inflammatory responses that lead to tissue damage and autoimmunity. Each PID may be characterized by distinct, peculiar autoimmune manifestations. Moreover, different pathogenetic mechanisms may underlie autoimmunity in PID. In this review, the main autoimmune manifestations observed in different PID, including humoral <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> combined <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> and syndromes with <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> are summarized. When possible, the pathogenetic mechanism underlying autoimmunity in a specific PID has been explained...|$|R
40|$|Primary Immune Deficienes (PID) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of inherited disorders in which immune system dysfunctions cause an enhanced susceptibility to infections {{that is the}} common clinical feature of these diseases. To date, more than 200 genes have been identified and associated with as many different <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> The frequency of PIDs is higher in North-Africa and Middle-East as compared to Europe and North- America. Indeed, our population {{is characterized by a}} high frequency of consanguineous marriages which may reach 50 % in rural areas.

During the last twenty years, we’ve diagnosed and investigated at the Institut Pasteur de Tunis, a resource-limited institution, 655 tunisian cases of PIDs including patients with combined <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> antibody deficiencies, phagocytosis defects, complement deficiencies and other well-defined <b>immunodeficiencies...</b>|$|R
5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have been infected with the human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, including those who have died. AIDS is a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|Acquired <b>immunodeficiency</b> {{syndrome}} (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts.

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E

Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human <b>immunodeficiency</b> virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E

The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with severe}} viral infections {{are often not}} {{thoroughly}} evaluated for <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> In this review, we summarize primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> that predispose individuals to severe viral infections. Some <b>immunodeficiencies</b> enhance susceptibility to disease with a specific virus or family of viruses, whereas others predispose to diseases with multiple viruses in addition to disease with other microbes. Although the role of cytotoxic T cells in controlling viral infections is well known, a number of immu-nodeficiencies that predispose to severe viral diseases have recently been ascribed to defects in the Toll-like receptor–interferon signaling pathway. These <b>immunodeficiencies</b> are rare, {{but it is important}} to identify them both for prognostic information and for genetic counseling. Undoubtedly, additional mutations in proteins in the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system will be identified in the future, which will reveal the importance of these proteins in controlling infections caused by viruses and other pathogens.
