The study of the modal spectrum of canonical closed waveguides is a basic topic in any course of electromagnetics or microwave engineering. However, surface-wave modes and leaky-wave modes in open waveguides are not yet so well known in the academic environment. Nevertheless, this study is necessary, since novel open dielectric waveguides have been proposed for millimeter-wave and optical electronics {{in order to reduce the}} conductor losses. Therefore, the comprehension of the phenomenon of leaky-wave modes and behavior is indispensable for any future microwave engineer, who has to work with the new millimeter-wave and optical technologies. This program constitutes the first tool explicitly conceived to help the teaching of the working principles of open dielectric <b>guides</b> <b>loaded</b> with printed circuits, and the associated practical leaky-wave antennas (LWAs).

40|$|A power {{transformer}} is a static piece of apparatus {{with two or}} more windings which, by electromagnetic induction, transforms a system of alternating voltage and current into another system of voltage and current usually of different values and at same frequency {{for the purpose of}} transmitting electrical power. The hot spot temperature depends on instantaneous load and ambient temperature, winding design and also cooling model. There are two possible methods for hotspot temperature determination. The first method is to measure the hot spot temperature using a fiber optic, and other is to calculation the hotspot temperature using transformer thermal models. It was noticed that the hot spot temperature rise over top oil temperature due to load changes is a function depending on time as well as the transformer loading (overshoot time dependent function). It has also been noticed that the top oil temperature time constant is shorter than the time constant suggested by the present IEC <b>loading</b> <b>guide,</b> especially in cases where the oil is guided through the windings in a zigzag pattern for the ONAN and ONAF cooling modes. This results in winding hottest spot temperatures higher than those predicted by the <b>loading</b> <b>guides</b> during transient states after the load current increases, before the corresponding steady states have been reached. This thesis presents more accurate temperature calculation methods taking into account the findings mentioned above.

It has been postulated that preemptive reduction of immunosuppression <b>guided</b> by EBV-DNA <b>load</b> {{may lead to a}} significantly lower incidence of PTLD, because of the reconstitution of T-cell control. In this report, we describe the feasibility of this approach in terms of safety with regard to the risk of acute as well as chronic allograft rejection in 75 lung transplant recipients transplanted between 1990 and 2001 and followed for this study from June 1, 2001 until January 1, 2006. Methods. From all patients visiting our outpatient clinic, EBV-DNA load was measured at least twice a year during the study period. In patients with positive results, measurements were repeated every two to four weeks. EBV reactivation was defined as two consecutive EBV-DNA load measurements with a rising trend; with the last measurement exceeding 10. 000 copies/mL under stable immunosuppression. In such case, immunosuppression was reduced. Results. EBV reactivation was observed in 26 / 75 patients (35 %). One (1. 5 %) of these patients developed PTLD during the study period. Acute rejection, acceleration of chronic allograft rejection, or worse survival were not observed after reduction of immunosuppression. Conclusions.
