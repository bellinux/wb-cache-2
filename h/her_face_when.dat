25|$|Hattie McDaniel earned {{that gold}} Oscar by her fine {{performance}} of 'Mammy' in Gone with the Wind. If you had seen <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> {{she walked up}} to the platform and took the gold trophy, you would have had the choke in your voice that all of us had when Hattie, hair trimmed with gardenias, face alight, and dress up to the queen's taste, accepted the honor in one of the finest speeches ever given on the Academy floor.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>When</b> acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
2500|$|From Kuwait, Lynch was {{transported to}} Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, {{where she was}} {{expected}} to recover fully from her injuries. On the flight to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the military medics kept her sedated and hydrated. Her family flew to Germany on April 5 {{to be reunited with}} her. In a statement, the hospital said, [...] "Lynch had a big smile on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> her parents arrived." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped on}} one knee, and Hetty turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> aside <b>when</b> {{he looked up}} again.|$|R
60|$|He {{had turned}} again towards her and was {{watching}} <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> but <b>when</b> {{she looked at}} him his eyes dropped.|$|R
60|$|A {{gleam of}} {{surprise}} mingled with pleasure rippled over <b>her</b> pretty <b>face</b> <b>when</b> {{she found that}} I could speak {{to her in the}} native tongue.|$|R
2500|$|After Corday's decapitation, a {{man named}} Legros lifted her head from the basket and slapped it on the cheek. Charles-Henri Sanson, the executioner, indignantly {{rejected}} published reports that Legros {{was one of his}} assistants. Sanson stated in his diary that Legros was in fact a carpenter who had been hired to make repairs to the guillotine. Witnesses report an expression of [...] "unequivocal indignation" [...] on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> her cheek was slapped. The oft-repeated anecdote has served to suggest that victims of the guillotine may in fact retain consciousness for a short while, including by Albert Camus in his Reflections on the Guillotine. ("Charlotte Corday's severed head blushed, it is said, under the executioner's slap.").|$|E
2500|$|On 14 August 1899, he {{was laid}} {{to rest in the}} St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, not far from his late father, Alexander III. During the service, his mother stood without tears, only deep {{suffering}} was imprinted on <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>When</b> the coffin was put down into the tomb, Maria Feodorovna stood next to Xenia, holding her arm-in-arm and suddenly, looking at her daughter with widely open, unseeing eyes, she loudly said, [...] "Let's go home. Let's go home, I cannot stand it anymore!" [...] and she rushed out. When a board was laid down for leaving the tomb, she went away so quickly that it was difficult for others to keep pace with her. Nobody even had enough time to throw flowers on to the tomb. In the carriage she sobbed for a long time, pressing to her breast George's hat that she took off the coffin's cover.|$|E
60|$|And {{there was}} a visible triumph in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> she turned it to dismiss the visitors.|$|E
6000|$|And this is fair Diana's case; [...] For, all astrologers maintain, Each night a bit {{drops off}} <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> [...] <b>When</b> mortals say she's in her wane: ...|$|R
60|$|The star had {{shone on}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> until now, <b>when</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> sank upon {{his hand and}} her own.|$|R
5000|$|The last scene shows Hwa-yeon {{smiling at}} her son playing on the throne in the empty royal court, before <b>her</b> <b>face</b> turns <b>when</b> the door shuts and she realizes she can't go back.|$|R
60|$|Carrie said nothing, but {{the firelight}} was on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> {{she looked up}} at her husband, and once more he was satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|... "My poor dear, {{you will}} find {{yourself}} understanding me before long." [...] I thought I saw something like pity in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> she said that.|$|E
60|$|Ida {{went up to}} him {{and touched}} his arm, and, for no very evident reason, the color crept into <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> he looked at her inquiringly.|$|E
6000|$|Helen met her playwright with an anxious, tired {{look upon}} <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> but <b>when</b> {{he touched her}} fingers {{to his lips and}} said, [...] "At your service, my lady," [...] she laughed in radiant, sudden relief.|$|R
60|$|Lady Bertie {{was much}} {{depressed}} this morning, {{so much so}} that it was impossible for Tancred not to notice her unequal demeanour. Her hand trembled as he touched it; <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> flushed <b>when</b> he entered, became deadly pale.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, how {{she loves}} him--how dearly she loves him!" [...] thought her brother, {{watching}} her from his solitary {{corner of the}} room, and seeing the smile that brightened <b>her</b> blushing <b>face</b> <b>when</b> Danville kissed <b>her</b> hand at parting.|$|R
60|$|Clara seemed {{doubtful}} {{whether she}} should speak. It {{was the first}} time I had ever seen such an expression in <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>when</b> she looked into mine.|$|E
60|$|Elfride {{had turned}} from the table towards the fire and was idly {{elevating}} a hand-screen before <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>when</b> she heard {{the click of a}} little gate outside.|$|E
60|$|My dear! It was {{the first}} time she had ever {{addressed}} me with that familiarity! There was an insolent smile too on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> she said the words.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she reached}} home {{there were still}} signs of tears on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>when</b> Anson came out to help her alight, and noticing it asked, [...] "What's the matter?" [...] she burst out afresh, crying, and talking incoherently. Anson was astonished.|$|R
60|$|He {{tore the}} note viciously into small pieces. Then {{he went back}} to Lady Hunterleys' apartments. She was sitting up now in an easy-chair. Once more, {{at the sound of the}} knock, she looked towards the door eagerly. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> fell <b>when</b> Draconmeyer entered.|$|R
60|$|He {{went into}} her boudoir, a remote and very cushiony place. She was sitting at her table writing letters. She lifted <b>her</b> <b>face</b> abstractedly <b>when</b> he entered, watched him go to the sofa, and sit down. Then {{she looked down at}} her paper again.|$|R
60|$|Peggotty only laughed the more, {{and held}} her apron tight over <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> my mother tried to pull it away, and sat as if her head were in a bag.|$|E
60|$|He gazed {{steadily}} into Diane Sampson's {{eyes and}} went his way without {{any sign of}} recognition. There was red in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> he passed and white when he had gone.|$|E
60|$|Sophy paused {{until she}} had lit a cigarette. The {{expression}} in <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>when</b> {{she looked up at}} John, irritated him vaguely. It was as if she were talking to a child.|$|E
60|$|Deronda {{could not}} sit still. He rose, {{and went to}} prop himself against {{the corner of the}} mantel-piece, at a {{different}} angle from <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> But <b>when</b> she had pressed her handkerchief against her cheeks, she turned and looked up at him, awaiting an answer.|$|R
60|$|Maud {{sat down}} beside him. There was a flush on <b>her</b> pretty <b>face,</b> and <b>when</b> she spoke her voice quivered with {{suppressed}} excitement.|$|R
60|$|While she was {{speaking}} Fan had entered the room unnoticed. She was pale and looked sad, but calmer now, and the traces of tears had been washed away. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> flushed <b>when</b> she heard Mrs. Churton's words, and she advanced and stood {{so that they could}} not help seeing her.|$|R
60|$|Ma was there, too, {{waiting for}} him on the back door-step as he drove into the yard at sunset. <b>Her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>when</b> she saw the baby, {{expressed}} the last degree of amazement.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very happy," [...] was Margaret's gentle reassurance. [...] "The dear little Daisy {{looks just}} as her godfather {{imagined}} her;" [...] and happy was <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> her father quitted her.|$|E
60|$|I {{closed the}} door and seated myself by her side. She removed her hands from <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>when</b> she felt me near her. She looked at me with a cold and steady surprise.|$|E
60|$|She spoke bravely and unfalteringly, but <b>her</b> <b>face</b> had paled <b>when</b> Sir Thomas {{first made}} the proposal, and the colour {{had not yet}} come back to her cheeks.|$|R
2500|$|In her memoirs, Jerome's {{daughter}} Jennie (later Lady Randolph Churchill and {{the mother}} of Sir Winston Churchill) recalled the [...] "dismay" [...] on <b>her</b> mother's <b>face</b> <b>when</b> she first saw the ship's extravagant velvet and silver fittings, installed {{as a result of the}} free rein extended by Jerome to the upholsterer. Total cost of the vessel was $125,000.|$|R
60|$|Judith {{joined her}} sister {{with an air}} of dignity and solemnity it was not her {{practice}} to show, and, though the gleamings of anguish were still visible on <b>her</b> beautiful <b>face,</b> <b>when</b> she spoke it was firmly and without tremor. At that instant Hist and the Delaware withdrew, moving towards Hurry, in {{the other end of the}} boat.|$|R
