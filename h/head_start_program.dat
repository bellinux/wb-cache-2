40|$|Classroom {{observations}} are increasingly common in education policies {{as a means}} to assess the quality of teachers and/or education programs for purposes of making high-stakes decisions. This article considers one policy, the <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> Designation Renewal System (DRS), which involves classroom observations to assess the quality of <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> <b>programs</b> in order to decide whether their funding is renewed. This article applies an argument-based approach for evaluating the validity of observational assessments that (a) explicates assumptions that underlie the presumed logic, leading from the collection of scores from observations of <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> classrooms, to the inference that scores assess the quality of <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> <b>programs,</b> to the decision to renew funding to <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> <b>programs,</b> and (b) summarizes evidence that speaks to the plausibility of each assumption. There was limited evidence to support the plausibility of many assumptions, including those pertaining to score generalizability, predictive validity, and the cutoff scores set as minimum standards of quality. Implications for improving the validity of classroom observations and the accuracy and fairness of decisions in the <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> DRS are discussed...|$|R

Regression discontinuity design was used to measure program impact without denying a control group the opportunity to attend <b>Head</b> <b>Start.</b> The analysis compared three-year-olds enrolled in <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> to four-year-olds who returned to <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> for their second year. This also eliminated the issue of selection bias because both groups chose to attend <b>Head</b> <b>Start</b> as three-year-olds.|$|R
