5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from <b>his</b> <b>driveway</b> in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Although Igor steered well {{clear of}} the Caribbean, large swells of 15–20ft (4.6–6.1m) {{propagated}} from the storm, drowning one person in St. Croix and another in Puerto Rico. Large waves affected the East Coast of the United States, and one person drowned in Surf City, North Carolina. In Bermuda, sustained winds of 91mph (146km/h) and gusts up to 117mph (188km/h) downed trees and power lines, cutting power to approximately 28,000 residents. Rainfall was largely insignificant, peaking at 3.19in (81mm). Impacts near the storm's landfall in Newfoundland were more severe. Rainfall amounts of more than 2in (50mm) were widespread, with a peak of 9.37in (238mm) in St Lawrence; as such, Igor ranks as the third wettest tropical cyclone to impact Atlantic Canada. Run-off from the torrential rainfall damaged or destroyed structures, killed a man when <b>his</b> <b>driveway</b> was washed out and he was swept away, and isolated approximately 150 communities. Sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) with gusts to 107mph (172km/h) in Cape Pine downed trees and power lines while damaging or destroying many homes. Approximately 50,000 households lost power during {{the peak of the}} storm. The overall damage total reached $200 million across Newfoundland, making Igor the costliest hurricane on record there. It was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit Newfoundland since 1935.|$|E

25|$|Although {{aware that}} he was a {{potential}} IRA assassination target, Gow declined to take anything more than routine security precautions. Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was parked in the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex.

Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, {{and asked if he}} could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. Bryant changed his mind and left, claiming he was going to return in the afternoon.|$|E

500|$|Roughly 150communities were {{temporarily}} isolated as all roads {{leading to}} them were severely damaged or washed out. Overall damage to roadways {{was regarded as}} [...] "colossal" [...] by Tom Hedderson, the minister for emergency preparedness. A 100ft (30m) section of the Trans-Canada Highway in Terra Nova National Park was severely eroded, leaving a large ravine behind and disconnecting the main population of Newfoundland {{from the rest of}} the island, while a bridge washout on the Burin Peninsula left 20,000people cut off {{from the rest of the}} island. Public infrastructure losses were estimated in excess of $100million, mainly attributed to roadways.

Booker responded by tweeting, [...] "I will do it myself; where does he live?" [...] Other people volunteered, including one person who offered his help on Twitter, and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the man's driveway. On April 12, 2012, Booker saved a woman from a house fire, suffering smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on his hands in the process. Newark Fire Chief John Centanni said that Booker's actions possibly saved the woman's life. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the shoreline areas of New Jersey and New York in late October 2012, Booker invited Newarkers without power to eat and sleep in his home. In February 2013, responding to a Twitter post, Booker helped a nervous constituent propose to his girlfriend. Booker rescued a dog from freezing temperatures in January 2013 and another dog that had been abandoned in a cage in July 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of books (including both of Guralnick's books) on Presley contain details of his many romances and alleged affairs including many while {{he was married to}} Priscilla. It has also been reported that Presley [...] "adored to fondle and suck women's toes, and those in his entourage who were given the job of choosing companions for him would often be asked to check the girls' feet." [...] However, according to Alan Fortas, an all-Memphis football halfback who became a bodyguard and part of the Presley entourage, [...] "Elvis needed someone to baby more than he needed a sex partner. He craved the attention of someone who adored him without the threat of sexual pressure, much as a mother would." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Elvis befriended some of the young girls who used to cluster adoringly in <b>his</b> <b>driveway,</b> or outside the fence ... Some of the girls were as young as fourteen. Fortas said they were frequent houseguests who attended his concerts as part of 'Elvis's personal traveling show.' Out in the backyard, they romped with Elvis in the Doughboy pool and challenged him to watermelon-seed spitting contests. They also slipped into his bedroom ... for rambunctious pillow fights. Sometimes they would all sit cross-legged with him on the bed, flipping through his fan magazines or admiring his stuffed-animal collection. Often they would all lie down together and cuddle. But what went on was horseplay, not foreplay."

25|$|On May 24, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invited African-American novelist James Baldwin, {{along with}} {{a large group of}} {{cultural}} leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have a full understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which {{came to be known as}} the Baldwin–Kennedy meeting, underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the Kennedy administration to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans. On June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation—the law which eventually became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
