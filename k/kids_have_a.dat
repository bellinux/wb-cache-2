Seminars" [...] who traps time-traveler Heinz-57 (played by Geoff Hoyle) {{in one of}} his {{seminars}} and continually refers to him as [...] "Heinz Asshole". [...] In the DVD commentary for the 2003 release of the film, director Lucas Reiner stated that the [...] "Absentee, oblivious, self-involved parents who don't notice their <b>kids</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> spaceship" [...] was a reference to the self-involved nature of adults during the 1970s and their propensity for self-improvement. [...] Reiner stated that these scenes were meant to symbolize the [...] "'70s hunger for self-improvement" [...] and the extreme ends that people would go to in order to improve themselves. [...] Lucas Reiner had never personally attended one of Werner Erhard's seminars, but had heard that attendants were not allowed to leave, often peed in their pants, and were called [...] "assholes" [...] and insulted publicly.

50|$|If there's {{one thing}} I can't stand it's when a CD is re-released {{untouched}} sonically, {{with a new}} cover and maybe a live video, and kids are duped into buying this new edition of something they already have.

Plus the budgets we get are laughable, particularly for a band with seven musicians to record. So we used some of our own money and took our time with this one. I'll tell you right now, we have no intent on hiding our intentions. We wanted to prevent the re-release of Keasbey untouched as well as get the record to sound how it should have sounded originally.
