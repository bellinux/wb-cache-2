I have read somewhere <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> the man who will not shed his blood for the liberty of his brothers is a coward and a slave. Will you not shed a drop of ink--my ink, too--for the right of your brothers {{to the work of}} their hands? I at first sight did not care to sign this petition, because I would as soon petition a tiger to share his prey with me as our rulers to relax their grip of the stolen labor they live on. But Donovan Brown said to me, 'You have no choice. Either you believe that the laborer should have the fruit of his labor or you do not. If you do, put your conviction on record, even if it should be as useless as Pilate's washing his hands.' So I signed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "Yes, I know; and I was {{perfectly}} sure of it; you're always so prompt, and I always wonder at it, such an absent-minded creature as you are. But you came near spoiling everything by getting here behind this pillar, and burying yourself <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> way. If it hadn't been for my principle of always asking questions, I {{never should have}} found you in the world. But just as I was really beginning to despair, the Chorewoman came by, and I {{asked her if she}} had seen any gentleman here lately; and she said there was one now, over here, and I stretched up and saw you. I had such a fright for a moment, not seeing you; for I left my little plush bag with my purse in it at Stearns's, and I've got to hurry right back; though I'm afraid they'll be shut when I get there, Saturday afternoon, this way; but I'm going to rattle at the front door, and perhaps they'll come--they always stay, some of them, to put the goods away; and I can tell them I don't want to buy anything, but I left my bag with my purse in it, and I guess they'll let me in. I want you to keep these things for me, Edward; and I'll leave my shopping-bag; I sha'n't want it any more. Don't lose any of them. Better keep them all in your lap here together, and then nobody will come and sit on them." [...] She disburdens herself of her packages and parcels, and arranges them on her husband's knees, while she goes on talking. [...] "I'm almost ready to drop, I'm so tired, and I do believe I should let you go up to Stearns's for me; but you couldn't describe the bag so they would recognize it, let alone what was in it, and they wouldn't give it to you, even if they would let you in to inquire: they're much more likely to let a lady in than a gentleman. But I shall take a coupe, and tell the driver simply to fly, though there's plenty of {{time to go to the}} ends of the earth and back before our train starts. Only I should like to be here to receive the Campbells, and keep Willis from buying tickets for Amy and himself, and us, too, for that matter; he has that vulgar passion--I don't know where he's picked it up--for wanting to pay everybody's way; and you'd never think of your Hundred-Trip ticket-book till it was too late. Do take your book out and hold it in your hand, so you'll be sure to remember it, as soon as you see Willis. You had better keep saying over to yourself, 'Willis--Hundred-Trip Tickets--Willis--Hundred-Trip Tickets;' that's the way I do. Where is the book? I have to remember everything! Do keep your ticket-book in your hand, Edward, till Willis comes." ...|$|E

60|$|Don't, I beseech you, {{measure the}} {{interest}} I've taken <b>in</b> <b>your</b> brilliant <b>book</b> (<b>that</b> is <b>in</b> the prior {{of the recent}} pair of them,) and don't measure any other decency or humanity of mine (in relation to anything that is yours,) by my late abominable and aggravated silence. You most handsomely sent me Anticipations when the volume appeared, and I was not able immediately to read it; I was bothered and preoccupied with many things, wished for a free mind and an attuned ear for it, so let it wait till the right hour, knowing that neither you nor I would lose by the process. The right hour came, and I gave myself up--utterly, admirably up--to the charm; but the charm, on its side, left me so spent, as it were, with saturation, that I had scarce pulled myself round before the complications of Xmas set in, and the New Year's flood--in respect to correspondence--was upon me; which I've been till now buffeting and breasting. And then I was ashamed--and I'm ashamed still. That is the penalty of vice--one's shame disqualifies one for the company of virtue. Yet, all this latter time, I've taken the greatest pleasure in my still throbbing and responding sense of the book.|$|R

"No, sir, I am {{sure that}} there is no mistake; but, for your own sake as well as mine, it were well that you should have the {{signature}} of an accountant to the correctness of the books. If you have to lay the matter before the magistrates, they would not take my testimony as to your losses, and might even say that you were rash in acting upon the word of a boy like myself, and you might then be obliged to have the accounts made up anew, which would cost you more, and cause much delay in the process; whereas, if you put <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>books</b> and say <b>that</b> their correctness is vouched for by an accountant, no question would arise on it; nor would there be any delay now, for while the books are being gone into, we can be {{trying to get to the}} bottom of the matter here." ...|$|R
5000|$|The sign-up process {{includes}} a step for entering your email password (there is an opt-out feature). LinkedIn will then offer {{to send out}} contact invitations to all members <b>in</b> <b>your</b> address <b>book</b> or <b>that</b> you have had email conversation with. When the member's email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations {{will be sent to}} [...] "selected" [...] email addresses, or to all. Up to 1,500 invitations can then be sent out in one click, with no possibility to undo or withdraw them. LinkedIn was sued for sending out another two follow-up invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial, authorized, invitation. In November 2014, LinkedIn lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of people's names and images without authorization. The lawsuit was eventually settled in 2015 in favor of LinkedIn members.|$|R
6000|$|Before he {{had been}} there two hours, he got tired of it, and thought only of getting away. He found a little door behind the altar which was not locked, and at ten o'clock he slipped out at it, and took to his heels and made for the beach. He had got half-way thither, when all at once the same little man stood {{in front of him and}} said, 'Good evening, Christian, where are you going?' 'I've leave to go where I please,' said the smith, but at the same time he noticed that he could not move a foot. 'No, you have {{undertaken}} to keep guard to-night as well,' said the little man, 'and you must attend to that.' He then took hold of him, and however unwilling he was, Christian had to go with him right back to the same little door that he had crept out at. When they got there, the little man said to him, 'Go in front of the altar now, and take <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hand the <b>book</b> <b>that</b> is lying there. There you shall stay till you hear the lid of the chest slam down over the dead. In that way you will come to no harm.' ...|$|R
