25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band.

500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, <b>I</b> <b>break</b> out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it.

It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
