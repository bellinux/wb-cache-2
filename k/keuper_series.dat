2500|$|The Triassic Period (251Ma – 205Ma) {{is part of}} the Mesozoic Era (251Ma – 65Ma) and is {{so called}} from its former {{threefold}} division in its type locality in Germany. The divisions have been revised in nomenclature so that they do not correspond with most of the older literature. The onshore Triassic in Britain differs from that in the southern North Sea, Germany and other parts of northern Europe, in not being the classic tripartite lithostratigraphic subdivision; The Triassic deposits of Germany form three series. In the Bunter (meaning 'brightly coloured') series, the land was emergent and red sandstone and sandy shales, with some salt and gypsum, were deposited. The Muschelkalk series saw the transgression of the land by the sea and the deposition of marine shale and limestone; the <b>Keuper</b> <b>series</b> saw the land again emergent and shale, sandstone, and gypsum being formed. Instead, the British Triassic is divided [...] into the Sherwood Sandstone Group, the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group (previously described by their quasi Germanic names, the Bunter and the Keuper) and the Penarth Group [...] these together attain a maximum thickness of ca. 3.5km in the Cheshire Basin.. In Britain the middle division of marine beds is largely absent, giving the original twofold division into Keuper and Bunter, which whilst recognizable as lithological or facies divisions, they are not equivalent to the strata in Germany. The absence of the middle facies, the Muschelkalk, does not mean that Muschelkalk beds of the middle Triassic are absent, but rather that the deposition was continental over this area and not marine as over northern and central Europe. Dating is therefore difficult as there are no fossils and there was no igneous activity, which could have led to the emplacement of isotopes enabling dating. Recent work has shown that the Mercia Mudstones are more complex than originally thought and there are now proposals to give new stratigraphic names to four of the formations.|$|E
40|$|The geology of {{the region}} of map sheet 8, Ribagorzana-Tor, of the 1 : 50, 000 {{geological}} maps of the Central Pyrenees, is described. The map covers part of the southern axial zone, the Nogueras zone, and {{the northern part of}} the Southern Cretaceous zone. The stratigraphie sequence consists of marine Palaeozoic rocks from the Cambro-Ordovician to the Carboniferous, unconformably overlain by mainly fluvial deposits ranging in age from the Upper Westphalian to the Lower Triassic. The Middle and Upper Triassic is represented by a lagunal evaporite sequence. The fully marine Mesozoic rocks, mainly limestones and marls, range in age from Liassic to Upper Cretaceous. The entire sequence is again unconformably overlain by fluvial piedmont deposits of the Upper Eocene-Oligocene. Hercynian and Alpine orogenies acted on this intercontinental mountain chain. In the axial zone at least five individual deformation phases with different trending axes can be attributed to the Hercynian stress field. The second, or major, folding phase produced a generally northward-dipping axial-plane slaty cleavage. Granodiorite batholiths and numerous dykes intruded almost at the end of this compressional phase. The major Alpine deformation shortened the axial zone by means of north to south up- and overthrusts along the Hercynian cleavage or fault planes, which at the same time caused asymmetric folding of the post-Hercynian strata above the unconformity. The Nogueras zone is interpreted as a steep flexure zone that collapsed due to the vulnerability of the easily deformed <b>Keuper</b> <b>series</b> filling the space between this flexure and the rigid mass of the overlying Mesozoic calcareous rocks; the latter is thought to have moved towards the south mainly under the influence of the gravitational pull. The post-Miocene erosion following the Alpine uplift led to various aplanation levels, some remnants of which are preserved in our area. Glacial forms developed during the Pleistocene, and subsequent river erosion modified the glacial morphology...|$|E
40|$|Non disponibleThis text briefly {{comments}} {{the geological}} history, mineralogy, stratigraphy and sedimentation of mudstones and marls from the <b>Keuper</b> Marl <b>series</b> {{of the eastern}} part of France. Geotechnical studies in England and also in France point out particular problems related to the overconsolidated structure of this material of Triassic age. A vide scatter in observed in the test results between the high values of strength of the unweathered soils and the low values of the softened zones. No simple relation to depth can be estahlished. A classification modified from the scheme proposed by the British research workers, shows that index properties and clay-sized proportion change with the alteration zones, as a result of silt-sized aggregation of clay minerals. Simple unexpensive tests allow quick quantitative evaluation of the unweathered material. Point load test and direct shear test on preformed failure planes give a measure of cohesion and ultimate friction angle. Short term weathering of marls appears closely related to the degree of saturation of the specimen before rewetting. One-dimensional and three-dimensional compression tests of intact and remoulded states are compared and the computed values of permeability from those tests are discussed. Rates of secondary compression are related of the alteration zones and overconsolidation ratio. Theoretical and experimental evidences lead the author to develop a graphical method of obtaining the strength parameters from stress paths in a three-dimensional (shear stress, normal stress, water content) space. Most of the scatter resulting from various swells during alteration, sampling and testing, is thus taken into account. The shape or the undrained compression stress paths correlates with the elastic parameters measured. Hvorslev strength components or Keuper clays and marls are compared with published data for other soils. Measurements of strength parameters by the static cone penetrameter in the weathered profile over Keuper Marl, are evaluated and compared with results obtained on a small-scale laboratory apparatus. The system was designed with a confinement cell (15 x 15 cm) which permitted to simulate the overburden pressure, up to 4 kg/sq cm. Finally, a regional study of 440 natural slopes shows a slight correlation with geology and index properties. Equilibrium conditions of natural slopes seem to be closer to the "critical state" strength envelope than to the residual angle...|$|R
