40|$|Classical {{congenital}} dislocation {{of the hip}} {{is secondary}} to a primary genetic dysplasia of the hip, or flat acetabulum, and develops during intra-uterine life, or {{in the course of}} the first or second year of postnatal life. Dislocation is a consequence of the primary dysplasia or “flat socket”; it is a secondary and incidental phenomenon. “ Dysplastic acetabulum” is a term now generally accepted, and means a congenital and genetic anomaly of the acetabulum, with hip-joint instability and incongruity. The primary anomaly is not limited to the acetabulum, but involves all mesodermal structures of the hip joint. Aplasia or hypoplasia of the roof or buttress or posterosuperior portion of the rim of the acetabulum causes a <b>flat</b> <b>socket</b> which is the important expression of the dysplasia of the pelvis and hip joint. Dislocation of the femoral head may result because the hypoplastic and insufficient roof of the acetabulum lies in the axis of transference of forces of body weight and muscle contraction. Ac-clivity of the roof of the socket is the principal anatomical feature and...|$|E
5000|$|The {{examination}} of metal composition {{in the formation}} of different types [...] does add knowledge concerning production modes. The thicker the object is, the more lead wasdeliberately added to the cast. The highest amounts of lead were measured in the duckbill axes, less in the <b>flat</b> <b>socketed</b> axes, and much less in thinner blades like spears and daggers, which were much more worked and annealed after being cast. This observation corresponds well with the controlled alloying of the duckbill axes and ribbed daggers (with much less lead in the latter) from the MBIIa, but does not correspond with the spears. Although they are derived mainly from MBIIa contexts, their composition is less controlled and more varied. There might be a connection between the level of allowing control and the investment in the cast — the more complex types, like duckbill and <b>flat</b> <b>socketed</b> axes and ribbed daggers, are usually cast in steatite, two-piece closed and well-carved moulds.On the other hand, some of the less controlled alloyed types, like spearheads and knives as well as more simple tools such as chisel points, were mainly cast into open, relatively roughly carved limestone moulds.|$|R
25|$|As {{usual in}} medieval art, {{the figures are}} not individualized, but repeat a few stylised types. They have the disproportionately large, oval faces which are {{characteristic}} of Pre-Romanesque sculpture. Their very large, almond-shaped eyes sit in <b>flat</b> <b>sockets</b> with sharply delineated eyebrows. The hair is composed of parallel strands from a central parting. Nevertheless, the facial expressions of some figures are very individuated and match the figures' gestures. Especially relevant in this respect is the figure of Cain who looks up to the Hand of God in heaven with fearful, terror-stricken eyes and pulls his cloak tight around his body.|$|R
50|$|The order (polarity) of {{the socket}} {{apertures}} of a three pin <b>flat</b> pin <b>socket,</b> to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin - green/yellow wire), Active (brown wire) and then Neutral (light blue wire), in a clockwise direction, {{when viewed from}} the front of the socket looking at the apertures.|$|R
5000|$|A {{completely}} <b>flat</b> wall <b>socket</b> (pictured) 50×50 millimetres (about 2×2 inches) {{with the}} 3 flat {{holes in the}} middle. This design matches the look, junction boxes etc. of other Danish wall outlets (such as those for AC power). [...] It supersedes an earlier round model which had a slightly recessed circular depression where the plug goes. Sockets etc. based on this 50mm module may be densely packed on walls etc. both vertically and horizontally, so plugs with their cords etc. need to stay within a traditional 43 mm(?) circle around the center to avoid collisions.|$|R
50|$|Bronze Age {{artefacts}} {{have been}} uncovered throughout the county, including several bronze axe heads around Kendal and Levens, an axe and a sword at Gleaston, a rapier near the hamlet of Salta, an intriguing carved granite ball near Carlisle {{and part of}} a gold necklace believed to be from France or Ireland found at Greysouthen. A timber palisade has also been discovered at High Crosby near Carlisle. Again, there is continuity between Bronze-age and Neolithic practice of deposition. There seems to be an association between the distribution of stone perforated axe-hammers and bronze metalwork deposition in the area of Furness. Of the approximately 200 bronze implements found in Cumbria, about half have been found in the Furness and Cartmel region. Most are flanged axes (21), and flanged spearheads (21), palstaves (20), and <b>flat</b> and <b>socketed</b> axes (16 each). Early Bronze Age metalwork distribution is largely along communication valleys (such as the Eden valley), and on the Furness and West Cumbrian plains, with evidence on the west coast (for example, a find at Maryport) of connections with Ireland. In the Middle Bronze Age, deposition seems to have switched from burials to wet places, presumably for ritualistic reasons. In the Late Bronze Age, socketed axe finds are the most common (62), but are rare in West Cumbria, which also lacks finds of the angle-flanged type. Hoards (two or more items) of deposited Bronze Age metalwork are rare in Cumbria, (notably at Ambleside, Hayton, Fell Lane, Kirkhead Cave, Skelmore Heads), for reasons that are still being discussed. Most are from the Middle Bronze Age period.|$|R
5000|$|When {{working with}} common 6-point {{hexagonal}} fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers {{double the amount}} of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut. This is of large importance on a box wrench which is typically adjustable in 15 or 30 degree increments. This versatility of fitting position is normally of small importance on a socket wrench which can be easily rotated in small increments regardless of socket type. Since loading contact points between the nut and socket are at the corner points (not the <b>flats),</b> twelve point <b>sockets</b> have more than adequate strength for most applications where nut and socket are in good condition. If the nut or socket is rounded by wear, using a [...] "double" [...] shaped socket {{is more likely to}} results in slippage or further rounding off and possible stripping of either the bolt head, nut or socket. This versatility is the main purpose of the 12-point shape found in common sockets, but is essential when working with 12-point bolt and nut heads. Socket strength is mainly a function of the alloys and heat treatments used to make the socket along with wall thickness of the socket wrench as measured at the corner points (thinnest section).|$|R
