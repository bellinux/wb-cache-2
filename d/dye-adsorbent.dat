40|$|The {{ability of}} five low cost {{adsorbents}} - rice husk, cotton, bark, hair and coal - to adsorb two basic dyes, namely, Safranine and Methylene Blue, has been studied. Equilibrium isotherms have been determined and analysed using the Langmuir equations. The monolayer saturation capacities for Safranine are 1119, 838, 875, 190 and 120 mg g(- 1) adsorbent and for Methylene Blue are 914, 312, 277, 158 and 250 mg g(- 1) adsorbent for bark, rice husk, cotton waste, hair and coal respectively. A {{limited number of}} fixed bed column studies have been performed and the bed depth service time for each <b>dye-adsorbent</b> system has been determined...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe report {{here the}} use of porous {{materials}} for the adsorption of both anionic and cationic dyes. We have investigated {{the effect of the}} pH and of the presence of a dual mesoporosity on the adsorbents capacity. The results show that, regardless of porosity, the bare mesostructured silicas are particularly efficient for the adsorption of the cationic dye, brilliant green. The adsorption isotherms have been fitted by using the Langmuir and the Freundlich models. Under acidic conditions, the dual-mesoporous material presents a better affinity and a slightly higher maximum adsorption capacity for congo red than the mono-modal mesostructure. Concerning the adsorption of brilliant green, no significant effect of porosity is noted and the fitting parameters indicate that similar <b>dye-adsorbent</b> interactions occur...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{orange peel}} {{adsorbent}} developed from an agricultural waste material was characterised and utilised {{for the removal}} of Remazol Brilliant Blue from an artificial textile-dye effluent. The adsorption thermodynamics of this <b>dye-adsorbent</b> pair was studied in a series of equilibrium experiments. The time to reach equilibrium was 15 h for the concentration range of 30 mg L- 1 to 250 mg L- 1. The adsorption capacity decreased with increasing temperature, from 9. 7 mg L- 1 at 20 ºC to 5. 0 mg L- 1 at 60 ºC. Both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models fitted the adsorption data quite reasonably. The thermodynamic analysis of dye adsorption onto the orange peel adsorbent indicated its endothermic and spontaneous nature. Thus, the application of orange peel adsorbent {{for the removal of}} dye from a synthetic textile effluent was successfully demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Removal of Basic Red 46 from aqueous {{media was}} {{achieved}} onto Animal Bone Meal {{as a new}} low cost adsorbent. The latter was characterized by Infra-Red and X-ray diffraction. The adsorption of Basic Red 46 was occurred by studying the effects of adsorbent amount, dye concentration, contact time, pH media and temperature. The adsorption rate {{data were analyzed using}} the pseudo-first order and the pseudo-second order kinetics models to determine adsorption rate constants. The isotherms of adsorption data were analyzed by both adsorption isotherm models Langmuir and Freundlich. The monolayer adsorption capacity is 76 mg/g of animal bone meal. Nearly 30 minutes of contact time was found to be sufficient for the dye adsorption to reach equilibrium. Thermodynamic parameters were also evaluated for the <b>dye-adsorbent</b> system and revealed that the adsorption process is endothermic in nature. All results found concluded that animal bone meal could be effectively employed as effective new low cost adsorbent for the removal textile dyes from aqueous solutions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA native layered double {{hydroxide}} Mg–Al–CO 3, denominated LDH, containing Mg(II) and Al(III) in the layers, {{was prepared}} by a co-precipitation method. Its calcined form Mg–Al, (CLDH), {{was obtained by}} calcination at 500 °C. Both materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and {{the determination of the}} point of zero charge. The porous structure of the solids was investigated by nitrogen adsorption at 77  K. The adsorptive affinity of these materials for Biebrich Scarlet was studied as a function of <b>dye–adsorbent</b> contact time, initial pH of the solution, initial dye concentration, and temperature. Sorption kinetics data fitted best to a pseudo-second-order model suggesting that the process of BS adsorption is controlled by reaction rate for interaction of dye molecules rather than by diffusion. Equilibrium data for both adsorbents were in accordance with both Sips and Langmuir isotherm models. The sorption capacity of CLDH was found to be almost independent on the initial pH, while sorption capacity of LDH was lower in neutral and alkaline conditions than at acidic pH. The adsorption process was also found to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature. © 2016 Balaban Desalination Publications. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeed husk of Bengal gram (SHBG) (Scientific Name: Cicer arietinum) {{was used}} as an {{adsorbent}} for the removal of a direct dye namely Congo red (CR), two basic dyes namely methylene blue (MB) & rhodamine-B (RB) and an acidic dye namely acid blue 25 (AB) from aqueous solutions with equilibrium isotherms. The effect of particle size, of mass of adsorbent, of agitation speed of shaker and of temperature of dye solutions was studied for understanding the interaction of dyes with adsorbent. The uptake of dyes by the adsorbent was increasing with increasing mass of the adsorbent, decreasing with increasing size of the adsorbent, and increasing with increasing agitation speed and temperature. The adsorption capacity for each <b>dye-adsorbent</b> system was determined by using the Langmuir isotherm. The adsorption capacity of adsorbent for MB, RB, CR and AB was 333. 33, 133. 34, 78. 12 and 5. 56 mgg− 1, respectively. The experimental data fit well with the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The standard enthalpy change of adsorption for MB, RB, CR and AB was 13. 5, 10. 97, 4. 01 and 6. 72 kJmol− 1, respectively. The average standard entropy change of adsorption for MB, RB, CR and AB is 58. 2957, 36. 869, 13. 2138 and − 3. 4179 kJmol− 1, respectively. The adsorption of two basic dyes is much higher than that of the direct and acid dyes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to valorise the mussel shells and {{evaluate}} the adsorption capacity of calcined mussel shells for the cationic dyes.  The adsorbent was characterized by DRX, FTIR, BET and SEM, respectively. The adsorption of Yellow Basic 28 on calcined mussel shells was investigated using the parameters such as concentrations (10 - 50 mg/L), pH (3 - 10), ionic strength (0 - 2 mol / L) and temperature (288 - 318 °C).  The adsorption rate data were analysed according to the ﬁrst and second-order kinetic models.  The adsorption kinetics was found to be best represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.  The experimental isotherm data were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Elovich and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm equations on the <b>dye-adsorbent</b> system. The experimental data yielded excellent ﬁts with Freundlich isotherm equation (R² = 0. 966). It was indicative of the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites on the CMS particles.  Various thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy of adsorption ΔH°, free energy change ΔG°and entropy ΔS° were estimated.  The positive value of ΔH°(30. 321 kJ/mol) and negative values of ΔG° (from - 5. 392 to - 2. 873 kJ/mol) show the process is endothermic and spontaneous.  The negative value of entropy ΔS° (- 87. 172 J/mol K) suggest the decreased randomness at the solid-liquid interface during the adsorption of dyes onto calcined mussel shells. </p...|$|E
