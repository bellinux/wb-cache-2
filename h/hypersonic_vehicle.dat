40|$|The concept studied {{during the}} summer NASA/ASEE Fellowship {{provides}} a means of lowering drag and a means for directional control of supersonic and <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Low drag and efficient directional control are essential {{for the success of}} aircraft, atmospheric entry vehicles, missiles, and other vehicles in supersonic and hypersonic flight. Drag reduction can result in increased vehicle range, increased speed, improved fuel efficiency, increased lift/drag ratio, and increased climb rate. For high supersonic and <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicles</b> heat transfer considerations dictate the design of the nose and leading edge. The heat transfer to such vehicles is most severe at stagnation points which occur on the leading edges and nose of the vehicle. Theoretical formulations, experimental data, and semi-empirical formulas all agree in the fact that stagnation point heat transfer is inversely proportional to the square root of the nose or leading edge radius. Thus, the noses and leading edges of supersonic and <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicles</b> are typically blunted so that the heat transfer and structural loads will be manageable. However, much of the wave drag experienced by these vehicles is due to nose blunting...|$|R

The rapid {{engineering}} aero-heating {{calculation method}} for <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicles</b> is {{established for the}} question of computational efficiency during conceptual design stage. First the pressure distribution along vehicle’s surface is calculated by modified Newtonian theory. Secondly, the streamline along the surface is calculated with Newtonian steepest decent concept.

Finally, the heat flux on the surfaces of blunted cone, lifting body and wave-rider vehicle is calculated The analysis result shows the method used in this paper is fit for <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and can satisfies the aero-heating calculation during conceptual design stage in both efficiency and accuracy...|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s, when {{studies were}} {{underway}} {{which led to}} the specification of the Space Shuttle, most leading US aerospace contractors explored orbital spaceplane designs, some based on a two-stage design.

With the adoption of the Space Shuttle design, these avenues appear to have been abandoned. The use of a spaceplane as part of the launching system to replace the Space Shuttle has been suggested in programs such as VentureStar.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{protection}} systems (TPS) and hot structures {{are required for}} a range of <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicles</b> ranging from ballistic reentry to <b>hypersonic</b> cruise <b>vehicles,</b> both within Earth’s atmosphere and non-Earth atmospheres. The focus of this paper is on air breathing <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Earth's atmosphere. This includes single-stage to orbit (SSTO), two-stage to orbit (TSTO) accelerators, access to space <b>vehicles,</b> and <b>hypersonic</b> cruise <b>vehicles.</b> This paper will start out with a brief discussion of aerodynamic heating and thermal management techniques to address the high heating, followed by an overview of TPS for rocket-launched and air-breathing vehicles.

50|$|Reentry heating {{differs from}} the normal {{atmospheric}} heating associated with jet aircraft, and this governed TPS design and characteristics. The skin of high-speed jet aircraft can also become hot, but this is from frictional heating due to atmospheric friction, similar to warming one's hands by rubbing them together. The orbiter reentered the atmosphere as a blunt body by having a very high (40-degree) angle of attack, with its broad lower surface facing the direction of flight. Over 80% of the heating the orbiter experiences during reentry is caused by compression of the air ahead of the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicle,</b> {{in accordance with the}} basic thermodynamic relation between pressure and temperature. A hot shock wave was created in front of the vehicle, which deflected most of the heat and prevented the orbiter's surface from directly contacting the peak heat. Therefore reentry heating was largely convective heat transfer between the shock wave and the orbiter's skin through superheated plasma. The key to a reusable shield against this type of heating is very low-density material, similar to how a thermos bottle inhibits convective heat transfer.|$|E
40|$|In this article, an {{adaptive}} fault tolerant control strategy is proposed {{to solve the}} trajectory tracking problem of a generic <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicle</b> subjected to actuator fault, external disturbance, and input saturation. The longitudinal model of generic <b>hypersonic</b> <b>vehicle</b> is divided into velocity subsystem and altitude subsystem, in which dynamic inversion and backstepping are applied, respectively, to track the desired trajectories. For the unknown maximum disturbance upper bound, actuator fault, and input saturation constraint, adaptive laws are proposed to estimate these information online.
