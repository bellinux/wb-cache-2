40|$|In this research, an {{architecture}} called the Agent-based Mobility Protocol (AMP) comprising a multi-agent system residing {{in both the}} mobile <b>host(s)</b> and the <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> has been developed {{for the purpose of}} enhancing mobility management in IP-based networks. The agent system on the mobile host was designed and subsequently built using an agent development platform called Agent Builder Pro. The core of the AMP architecture is the <b>access</b> <b>network</b> agency and both its specifications and the corresponding mobility management were designed using a combination of collaboration and operation diagrams. Given the scope and complexity of computer networks generally, and the Internet, specifically, the use of a network simulator was considered appropriate in providing a wider and comprehensive understanding of how the AMP architecture and protocol would perform in supporting a mobile host roaming over multiple network domains or autonomous systems. Hence, this paper presents our work in developing the AMP architecture including its implementation over a discrete-event network simulator called ns- 2 where customized objects have been built into the simulator. In addition, using different simulated scenarios, the architecture and protocol operations of AMP for mobility management were evaluated against Mobile IP as a basis for comparative analyses.

Therefore, {{there is a strong}} requirement for unified authentication. Lee et al. [35] proposed a unified authentication scheme for BcN wherein an AAA core-broker is positioned in the core network and manages the information for the authentication of the mobile nodes. When the mobile node detects a new <b>access</b> <b>network,</b> the information of the new <b>access</b> <b>network</b> is sent to the AAA core-broker which performs the pre-authentication of the mobile node with the AAA server of the new <b>access</b> <b>network.</b> When the mobile node moves into the new <b>access</b> <b>network,</b> a fast authentication procedure can be implemented locally. With the proposed scheme, low latency authentication operations can be achieved. This work seems to provide a sound unified authentication scheme. But in fact, it does not.
