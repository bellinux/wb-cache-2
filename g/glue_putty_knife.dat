2500|$|The current Mac Mini is {{designed}} to be opened using a round cover {{on the bottom of the}} computer. Prior versions of the Mac Mini were much more difficult to open. Some Mac Mini owners used a <b>putty</b> <b>knife</b> or a pizza cutter to pry open the cases of older models to gain access to the interior for installation of cheaper third party memory upgrades. The official Apple Service Source manual for Mac Mini describes this procedure in detail, including an official Apple part number for a [...] "modified putty knife". It's also possible to use wires to pull the white plastic bottom case out of the metal top case. While opening the case does not actually void the Mac Mini warranty, anything broken while the case is open is not covered. Other modifications include hard disk upgrades, overclocking the processor (G4 only), and upgrading the wireless networking (for older models) to 802.11n. The 2009 model can have its SuperDrive replaced with a second SATA hard drive. The removal of the optical drive in the 2011 models leaves internal space for a second internal hard drive or SSD, which can be ordered as a BTO option from Apple, or as an upgrade kit from 3rd party suppliers.|$|R
50|$|With {{his newfound}} {{financial}} freedom, {{he left the}} daily newspaper grind for life as a freelance author, scripting for radio while also writing (for six months) The Totem Pole, a daily column for United Features Syndicate, making personal appearances and working on his next book, Life in a <b>Putty</b> <b>Knife</b> Factory (1943), which became another bestseller. He spent eight months in Hollywood as a screenwriter for Paramount Pictures, and wrote about the experience in Lost in the Horse Latitudes (1944). His first three books were widely circulated {{around the world in}} Armed Services Editions. The popularity of these titles kept Smith on the New York Herald Tribunes Best Seller List for 100 weeks and prompted a collection of all three in 3 Smiths in the Wind (1946). By the end of World War II, Smiths fame as a humorist was such that he edited Desert Island Decameron (1945), a collection of essays and stories by such leading humorists as Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and James Thurber. Histories of the Manhattan Project mention Desert Island Decameron because its the book Donald Hornig was reading when he was sitting in the Trinity Test tower babysitting the atomic bomb on July 15, 1945, the stormy night prior to the first nuclear explosion.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{advances}} {{made in the}} recording and cataloguing of cuneiform tablets, {{there is still much}} work {{to be done in the}} field of cuneiform reconstruction. The processes employed to rebuild cuneiform fragments still rely on <b>glue</b> and <b>putty,</b> with manual matching of fragments from catalogues or individual collections. The reconstruction process is hindered by inadequate information about the size and shape of fragments, and the inaccessibility of the original fragments makes finding information difficult in some collections. Most catalogue data associated with cuneiform tablets concerns the content of the text, and not the physical appearance of complete or fragmented tablets. This paper shows how photogrammetric analysis of cuneiform tablets can be used to retrieve physical information directly from source materials without the risk of human error. An initial scan of 8000 images from the CDLI database has already revealed interesting new information about the tablets held in cuneiform archives, and offered new avenues for research within the cuneiform reconstruction process.

40|$|Oltarna pala s prikazom Gospe od Karmela djelo je Antonija Grapinellija, venecijanskog slikara sredine 18. stoljeća. Uz opis zatečenog stanja i izvedenih konzervatorsko-restauratorskih zahvata, posebno je izdvojeno čišćenje slike od površinske nečistoće i laka te prijašnjih preslika. Metodologija čišćenja ističe se zbog primjene Pemulena TR- 2, materijala primarno osmišljenog za primjenu u kozmetičkoj industriji. Inovativnost primjene navedenog polimernog emulgatora leži u jednostavnoj pripremi vodenih gelova i emulzija. Na konkretnoj problematici čišćenja slike Gospa od Karmela propituju se mogućnosti modifciranja djelovanja gelova i emulzija manipuliranjem pH-vrijednostima, kao i dodavanjem kelata i/ili tenzida. Primjena tog tipa emulzija otvara mogućnost čišćenja istovremenim djelovanjem vode, otapala, kelata, tenzida i fzikalne snage polimera, uz zadržavanje pH-vrijednosti u intervalu koji nije razoran za izvorni uljeni oslik. An altarpiece {{depicting}} Our Lady of Carmel {{is a work}} of Antonio Grapinelli, an 18 th-century Venetian painter. It {{was brought}} to the Croatian Conservation Institute workshop after the roof had collapsed of the Parish Church of St. George in Bobovišće on the island of Brač, causing no direct damage to the painting. On the painting, traces of two earlier treatments were present, executed at two different times and using different methods, altering its original look. In the first treatment, while cleaning the painting, the binders and the pigments were washed of the paint layer. Homogeneous lighter yellow putty was then applied to the damaged parts of the canvas and the paint layer. A considerable portion of the surface was overpainted with glaze, following the original forms and tonality of the painting, as an attempt to hide the damage done to the paint layer during the cleaning. An exception to this was the zone of the sky which was entirely overpainted in blue oil colour, thereby concealing the original circle of stars around the Virgin’s head. A new, similar ring of stars was painted in approximately the same spot, but somewhat smaller in radius than the original one. The general impression of this treatment is that it was largely executed by respecting the original look of the painting and the author’s painting technique. In the second treatment, all injuries were filled in with grainy structure, ochre-yellow putty. The putty was applied in a thick coat, often even on top of the surface of the original paint layer around the damaged areas, filling in all smaller and larger injuries of the canvas and the paint layer. The <b>putty</b> <b>glued</b> the painting to the back panel in several places. All puttied surfaces were retouched in pastose coats of oil paint, whose tone was out of tune with the original. The zone of the sky was once again overpainted, this time in a thick, pastose coat of oil paint. A thick coat of varnish was then applied over the entire surface of the painting. The general impression of this treatment is that it was executed carelessly, superficially and with little skill, lacking the understanding and the respect for the value of the artwork. As time went by, a considerable amount of surface dirt had attached to the varnish layer. Their adhesion made it impossible to remove the dirt with the usual cleaning methods, {{while at the same time}} it prevented the possibility of removing the varnish without endangering the paint layer. This paper therefore brings an account of how the painting was cleaned from surface impurities, varnish and a part of the overpaint. It details the application of Pemulen TR- 2, a material primarily designated for the use in cosmetic industry. The innovativeness in the use of this polymer emulsifier lies in the simplicity of preparation of the water gels and emulsions. As exemplified by the cleaning of the Our Lady of Carmel painting, questions are raised about the possibilities of modifying the workings of gels and emulsions by manipulating pH values, as well as adding chelates and/or tensides. The type of emulsion described here made it possible for the painting to be cleaned by synchronized workings of water, solvents, chelates, tensides and the physical strength of polymers, while at the same time keeping pH values within a range that poses no threat to the original oil painting. The text brings an overview of the cleaning trials performed using solvents, gels and emulsions, along with the instructions for preparing and applying the recipes used. The cleaning treatments using Pemulen TR- 2 -based emulsions enabled a simple, gradual and controlled removal of impurities and old varnish coats from the Our Lady of Carmel painting, pointing once more to the necessity of continually introducing new materials and methods into the practice of conservation and restoration...|$|R
