40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma thesis is the {{analysis}} of macroeconomic development of China in 1990 - 2014 in four key economic areas: economic performance, financial sector, labor market and internal and <b>external</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The main hypothesis is that China is not threatened by a hard-landing {{in the next few}} years. The theoretical part explains the basic terms and defines the research framework. In the empirical part is conducted the analysis of the selected indicators in that framework, consisting of internal and <b>external</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> labor market and demographic trends, financial sector, fiscal and monetary policies and additional growth factors. The result of the empirical part is the construction of a SWOT matrix. At the end there are proposed the recommendations for setting the future economic policy in China...|$|E

Using a reaction function we tested the hypothesis that SBP fully sterilized its foreign exchange interventions. The results indicated that for this period, SBP only partially neutralized its foreign exchange interventions. In addition, we also found that changes in SBP’s domestic credit were counter cyclical as it had negative relation with the output gap. However, the changes in domestic credit were found to have positive relation with changes in inflation. This probably resulted from too much weight assigned to growth objective in the back drop of recession and low inflation environment at the start of 2001. It was also found that the SBP also change its domestic credit systematically to reduce interest rate variability at the short end. ...|$|R

The mechanisms of financial crises due to monsoon or spill-over effects are also analysed in this framework.

The external transfer problem and the associated internal fiscal and real resource transfer problems are analyzed with special emphasis on possible causes for the breakdown of the internal and external transfer processes. The concepts of national and public sector solvency are used to evaluate the mutual consistency and feasibility of fiscal, financial and monetary plans.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{globalization}} and regionalization, we consider to be important {{an analysis of the}} asymmetries from the balances of payments of the member states of the European Union (EU). The propagation of a shock determines different effects in the member states of the European Union, due to the existence of some heterogeneous elements in the structure of these economies. Such a situation implies the risk of occurrence of divergences between the member states regarding the joint decisions with impact on the economic development and the <b>external</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The article aims at providing a theoretical analysis of the way a shock considered by the authors as being representative affects the current account balance of some countries with different economic characteristics, {{at least in terms of}} the foreign exchange regime. The theoretical analysis is followed by an empirical analysis of two European Union countries that have undergone the shock of the exchange rate regime shift generated by the entry into ERM II (Exchange Rate Mechanism II). Our research aims at showing the way in which this shock has been reflected upon the balance of the current account, and if the change of the exchange rate regime has been beneficial or not for the economies analysed. The article is based on wider research studies concerning the matters of <b>external</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> asymmetric shocks and European integration, and which have been developed by the authors during the last three years...|$|E
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{points of}} the gravitational potential field of minor celestial bodies, including asteroids, comets, and irregular satellites of planets, are studied. In order to understand better the orbital dynamics of massless particles moving near celestial minor bodies and their internal structure, both internal and <b>external</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{points of the}} potential field of the body are analyzed. In this paper, the location and stability of the equilibrium points of 23 minor celestial bodies are presented. In addition, the contour plots of the gravitational effective potential of these minor bodies are used {{to point out the}} differences between them. Furthermore, stability and topological classifications of equilibrium points are discussed, which clearly illustrate the topological structure near the equilibrium points and help to have an insight into the orbital dynamics around the irregular-shaped minor celestial bodies. The results obtained here show that {{there is at least one}} equilibrium point in the potential field of a minor celestial body, and the number of equilibrium points could be one, five, seven, and nine, which are all odd integers. It is found that for some irregular-shaped celestial bodies, there are more than four equilibrium points outside the bodies while for some others there are no <b>external</b> <b>equilibrium</b> points. If a celestial body has one equilibrium point inside the body, this one is more likely linearly stable. Comment: 33 pages, 1 figure in Astrophysics and Space Science (2014...|$|E

This equilibrium has been disrupted since the Fall of 2008. In the current situation of disequilibrium, very significant public capital exports (in the form of FX interventions by the SNB) are the only protection against an even stronger CHF. The question of whether a return to the pre-crisis equilibrium is likely is of prime importance for the country. A negative answer combined with the observation that permanent interventions by the SNB must be ruled out implies a structurally much stronger CHF eroding the competitiveness of large portions of the Swiss industry until the current account surplus is eliminated.|$|E
