5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Pundalik legend, {{two of which are}} attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34–67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god Gopala-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from Govardhana as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in digambar form, wearing makara-kundala, the srivatsa mark (described above), a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting his hands on his waist and keeping his cow-stick between <b>his</b> <b>thighs.</b> Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form {{on the banks of the}} river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a tirtha and a kshetra. The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.|$|E
25|$|Several stories {{within the}} Mahābhārata took on {{separate}} identities {{of their own}} in Classical Sanskrit literature. For instance, Abhijñānaśākuntala by the renowned Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa (c. 400 CE), believed to {{have lived in the}} era of the Gupta dynasty, is based on a story that is the precursor to the Mahābhārata. Urubhaṅga, a Sanskrit play written by Bhāsa who is believed to have lived before Kālidāsa, is based on the slaying of Duryodhana by the splitting of <b>his</b> <b>thighs</b> by Bhīma.|$|E
25|$|Typhon {{the enemy}} of the Olympian gods is {{described}} as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from <b>his</b> <b>thighs,</b> who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus, or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. Typhon is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Serpent elements figure among his offspring; among his children by Echidna are: Cerberus (a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and a serpentine mane); the serpent-tailed Chimaera; the serpent-like chthonic water beast Lernaean Hydra; and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon Ladon. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by Heracles.|$|E

500|$|His body arches, forcing {{his torso}} to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds {{in his hands}} as his head falls to the side from fatigue and the {{physical}} reality of approaching death. His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers <b>his</b> <b>thighs</b> and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the Arezzo work, {{may be influenced by}} earlier crucifixions by Giunta Pisano. His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan Meditation on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; [...] "Turn your eyes away from His divinity for a little while and consider Him purely as a man".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{mentioned}} Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century {{art historian}} Albert Boime described them as [...] "powerful, vulturine... grasping <b>his</b> <b>thighs</b> in a gesture... projecting... enormous strength controlled". Some contemporary critics {{were not so}} kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged {{what he saw as}} a [...] "fantastical bundle of flesh... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!" [...] Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: [...] "A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality... the energetic and mighty nature".|$|E
500|$|Bertin is {{presented}} as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as [...] "crab-like claws... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are {{the sleeves of his}} coat." [...] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his [...] "nearly ferocious presence" [...] is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on <b>his</b> <b>thighs,</b> barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar.|$|E

500|$|A {{complete}} inquest into Cancellor's {{death was}} initiated. His body {{was taken for}} autopsy on 28April and {{was found to be}} covered in blood under the gloves and stockings. <b>His</b> <b>thighs</b> were [...] "reduced to a perfect jelly" [...] and his body was covered in bruises and cuts, including two inch-deep holes in his right leg, deep enough to allow the medical examiner, Robert Willis, to touch the bone underneath. Willis reported that other than these injuries, the boy was healthy and his internal organs (including the heart) were free of disease. He thus concluded that Cancellor had not died of natural causes, as Hopley had suggested, and noted that the boy had obviously been beaten shortly before his death. A female servant named Ellen Fowler, when questioned by investigators, reported that she had heard Cancellor screaming and being beaten from 10pm until midnight and that, shortly thereafter, he abruptly fell silent. She also noted traces of blood in the house and on Hopley's candlestick, which was left outside Cancellor's bedroom, and evidence that Cancellor's and Hopley's clothes had been washed soon before the former was pronounced dead. Two other servants testified in the inquiry and gave similar accounts.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a period}} of rest in England, Little turned down a desk {{assignment}} and volunteered to return to action on the Western Front, joining Lieutenant Colonel Collishaw's No.3 Squadron RNAS in March 1918. The unit evolved into No.203 Squadron of the new Royal Air Force on 1April, formed after the merger of the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps. Now ranked captain, and again flying Sopwith Camels, Little gained a further nine successes, beginning with a Fokker Triplane on 1April, and concluding with two kills in one day on 22May, an Albatros and a DFW. During this stretch of victories, on 21April 1918, he was brought down unharmed by Friedrich Ehmann. On 27May, Little received reports of German Gotha bombers in the vicinity, and took off on a moonlit evening to intercept the raiders. As he closed {{with one of the}} bombers, his plane was caught in a searchlight beam and he was struck by a bullet that passed through both <b>his</b> <b>thighs.</b> He crash-landed in a field near Nœux, and bled to death before he was discovered the following morning by a passing gendarme. Little's skull and ankle had also been fractured in the impact; his body was identified by his friend and fellow ace, Charles Dawson Booker. [...] Collishaw launched an investigation but it was never established whether the single bullet that hit Little had come from a gunner in the Gotha or from the ground.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{one case}} of {{sympathomimetic}} toxicity {{was reported in}} the UK after a person took 0.2g of mephedrone orally, and after this did not achieve the desired effect, subcutaneously injected 3.8g mixed with water into <b>his</b> <b>thighs.</b> Shortly afterwards, the user [...] "developed palpitations, blurred tunnel vision, chest pressure and sweating". The patient was treated with 1mg of lorazepam and the sympathomimetic features decreased and the user was discharged within six hours of arrival. One case of serotonin syndrome has been reported, where the patient was already prescribed fluoxetine and olanzapine, and then took 40 tablets containing mephedrone in one night. He was treated with lorazepam and discharged 15 hours after admission. Both enantiomers of methcathinone, which differs only in the lack of the methyl group on the aryl ring when compared to mephedrone, {{have been shown to be}} toxic to rat dopamine neurons, and the S-enantiomer was also toxic against serotonin neurons. Simon Gibbons and Mire Zloh of the School of Pharmacy, University of London stated, based on the chemical similarities between methcathinone and mephedrone, [...] "it is highly likely that mephedrone will display neurotoxicity". However, Brunt and colleagues stated, [...] "extreme caution" [...] should be used when inferring the toxicity of mephedrone from methcathinone, noting some of the toxicity associated with methcathinone is due to manganese impurities related to its synthesis, rather than the compound itself. They concluded more experimental research is needed to investigate the toxicity of mephedrone.|$|E

500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round <b>his</b> <b>thighs</b> and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{placement}} of Arcturus {{has also been}} mutable through the centuries. Traditionally, Arcturus lay between <b>his</b> <b>thighs,</b> as Ptolemy depicted him.

2500|$|Alexander Vinokourov {{began the}} Tour {{as one of}} the favourites. Vinokourov's A test {{revealed}} two different types of red blood cells in his circulatory system indicating he had a blood transfusion prior to the stage. A blood transfusion is meant {{to increase the number of}} red blood cells in the body, improving oxygen flow from the lungs to the muscles. Vinokourov rejected the positive test, blaming the anomaly on excessive blood flow in <b>his</b> <b>thighs</b> following a heavy collision earlier in the Tour. Accordingly, he asked for his B sample to be tested; however, the lab test for locating blood cells from another donor in [...] "old fashioned" [...] homologous transfusions is considered fool-proof. It was later revealed that he had also tested positive on his win of stage 15, and that his B sample had since returned [...] "non-negative". [...] Astana responded by sacking Vinokourov.|$|E
2500|$|Regaining her composure, {{she told}} Sanders {{to step into}} the circle, take off his clothes, and put his head between <b>his</b> <b>thighs.</b> As he did so, she took a sickle-knife and nicked his scrotum, saying, [...] "You are one of us now." [...] (This was later {{revealed}} to be false and Sanders was merely furthering his publicity) It was then that Sanders realised she was a witch. His Grandmother was a hereditary witch, a descendant of the Welsh chieftain Owain Glyndŵr, the last man (according to Sanders) to have called himself [...] "King of the Witches"; supposedly his grandmother let him copy her Book of Shadows when he was nine and taught him the rites and magic of Witches. He was taught clairvoyance first by scrying in inky water, then in his grandmother's crystal. Sanders claimed that following the Blitz, and a few months before her death at age 74, Mrs Bibby conferred upon him second- and third-grade initiations, involving ritual sex.|$|E
2500|$|Like William Shakespeare, Marlowe is {{frequently}} {{claimed to have}} been homosexual. Others argue that the question of whether an Elizabethan was gay or homosexual in a modern sense is anachronistic. For the Elizabethans, what is often today termed homosexual or bisexual was more likely to be recognised as a sexual act, rather than an exclusive sexual orientation and identity. Some scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowe's homosexuality may simply be exaggerated rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying: [...] "All they that love not Tobacco and Boys are fools". David Bevington and Eric Rasmussen describe Baines's evidence as [...] "unreliable testimony" [...] and make the comment: [...] "These and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would regard as a witch-hunt". One critic, J.B. Steane, remarked that he considers there to be [...] "no evidence for Marlowe's homosexuality at all." [...] Other scholars, however, point to homosexual themes in Marlowe's writing: in Hero and Leander, Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander, [...] "in his looks were all that men desire" [...] and that when the youth swims to visit Hero at Sestos, the sea god Neptune becomes sexually excited, [...] "magining that Ganymede, displeas'd, ad left the Heavens ... he lusty god embrac'd him, call'd him love ... He watched his arms and, as they opened wide t every stroke, betwixt them would he slide nd steal a kiss, ... And dive into the water, and there pry pon his breast, <b>his</b> <b>thighs,</b> and every limb, ... nd talk of love", while the boy, naive and unaware of Greek love practices, protests, You are deceiv'd, I am no woman, I.' Thereat smil'd Neptune." [...] Edward the Second contains the following passage supporting homosexual relationships: ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Paul had two passages of the Book of Leviticus, [...] and , {{in mind when}} he used the word ἀρσενοκοῖται, which may be of his coinage. with most commentators and translators interpreting it as a reference to male same-sex intercourse. However, John Boswell states that it [...] "did not connote homosexuality to Paul or his early readers", and that in later Christian literature the word is used, for instance, by Aristides of Athens (c. 138) clearly not for homosexuality and possibly for prostitution, [...] Eusebius (d. c. 340) who evidently used it in reference to women, and in the writings of 6th-century [...] Patriarch John IV of Constantinople, known as John the Faster. In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of arsenokoitia as active or passive and says that [...] "many men even commit the sin of arsenokoitia with their wives". Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity. Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F. Greenberg, who declares usage of the term arsenokoites by writers such as Aristides of Athens and Eusebius, and in the Sibylline Oracles, to be [...] "consistent with a homosexual meaning". A discussion document issued by the House of Bishops of the Church of England states that most scholars still hold that the word arsenokoites relates to homosexuality. Another work attributed to John the Faster, a series of canons that for various sins provided shorter though stricter penances in place of the previous longer penances, applies a penance of eighty days for [...] "intercourse of men with one another" [...] (canon 9), explained in the Pedalion as mutual masturbation – double the penalty for solitary masturbation (canon 8) – and three years with xerophagy or, in accordance with the older canon of Basil the Great, fifteen without (canon 18) for being [...] "so mad as to copulate with another man" [...] – ἀρρενομανήσαντα in the original – explained in the Pedalion as [...] "guilty of arsenocoetia (i.e., sexual intercourse between males)" [...] – ἀρσενοκοίτην in the original. According to the same work, ordination is not to be conferred on someone who as a boy has been the victim of anal intercourse, {{but this is not the}} case if the semen was ejaculated between <b>his</b> <b>thighs</b> (canon 19). These canons are included, with commentary, in the Pedalion, the most widely used collection of canons of the Greek Orthodox Church, an English translation of which was produced by Denver Cummings and published by the Orthodox Christian Educational Society in 1957 under the title, The Rudder.|$|E
