5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by <b>direct</b> <b>heating,</b> but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. <b>Direct</b> <b>heating</b> applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E

2500|$|In operation, {{a current}} {{flows through the}} {{filament}} (heater)—a high resistance wire made of nichrome—and heats the cathode red hot (800–1000°C). This causes the cathode to release electrons into the vacuum, a process called thermionic emission. (Some valves use <b>direct</b> <b>heating,</b> in which a tungsten filament acts as both heater and cathode.) [...] The alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the concentric plate electrode. [...] When the plate has a positive voltage {{with respect to the}} cathode, it electrostatically attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. [...] However, when the polarity is reversed and the plate has a negative voltage, no current flows, because the cathode electrons are not attracted to it. [...] The plate, being unheated, does not emit any electrons. So electrons can only flow through the tube in one direction, from the cathode to the anode plate.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{results of a}} global {{resource}} assessment for geothermal energy within deep aquifers for <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> utilization. Greenhouse heating, spatial heating, and spatial cooling are considered in this assessment. We derive subsurface temperatures from geophysical data and apply a volumetric heat-in-place method to improve current global geothermal resource base estimates for <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> applications. The amount of thermal energy stored within aquifers depends on the Earth's heat flow, aquifer volume, and thermal properties. We assess the thermal energy available by estimating subsurface temperatures up {{to a depth of}} three kilometer depending on aquifer thickness. The distribution of geothermal resources is displayed in a series of maps and the depth of the minimum production temperature is used as an indicator of performance and technical feasibility. Suitable aquifers underlay 16 % of the Earth's land surface and store an estimated 4 · 10 5 to 5 · 10 6 EJ that could theoretically be used for <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> applications. Even with a conservative recovery factor of 1 % and an assumed lifetime of 30 years, the annual recoverable geothermal energy is in the same order as the world final energy consumption of 363. 5 EJ yr − 1.
