Available {{figures for the}} <b>exchange-traded</b> and over-the-counter-traded <b>derivatives</b> in Russia show that the Russian derivatives markets experienced enormous growth rates since the financial crisis in 1998. Starting from a very low level, turnover of <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> in Russia rose from 2000 to 2006 on average 168 percent per year and reached a total turnover of EUR 102 billion in 2006. Among futures, equity futures, followed by currency futures, are the most traded <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> in Russia. Turnover of <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> on interest rates, bonds or even commodities represent {{only a very small}} fraction of the total turnover. Available figures for the Russian OTC foreign exchange derivatives market suggest for the period between April 2004 and 2007 an annual turnover growth rate of 47 percent.

40|$|Although margin {{requirements}} would arise naturally {{in the context}} of unregulated trading of clearinghouse-guaranteed derivative contracts, the {{margin requirements}} on U.

At present, two alternative methodologies are used for margining exchangetraded derivative contracts. Customer positions in securities and securities options are margined using a strategy-based approach. Futures, futures-options, and securitiesoption clearinghouse margins are set using a portfolio margining system. This study evaluates the relative efficiency of these alternative margining techniques using data on S&P 500 futures-option contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The results indicate that the portfolio margining approach isamuch more efficient system for collateralizing the one-day risk exposures of equity derivative portfolios. Given the overwhelming efficiency advantage of the portfolio approach, the simultaneous existence of these alternative margining methods is somewhat puzzling. It is argued that the co-existence of these systems can in part be explained {{in the context of}} Kane's (1984) model of regulatory competition.

40|$|Jet {{fuel costs}} have {{substantially}} risen {{over the past}} several years putting consistent pressure on airlines to maintain positive cash flows. While the costs are hedgable, there is not a perfect hedge available in either the over-the-counter or exchange traded derivatives markets. Over-the-counter derivatives on jet fuel are very illiquid which makes them rather expensive and not available in quantities sufficient to hedge all of an airlines jet fuel consumption. <b>Exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> are not available in the United States for jet fuel, so airlines must use futures contracts on commodities that are highly correlated with jet fuel, such as crude and heating oil. As such, airlines employ a variety of strategies ranging from not hedging to fully hedging using a combination of products. This paper is divided into several sections. First, we document the various strategies, including hedging using over-the-counter derivatives, futures contracts, and not hedging, and evaluate the effectiveness and merits of each. We then discuss the accounting rules and the implications these rules have for driving hedging strategies. Finally, we perform an industry survey as of December 31, 2003 and document the practices currently in place in the domestic airline industry to determine whether the use of a hedging strategy appears to create market value. Our research indicates that, contrary to the opinions of many airline executives, the optimal strategy is to employ a dynamic hedging program that is actively managed through the price cycle using a variety of derivative products. Because the airline industry is relatively unhedged at the present, using derivatives to hedge jet fuel costs creates a competitive advantage and has been shown to increase firm value. I. Available Hedging Strategies Domestic airlines have a variety of hedging strategies available to them. These include using both over-the-counter and <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> and remaining unhedged...|$|R

40|$|POLICY BRIEF Don’t {{blame the}} {{physical}} markets: Financialization {{is the root}} cause of oil and commodity price volatility The sharp price movements of many primary commodities, including oil, have fuelled intense debate about the causes of the price hikes and possible remedies. Growing demand from large developing economies and frequent supply shocks, such as adverse weather and export bans, are generally accepted as more tangible factors that explain volatility, rather than the {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of bets placed on expectations of temporarily rising prices. Despite a growing body of evidence on the destabilizing influences emanating from financial markets, the “real economy ” explanations still dominate the debate. It is not commonly recognized that demand from financial investors in the commodity markets has become overwhelming during the last decade. Of course, supply and demand shocks can still move commodity prices time and again.

40|$|It {{is often}} presumed that higher market {{volatility}} begets more active trading in derivatives markets. A number of empirical studies {{have confirmed that}} such {{a positive relationship between}} volatility and activity exists. However, those studies have usually drawn on analyses that apply mainly to daily or intraday data. Very few studies have considered the existence of a possible relationship between volatility and volume from one month to the next. Moreover, the nature of the trading that could give rise to such a relationship is generally left unexplained. In this special feature, we examine the relationship between volatility and monthly activity in <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> contracts. First, we discuss the various trading motives that would lead to such a relationship. We distinguish between hedging motives and information-based motives.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays. The first essay (chapter two) looks at the impact of derivatives regulation on liquidity and mispricing of US derivatives markets. In particular, we test the hypothesis that Dodd Frank derivative provisions may improve {{the efficiency of the}} exchange traded markets due to an increase of arbitrage by traders on the exchange traded markets, as opposed to the OTC markets. We examine the impact of key Dodd Frank events on market activity for financial derivatives (futures and option contracts on US T bonds, Eurodollar futures and options, and S&P 500 Futures contracts) and on foreign exchange derivatives (futures and options contracts on EUROs, British Pounds, and Canadian dollars). First, we look at how liquidity on the markets has been affected. Next, we test for mispricing of derivatives contracts. We find that measured liquidity does fall for US financial futures and options but rises for foreign exchange futures and options subsequent to the introduction of the Treasury guidelines for OTC trading. We also find that the efficiency of the U. S. exchange traded futures markets has improved, as reflected by a reduction in mispricing in the S&P futures contracts; some improvement in pricing efficiency is also shown for nearby Eurodollar futures contracts. These results are consistent with an increase of arbitrage by traders on the exchange traded markets, as opposed to the OTC markets, in contrast to the “noise” model. The second essay (chapter three) provides a description and comparison between OTC and <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> market activity. It compares the turnover in OTC derivatives among three regions: Americas, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. Similar analysis is also conducted for non-financial customers. The empirical results show that the growth rate of <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> leads growth rate of OTC derivatives. The conclusion still holds for derivatives of different risk categories. The third essay (chapter four) examines the futures market efficiency of the VIX and the relative merits of the VIX and VIX futures contracts in forecasting future S&P 500 excess returns the future Russell 2000 excess returns, and the future small-cap premium. We find that the current VIX is significantly negatively related to S&P 500 index excess returns and positively related to the Russell 2000 index excess returns. These results suggest that the VIX predicts asset returns based on size based portfolios asymmetrically – with higher (lower) values of the VIX associated with lower (higher) values of small-cap (large cap) returns in the future. However, the VIX and VIX modeled by an ARIMA process are not significantly related to future values of the small-cap premium. In contrast, VIX futures show forecasting prowess for the S&P 500 excess return, the Russell 2000 excess return and the small-cap premium. VIX futures are significantly negatively related to these series. The results for the speculative efficiency of the VIX futures contracts are mixed, however. Overall, the analyses support the hypothesis of informational advantages of the futures markets relative to the spot market in the price discovery process not just for size based asset returns, but on the size premium as well...|$|R
