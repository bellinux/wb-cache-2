5|$|<b>External</b> <b>costs,</b> also {{referred}} to as hidden costs, are quantifications of the environmental and climate impacts of air transport. Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely, figures have been produced for the most significant. In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £1.4billion, rising to £4.8billion per annum by 2030. The impact of noise was costed at around £25million per annum in 2000, and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £119million and £236million per annum. Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total external cost for 2000 of around £6billion.|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of the internalisation of environmental externalities on energy prices. In this context, its aim is to quantify the <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> of greenhouse gases (specifically carbon dioxide) generated during electricity production in the thermal power plants in Greece and to estimate the impact on the electricity production cost and on the electricity prices of a possible internalisation of this <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> by the producers. For this purpose, this paper applies the EcoSenseLE online tool to quantify the examined externalities. This research finds that the calculated <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> is significantly high (compared to the corresponding production cost) mainly in lignite-fired power plants. Specifically, a possible internalisation of this <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> would increase the production cost by more than 52 % (on average), which, in turn, would affect similarly the electricity prices. This finding could be important for decision makers in the electricity sector to develop strategies for emission reduction and to develop environmental and energy policies. The general limitation of the <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> methodology applies to this work as it uses the standard method developed for the Externe project. Similarly, the data limitations as well as assumptions related to the costs and exclusions/ omissions of cost elements affect the results. <b>External</b> <b>cost</b> Electricity prices Climate change Thermal power plants Greece...|$|R

25|$|A recent law journal note {{summarized}} the justifications for regulating payday lending. The summary notes {{that while it}} is difficult to quantify the impact on specific consumers, there are external parties who are clearly affected by the decision of a borrower to get a payday loan. Most directly impacted are the holders of other low interest debt from the same borrower, which now is less likely to be paid off since the limited income is first used to pay the fee associated with the payday loan. The <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> of this product can be expanded to include the businesses that are not patronized by the cash-strapped payday customer to the children and family who are left with fewer resources than before the loan. The <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> alone, forced on people given no choice in the matter, may be enough justification for stronger regulation even assuming that the borrower him or herself understood the full implications of the decision to seek a payday loan.|$|E
40|$|Project {{delivery}} {{methods that}} are based on the concept of supply chain integration are believed by many to lead towards a more effective and more efficient way of working than other, more traditional ways of project delivery like the design-bid-build (DBB) method. This tentative study compares the cost performance of strategic alliance (SA) with that of a DBB. based on cost estimates at the Pre-construction stage. The cost estimates of three SA’s have been compared to three DBB cost estimates, which have been made by three <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> consultants, {{to see if there are}} indication of one project delivery method is superior. Three large scale housing renovation projects which are delivered by a similar form of SA have been selected for this study. The three alliances exist of different clients, contractors and subcontractors which are working in different regions. The target cost estimates made by the SA’s for the three projects have been compared with <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> estimates. These <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> estimates have been made by three different <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> consultants. The <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> estimates were made based on the assumption that the project would be delivered based on a traditional DBB method. The <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> consultants weren’t informed about the SA that was set up to deliver the project. Project costs per element were compared.

25|$|Environmental {{concerns}} over <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam {{is the largest}} source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, landfilling or incineration. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, have required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} {{problem with}} {{climate change is}} that the emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) do not face the full cost implications of their actions (IMF, 2008, p.6). There are costs that emitters do face, e.g., {{the costs of the}} fuel being used, but there are other costs that are not necessarily included in the price of a good or service. These other costs are called <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> (Halsnæs et al.., 2007). They are [...] "external" [...] because they are costs that the emitter does not face. <b>External</b> <b>costs</b> may affect the welfare of others. In the case of climate change, GHG emissions affect the welfare of people living in the future, as well as affecting the natural environment (Toth et al., 2001). These <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> can be estimated and converted in a common (monetary) unit. The argument for doing this is that these <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> can then be added to the private costs that the emitter faces. In doing this, the emitter faces the full (social) costs of their actions (IMF, 2008, p.9).|$|E
2500|$|A 2001 EU-funded study {{known as}} ExternE, or Externalities of Energy, over the decade from 1995 to 2005 {{found that the}} cost of {{producing}} electricity from coal would double over its present value, if <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> were taken into account. [...] These <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> include damage to the environment and to human health from airborne particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, chromium VI and arsenic emissions produced by coal. It was estimated that external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1–2% of the EU’s entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with coal being the main fossil fuel accountable, and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included. The study found that environmental and health costs of coal alone were [...] €0.06/kWh, or 6 cents/kWh, with the energy sources of the lowest <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> being nuclear power €0.0019/kWh, and wind power at €0.0009/kWh.|$|E
30|$|There is thus an {{inherent}} contradiction between the fiscal and environmental policy goals. An effective environmental tax may erode its own base. The consequences could be wide-reaching, since fuel taxes {{are probably the}} most important market correction mechanism currently in place in Europe. According to Thune-Larsen et al. [32], the Norwegian petrol tax is just about high enough to balance the vehicles’ average marginal <b>external</b> <b>cost.</b> The per litre diesel tax, however, falls around NOK 3 (= appr. € 0.35) short of the associated <b>external</b> <b>cost.</b> BEVs are subject to only a small electricity tax, despite giving rising to an <b>external</b> <b>cost</b> that is only 30 % lower than for petrol cars.|$|R

2500|$|Agriculture, as {{implemented}} {{through the}} method of farming, imposes <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total <b>external</b> <b>costs</b> for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare. A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million. Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more {{should be done to}} internalize <b>external</b> <b>costs.</b> Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society. In 2010, the International Resource Panel of the United Nations Environment Programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that [...] "gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. [...] "On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020)." ...|$|E
