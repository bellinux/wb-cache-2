5|$|<b>Kauri</b> gum is a fossilised resin detracted from <b>kauri</b> trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. <b>Kauri</b> forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to revert to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient <b>kauri</b> fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kauri</b> gum {{formed when}} resin from <b>kauri</b> trees leaked out through {{fractures}} or {{cracks in the}} bark, hardening with the exposure to air. Lumps commonly {{fell to the ground}} and became covered with soil and forest litter, eventually fossilising. Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kauri</b> gum {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). <b>Kauri</b> gum was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>kauri</b> gum {{was found}} to mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used <b>kauri</b> gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|The Māori {{had many}} {{uses for the}} gum, which they called kapia. Fresh gum {{was used as a}} type of chewing gum (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the gum was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with animal fat, it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. <b>Kauri</b> gum was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, <b>kauri</b> gum sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E
5|$|Curio Bay {{features}} the petrified {{remains of a}} forest 160 million years old. This represents a remnant of the subtropical woodland that once covered the region, only to become submerged by the sea. The fossilised remnants of trees closely related to modern <b>kauri</b> and Norfolk pine can be seen here.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kauri</b> gum was Auckland's main export in {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{sustaining}} much of the early growth of the city. Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons of gum were exported. The peak in the gum market was 1899, with 11,116tons exported that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700). The average annual export was over 5,000tons, with the average price gained £63 ($103.91) per ton.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gumfields were in Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, {{the site}} of the {{original}} <b>kauri</b> forests. Initially, the gum was readily accessible, commonly found lying on the ground. Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on the beach at Mercury Bay, Coromandel, in 1769, although he suspected it came from the mangroves, and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's early {{economy was}} based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, <b>kauri</b> gum, and native timber. During the 1880s {{agricultural}} products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand. Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census, although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector. The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people. Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).|$|E
5|$|In Northland, C.australis shows a {{great deal}} of genetic diversity—suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured. Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which {{botanist}} Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with C.pumilio, the dwarf cabbage tree. In eastern Northland, C.australis generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, C.obtecta, which grows at North Cape and on nearby islands. These obtecta-like characteristics appear in populations of C.australis along parts of the eastern coastline from the Karikari Peninsula to the Coromandel Peninsula. In western Northland and Auckland, a form often called tītī grows. When young, tītī are generally very spindly, and are common in young <b>kauri</b> forests. When growing in the open, tītī can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} grass or among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned karri regrowth forests. It is common in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and <b>kauri</b> (Agathis) forest, and in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, <b>kauri</b> gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E

25|$|After union workers went on strike, some 1,700 strikebreakers {{were brought}} in to unload ships, about 80 of whom were {{assigned}} to unload Golden <b>Kauri.</b> On 4 October, a strikebreaker was fatally injured by timber falling from a sling being used to unload Golden <b>Kauri,</b> and a second strikebreaker {{was killed in an}} industrial accident the same day. Unionists jeered at the ambulance transporting the two to hospital as it passed by.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, the Oceanic and Oriental Line was wound up, and Golden <b>Kauri</b> {{came under}} the direct control of the parent company, Matson Lines. Shortly afterward, Golden <b>Kauri</b> was renamed SS Waipio. Waipio carried on in the freight and cargo trade through World War II, still home-ported in San Francisco. In 1946, Waipio was sold to Campania Paralos de Vapores, S.A of Panama, and renamed SS Paralos. Paralos was {{scrapped}} in Osaka, Japan in 1954.|$|E
25|$|It {{has taken}} many decades {{for the young}} <b>kauri</b> (Agathis australis), known as 'rickers' to {{regenerate}} and finally, begin to emerge through the forest canopy again. Many sharp pointed, cone shaped, rickers {{can be seen from}} the Kitekite loop track near the falls. At about 100 years old, <b>kauri</b> begin to develop a spreading crown. It is now approaching 100 years since milling stopped. The crowns generally continue to expand for a further 500 years.|$|E

25|$|In 1839, European {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in the Kaipara to fell and mill <b>kauri</b> trees and build boats for local requirements. Despite the perilous bar at the harbour entrance, the Kaipara became a busy timber port from the 1860s, shipping thousands of tonnes of <b>kauri</b> timber and gum. The first sailing ship wrecked {{at the entrance to}} the harbour was the Aurora in April 1840. The brigantine Sophia Pate was wrecked at South Head in August 1841 with the loss of all 21 on board.|$|E
25|$|Golden <b>Kauri</b> {{departed}} Melbourne for Newcastle, NSW on 9 October, {{arriving on}} the 15th. On the 16th, {{a group of}} about 400 union members marched to King's Wharf to confront strikebreakers, who were ordered by police to board Golden <b>Kauri</b> for their safety. Unionists then charged the ship three times, attempting to get aboard, and on each occasion were driven back by baton-wielding police. The police finally dispersed the crowd with a baton charge. About 20 waterside workers were later treated in hospital for injuries sustained in the confrontation.|$|E
25|$|The Wairoa is {{the main}} river feeding the Kaipara from the north. Thirty {{kilometres}} upstream, the town of Dargaville was established. The stretch of water to Dargaville is broad and straight and provides an easy to navigate route into what were then <b>kauri</b> forests in the interior. Dargaville flourished as <b>kauri</b> fell and mills buzzed. Immigrants from Britain and Croatia were attracted to the area. Ships up to 3,000 tons carried timber and logs out along the Wairoa to defy {{the bar at the}} harbour entrance before continuing on, usually to another New Zealand port or across the Tasman to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Kaiwaka {{became a}} trading and {{commercial}} point {{from the late}} 1850s. As the <b>kauri</b> timber and gum industries declined {{towards the end of}} the century, dairy farming became established. The Hakaru Dairy Company was formed to serve Kaiwaka farmers in 1902.|$|E
25|$|Ngai Tai {{along with}} members of other Hauraki tribes, lived in the Omana park area for many generations. The park was part of William Fairburn's Maraetai Mission Station which {{included}} a small school for Maori from 1837 - 42. Omana {{was part of the}} mission farm, developed from 1837. The forest covering the park and surrounding area was felled for timber by European settlers who cleared the land for farming during the mid-1840s. <b>Kauri</b> felled in the Maraetai hills behind Omana was hauled by bullock teams down to the sea and then floated to mills in Auckland. The Omana park area was also dug for <b>kauri</b> gum and even prospected for gold and silver. In 1852 following the discovery of gold in Coromandel many searched the hills digging shafts wherever quartz veins could be located.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{analysis}} in the sediments of the Waitetuna arm of the harbour shows that the original vegetation was kahikatea on the flats, and a mixed podocarp-hardwood forest on the slopes, with totara, maire, matai, rimu, rata, beech and tree ferns. <b>Kauri</b> was present, but not abundant.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, Coromandel {{acquired}} timber spars for the Royal Navy and undertook coastal survey work. She {{gave her}} name to the town Coromandel on the harbour where she stopped to purchase <b>kauri</b> wood for spars, and to the Coromandel Peninsula on which the town sits. Coromandel returned to Sydney in June 1821 and departed again for Britain on 25 July 1821.|$|E
25|$|Birkenhead Public Library (Te Whare Matauranga o Birkenhead in Māori) is a New Zealand library, {{part of the}} Auckland Libraries system {{located on}} Auckland's North Shore. Founded in 1949 it {{predominantly}} serves the areas of Birkenhead, Beach Haven, Birkdale, <b>Kauri</b> Park, Chelsea, and Birkenhead East, {{a population of about}} 26,000, including six primary schools, two intermediate schools, and two colleges.|$|E
25|$|Golden <b>Kauri</b> {{departed}} Newcastle for the United States a {{few days}} later, arriving at San Francisco on or about 22 November. Her owners {{appear to have been}} undeterred by the recent mayhem on the Australian docks however, as the ship was back in Melbourne on 20 February 1929, having sailed a few weeks earlier from the lumber town of Aberdeen, Washington.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{originally}} constructed entirely of native Japanese woods. (In 1956, the mainmast became infested with borer-type insects {{and was replaced}} in Auckland with one of native New Zealand <b>kauri</b> pine.) It was double-planked, mahogany over hinoki (cypress). The hull was hinoki above the water line, sugi (cryptomeria cedar) below. The cabins below decks consisted of mahogany, camphor, cherry, chestnut and Japanese cabinet woods.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} organised {{attempt to}} colonise New Zealand came in 1825, when the New Zealand Company {{was formed in}} London, headed by the wealthy John George Lambton, MP. The company unsuccessfully petitioned the British Government for a 31-year term of exclusive trade and for command over a military force, anticipating that large profits could be made from New Zealand flax, <b>kauri</b> timber, whaling and sealing.|$|E
25|$|After decommission, {{the ship}} was laid up for several years until {{resuming}} service in 1926 as the merchant ship SS West Elcajon, operating between the United States and the Far East. In 1928, she was purchased by the Matson Line, renamed SS Golden <b>Kauri,</b> and employed in the timber trade between the U.S. and Australia. In late 1928, she became embroiled in a violent Australian industrial dispute.|$|E
25|$|The <b>kauri</b> gum {{industry}} became established around Matakohe in 1867-70, {{possibly the}} {{first place in the}} Kaipara District that the industry developed amongst settlers. A flax mill was built in 1870, but it was not profitable and was soon converted to a timber mill. This was replaced by a larger timber mill in the 1880s. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1906. Matakohe held a race-day each February, in which were entries from as far as Kaiwaka and Waipu.|$|E
25|$|Forsaith {{established}} himself as a farmer and trader in the Kaipara District. He bought land in 1839 on the Wairoa River near present-day Dargaville. He was likely to have been the first European settler in the area. He built a timber mill for cutting <b>Kauri</b> spars, as the British Government was purchasing these at £17 each. He cleared land for wheat and running cattle, which he had to import. By May 1841, he had fenced 12 acres of cleared land, most of it growing wheat.|$|E
25|$|Gum-diggers {{operated}} {{on the peninsula}} from the 1870s and lasting into the 1930s, although <b>kauri</b> trees no longer grew there. Dairy farming {{was established in the}} early 20th century. Sand from Pouto was used to build dams in the Waitakere Ranges, and was also barged around the Kaipara Harbour. The southern part of the peninsula was slow to be developed, with the road only reaching to Taingaehe in 1930, and extending another 35km to Pouto itself in 1931. Until then, contact {{with the rest of the}} world was by steamer. The road wasn't metalled until the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|Tāwari {{can often}} be found {{together}} with the New Zealand <b>kauri</b> Agathis australis in the understory of the lowland rain forest. It is common in cloud forest up to 700m too. The species has a preference for shaded or sheltered locations, often in permanently damp soil and near streams. It is locally abundant but mostly individuals are far between. It is common in regenerating forests along with tawheowheo Quintinia serrata. Pollination is mainly by birds. The seeds are partly covered by a fleshy aril and are dispersed by birds and other animals that eat it. The wide spreading anthers are an adaptation to pollination by birds.|$|E
25|$|Between 1795 and 1830 {{a steady}} flow of sealing and then whaling ships visited New Zealand, mainly {{stopping}} at the Bay of Islands for food supplies and recreation. Many of the ships came from Sydney. Missionaries, initially from Sydney and later from England, arrived in small numbers to try to convert Māori to Christianity, but were shocked by the frequent scenes of drunkenness and debauchery as single women and girls flooded on to the ships to service the sailors' needs in exchange for goods such as iron nails. Trade between Sydney and New Zealand increased as traders sought <b>kauri</b> timber and flax and missionaries purchased large areas of land in the Bay of Islands.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Forsaith {{became an}} {{apprentice}} as a silk merchant in Croydon, but he rather {{wanted to go}} to sea. As a cabin boy, he travelled on a collier to the River Tyne. He then made three journeys to the West Indies as a cadet officer for Charles Horsfall and Co. on the Huddersfield (named after Horsfall's birthplace). He returned home with a good reference, but found that his father had died in the meantime. As a fourth officer, he sailed on the convict ship Hoogley to Botany Bay in 1834. Two years later, he again sailed to Australia, this time on the Lord Goderich. He first came to New Zealand on the return journey, when <b>Kauri</b> spars were loaded in Hokianga.|$|E
