5|$|Alongside {{the main}} {{narrative}} are side stories involving {{various members of}} Fortuna Entertainment, which Itsuki can help as he learns from working in various sectors of the agency's business. These quests' storylines include Tsubasa working to create her idol persona; Touma's wish to become an inspirational actor; Kiria's <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> her softer side, which clashes with her professional identity; Eleanora's attempts to polish her abilities as an actress {{in preparation for a}} hoped-for Hollywood career; Mamori pushing to expand her professional range beyond her cooking host role; Yashiro breaking out of his self-imposed personal and professional isolation, culminating in a battle with his father's spirit; the often-tipsy Maiko's efforts to maintain Fortuna's public and private functions; Barry's antics and his growing insecurity after losing his Mirage Master abilities; and Tiki wanting the chance to experience the real world. If all the side stories are completed, a post-credits scene is unlocked where Maiko returns to modelling and makes Itsuki the new manager of Fortuna Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and {{watching}} it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
40|$|A {{test program}} to {{determine}} the total <b>discomfort</b> associated <b>with</b> vehicle vibration is described. The program utilizes a three-degree-of-freedom vibration simulator {{to determine the}} effects of multifrequency and multiaxis vibration inputs. The approach to multifrequency vibration includes a separate consideration of the <b>discomfort</b> associated <b>with</b> each frequency component or band of the total spectrum and a subsequent empirical weighting of the discomfort components of these frequency bands when in various random combinations. The results are in the form of equal discomfort curves that specify the <b>discomfort</b> associated <b>with</b> discrete frequencies between 1 and 30 Hz and different acceleration levels. These results provide detailed information of the human discomfort response to increases in acceleration level for each frequency investigated. More importantly, the results provide a method for adding the <b>discomfort</b> associated <b>with</b> separate frequencies to give a total typification of the discomfort of a random spectrum of vibration...|$|R

The reason for this was because Branyan expressed <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> the cleanup role because of the excessive work load.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Kuroki visited Italy {{where she}} met Cicciolina, whom she regards as sensei. She was pleased to find that many of their {{opinions}} coincided, but was surprised by Cicciolina's <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> Kuroki's masochistic tendencies and preference for the S genre. Kuroki attributes this to cultural and personal differences, and does not feel that S equates to submissiveness. Indeed, Fornander points out that Kuroki made AVs in general, and S in particular a feminist issue in Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic {{approach}} to Marian art is quite {{distinct from the}} way other Christians (such as the Protestant and the Eastern Orthodox) treat the depictions of the Virgin Mary. From {{the very beginning of}} the Protestant Reformation its leaders expressed their <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.|$|E
25|$|Another {{point of}} pride was their pay, which was both high and {{consistent}} by Chinese standards – a strong recruiting drive that triumphed over most <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> unfamiliar uniforms. The pay was high {{in part to}} attract new recruits to dangerous work, but also {{to compensate for the}} lack of “looting” opportunity. Ward strongly discouraged looting, as he knew the practice turned local populaces against their “liberators”. Other benefits offered to Ward's men included better rations, billets, and of course, better chance of survival in combat.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists in Belgium {{investigated}} {{whether the}} Western majority's <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> the Islamic hijab, {{and the support}} of its ban from the public sphere, is motivated by the defense of the values of autonomy and universalism (which includes equality), or by xenophobia/ethnic prejudice and by antireligious sentiments. Consistently across two studies, it was found that hostility toward the veil was predicted by (a) xenophobia/subtle ethnic prejudice as well as by (b) general antireligious sentiments (jointly or independently) and not by the defense of the liberal values of autonomy and equality.|$|E

In 1892 Carlisle was again proposed as a candidate for president at the Democratic convention, but this time Carlisle asked that he not be considered.

25|$|For {{the launch}} of the series Melrose Place in 1992, Jennie Garth made a multi-episode special guest appearance. During the final episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210 season 2, Grant Show played his Melrose Place {{character}} Jake, who started a relationship with Kelly which led into early episodes of the spin-off. During Kelly's appearances, her relationship with Jake was largely on-and-off due to his <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> her youth. In the end, after weeks of trying to break up with Kelly, Jake pretended to cheat on her, prompting her to leave him. Afterward on both Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place, Kelly, Donna, Jake, and others made occasional comments concerning Kelly and Jake's brief relationship.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the EEOC {{ruled that}} {{employment}} {{discrimination on the}} basis of gender identity or transgender status is prohibited under Title VII. The decision held that {{discrimination on the basis}} of gender identity qualified as {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex whether the discrimination was due to sex stereotyping, <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> the fact of an individual's transition, or discrimination due to a perceived change in the individual's sex. In 2014, the EEOC initiated two lawsuits against private companies for discrimination on the basis of gender identity, with additional litigation under consideration. As of November 2014, Commissioner Chai Feldblum is making an active effort to increase awareness of Title VII remedies for individuals discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{screening}} colonoscopy process {{requires a}} considerable amount of time and some discomfort for patients. Objective: We sought to use willingness-to-pay (WTP) to value the time required and the <b>discomfort</b> associated <b>with</b> screening colonoscopy. In addition, we aimed to explore some of the differences between and potential uses of the WTP and the human capital methods. Methods: Subjects completed a diary recording time and a questionnaire including WTP questions to value the time and <b>discomfort</b> associated <b>with</b> colonoscopy. We also valued the elapsed time reported in the diaries (but not the discomfort) using the human capital method. Results: 110 subjects completed the study. Mean WTP to avoid the time and discomfort was $ 263. Human capital values for elapsed time were greater. Linear regressions showed that WTP was influenced most by the difficulty of the preparation, which added $ 147 to WTP (p= 0. 03). Conclusions: WTP values to avoid the time and <b>discomfort</b> associated <b>with</b> the screening colonoscopy process were substantially lower than most of the human capital values for elapsed time alone. The human capital method may overestimate the value of time in situations that involve an irregular, episodic series of time intervals, such as preparation for or recovery after colonoscopy.

25|$|The {{marriage}} between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was {{by any standard}} extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> any conversation that was not strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, {{but the question of}} how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since {{he did not want to}} be accused of nepotism.|$|E
25|$|Several months later, in a forum {{discussion}}, Nicieza {{once again}} defended his {{writing of the}} story. In a discussion regarding communication between comic book authors, and whether writers were bothered when their creations were altered, or re-characterized, by other authors of a shared universe, Nicieza's treatment of Anarky was criticized. In addressing the concerns of his detractors, Nicieza submitted that he fully agreed with the criticisms by Alan Grant. As Nicieza explained, his intention was to deliberately alter the concept the Anarky mantle represented, while attempting to respect the characterization of Lonnie Machin. For this reason, Nicieza also saw little reason to communicate with Grant for feedback, and so made no overtures to Anarky's creator. Nicieza also confessed to his personal <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> communicating with Grant, given the latter's estrangement from DC Comics.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the Whig Party like his father, Harlan got an early start in politics, when in 1851, he was offered the post of {{adjutant}} general of the state by governor John L. Helm. He served in the post for the next eight years, which gave him a statewide presence and familiarity with many of Kentucky's leading political figures. With the Whig Party's dissolution in the early 1850s, Harlan shifted his affiliation to the Know Nothings, despite his <b>discomfort</b> <b>with</b> their opposition to Catholicism. Harlan's personal popularity within the state was such {{that he was able}} to survive the decline of the Know Nothing movement in the late 1850s, winning election in 1858 as the county judge for Franklin County, Kentucky. The following year, he renounced his allegiance to the Know Nothings and joined the state's Opposition Party, serving as their candidate in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat William E. Simms for the seat in Kentucky's 8th congressional district.|$|E

40|$|Lateral {{acceleration}} causes discomfort but how {{the discomfort}} {{depends on the}} frequency of acceleration or characteristics of seating is poorly understood. Using magnitude estimation, twelve male subjects rated the discomfort caused by lateral oscillation at eight frequencies (0. 2 - 1. 0 Hz) across four seating conditions (a rigid seat and a train seat, both with and without backrests). <b>Discomfort</b> increased <b>with</b> increasing frequency of lateral acceleration {{in a similar manner}} for all four seating conditions. However, at all frequencies and with both seats there was less <b>discomfort</b> when sitting <b>with</b> backrest support than without. Least discomfort occurred on the train seat with backrest and greatest discomfort on the rigid seat without backrest. Current standards predict an additive effect of backrest on vibration discomfort, but the findings show that low frequency lateral acceleration can cause less <b>discomfort</b> when sitting <b>with</b> a backrest than when sitting on the same seat without a backrest...|$|R
