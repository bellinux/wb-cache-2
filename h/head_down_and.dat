5|$|For moulting, all Portias spin a {{horizontal}} web whose diameter is {{about twice the}} spider's body length and is suspended only 1 to 4millimetres below a leaf. The spider lies <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> often slides down 20 to 30millimetres during moulting. Portias spin a similar temporary web for resting.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius {{may be able to}} use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{athletes have}} {{also used the}} Olympic stage to promote their own {{political}} agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former. During the same Olympics, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet-led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská turned her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{to the right of}} the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.|$|E

[...] "P-o-i— POISON FOR BILL JONES," [...] he ses, in a voice as if ’e couldn’t believe it.|$|R
6000|$|The Baroness {{looked at}} the family, who held their <b>heads</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> then at my lord, but this time without any dislike. She leaned {{over to him and}} said rapidly in German, [...] "I had unright when I said the Colonel was the only man of the family. Thou canst, if thou willest, Eugene." [...] To which remark my lord only bowed.|$|R
25|$|Hedberg {{suffered}} from stage fright throughout his career; he often performed in sunglasses, with his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{his hair in}} his face or his eyes closed, and sometimes stood upstage or {{with his back to}} the audience, constantly moving in place. At times, he nervously shook his microphone unconsciously.|$|E
25|$|Butt {{started in}} the Under-17s and quickly progressed through Under-19 level, {{although}} at that time he was much younger than the age limits suggest, making his senior debut for Lahore Whites in 2000 aged only 15. His talent was noticed immediately, which led to him being given {{a place in the}} Pakistan A team against England soon after. However, instead of rushing straight for the limelight of international cricket, he got his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> consolidated by playing consistently for his region and the youth teams, until the Pakistan selectors finally drafted him in 2003.|$|E
25|$|At the Olympics, {{where she}} once again faced Soviet opposition, Čáslavská {{continued}} to subtly voice her views. After {{she appeared to}} have {{won the gold medal}} on floor outright, the judging panel curiously upgraded the preliminary scores of Soviet Larisa Petrik, and declared a tie for the gold instead. All of this occurred on the heels of another very controversial judging decision that cost Čáslavská the gold on beam, instead awarding the title to Soviet rival Natalia Kuchinskaya. Clearly disheartened and angered by the politics that favored the USSR, she protested during both medal ceremonies by quietly turning her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem.|$|E

6000|$|On deck, Gunter {{and those}} who had stayed with him became curious to know what the [...] "preachin' skipper" [...] was saying, and drew near to the fore-hatch, up which the tones of his strong voice travelled. Gradually they bent their <b>heads</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> lay at {{full-length}} on the deck listening intently to every word. They noted, also, the frequent ejaculations of assent, and the aspirations of hope that escaped from the audience.|$|R

25|$|The fight {{took place}} in October 2013, Klitschko's third undefeated {{consecutive}} opponent. The bout was marred with over 160 clinches, most initiated by Klitschko, followed by several repeated roughhouse tactics throughout the match against Povetkin. This included leaning on his opponent and pushing his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> throwing Povetkin to the canvas, {{which resulted in the}} referee scoring some as knockdowns. Klitschko won by unanimous decision scoring a knockdown in round 2 from a flush jab, and 3 knockdowns in round 7 including one prompted from a big right uppercut. All 3 judges scored it 119–104 on the scorecards. Klitschko landed 139 of 417 punches (33%) and Povetkin connected on 59 of 283 (21%).|$|E
25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Song" [...] {{tells the}} story of an ex-girlfriend fondly remembered ("I knew a girl and I like her still"). It is the first of two songs which feature dreamlike-senses in the lyrics ("I'll lay my <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see what I see").

500|$|Conroy was a firm fan {{favourite}} amongst Stoke City supporters due to {{his ability}} to create something out of nothing {{as well as his}} distinctive pale skin, bright ginger hair and sideburns. He was a talented dribbler. He described himself as having [...] "the classic winger's role; a trick, then <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> go, hit the byline and cross".|$|E
500|$|The Associated Press {{has noted}} that {{contrary}} to expectations, Franken has not sought out the media spotlight: [...] "He rarely talks to the Washington press corps, has shed his comedic persona and focused on policy, working to be taken seriously." [...] In interviews he has expressed his desire to be known for a focus on constituency work, keeping his <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> working hard.|$|E
500|$|For moulting, all Portias spin a {{horizontal}} web whose diameter is {{about twice the}} spider's body length and is suspended only [...] below a leaf.

Novacek ties Adama up and begins choking him, furiously blaming his former commander for sending him {{on a mission to}} be captured and tortured by the Cylons for the past three years.|$|R
500|$|Another common behaviour, {{primarily}} seen in males, is dubbed [...] "spread arms", {{in which}} the squid will slightly tilt its body forward, <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> arms spread widely and raised above. The mantle is darkened. This behaviour is exhibited mostly when the squids are chasing or following another individual. It {{is thought to be}} a signal of reproductive arousal or aggression, similar to the [...] "zebra display" [...] behaviour of Sepioteuthis sepioidea, the [...] "intense zebra display" [...] behaviour of Sepia officinalis, and the [...] "lateral display" [...] of Loligo plei. Females will also sometimes use this display to rebuff courting males.|$|E
500|$|Fighting {{tactics are}} governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt {{informal}} tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as [...] "going for it", in which the player puts his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> just throws as many punches as he can, {{as fast as he}} can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.|$|E
500|$|During the season, Geelong coach Chris Scott praised Selwood as [...] "probably {{the toughest}} player I've ever seen...he gets {{hit in the}} head a lot...he just sees the ball and he puts his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> he goes as hard as anyone {{possibly}} could". Despite Selwood's individual efforts, the Cats finished with a 15-7 win-loss record {{at the conclusion of the}} season to finish sixth on the ladder. This represented the first time in Selwood's career that the club had not qualified with a double chance for the finals series, setting them up for an Elimination Final match against Fremantle. Despite Selwood's contribution of a game-high 28 disposals and team-high six inside-50s, the Cats were defeated by 16points and exited the finals series—the first time that the club had failed to progress beyond the first week since Selwood had begun his career.|$|E
50|$|RESPECT.FC's rules differ {{somewhat}} {{from the}} North American Unified Rules. Among {{the differences are}} the allowance of knees to the <b>head</b> of <b>downed</b> opponent <b>and</b> stomp kicks to the body, while elbows to the <b>head</b> of <b>downed</b> opponent <b>and</b> soccer kicks are prohibited. Similar to the Unified Rules, fights have 3 rounds each lasting 5 minutes. Title Fights are 5 rounds.|$|R

500|$|King {{was issued}} a three-place grid place penalty by the {{stewards}} {{for his role}} in the collision with Gasly which was served at the season's next race in Austria. He said that it was a [...] "disappointing" [...] conclusion to the race weekend and revealed that he and Gasly discussed the incident and the pair had no issue regarding the matter. Gasly said that his team had hoped for a better result in Monaco but the car's amount of performance was not the reason that his team was unable to score points. He further stated that while he was happy with the behaviour of his vehicle he was afflicted with misfortune: [...] "I put my <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> fought my way back, but when you start from so far back on the grid in Monaco scoring points is a hopeless task." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Buren's profile at the Pro Football Hall of Fame states he [...] "lined up as a halfback but played {{more like}} a fullback." [...] He had a rare {{combination}} of strength, speed, and endurance. While not as elusive or nimble as other backs, he preferred to run through tacklers instead of avoid them, and never ran out of bounds if he felt he could pick up extra yards. [...] "There's no trick," [...] {{he said of his}} running style. [...] "When I see I'm gonna be tackled I just put my <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> give 'em the shoulder." [...] He was described as a [...] "deadly tackler", hitting as hard on defense as he did when he carried the ball. His disregard for his own body led to many injuries for both himself and opposing players.|$|E
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep my <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
