40|$|In this thesis, {{absorbed power}} during {{exposure}} to vertical whole-body vibration is {{considered as a}} potential indicator of the physical stress affecting human health. The amount of vibration energy, either absorbed or exchanged between the source and body, {{may be a good}} measure of the physical stress on the body since it takes into consideration the interaction between the vibrating structure and the body as well as the relative motion between the vibrating body parts. Moreover, energy is a scalar quantity that makes it easy to add up contributions from all directions and all body segments to a single value. In order to study the energy content of the vibration transmitted to the whole body and to the different body segments, a four-degree-of-freedom linear biodynamic model used in earlier studies is chosen to represent the body. The local absorbed powers and the total power absorption under different excitations (e. g. sinusoidal excitation, random excitation, and transient excitation) are derived. On the basis of the model and of the guidance provided in ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) to relate vibration exposure with the risks of health effects, health guidance caution zones are established based on absorbed power.

40|$|A {{synthesis}} of the measured values of human male hand-arm impedance characteristics {{reported in the literature}} has been performed. The <b>driving-point</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> data of the human hand-arm grasping a vibrating handle has been compared to highlight the various similarities and differences among the data. Unexplained differences among the results of various studies, conducted independently under nominally equivalent measurement conditions, led to the exclusion of outliers from the analysis. The most probable values of impedance phase and magnitude are defined by lower and upper envelopes of the mean values of the accepted data sets. The mean of the data sets, together with the smoothened envelopes, are used to define the target and range of idealized values of theXh,YhandZhcomponents of impedance in the 10 - 1000 Hz frequency range. A pooling of results from different studies suggests that there is a small dependence of theXhcomponent of impedance magnitude on the hand grip forces. The dependence of the phase of the corresponding impedance component on the hand grip force, however, is insignificant. There is insufficient data from independent sources to establish a dependence of other components of impedance on the hand grip and thrust forces. A four-degrees-of-freedom, lumped parameter model is derived to fit the target impedance magnitude and phase values using a constrained optimization algorithm. The predicted values correlate well with the target values in the selected frequency range. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The mathematical {{model can be}} used to obtain a better insight into the mechanisms and biodynamic behavior of the SHS system. The main limitation of some previous SHS models is that they were derived to satisfy a single biodynamic response function. Such an approach may provide a reasonable fit with the function data being considered but uncertain matches with the others. The model presented in this study is based on all three types of biodynamic response functions: Seat-To-Head Transmissibility (STHT), <b>Driving-Point</b> Mechanical <b>Impedance</b> (DPMI) and Apparent Mass (APM).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop models of the hand-arm system in the three orthogonal directions (xh, yh, and zh) and to enhance the understanding of the hand vibration dynamics. A four-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) model and 5 -DOF model were used in the simulation for each direction. The <b>driving-point</b> mechanical <b>impedances</b> distributed at the fingers and palm of the hand reported in a previous study were used to determine the parameters of the models. The 5 -DOF models were generally superior to the 4 -DOF models for the simulation. Hence, as examples of applications, the 5 -DOF models were used to predict the transmissibility of a vibration-reducing glove and the vibration transmissibility on the major substructures of the hand-arm system. The model-predicted results were also compared with the experimental data reported in two other recent studies. Some reasonable agreements were observed in the comparisons, which provided some validation of the developed models. This study concluded that the 5 -DOF models are acceptable for helping to design and analyze vibrating tools and anti-vibration devices. This study also confirmed that the 5 -DOF model in the zh direction is acceptable for a coarse estimation of the biodynamic responses distributed throughout the major substructures of the hand-arm system.

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a modeling method for estimating the biodynamic responses distributed at the fingers and the palm of the hand based on the total <b>driving-point</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> of the entire hand–arm system. A five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) model with a set of constraints proposed in this study was used in the estimation. Three sets of mechanical impedance data measured at the fingers and palm of the hand were used to examine the validity of the proposed method. The estimated response distributed at the palm was consistent with the measured data even when the real part of the impedance alone was used in the modeling (coefficient of correlation, r 2 ≥ 0. 902). Better agreements between the estimated and measured responses were obtained (r 2 ≥ 0. 929) when the magnitude and phase of the total impedance or the magnitude alone were used in the modeling estimation. In each case, the estimated response distributed at the fingers was also reliably correlated with the experimental data (r 2 ≥ 0. 726) but it was not as consistent with the experimental data as that distributed at the palm. The applications of the proposed method were also demonstrated using five other sets of reported experimental data. This study also demonstrated that the modeling method may also be used to assess the quality of the experimental data in some cases. As a special application of the acceptable data identified in this study, this study also defined a 2 -DOF model for the construction of a hand–arm simulator for tool tests.

40|$|Clinical and {{epidemiological}} {{studies have shown}} that operators of hand-held power tools are prone to develop peripheral, vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal disorders collectively known as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAYS). The reported biodynamic responses of the human hand-arm to hand-transmitted vibration exhibit considerable differences, which could be partly attributed to the complexity of the hand-arm system. Furthermore, {{the vast majority of the}} hand-arm models offer limited applicability to the tools since these lack consideration of the anthropometric, anatomical and biological properties of the hand-arm system. Experimental and analytical methods are used in this dissertation research to: (i) identify sources of discrepancies in the reported hand-arm biodynamic responses to vibration; (ii) simultaneously characterize localized vibration transmission to different segments of the human hand-arm and the <b>driving-point</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> (DPMI) response under different hand-arm postures, hand forces, and excitation levels; (iii) develop biomechanical models corresponding to bent- and extended-arm postures on the basis of both the DPMI and vibration transmissibility responses; and (iv) characterize vibration power absorption (VPA) distribution of different components of the hand-arm for potential injury risks assessments. The results show that the discrepancies in the reported biodynamic responses above 500 Hz were due to acceleration measurement location, handle dynamics (handle resonant frequency and deformation) and ineffectiveness of handle inertia correction. The peaks and valleys in the DPMI magnitude correspond to resonant frequencies of the tissues/muscles and the bones/structure, respectively. On the other hand, the peaks in transmissibility magnitudes represent the resonant frequencies of both the tissues/muscles and bones/structure. Furthermore, the DPMI seems to characterize the dynamic response of the entire hand-arm system with emphasis around the driving-point, while the transmissibility responses emphasize the dynamic response of the tissues/muscles of the human hand-arm system. The VPA distributions in the forearm and upper-arm were observed to be considerably higher than those of the hand components below 100 Hz, while the VPA distribution in the fingers was greater above 100 Hz.

40|$|A {{number of}} biodynamic {{models of the}} hand-arm system have evolved {{on the basis of}} {{measured}} <b>driving-point</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> (DPMI) responses to facilitate analyses of the coupled hand-tool system [1]. The parameter identifications in such models are based upon minimization of an error function of the model and the target impedance data, which may not yield a unique solution. Consequently, a number of model structures and parameter sets could be realized that would equally satisfy the target curve. Moreover, {{the vast majority of the}} reported models exhibit acute deficiencies due to excessive static deflections of model masses, presence of a low frequency mode and very light masses in the order of 1. 2 - 4. 8 grams. The models also do not characterize the dependency of the biodynamic responses on many factors, namely the hand forces, hand-arm posture and vibration intensity. This study aims at development of a hand-arm biodynamic model with considerations of the hand forces, and both the DPMI and power absorption measures, to enhance the uniqueness of the model. Methods Two different model structures are chosen for identifying the model parameters on the basis of measured DPMI and absorbed power characteristics of the hand-arm system under zh-axis vibration over a range of hand-grip and push forces. Owing to the strong influence of the hand-handle coupling forces, the models were initially derived for fixed hand forces, namely 30 N grip and 50 N push forces, as suggested in the ISO 10068 standard [2]. The equations of motion for the model are formulated and solved to compute both the DPMI and absorbed power responses. A constrained minimization function comprising weighted errors of both the DPMI and absorbed power is formulated and solved to identify the parameters. Alternate functions corresponding to different combinations of hand forces are then applied to identify hand-force dependent model parameters. Variations in the model parameters are investigated as functions of the grip, push and coupling forces through linear regression analysis. Regression-based models are formulated for deriving the hand-handle forces dependent model parameters. The validity of the model is also examined under selected combinations of hand forces. [...|$|R

40|$|Hand-arm {{vibration}} syndrome (HAVS) {{is the term}} often used for the symptoms associated with prolonged occupational exposure to hand-arm vibration arising from hand-held power tools. The human hand and arm response to vibration has been widely investigated in terms of force-motion relationships at the hand-handle interface. Owing to the complex nature of the biological system, the reported data suggest inconsistent contributions due to various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Furthermore, the injury risk posed by exposure to hand-tool vibration is strongly related to the hand-handle contact force. This dissertation research concerns with the study of hand-handle interactions under static and dynamic grasping of different handles, and characterization of hand-arm biodynamic response to vibration. The hand-handle interactions in static grasping task were characterized for various hand force combinations through measurement of interface pressure distributions using a flexible capacitive pressure sensing grid. The pressure peaks were assessed in view of known pressure discomfort threshold and sustained pressure values. The results suggest that pressure developed in the thenar eminence, when grasping a large size handle, could exceed the discomfort threshold. The hand-forces were {{defined in terms of}} independent grip and push forces, and hand-handle coupling and contact forces. The measured data were used to propose regression models for estimating contact force and interface peak pressure from directly measurable grip and push forces {{as a function of the}} handle size. The biodynamic responses of the human hand-arm system exposed to xh- and zh-axes vibration were characterized in terms of <b>driving-point</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> and dissipated power. The experiments were designed to study the influences of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, namely handle geometry, posture, magnitude and direction of vibration and hand forces. Both biodynamic responses were found to be better correlated with the coupling force below 200 Hz, and with the contact force at higher frequencies under zh-axis of vibration. Apart from the experimental observations, the high significance of majority of the main factors was supported by multi-factor ANOVA. The effects of handle size, and push and grip forces on the biodynamic responses of the human hand-arm exposed to vibration were observed to be more significant for the extended forearm posture than that for the bent-elbow posture. The effects were far more significant for the extended arm posture, which revealed considerably higher coupling with the vibrating handle...|$|R
40|$|The goal of biodynamic {{models is}} to {{simulate}} the vibration behaviour of the human body. In combination with experimental studies biodynamical models {{can be a powerful}} tool for the analysis of the effects of vibration exposure on health [1] and comfort. This paper gives an overview {{of the state of the}} art of biodynamic whole-body vibration models of humans, addressing both numerical models and hardware dummies. Method Two approaches are distinguished, the phenomenological and the anatomical, as illustrated in Figure 1. [] Phenomenological models aim to reproduce the vibration behaviour of humans with respect to particular physical quantities, chiefly the <b>driving-point</b> <b>impedance</b> at the interface to the seat, and partly with respect to other transfer functions. Discrete systems of masses, springs, and dampers with several degrees of freedom whose topology and parameters are determined by structure- and parameter identification methods are used in the sense that the functions derived from measurements are reproduced as well as possible. This paper provides an evaluation of this methodology and defines its range of application as well as its limits...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{described}} for constructing physically realizable <b>driving-point</b> <b>impedance</b> function from measured frequency response data (i. e., magnitude and phase) on a model winding and a transformer. A unique {{feature of the}} proposed method is that it ensures the constructed rational function is always positive-real, thereby guaranteeing synthesis of a physically realizable network every time. This feature could not always be guaranteed by earlier methods. Hence, it was a limitation. The proposed method is demonstrated on a single-layer model winding and the measured terminal characteristics is converted to a lumped parameter ladder network, since this representation is naturally suited to establish a physical mapping between the actual winding and synthesized circuit. So, the need to guarantee physical realizability is evident. Proceeding further, the terminal characteristics of a 315 -kVA, 11 / 6. 9 -kV transformer is measured and a rational function representation is obtained. However, its realization as a coupled ladder network requires some more work to be done. In summary, {{it is believed that}} this proposal is a step towards providing a solution for localization of deformation in actual transformer windings...|$|E
