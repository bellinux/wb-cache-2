It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the <b>foreign</b> <b>interest</b> rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E

25|$|A {{privatisation}} {{drive that}} stalled last June resumed in April, {{when the government}} sold its stake in HBL Pakistan for $1billion. Three-quarters of bids came from foreign investors.

25|$|Another {{example is}} a company that opens a {{subsidiary}} in another country and borrows in the foreign currency to finance its operations, even though the <b>foreign</b> <b>interest</b> rate may be more expensive than in its home country: by matching the debt payments to expected revenues in the foreign currency, the parent company has reduced its foreign currency exposure. Similarly, an oil producer may expect to receive its revenues in U.S. dollars, but faces costs in a different currency; it would be applying a natural hedge if it agreed to, for example, pay bonuses to employees in U.S. dollars.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} it {{dates from the}} 7th century. A Tang Chinese monk, Yijing, wrote that he visited Srivijaya in 671 CE for six months. The earliest known inscription in which the name Srivijaya appears also dates from the 7th century in the Kedukan Bukit inscription found near Palembang, Sumatra, dated 16 June 682 CE. Between the late 7th and early 11th century, Srivijaya rose to become a hegemon in Southeast Asia. It was involved in close interactions, often rivalries, with the neighbouring Java, Kambuja and Champa. Srivijaya's main <b>foreign</b> <b>interest</b> was nurturing lucrative trade agreements with China which lasted from the Tang to the Song dynasty. Srivijaya had religious, cultural and trade links with the Buddhist Pala of Bengal, {{as well as with}} the Islamic Caliphate in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Thailand, with Buddhist and animist beliefs, {{also have a}} vast pantheon of amulets, which are still popular and in common use by most people even in the present day. The belief in magic is {{impregnated}} into Thai culture and religious beliefs and folk superstitions, and this {{is reflected in the}} fact that we can still see commonplace use of amulets and magical rituals in everyday life. Some of the more commonly known amulets are of course the Buddhist votive tablets, such as the Pra Somdej Buddha image, and guru monk coins. But Thailand has an immensely large number of magical traditions, and thousands of different types of amulet and occult charm can be found in use, ranging from the takrut scroll spell, to the necromantic Ban Neng Chin Aathan, which uses the bones or flesh of the corpse of a 'hoeng prai' ghost (a person who died unnaturally, screaming, or in other strange premature circumstances), to reanimate the spirit of the dead, to dwell within the bone as a spirit, and assist the owner to achieve their goals. The list of Thai Buddhist amulets in existence is a lifetime study in its own right, and indeed, many people devote their lives to the study of them, and collection. Thai amulets are still immensely popular both with Thai folk as well as with foreigners, and in recent years, a massive increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>interest</b> has caused the subject of Thai Buddhist amulets to become a commonly known topic around the world. Amulets can fecth prices ranging from a few dollars right up to millions of dollars for a single amulet. Due to the money that can be made with sorcery services, and with rare collector amulets of the master class, there is also a forgery market in existence, which ensures that the experts of the scene maintain a monopoly on the market. With so many fakes, experts are needed for collectors to trust for obtaining authentic amulets, and not selling them fakes.|$|E

60|$|Poland, {{from one}} cause or other, is always unquiet. The new Constitution only serves to supply that restless people with new means, at least new modes, of cherishing their {{turbulent}} disposition. The {{bottom of the}} character is the same. It is a great question, whether the joining that crown with the Electorate of Saxony will contribute most to strengthen the royal authority of Poland or to shake the ducal in Saxony. The Elector is a Catholic; the people of Saxony are, six sevenths at the very least, Protestants. He must continue a Catholic, according to the Polish law, if he accepts that crown. The pride of the Saxons, formerly flattered by having a crown {{in the house of}} their prince, though an honor which cost them dear,--the German probity, fidelity, and loyalty,--the weight of the Constitution of the Empire under the Treaty of Westphalia,--the good temper and good-nature of the princes of the House of Saxony, had formerly removed from the people all apprehension with regard to their religion, and kept them perfectly quiet, obedient, and even affectionate. The Seven Years' War made some change {{in the minds of the}} Saxons. They did not, I believe, regret the loss of what might be considered almost as the succession to the crown of Poland, the possession of which, by annexing them to a <b>foreign</b> <b>interest,</b> had often obliged them to act an arduous part, towards the support of which that <b>foreign</b> <b>interest</b> afforded no proportionable strength. In this very delicate situation of their political interests, the speculations of the French and German Economists, and the cabals, and the secret, as well as public doctrines of the Illuminatenorden, and Freemasons, have made a considerable progress in that country; and a turbulent spirit, under color of religion, but in reality arising from the French rights of man, has already shown itself, and is ready on every occasion to blaze out.|$|E
60|$|The third {{schooner}} now {{brought us}} to. This vessel sent another committee, who announced {{themselves to be}} the representatives of a party that was termed the Tangents. They were not numerous, but sufficiently so to hold the balance whenever the Horizontals and the Perpendiculars crossed each other directly at right angles, {{as was the case}} at present; and they had now determined to run a single candidate of their own. They, too, wished to fortify themselves by the <b>foreign</b> <b>interest,</b> as was natural, and had come out in quest of a proper person. I suggested the first mate; but against this Noah protested, declaring that come what would, the ship must on no account be deserted. Time pressed; and, while the captain and the subordinate were hotly disputing the propriety of permitting the latter to serve, Bob, who had already tasted the sweets of political importance, in his assumed character of prince-royal, stepped slyly up to the committee, and gave in his name. Noah was too much occupied to discover this well-managed movement; {{and by the time he}} had sworn to throw the mate overboard if he did not instantly relinquish all ambitious projects of this nature, he found that the Tangents were off. Supposing they had gone to some other vessel, the captain allowed himself to be soothed, and all went on smoothly again.|$|E

The Author appears very well qualify d for his Task, and opens a Scene of Politicks which the good natur'd part of Mankind will scarce think human Race capable of. Those that are acquainted with the Person of Major Ramkins, assure me, that the late King fames never had a more active and diligent Servant, {{and that he was}} one never wanting in his Station.

40|$|A {{two-stage}} game {{depiction of}} counterterrorism is presented, where {{the emphasis is}} on the interaction between the preemptive and defensive measures taken by two targeted countries facing a common threat.

The analysis identifies key factors - cost comparisons, <b>foreign</b> <b>interests,</b> and targeting risks - that determine counterterrorism allocations. The study shows that the market failures associated with preemptive and defensive countermeasures may be jointly ameliorated by a disadvantaged defender. Nevertheless, the subgame perfect equilibrium will still be suboptimal owing to a preemption choice that does not fully internalize the externalities. Terrorism; War - Economic aspects...|$|R
