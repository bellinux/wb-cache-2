25|$|The {{genetic code}} {{was most likely}} based on DNA. Some {{studies suggest that the}} LUCA may have lacked DNA and been defined wholly through RNA. If DNA was present, it was {{composed}} of four nucleotides (deoxyadenosine, <b>deoxycytidine,</b> deoxythymidine, and deoxyguanosine), to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including DNA topoisomerase, DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons, thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 amino acids were used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids.|$|E

50|$|The nucleosides {{cytidine}} and <b>deoxycytidine</b> can be salvaged {{along the}} uracil pathway by cytidine deaminase, which converts them to uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively.

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dCTP nucleotidohydrolase.

50|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} of antineoplastic resistance is over-expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes or carrier molecules. By increasing expression of metabolic enzymes, drugs are more rapidly converted to drug conjugates or inactive forms that can then be excreted. For example, increased expression of glutathione promotes drug resistance, as the electrophilic properties of glutathione allow it to react with cytotoxic agents, inactivating them. In some cases, decreased expression or loss of expression of drug-metabolising enzymes confers resistance, as the enzymes are needed to process a drug from an inactive form to an active form. Arabinoside, a commonly used chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphomas, is converted into cytosine arabinoside triphosphate by <b>deoxycytidine</b> kinase. Mutation of <b>deoxycytidine</b> kinase or loss of expression results in resistance to arabinoside. This {{is a form of}} enzymatic deactivation.|$|E
50|$|Mechanisms of {{resistance}} and turnover have been reported. Clofarabine-resistance arises from decreased <b>deoxycytidine</b> kinase activity in vitro. ABC transporter ABCG2 promotes export of clofarabine-5´-monophosphate and thus limits the cytotoxic {{effects of this}} analog in vivo. Biochemically, clofarabine-5’-triphosphate was shown to be substrate for SAMHD1, thus potentially limiting the amount of active compound in cells.|$|E
5000|$|Cytarabine {{is often}} given by {{continuous}} intravenous infusion, which follows a biphasic elimination - initial fast clearance rate {{followed by a}} slower rate of the analog. [...] Cytarabine is transported into the cell primarily by hENT-1. It is then monophosphorylated by <b>deoxycytidine</b> kinase and eventually cytarabine-5´-triphosphate, which is the active metabolite being incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:CMP phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include: deoxycytidylate kinase, deoxycytidylate kinase, CMP kinase, CTP:CMP phosphotransferase, dCMP kinase, <b>deoxycytidine</b> monophosphokinase, UMP-CMP kinase, ATP:UMP-CMP phosphotransferase, and pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase. This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism.|$|E
5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, {{specifically}} in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cytidine/2'-deoxycytidine aminohydrolase. This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism. As every <b>deoxycytidine</b> deaminase is also a cytidine deaminase, they share the same EC number. The recommended name assigned by the IUBMB is cytidine deaminase.|$|E
50|$|Pol ζ another B family polymerase, {{is made of}} two {{subunits}} Rev3, the catalytic subunit, and Rev7, {{which increases}} the catalytic function of the polymerase, and is involved in translesion synthesis. Pol ζ lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, is unique in that it can extend primers with terminal mismatches. Rev1 has three regions {{of interest in the}} BRCT domain, ubiquitin-binding domain, and C-terminal domain and has dCMP transferase ability, which adds <b>deoxycytidine</b> opposite lesions that would stall replicative polymerases Pol δ and Pol ε. These stalled polymerases activate ubiquitin complexes that in turn disassociate replication polymerases and recruit Pol ζ and Rev1. Together Pol ζ and Rev1 add <b>deoxycytidine</b> and Pol ζ extends past the lesion. Through a yet undetermined process, Pol ζ disassociates and replication polymerases reassociate and continue replication. Pol ζ and Rev1 are not required for replication, but loss of REV3 gene in budding yeast can cause increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents due to collapse of replication forks where replication polymerases have stalled.|$|E
50|$|Elvucitabine is a <b>deoxycytidine</b> {{analogue}} {{with activity}} against HIV resistant to several other nucleoside analogues, including zidovudine and lamivudine. This {{is partly because}} of high intracellular levels of its triphosphate metabolite reached in cells. Clinical trials of elvucitabine are on hold, because it has shown bone marrow suppression in some patients, with CD4+ cell numbers dropping as early as two days after initiation of dosing.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes a {{deoxyribonucleoside}} kinase {{that specifically}} phosphorylates thymidine, <b>deoxycytidine,</b> and deoxyuridine. The encoded enzyme localizes to the mitochondria and {{is required for}} mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Mutations in this gene {{are associated with a}} myopathic form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms, some of which lack transit peptide, so are not localized to mitochondria.|$|E
50|$|Apricitabine is a <b>deoxycytidine</b> analogue. It is {{structurally}} {{related to}} lamivudine where {{the positions of}} the oxygen and the sulfur are essentially reversed. Even though apricitabine is a little less potent in vitro compared to some other NRTIs, it maintains its activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 variants with NRTI resistance mutations. Apricitabine is in the final stage of clinical development for the treatment of NRTI-experienced patients.|$|E
50|$|Dideoxy{{nucleoside}}s are analogues of nucleoside {{where the}} sugar ring lacks both 2´ and 3´-hydroxyl groups. Three {{years after the}} synthesis of zidovudine, Jerome Horwitz and his colleagues in Chicago prepared another dideoxynucleoside now known as zalcitabine (ddC). Zalcitabine is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue, structurally related to <b>deoxycytidine,</b> in which the 3´-hydroxyl group of the ribose sugar moiety is substituted with hydrogen. Zalcitabine {{was approved by the}} FDA for the treatmentof HIV-1 in June 1992.|$|E
5000|$|The terms ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP {{refer to}} those {{nucleoside}} triphosphates that contain ribose. The nucleoside triphosphates containing deoxyribose are called dNTPs, {{and take the}} prefix deoxy- in their names and small d- in their abbreviations: deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), <b>deoxycytidine</b> triphosphate (dCTP), deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). The dNTPs are the building blocks for DNA replication (they lose two of the phosphate groups {{in the process of}} incorporation).|$|E
50|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, the phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides {{is mediated}} predominantly by two deoxyribonucleoside kinases, cytosolic <b>deoxycytidine</b> kinase and mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase. The protein encoded by this gene {{is responsible for}} phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in the mitochondrial matrix. In addition, this protein phosphorylates several purine deoxyribonucleoside analogs used {{in the treatment of}} lymphoproliferative disorders, and this phosphorylation is critical for the effectiveness of the analogs. Alternative splice variants encoding different protein isoforms have been described for this gene.|$|E
5000|$|Thymidine {{phosphorylase}} catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of thymidine, deoxyuridine, {{and their}} analogs (except <b>deoxycytidine)</b> {{to their respective}} bases (thymine/uracil) and 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate. The enzyme follows a sequential mechanism, where phosphate binds before thymidine (or deoxyuridine, etc.) and 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate leaves after the nitrogenous base. The thymidine is bound in a high-energy conformation, in which the glycosidic bond weakens as the phosphate attacks the C1 position of the ribose ring, as shown below. The enzyme can then transfer deoxyribose 1-phosphate to other nitrogenous bases.|$|E
