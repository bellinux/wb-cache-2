In the 2014 remake however, the option to save is available at all times, the skip function is retained, and text is no longer highlighted.

5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series.

The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always played by the same two actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous <b>dialogue</b> <b>and</b> contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based it on the long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E
