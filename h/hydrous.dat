5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with <b>hydrous</b> sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in <b>hydrous</b> minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E
5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown <b>hydrous</b> iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
25|$|A 15% <b>hydrous</b> ethanol and 85% {{gasoline}} blend, hE15, {{has been}} introduced at public gas stations in the Netherlands since 2008. Ethanol fuel specifications worldwide traditionally dictate use of anhydrous ethanol (less than 1% water) for gasoline blending. This results in additional costs, energy usage and environmental impacts associated with the extra processing step required to dehydrate the <b>hydrous</b> ethanol produced via distillation (3.5-4.9 vol.% water) to meet the current anhydrous ethanol specifications. A patented discovery reveals <b>hydrous</b> ethanol can be effectively used in most ethanol/gasoline blending applications.|$|E
25|$|Overall, a {{transition}} from anhydrous to <b>hydrous</b> ethanol for gasoline blending {{is expected to make}} a significant contribution to ethanol's cost-competitiveness, fuel cycle net energy balance, air quality, and greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|Microwave ovens have {{a limited}} role in {{professional}} cooking, because the boiling-range temperatures produced in especially <b>hydrous</b> foods impede flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking.

25|$|Minerals such as gaspeite, hellyerite, otwayite, widgiemoolthalite {{and related}} <b>hydrous</b> nickel carbonates are {{diagnostic}} of nickel gossans, but are exceedingly rare.

25|$|According to the Brazilian ANP specification, <b>hydrous</b> ethanol {{contains}} up to 4.9 vol.% water. In hE15, {{this would}} be up to 0.74 vol.% water in the overall mixture. Japanese and German scientific evidence revealed the water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The H isotope {{composition}} of mantle rocks {{on earth is}} highly variable, and that of mantle water is around -80‰ ~ -50‰ depending on its states such as fluid, <b>hydrous</b> phase, hydroxyl point defect, Juvenile water (from degassing of the mantle), magmatic water (water equilibrated with a magma).|$|E
25|$|Nalbuphine is also {{available}} in a sulfite and paraben-free formulation in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride per mL.

25|$|Vermiculite is a <b>hydrous</b> {{phyllosilicate}} mineral. It undergoes significant expansion when heated. Exfoliation {{occurs when}} the mineral is heated sufficiently, and the effect is routinely produced in commercial furnaces.

25|$|Nakhla is {{the first}} Martian {{meteorite}} {{to show signs of}} aqueous processes on Mars. The rock contains carbonates and <b>hydrous</b> minerals, formed by chemical reactions in water. In addition, the rock was exposed to water after it formed, which caused secondary accumulations of minerals. The carbonates contain more 13C than rocks formed on Earth, indicating Martian origin.|$|E
25|$|Jamaica {{produces}} enormous {{quantities of}} drinking alcohol (at least 5% water content), {{most of which}} appears to be consumed as beverages, and none of it used as motor fuel. Facilities exist to refine <b>hydrous</b> ethanol feedstock into anhydrous ethanol (0% water content), but as of 2007, the process appeared to be uneconomic and the production plant was idle.|$|E
25|$|The first {{commercial}} vehicle capable of running on pure ethanol was the Ford Model T, produced from 1908 through 1927. It was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of gasoline or ethanol, {{or a combination of}} both. At that time, other car manufacturers also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Thereafter, and {{as a response to the}} 1973 and 1979 energy crises, the first modern vehicle capable of running with pure <b>hydrous</b> ethanol (E100) was launched in the Brazilian market, the Fiat 147, after testing with several prototypes developed by the Brazilian subsidiaries of Fiat, Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford. , there were 1.1 million neat ethanol vehicles still in use in Brazil. Since 2003, Brazilian newer flex-fuel vehicles are capable of running on pure <b>hydrous</b> ethanol (E100) or blended with any combination of E20 to E27,5 gasoline (a mixture made with anhydrous ethanol), the national mandatory blend. , there were 17.1 million flexible-fuel vehicles running on Brazilian roads.|$|E
25|$|E100 is pure ethanol fuel. Straight <b>hydrous</b> ethanol as an {{automotive}} fuel {{has been widely}} used in Brazil since the late 1970s for neat ethanol vehicles and more recently for flexible-fuel vehicles. The ethanol fuel used in Brazil is distilled close to the azeotrope mixture of 95.63% ethanol and 4.37% water (by weight) which is approximately 3.5% water by volume.|$|E
25|$|Superheated {{water can}} be used to {{chemically}} convert organic material into fuel products. This is known by several terms, including direct hydrothermal liquefaction, and <b>hydrous</b> pyrolysis. A few commercial scale applications exist. Thermal depolymerization or thermal conversion (TCC) uses superheated water at about 250°C to convert turkey waste into a light fuel oil and is said to process 200 tons of low grade waste into fuel oil a day.|$|E
25|$|Several common ethanol fuel {{mixtures}} are in use {{around the}} world. The use of pure <b>hydrous</b> or anhydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines (ICEs) is only possible if the engines are {{designed or modified}} for that purpose, and used only in automobiles, light-duty trucks and motorcycles. Anhydrous ethanol can be blended with gasoline (petrol) for use in gasoline engines, but with high ethanol content only after minor engine modifications.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{depolymerization}} (TDP) is a depolymerization process using <b>hydrous</b> pyrolysis for {{the reduction}} of complex organic materials (usually waste products of various sorts, often biomass and plastic) into light crude oil. It mimics the natural geological processes thought {{to be involved in}} the production of fossil fuels. Under pressure and heat, long chain polymers of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon decompose into short-chain petroleum hydrocarbons with a maximum length of around 18 carbons.|$|E
25|$|The sulfate {{minerals}} all {{contain the}} sulfate anion, 2−. They {{tend to be}} transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile. Sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters; alternative, sulfates {{can also be found}} in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides, or as oxidation products of sulfides. Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and <b>hydrous</b> minerals. The most common <b>hydrous</b> sulfate by far is gypsum, CaSO4⋅2H2O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form desert roses. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO4, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include barite (BaSO4), celestine (SrSO4), and anglesite (PbSO4); anhydrite {{is not part of the}} barite group, as the smaller Ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination.|$|E
25|$|Nalbuphine is a semi-synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist {{analgesic}} of the phenanthrene series. It is chemically {{related to the}} widely used opioid antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, and the potent opioid analgesic, oxymorphone. It is available in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride per mL. Both strengths contain 0.94% sodium citrate <b>hydrous,</b> 1.26% citric acid anhydrous, 0.1% sodium metabisulfite, and 0.2% of a 9:1 mixture of methylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives; pH is adjusted, if necessary, with hydrochloric acid.

25|$|A planet cannot have a hydrosphere—a key {{ingredient}} {{for the formation}} of carbon-based life—unless there is a source for water within its stellar system. The origin of water on Earth is still not completely understood; possible sources include the result of impacts with icy bodies, outgassing, mineralization, leakage from <b>hydrous</b> minerals from the lithosphere, and photolysis. For an extrasolar system, an icy body from beyond the frost line could migrate into the habitable zone of its star, creating an ocean planet with seas hundreds of kilometers deep such as GJ 1214 b or Kepler-22b may be.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest single}} use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive. Brazil in {{particular}} relies heavily upon {{the use of}} ethanol as an engine fuel, {{due in part to}} its role as the globe's leading producer of ethanol. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% anhydrous ethanol. <b>Hydrous</b> ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country. Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration. The US and many other countries primarily use E10 (10% ethanol, sometimes known as gasohol) and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of using water isotope depletion with elevation to reconstruct paleoaltimetry was demonstrated {{as early as}} the late 1960s, when Caltech geochemist Samuel Epstein tried to collect rainwater at different elevations in a single storm. The δ18O and δD lapse rates vary within -1 to -5‰/km and -10 to -40‰/km respectively, but can vary with locations and seasons, and are not exactly linear with altitude. One of the first studies in stable isotope paleoaltimetry demonstrated a meteoric water δD signature of -90 to -139‰ in fluid inclusions in quartz and adularia in an epithermal gold-silver deposit in Nevada, and suggested the applicability of stable isotopes in reconstruction of ancient topography in the Great Basin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of <b>hydrous</b> silicate minerals have since then been used to reconstruct topographic histories in mountain ranges across the world, including the North American Cordillera, the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, the European Alps, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. Lab experiments with clay minerals have shown that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions are relatively resistant to alteration at moderate temperature (<100nbsp&°C), and can preserve the original meteoric water signal. One important effect of mountain ranges on rainfall stable isotopes is the rain shadow effect, in which an isotopic depletion happens in precipitation on the leeward side compared to the windward side. A change in the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation on the two sides of a mountain can be used to infer the magnitude of the rain shadow effect. In one such study, an isotope enrichment was observed in smectite {{on the east side of}} the Sierra Nevada in California from mid-Miocene to late Pliocene, suggesting a decrease in elevation during this period. Another study found δD values around -140‰ in muscovite in the North America Cordillera during the early Eocene, which would suggest an elevation 1000m higher than today at the time. In addition to <b>hydrous</b> minerals, hydrogen isotopes in biomarkers such as leaf waxes have also been developed for paleoaltimetry studies. The δD lapse rate in leaf waxes (-21‰/km) falls in the range of meteoric water observations. As an example study, leaf wax δD data have been used to confirm <b>hydrous</b> mineral paleoaltimetry for the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada during the Eocene.|$|E
25|$|TTGs are an {{aggregation}} {{of certain}} rocks (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite), that form when <b>hydrous,</b> mafic crust is melted at high pressure. These rocks {{are critical to}} the formation of Archean greenstone complexes due to the low density, intrusive nature of the rocks. TTGs are found in other Archean greenstone belts such as Isua and Barberton. The processes that form TTGs are debated. Some authors attribute TTG formation to subduction activity, while others attribute the origin of these melts to the direct melting of the lithosphere by mantle plumes. The debate of the origin of the TTGs is a key topic in the debate of when plate tectonics began.|$|E
25|$|Flexible fuel {{vehicles}} {{are designed to}} operate smoothly using {{a wide range of}} available ethanol fuel mixtures—from pure gasoline to bioethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) or E100 (neat <b>hydrous</b> ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive {{to a wide range of}} consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding. Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier, Ford EcoSport, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford Ka.|$|E
25|$|Honda's Brazilian {{subsidiary}} launched flexible-fuel versions for the Honda Civic and Honda Fit in late 2006. As other Brazilian flex-fuel vehicles, {{these models}} run on any blend of <b>hydrous</b> ethanol (E100) and E20-E25 gasoline. Initially, {{and in order}} to test the market preferences, the carmaker decided to produce a limited share of the vehicles with flex-fuel engines, 33 percent of the Civic production and 28 percent of the Fit models. Also, the sale price for the flex-fuel version was higher than the respective gasoline versions, around US$1,000 premium for the Civic, and US$650 for the Fit, despite the fact that all other flex-fuel vehicles sold in Brazil had the same tag price as their gasoline versions. In July 2009, Honda launched in the Brazilian market its third flexible-fuel car, the Honda City.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} rock {{composition}} {{most responsible for}} the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800°C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500°C in the absence of water.O on mantle wedge melting. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 249, p. 74-89 Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. <b>Hydrous</b> magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, {{an important part of the}} continental crust.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{approach}} to study the alteration of D/H ratios of kerogen during catagenesis: 1)laboratory incubation of organic matter that enables mechanistic study with controlled experiments. 2)natural sample measurement that provides information of combined effects over geological timescales. The complex composition and chemistry of kerogen complicates the results. Nevertheless, most research on hydrogen isotopes of kerogen show D enrichment with increasing maturity. Type II kerogen(marine derived) from New Albany Shale is reported to have δD rise from -120‰ to -70‰ as vitrinite reflectance increase from 0.3% to 1.5%. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for enrichment. One of them is kinetic fractionation during hydrocarbon generation while the other is isotopic exchange with surrounding water. Anhydrous incubation experiments have shown that the products are generally more depleted in D than their precursors, causing enrichment in residual kerogen. Schimmelmann et al. studied the relationship between terrestrially-derived oil and their source rock kerogens from four Australian Basins. They found that on average the oil is depleted to corresponding kerogen by 23‰. <b>Hydrous</b> incubation experiments suggest that 36-79% of bulk organic hydrogen may come from water at moderate maturity. While still under debate, it appears likely that incorporation of water hydrogen isotopes is the more dominant process for kerogen D- enrichment during catagenesis.|$|E

500|$|Since 1975, {{and as a}} {{response}} to the shock caused by the first oil crisis, the Brazilian government implemented the National Alcohol Program -Pró-Álcool- (...) , a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automotive fuels derived from fossil fuels in favor of ethanol made from sugar cane.

After reaching more than 4 million cars and light trucks running on pure ethanol by the late 1980s, the use of E100-only vehicles sharply declined after increases in sugar prices produced shortages of ethanol fuel.|$|E
500|$|Amalthea's {{irregular}} {{shape and}} large size led {{in the past}} to a conclusion that it is a fairly strong, rigid body, where it was argued that a body composed of ices or other weak materials would have been pulled into a more spherical shape by its own gravity. However, on 5 November 2002, the Galileo orbiter made a targeted flyby that came within 160km of Amalthea and the deflection of its orbit was used to compute the moon's mass (its volume had been calculated previously—to within 10% or so—from a careful analysis of all extant images).
