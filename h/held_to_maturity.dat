Correlation of Azam showed that days to silking with days to anthesis; days <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> with days <b>to</b> anthesis and days to silking observed highly significant while days <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> with anthesis <b>to</b> silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. Correlations of Pahari showed that days to silking with days to anthesis; days <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> with days <b>to</b> anthesis and days to silking; grain yield with days <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> observed highly significant but grain yield with days to anthesis and days to silking observed significant difference. Correlation analysis of Iqbal showed that days to silking with days to anthesis; days <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> with days <b>to</b> anthesis and days to silking showed highly significant while anthesis to silking interval (ASI) with days to silking and days <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> with anthesis <b>to</b> silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference.
