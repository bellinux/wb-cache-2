The instrument relies on Linear Variable <b>Differential</b> <b>Transformers</b> by exploiting the three-parameter sine fit {{to estimate the}} amplitudes of their secondary signals.

40|$|ABSTRACT Power {{transformers}} are {{key components}} for electrical energy transfer {{in a power}} system. Stability and security of transformer protection are important to system operation. Many maloperation cases of <b>transformer</b> <b>differential</b> protection are caused by inrush current problems. The phenomenon of transformer inrush current has been widely discussed in literature. Therefore, this research only discussed and analyzed inrush current problems to <b>transformer</b> <b>differential</b> protection. To understand the inrush current problems on <b>differential</b> protection, <b>transformer</b> simulation models were presented using Matlab/Simulink.

A cylindrical ferromagnetic core, attached to the object whose position is to be measured, slides along the axis of the tube. An alternating current drives the primary and causes a voltage to be induced in each secondary proportional to the length of the core linking to the secondary. The frequency is usually in the range 1 to 10 kHz.|$|E

50|$|A {{circular}} sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was {{cut from}} the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank {{was placed on the}} die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable <b>differential</b> <b>transformer</b> (LVDT), fitted {{at the bottom of the}} die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 °C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 °C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa. As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and thinning factor. Post deformation micro-structural studies were conducted on the formed components in order to analyze the microstructure in terms of grain growth, grain elongation, cavitations, etc.|$|E

40|$|A good primary {{stability}} of cementless femoral stems {{is essential for}} the long-term success of total hip arthroplasty. Experimental measurement of implant micromotion with linear variable <b>differential</b> <b>transformers</b> is commonly used to assess implant primary stability in pre-clinical testing. But these measurements are often limited to a few distinct points at the interface. New techniques based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) have recently been introduced, such as Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) or markers-based approaches. DVC is however limited to measurement around non-metallic implants due to metal-induced imaging artifacts, and markers-based techniques are confined to {{a small portion of the}} implant. In this paper, we present a technique based on micro-CT imaging and radiopaque markers to provide the first full-field micromotion measurement at the entire bone-implant interface of a cementless femoral stem implanted in a cadaveric femur. Micromotion was measured during compression and torsion. Over 300 simultaneous measurement points were obtained. Micromotion amplitude ranged from 0 to 24 µm in compression and from 0 to 49 µm in torsion. Peak micromotion was distal in compression and proximal in torsion. The technique bias was 5. 1 µm and its repeatability standard deviation was 4 µm. The method was thus highly reliable and compared well with results obtained with linear variable <b>differential</b> <b>transformers</b> (LVDTs) reported in the literature. These results indicate that this micro-CT based technique is perfectly relevant to observe local variations in primary stability around metallic implants. Possible applications include pre-clinical testing of implants and validation of patient-specific models for pre-operative planning...|$|R
5000|$|After {{completion}} of the new wood tower, which was 156 metres high without the arms carrying the antenna 156 (with these arms its height amounted to 163 metres), the second wood tower was dismantled and rebuilt in 1935 at Nuremberg-Kleinreuth, where it served until 1961 as a transmission tower for medium wave. The wood tower at Ismaning carried a dipole antenna, whose point of feeding was at 120 metres height. From this point of feeding, several wires ran to the arms on the tower top and to fastening spots at a height of 80 metres. At this height a <b>differential</b> <b>transformer</b> was installed in a small housing inside the tower; its task was to prevent the drain of the radiated high frequency over the feeder. This antenna, developed by the company Lorenz, was called [...] "Höhendipol". It was one for the transmitter frequency of 740 kHz, which was used from 1934 to 1950, optimized fading-reducing transmitting antenna. However, according to the wave plan of Copenhagen, which required directional radiation at night times, {{it could only be}} used during daylight hours after 1950.In 1969 this antenna was dismantled after a new medium wave transmitting mast was built. Between 1969 and 1977 the wood tower was used for carrying transmitting antennas for FM broadcasting. In 1977 a 100-metre-high guyed steel framework mast took over this function, so the wood tower became defunct in 1977.The state of the tower worsened more and more after 1977, and it seemed to be impossible to repair this tower, which was nicknamed [...] "Bavarian Eiffel Tower," [...] and which was already under protection as a monument.On March 16, 1983 it was blown up.Its concrete foundations and the tuning house, which once stood under the tower, can still be seen today.|$|E
