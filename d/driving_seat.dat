25|$|There {{were signs}} {{at this stage}} that Larry Perkins was {{thinking}} about life outside of the drivers seat, with rumours at season end that Steven Richards would be moving from Ford Tickford Racing to Perkins Engineering, to replace Larry in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> of the #11 car.|$|E
25|$|In a BBC {{television}} documentary broadcast, {{relatives of the}} victims and survivors of the incident maintained {{that they had been}} told by a Crown Office official in one to one meetings that Clarke's prior blackout happened in a canteen, instead the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> of a bus, and that his obesity and lack of intelligence were major factors in not charging him.|$|E
25|$|The replayed {{match was}} as {{entertaining}} as its predecessor {{in the first}} half, but two rash sendings off by the referee, of Peter Canavan (who had only came on the pitch as a substitute two minutes prior), and Stephen O'Neill (for a second yellow card) put Armagh in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat.</b> Armagh won the match by two points, 0–13 to 0–11.|$|E

25|$|The GX model {{could only}} be {{differentiated}} on the exterior by its grille, wipers and badges, although the interior gained luxuries such as cloth inserts for the vinyl upholstery and a three-way adjustable <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> (fore/aft, recline, thigh support). A GX wagon followed in June 1975, followed by a minor trim and grille facelift in 1976. The 180B proved popular right to its discontinuation in October 1977, when the P810 200B range arrived in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a hexagonal socket on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Test, England made a tortuous 133 in 115 four-ball overs, with George 'Joey' Palmer taking 7 for 68. By close of {{play on the}} first day, Australia were in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> at 86 for 1. Whilst England {{recovered}} to dismiss them for 197 and then made 232 themselves, they {{were never going to}} stop Australia getting the 169 runs they needed to win. The third Test was even more one-sided. England got 188. Then Australia made 262, with Percy McDonnell making 147, Alec Bannerman 70, and no other batsman scoring more than 7! England again collapsed to 134, and Australia won by 6 wickets.|$|E

25|$|Safety {{levels of}} the technology, the thought of abandoning control to a machine, and {{psychological}} comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially. The commuters also stated {{that they did not}} want to see everything the car was doing. This was primarily a referral to the auto-steering wheel with no one sitting in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat.</b> Intel also learnt that voice control regulator is vital, and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition, and brings some sense of control back. It is important to mention that Intel included only 10 people in this study, which makes the study less credible. In a video posted on YouTube, Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing.|$|E
25|$|The goals {{kept coming}} {{at the start}} of April, as Gary McSwegan grabbed 4 goals in a 6–1 win over Dumbarton at Tannadice. Since that 1–0 defeat at Boghead six months previously, United had scored 17 goals against Dumbarton in 3 games. Just as United looked to be running away with the league, they lost another {{important}} three points with a 1–0 defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. a 2–0 victory away to Hamilton put United back in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat,</b> and with two games left, United had to play their two nearest challengers. With a one-point advantage, United faced Dunfermline at Tannadice, and with a crowd of 12,000 turning up expecting to see United clinch the title, Dunfermline left with a 1–0 win. That defeat left United two points behind Dunfermline, and the final game of the season was against third-placed Morton. In front of over 12,000, United managed a 2–2 draw to pip Morton to 2nd place on goal difference and secure the play-off place.|$|E
25|$|At the Belgian Grand Prix, a {{qualifying}} session held {{in mixed}} weather conditions and grid penalties for three drivers allowed {{the team to}} claim its best grid positions of the season, as Senna took 18th, one position ahead of Yamamoto. In the race, however, Senna retired early after suffering a suspension failure which caused him to spin, whilst Yamamoto finished, albeit a place lower than he had started. The Italian Grand Prix that followed {{was held at the}} high-speed Monza circuit, where the F110 was particularly disadvantaged by the team's lack of a low-downforce aerodynamic package. The drivers qualified slowest, with Senna again ahead, and were then elevated a position each when Glock received a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. In the race, Senna was another early retirement with a failure in his car's hydraulic system, whilst Yamamoto extended his run of finishes with a 19thplace, ahead of Di Grassi, who retired with three laps to go but was classified as a finisher. Yamamoto struck one of his mechanics as he pulled away from his mid-race pit stop, but the man was not seriously injured. During preparation for the Singapore Grand Prix, the team announced that Yamamoto was to be replaced by Klien for the weekend because he was suffering from food poisoning, although several journalists noticed a seemingly healthy Yamamoto in the paddock, indicating that he had been dropped for sponsorship reasons instead. In his first competitive outing since the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, Klien outqualified Senna by more than a second; both Hispania cars lined up ahead of Felipe Massa's Ferrari on the grid, as he had failed to set a time during the session. In the race, Klien ran ahead of Senna until Senna collected the crashed Sauber of Kobayashi, who lost control in front of him, on his 30thlap. Klien retired two laps later when his F110's hydraulics failed. Yamamoto returned to the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> for his home race in Japan; he qualified a tenth of a second behind Senna on the back row of the grid. In the race, Senna made a pit stop on the first lap, along with several other drivers, in response to a safety-car period caused by two first-lap accidents. Yamamoto, meanwhile, remained on track, keeping Trulli and Glock behind him for until lap15 and his own stop on lap31 respectively, whereupon he dropped behind Senna. The two drivers achieved a double finish, with Senna in 15thposition and Yamamoto in 16th, despite the latter suffering from fuel pressure problems.|$|E

500|$|Sam Wollaston of The Guardian {{received}} the series positively, writing: [...] "Holby City has {{everything you want}} from a hospital drama: good–looking staff, a bit of love interest, a dishy doc, the odd current issue (no beds, badly–paid nurses) and bits {{where you have to}} look away", deeming it: [...] "Pretty good, really." [...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat,</b> Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United {{started their}} {{campaign}} {{to win an}} unprecedented third straight title at White Hart Lane — Teddy Sheringham's former stomping ground. An hour into his debut presented him {{with a chance to}} score from a dubious penalty, but he hit the post and blasted the rebound wide. What seemed like a pulsating draw turned out to be business as usual for the champions, who scored twice in the last ten minutes from a Nicky Butt strike and an own goal by hapless defender Ramon Vega. David Beckham came off the bench to grab the winner against Southampton to ensure United remained in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> and despite a lacklustre goalless draw to Leicester at Filbert Street, they managed a third straight clean sheet. Beckham kept up his ever-improving goal-scoring record while Sheringham poached his first goal for the club as Ferguson's all-conquering United dismantled Everton at Goodison Park. At home to Coventry, Andy Cole marked his return from minor surgery with a goal inside 73 seconds that left goalkeeper, Steve Ogrizovic completely bamboozled. Keane and Poborský added to the rout, which Ferguson and Coventry boss Gordon Strachan mutually agreed was a [...] "flattering scoreline". The champions set the benchmark in August with five straight clean sheets and eight goals leaving them joint top with Blackburn Rovers. In such commanding form, pundits alike reckoned that {{it was a matter of}} time before they would resume their domestic supremacy.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{consecutive}} All-Ireland final appearance beckoned for Dublin in 1921; however, {{on this occasion}} it was Limerick, the champions of 1918, who provided the opposition. The reigning champions proved {{no match for the}} Munster men, with captain Bob McConkey scoring four goals to put his team in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] The final score of 8-5 to 3-2 gave Limerick a second All-Ireland title in four years. [...] The 1921 championship marked the first occasion that the Liam MacCarthy Cup was presented to the winning captain.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 December 2014 a bin lorry {{collided}} with pedestrians {{in the city}} centre of Glasgow, Scotland, killing six and injuring fifteen others. The driver of the council-owned vehicle, Harry Clarke, said he had passed out at the wheel. A similar blackout {{had happened to him}} in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> of a bus, although he had not disclosed the incident on his heavy goods vehicle licence renewal [...] application, despite such self-reporting being mandatory. Clarke was officially told he would not face further prosecution, effectively giving him immunity over the deaths and causing protests from victims' families at the way the case had been handled. In October 2015 it was reported that Clarke had been arrested on suspicion of driving without a licence in September 2015.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971 ‘the Cats’ {{reclaimed}} the Leinster {{title from}} Wexford and booked {{their place in}} the All-Ireland final. [...] Fierce rivals Tipperary provided the opposition in one of the great All-Ireland finals of the decade. [...] The game was notable as it was the first All-Ireland final to be broadcast in colour by Telefís Éireann. [...] Tipperary relied on two freak goals to put them in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat,</b> one of which passed through Ollie Walsh’s legs. [...] Kilkenny’s Eddie Keher surpassed his own record by scoring 2-11, in spite of ending up on the losing side. [...] The game is also memorable for the fact that Michael ‘Babs’ Keating discarded his boots and socks and played out the last period of the game in his bare feet. [...] The final score of 5-17 to 5-14 gave Tipperary a merited victory and allowed the team to go top of the all-time roll of honour. [...] Furthermore, Tipp wouldn’t win another All-Ireland title for eighteen years.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, he {{made the}} {{modestly}} successful Kingdom of Heaven, a film about the Crusades. The film starred Orlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer Harry Gregson-Williams. The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes. Unhappy with the theatrical version of Kingdom of Heaven (which he blamed on paying {{too much attention to}} the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006. The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven has been met with critical acclaim, with Empire magazine calling the film an [...] "epic", adding: [...] "The added 45 minutes in the director’s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle." [...] "This is the one that should have gone out" [...] reflected Scott. Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: [...] "It depends who's in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat.</b> If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version {{to go out into the}} cinema." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1965 saw Clay Regazzoni {{behind the}} wheel of an open-wheeled car for the first time, as he entered the European Formula Three {{championship}} with a Brabham. This first season brought moderate success, and improving form during 1966 (this time driving a De Tomaso) brought him to the attention of ambitious Italian constructor Tecno. Tecno offered Regazzoni the use of one of their F3 chassis for 1967, where his reliable, fast performances earned him the offer of a works Tecno drive in Formula Two for the following year. Despite this, Regazzoni continued to drive in Formula Three events during 1968 and, not for the last time, was lucky to survive a major accident. Exiting the chicane during the Monaco Grand Prix Formula 3 support race, Regazzoni lost control of his car and collided heavily with the crash barrier. The diminutive size of the Formula 3 machine allowed it to pass under the rail, the sharp metal edge of the Armco slicing {{across the top of the}} open cockpit. Regazzoni managed to duck down low enough in the <b>driving</b> <b>seat</b> for the rail to pass above him, missing his head by a tiny margin. The car eventually came to a halt when the roll hoop, behind Regazzoni's head and significantly lower than the top of his helmet, wedged itself underneath the barrier.|$|E
