40|$|Abstract: In animal-response grazing trials {{there are}} sources of {{uncertainty}} in one-period one-off measurements, which as partial factorisation over time, become traceable and quantifiable sources {{of variation in}} repeat measurement trials. This is illustrated for a trial comparing sheep and goat live-weight gains under two stocking rates on mixed species pastures established by three contrasting sowing methods. It used variable plot size to give uniform animal numbers and tracked changes in <b>individual</b> <b>animal</b> performance and pasture growth in different periods. It was repeated on the same plots and animals over 17 grazing cycles. The variation explainable was greater with growth rates expressed as percent live-weight increase per day, than as weight or metabolic weight increase per day. The base data sets were adjusted for specific weighing-day effects of estimated gut-fill using moving averages, and <b>for</b> calibration <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> <b>animal</b> effects by genotype/environment analysis. Collectively these significantly increased the proportion explainable by 3. 1 - 3. 8 % in variance analyses using qualitative treatment variables, and 2. 7 - 3. 7 % in response function analyses relative to measured climate, pasture, plot and collective animal covariates. Simulation studies, to allow for variability in the independent variables {{as well as the}} dependent variables, indicated that the proportion explainable could increase by a further 0 - 1. 2 % and 1. 1 - 1. 9 % respectively for the variance or response function approaches...|$|R

In a panel of 344 individuals representing 11 pig breeds (European, Chinese, and North American), a total of 32 alleles were observed, and the overall breeds' calculated PIC (polymorphism information content), HE (heterozygosity), and NE (effective allele number) were 0. 94, 0. 94, and 16. 41.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} designing farming systems for low input conditions. By focusing {{on the problem of}} feed (=resource) allocation in livestock systems it provides clues for the design of alternative agricultural systems and systems in general. Linear programming (LP) is used to examine system behaviour under conditions of varying feed resource qualities, <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> <b>animal</b> production levels that range from 0. 75 to 3. 00 times maintenance. Milk yield, animal numbers and amounts of feed offered or refused are measures of system performance in two hypothetical Cases representative for actual farming systems. Case 1 considers available feed as one aggregated resource, with an average nutritive value ranging from that of straw to that of high quality forage. It establishes the <b>individual</b> <b>animal</b> output level that is required to achieve maximum total system output from a given feed resource. In Case 2, animals of different production levels are allowed to select between two feed resources that, through proper definition of the their proportions on offer, on average represent the same feed quality scale as in Case 1. The possibility of selection, however, allows the nutritive value of the actual intake to differ from the average nutritive value of feed offered. Better feed and higher (potential) <b>individual</b> <b>animal</b> output tend to increase total system output in terms of milk, by reducing the number of animals. Nevertheless, the term 'damning objective' is introduced to express that high targets for subsystem output reduces total system output if subsystem requirements exceed resource availability. Moreover, heterogeneity of (feed) resources can increase system output by using more production units with lower individual output. The results are tested against farmers' practice and situations reported in literature. Implications for the design of sustainable systems and further research are discussed...|$|R
