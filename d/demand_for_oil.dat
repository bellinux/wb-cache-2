5|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{negative}} associations with oil among many ranchers and farmers, demand for kerosene and other petroleum derivatives drove oil prospecting in Texas after the American Civil War at known oil-producing springs and accidental finds while drilling for water. One {{of the first}} significant wells in Texas was developed {{near the town of}} Oil Springs, near Nacogdoches. The site began production in 1866. The first oilfield in Texas with a substantial economic impact was developed in 1894 near Corsicana. In 1898, the field built the state's first modern refinery. The success of the Corsicana field and increasing <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> worldwide led to more exploration around the state.|$|E

The Küttejõu open-pit mine was closed in 1947 and the Küttejõu {{underground}} mine was merged with the Kiviõli mine in 1951. The Ubja mine was closed in 1959. After construction of large oil shale-fired power stations, <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> shale increased and consequently new larger mines were constructed: the underground mines Viru (1965) and Estonia (1972) along with the open-pit mines Sirgala (1963), Narva (1970) and Oktoobri (1974; later named Aidu). Correspondingly, several exhausted smaller mines like Kukruse (1967), Käva (1972), No. 2 (1973), No. 4 (1975), and Kiviõli (1987) were closed. The Estonia Mine became the largest oil shale mine in the world. Because {{of the success of}} oil shale-based power generation, Estonian oil shale mining peaked in 1980 at 31.35million tonnes, and in the same year power generation peaked at 18.9TWh. The industry declined during the subsequent two decades. Demand for electric power generated from oil shale decreased following construction of nuclear power stations in the Russian SFSR, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station. At the end of 1988, a fire broke out in the Estonia Mine. The largest underground fire in Estonia, it continued for 81days and caused serious pollution of ground and surface waters.|$|E

Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. In a scenario with oil prices above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs, with the excess oil production from its oil sands probably going to export.

These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion.

The Suez Canal reopened and the economics of ULCCs began to appear less satisfactory than had originally been anticipated.

The whole economic basis of the Whiddy terminal was incompatible with the [...] "just-in-time" [...] approach to industrial management which was being widely adopted at the time. That apart, the late 1970s had a levelling-off in <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> as the result of both economic recession and a rise in the price of oil. All these circumstances caused a fall in the use of the terminal to a level below that which had been planned.

The company was forced to undertake a number of cost-saving measures.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to a wave of oil nationalizations and the high prices of the 1970s, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil, especially after prices reached new peaks approaching US$40/bbl in 1979–1980 when the Iranian Revolution and Iran–Iraq War disrupted regional stability and oil supplies. Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power; national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil; and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>oil</b> dropped by 5million barrels, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount, and OPEC's market share sank from approximately 50 percent in 1979 to less than 30 percent in 1985.
