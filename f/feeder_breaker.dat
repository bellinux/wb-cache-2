50|$|Number of {{shuttle car}} loads {{is defined as}} the total number of fully loaded shuttle cars that were loaded at the {{continuous}} miner and subsequently tipped at the feeder breaker.Average shuttle car load time refers to the average time in seconds that was necessary to load a shuttle car to its maximum coal-carrying capacity.Average shuttle car change time refers to the average time in seconds that was necessary for an unloaded shuttle car to be repositioned behind the continuous miner after the previously loaded shuttle car trammed away from the machine towards the tipping point.Conveyor on time refers to the total time in minutes that the flight chain conveyor on the continuous miner was running.Cutter ON - Conveyor OFF - bunker operation min- bunker operation refers to the total time in minutes that ONLY the cutterhead was running and coal was being stored on the spade.Shuttle car away time refers to the total time in minutes that was utilised by a loaded shuttle car to travel from the continuous miner to the <b>feeder</b> <b>breaker,</b> tip the loaded coal and travel back to the continuous miner to be loaded again.Cutter operation time refers to the total time in minutes that the cutterhead was running.Relocation time refers to the total time in minutes that was utilised in order to relocate a continuous miner to a different heading after the maximum allowable unsupported length of the previously cut heading was reached.Utilisation of the modified cutting cycle has improved the general consistency of the production machines in achieving the target values of the key performance indicators. This is confirmed by means of continuous production reporting that monitors and documents the key performance indicators on a shift basis. The following table shows an example of a typical summary of key performance indicators and the actual numbers achieved. It is illustrative of the success with which the bi-directional cutting cycle is being run at a South African coal mine.|$|E

40|$|Over {{recent years}} Anglo Coal Underground CM mines have {{consistently}} {{been able to}} increase production output by improving their production process efficiency. However, in the very same time, the utilization of available production time has declined. This report will explore {{the architecture of the}} current Performance Management System (PMS) for frontline production section in Greenside Colliery, with specials impetus given to the measurement front line time utilization. Guided by existing literature and case studies on Performance Measurement Systems and equipment time losses one was then able to conduct work studies in the erratic underground coal mining sections. This was done with the view of building a factual basis for process flows and root cause identification. Informed by the above the report will give recommendations, on the short comings and suitability of the current PMS, a concise definition of what ìproduction downtimeî and illuminate critical areas of lost production. From the study of best practices the PMS was found to be suited generally for frontline coal management. However {{more needs to be done}} in improving the accuracy of the data recorded and its communication. A definition was fabricated for Lost Production Time based on the existence of a critical value chain. Based on this definition the critical areas of lost production time were identified and summarized in diagrammatic form that will be used in the data capturing of the new PMS. The study found that Continuous Miner operational stoppages and <b>Feeder</b> <b>Breaker</b> breakdowns present the best opportunities of improvement and recommends that work studies be done to improve the operational stoppages and equipment redesign consideration be made to reduce shearing pin and torque shaft damage. The report culminates by giving further recommendations based on findings on other aspects that are not contained within the project scope but however do have a bearing on the efficiency of the total PMS.

30|$|The {{mining and}} {{cleaning}} of coal at local processing sites creates {{large quantities of}} ambient particulate matter (Ghose and Banerjee 1995; Ghose and Majee 2000). Opencast mining operations contribute major air pollutants to the atmosphere and are responsible for environmental degradation by deteriorating the air quality in respect to dust, fine coal particles and other gaseous pollutants (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2010). The major sources of air pollution in coal mining area include: drilling and blasting, loading and unloading of coal and overburden, movements of heavy vehicles on haul roads, dragline operations, crushing of coal in <b>feeder</b> <b>breakers,</b> presence of fire, exposed pit faces, wind erosion and exhaust of heavy earthmover machinery (Nair and Sinha 1987; Ghose and Majee 2007; Huertas et al. 2011). According to Ghose and Banerjee (1997), air pollution caused by washeries is more acute than any other coal processing operations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{determining}} locations of single-phase-to-ground faults in ungrounded distribution system using pre-fault and during-fault fundamental-frequency mea-surements. The pre-fault measurements {{along with the}} load profiles are used to determine load demands for each individual load in a feeder section. The during-fault measurements are used to determine possible faulted area and location. The faulted feeder and faulted feeder section are first determined based on the reactive power factors of residual powers determined for the <b>feeder</b> <b>breakers</b> and switches with sensors. The line segments in the faulted feeder section are then tested for a sign change of phase-to-ground voltage on the fault phase to determine the faulted line segment.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{determining}} single-phase-to-ground fault locations of ungrounded distribution systems {{based on the}} measurements collected from the <b>feeder</b> <b>breakers</b> and intelligent switches during the fault. The method first narrows down the possible faulted area into a specific feeder section based on the reactive power factors of residual powers determined for the breakers and switches. Then the power consumption of each individual load in the faulted section is determined based on measurements at {{the boundaries of the}} section, and load profiles for each individual load. The possible faulted line segment is determined using a forward sweep scheme to test a sign change of faulted phase voltages on terminal buses of line segments, and the possible fault point is determined by finding a location along the faulted segment having a zero voltage on the faulted phase.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{generalized}} admittance based method for fault location analysis of distribution systems. Based on the measurements {{collected from the}} <b>feeder</b> <b>breakers</b> and intelligent switches during a fault, the fault type and faulted feeder section are first deter-mined by examining the over-voltages and over-currents on the breakers/switches. The load demands, faulted line segment and fault location are then determined sequentially by finding a set of loads, a line segment and a fault location that has minimal distance between the currents measured at {{the boundaries of the}} feeder section, and the estimated currents deter-mined by multiplying the measured voltages by an equivalent admittance matrix determined for the feeder section when applying the given load and fault conditions to the feeder section. The proposed approach determines the equivalent admittance matrix for a feeder section with one or two measuring ports through topology and circuit analysis, and for a feeder section with more than two measuring ports through Kron reduction on nodal admittance matrix. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

This paper puts {{forward a}} distributed automation scheme with grounding protection for 10 kV aerial wire, {{which is based}} on the outgoing line and <b>feeder</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> in substation, the intelligent column circuit breaker and the intelligent load switch.

Practical application results show that the application of the scheme have reduced the hours of power failure, reduced maintenance time and improved the stability of the system. At present， 10 kV aerial line is widely used in our country, after coming out through the substation circuit breaker (the column switch are various, but the most widely used is circuit breaker or load switch). The lines are separated by the column switch. In the branches, column switch and disconnector are also widely used to control the lines. In the client side of 10 kv lines, generally us...|$|R
40|$|A reactor startup is in progress. The Primary Plant Operator (PPO) {{has just}} started {{withdrawing}} regulating group CEAs in Manual-Sequential mode, when the "Withdraw-Insert " switch fails in the WITHDRAW mode (indicative {{of holding the}} switch in the withdraw position). The PPO releases the control switch and notes that regulating group CEAs are continuing to withdraw. The PPO then attempts to trip the reactor by pressing ALL four (4) TCB trip buttons and receives the following indication: * All four (4) "K-relays " on RPS have deenergized. * TCB # 1 and TCB # 2 green lights lit, red light out. * TCB # 3, # 4, # 5, # 6, # 7, # 8 and # 9 red lights lit, green lights out. All other indications are normal for a reactor startup. Which {{one of the following}} describes the result of the above TCB status? A The action taken will trip the main turbine, which will then deenergize the CEA busses stopping the rod withdrawal. B The present TCB configuration will immediately trip all CEAs stopping the rod withdrawal. Do D C Both of the MG Set <b>feeder</b> <b>breakers</b> must be opened from C 04 to stop rod withdrawal. D The main turbine Trip pushbutton on C 05 must be pushed to stop rod withdrawal. Justification A; Wrong- the indication given has only TCBs # 1 & # 2 open and the rest closed. These TCBs are in series and will NOT deenergize either CEA bus if they are the only TCBs open. Therefore the undervoltage trip of the turbine will not occur. B; Wrong- only one of the two lines to one of the two CEA busses has been opened. As each CEA bus has two supply lines, both busses are still powered. C; Correct- EOP- 2525 states that the MG set breakers are to be opened on C 04 if the TCBs don't open when the trip buttons are pushed.

40|$|For the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), {{the margins}} of {{coordination}} times between the lateral circuit breakers (LCB) of underground 4 -way automatic line switches and the protection equipment of high voltage customers are often too small. This could lead to sympathy tripping by the <b>feeder</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> (FCB) of the distribution feeder and create difficulties in protection coordination between upstream and downstream protection equipment, identification of faults, and restoration operations. In order to solve the problem, {{it is necessary to}} reexamine the protection coordination between LCBs and high voltage customers’ protection equipment, and between LCBs and FCBs, in order to bring forth new proposals for settings and operations. This paper applies linear programming to optimize the protection coordination of protection devices, and proposes new time current curves (TCCs) for the overcurrent (CO) and low-energy overcurrent (LCO) relays used in normally open distribution systems by performing simulations in the Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) environment. The simulation results show that the new TCCs solve the coordination problems among high voltage customer, lateral, feeder, bus-interconnection, and distribution transformer. The new proposals also satisfy the requirements of Taipower on protection coordination of the distribution feeder automation system (DFAS). Finally, the authors believe that the system configuration, operation experience, and relevant criteria mentioned in this paper may serve as valuable references for other companies or utilities when building DFAS of their own...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Fault Passage Indicator (FPI) is nearly 70 years old. Its main {{functionality}} is {{to indicate the}} flow of a faulty current through a cable section. Despite {{the simplicity of the}} concept, it has proven to be an effective solution to ease the task of locating a fault. In this long period, the manufacturers have come up with new ideas to improve the FPI and to provide a satisfactory answer {{to the needs of the}} Distribution Network Operators (DNO). The ultimate goal is to reduce the outage time and the consequent losses, aiming to increase the reliability of the grid. FPIs are devices that combine features from different fields and, therefore, they can be approached from different perspectives: (directional) fault detection algorithms, faulted phase detection, (auto) configuration of detection parameters, number of sensors and sensor technology, the optimal placement of the FPIs in the grid, the mechanical installation of the device, the acquisition of the indication, the reset of the device, amongst some more. Several improvements have taken place in the last years regarding the above-mentioned fields: directional FPIs without voltage sensors, FPIs that can be installed far from the conductor (contactless), use of FPIs for grid monitoring purposes, and some more. Moreover, the FPI is a scalable device that must combine fault detection capabilities with a low cost, while providing high accuracy and coordination with the <b>feeder</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> operation. The paper will analyze the improvements and limitations above mentioned that challenge the further development of this mature technology. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Capítulos en librosUnderfrequency {{load-shedding}} (UFLS) schemes are a last-resort tool {{to protect}} a power system {{in case of a}} severe disturbance. This paper presents a design of UFLS schemes taking into account load variation, affecting their step sizes. Most of the UFLS schemes implemented today are conventional static and semi-adaptive schemes. To date, methods for the design of these schemes consider known and constant step sizes. Step sizes might actually vary due to feeder load variation, <b>feeder</b> outages or <b>breaker</b> failures. The proposed design is formulated as a scenario-based optimization problem which is based on different step size variation scenarios. The design is applied to a Spanish small isolated power system, exhibiting strong variations of the step sizes. A UFLS scheme designed without contemplating step size variations serves as a reference case. Three different cases are analyzed that differ in the degree step size variations are taken into account. Taking into account load variations benefits the design and performance of UFLS schemes, whereas neglecting these variations results in dangerously low frequencies. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{electric}} distribution system, {{the problem}} of finding the optimal configuration of radial network may be classified as the Travelling Salesman Problem. When a medium voltage system (20 kV) {{has a number of}} connected <b>feeders</b> whose circuit <b>breakers</b> (CBs) can be opened or closed, the combinatorial number of possible system configurations created by switching CBs become very large. In order to determine the minimum loss configuration of medium voltage system, a new computation algorithm is proposed. Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) is proposed to solve the network reconfiguration problem to get optimal switching combination in the network. The HSA is a recently developed algorithm which is conceptualized using the musical process of searching for a perfect state of harmony. It uses a stochastic random search instead of a gradient search which eliminates the need for derivative information. Simulations are carried out on 33 bus radial network of IEEE test system to validate the proposed algorithm. The results are compared with PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) as a popular approaches available in the literature. It is observed that the proposed method performed well compared to the PSO in terms of the quality of solutions...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of Kyoto {{protocol}} for reducing green house gases and the identification of perfluorocarbons (PFC&# 146;s) emitted during anode effect (AE) in the aluminium electrolysis process as a major source and increasing in global aluminium production capacities, efforts to prevent and control AE have become very important. Much fundamental information on the initiating cause of AE, and the electrochemistry {{have been published in}} the last six decades. Modern control systems at most smelters should apply this knowledge and prevent AE, but in reality don&# 146;t perform as well as expected. While the electrolysis is continuous, manual interventions are still needed, and not all the relevant process parameters are capable of being sensed and controlled directly. Due to this, the process gets disturbed and with subjective decisions, the root cause of each AE gets obscured. No study has been published analysing these causes. They can be due to actions taken by man, performance of equipment and materials as well deviation from control parameters. This study focussed on these previously ignored aspects in order to determine their importance, develop early identification and remedies. Scientific methodology was employed in a smelter with a range of cell technologies and work practices involving extensive data analysis and follow up trials to address root causes, implementing remedies to prevent recurrence. Variables significantly affecting AE frequency were current density, energy balance, algorithms for controls, <b>feeder</b> and <b>breaker</b> design, as well as operational practices. A new logic was introduced to predict AE&# 146;s early reducing AE frequency by 30 - 70 %. AE duration was reduced from 45 to 25 seconds in a potline through refinements in control system. At the start of this investigation the average PFC emission at the smelter was 0. 24 t CO 2 equivalent / t Al and the end a figure of 0. 12 t CO 2 equivalent / t Al. At the time of its conclusion, the improvements were consolidated in a test section achieving an extremely low PFC emission of <= 0. 04 t CO 2 equivalent/t Al as compared to the 2010 voluntary target of 0. 88 t CO 2 equivalent/t Al set by the International Aluminium Association...|$|R
