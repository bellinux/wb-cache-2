The prepared mixture enters into the industrial double tube scraped crystallizer - heat exchanger, in which the processes of pre-freezing and churning of ice cream are carried out. A refrigerant fluid evaporates and continually circulates in a vessel jacket.Usually, the initial temperature of an ice cream mixture is 12-18 °C. After switching on a freezer, an <b>evaporating</b> <b>temperature</b> of a refrigerant decreases down to a range from −25 to −32 °C. The final temperature of the treated mixture into the scraped surface freezer is about −5 °C, with an ice concentration of approximately 30-50%, depending on the formula. During the freezing process ice crystals form on the inside cool surface of the crystallizer wall. They are removed by blades, mixed into the bulk, and continue to decrease its temperature and to improve heat transfer within the product.|$|E
