50|$|Section 12 {{provides}} that an <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> may devised by will in writing {{signed by the}} testator or someone in his presence and at his express direction, attested and subscribed in the testators presence by three of more witnesses. It also provides for <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> in cases where no devise is made.|$|E
5000|$|A life <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> (Law French, [...] "for {{the life}} of another") is held {{for the rest of}} the {{lifetime}} of a person who does not hold the estate. This form of life estate arises where a life tenant has disposed of the property, assuming such a disposal does not trigger any special forfeiture under the life interest instrument. It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the measuring life that of someone other than the life tenant's life. A life <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|A {{life estate}} is an estate to last someone's {{lifetime}}, either the grantee's lifetime or {{the lifetime of}} someone else - a life <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie.</b> These estates {{were used in the}} creation of a strict settlement.|$|E
50|$|Sections 4 to 6 {{addressed}} various technicalities of {{land law}} since rendered obsolete. The Act {{did not extend}} to <b>estates</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> and various manorial rights were preserved over the land devised. Where land was held subject to a Lord of the Manor, for example under a copyhold, the Act required that the will was recorded in the Court Roll of the manor and that various fees and duties were paid. These provisions became irrelevant following {{the demise of the}} manorial system with the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|R
5000|$|In {{property}} {{law of the}} United States and some Canadian provinces, <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> (Old French for [...] "for another's life") is a duration of a property interest. [...] While it {{is similar to a}} life estate, it differs in that a person's life interest will last for the life of another person instead of their own. [...] For example, if Bob is given use of the family house for as long as his mother lives, he has possession of the house <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie.</b> <b>Pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> can occur when a contingent remainder is destroyed, in a Doctrine of Merger situation, where one person acquires the life estate of another and thereby destroys a remainder not already vested.|$|R
50|$|Life estates are {{measured}} {{either by the}} life of the property recipient, or by the life of some other person (<b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie).</b>|$|R
50|$|A life <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> {{is held by}} {{one person}} for the natural life of another person. Such an estate may arise if the {{original}} life tenant sells her life estate to another, or if the life estate is originally granted pur autre vie.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislation}} achieved this {{by giving}} the tenant for life statutory powers {{to deal with the}} land which far exceeded the powers he had previously under common law. The most important of these powers was the power of the tenant for life to sell the fee simple interest in the land and not just a life <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The key {{difference}} between a reversion and a remainder is that a reversion is held by the grantor of the original conveyance, whereas [...] "remainder" [...] is {{used to refer to}} an interest that would be a reversion, but is instead transferred to someone other than the grantor. Similarly to reversions, remainders are usually created in conjunction with a life estate, life <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie,</b> or fee tail estate (or a future interest that will eventually become one of these estates).|$|E
5000|$|A {{land owner}} of an estate cannot give a [...] "greater interest" [...] in the estate than he or she owns. That is, a life estate owner cannot give {{complete}} and indefinite ownership (fee simple) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when {{the person who is}} the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's life embedded life estate, then Charlie's life estate interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons {{under the terms of the}} will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as [...] "A conveys X to B until A dies" [...] and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.|$|R

50|$|So {{much of this}} Act {{as related}} to devises or bequests of lands or tenements, or to the {{revocation}} or alteration of any devise in writing of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any clause thereof, or to the devise of any <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie,</b> or to any such estate being assets, or to nuncupative wills, or to the repeal, altering or changing of any will in writing concerning any goods or chattels or personal estate, or any clause, devise, or bequest therein was repealed by section 2 of the Wills Act 1837 (1 Vict c 26).

50|$|There {{are several}} cases in which, by statute or otherwise, {{property}} {{is taken out}} of the class of real or personal to which it seems naturally to belong. By the operation of the equitable doctrine of conversion money directed to be employed in the purchase of land, or land directed to be turned into money, is in general regarded as that species of property into which it is directed to be converted. An example of property prima facie real which is treated as personal is an <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie,</b> which, since 1740, is distributable as personal property {{in the absence of a}} special occupant. Examples of property prima facie personal which is treated as real are fixtures, heirlooms, such as deeds and family portraits, and shares in some of the older companies, as the New River Company, which are real estate by statute. In ordinary cases shares in companies are personal property, unless the shareholders have individually some interest in the land as land.|$|E

5000|$|The {{law in the}} United States agrees in most respects {{with that}} of England. Heirlooms are unknown, one reason being, no doubt, that the {{importance}} of title-deeds is much less than it is in England, owing to the operation of the Registration Acts. Long terms in some states have annexed to them the properties of freehold estates. In some states estates pur autre vie descend like real property; in others an <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> <b>autre</b> <b>vie</b> is deemed a freehold only during the life of the grantee; after his death it becomes a chattel real. In yet other states the heir has a scintilla of interest as special occupant. [...] In some states railway rolling stock is considered as purely personal, in others it has been held to be a fixture, and so to partake of the nature of real property. Shares in some of the early American corporations were, like New River shares in England, made real estate by statute, {{as in the case of}} the Cape Sable Company in Maryland. In Louisiana animals employed in husbandry are, and slaves were, regarded as immovables. Pews in churches are generally real property, but in some states they are made personal property by statute.

5000|$|In land law, {{the term}} [...] "estate" [...] is {{a remnant of}} the English feudal system, which created a complex {{hierarchy}} of estates and interests in land.

An estate can be an estate for years, an estate at will, a life estate (extinguishing at {{the death of the}} holder), an <b>estate</b> <b>pur</b> auter vie (a life interest for the life of another person) or a fee tail estate (to the heirs of one's body) or some more limited kind of heir (e.g. to heirs male of one's body).|$|R
