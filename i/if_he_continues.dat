25|$|In 2007, as {{a result}} of an {{incident}} in Las Vegas, regarding an attempt to reacquire materials Simpson claimed were stolen from him, Simpson was convicted of multiple felonies including use of a deadly weapon to commit kidnapping, burglary and armed robbery, and sentenced to a minimum 9 years to a maximum 33 years in prison.

2500|$|Edwin Percy Whipple from North American Review {{considered}} The Tenant [...] "less unpleasant" [...] than Wuthering Heights. However, both novels, in his opinion, {{were constructed}} with an [...] "excessive clumsiness" [...] and [...] "the brutal element of human nature" [...] was equally [...] "given prominence" [...] in them. He continues: [...] " [...] seems a convincing proof, {{that there is}} nothing kindly in author's powerful mind, and that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> to write novels, he will introduce into the land of romance a larger number of hateful men and women than any other author of the day. In Gilbert he sees [...] "nothing good, except rude honesty", and while acknowledging Helen's [...] "strong-mindedness", he finds no [...] "lovable or feminine virtues". Despite this, Whipple praised novels characterization: [...] "All the characters are drawn with great power and precision of outline, and the scenes are vivid as the life itself." [...] Helen's marriage to Arthur he sees as [...] "a reversal of the process carries on in Jane Eyre", but Arthur Huntingdon, in his opinion, is [...] "no Rochester". [...] "He is never virtuously inclined, except in those periods of illness and feebleness which his debaucheries have occasioned". Whipple concludes: [...] "The reader of Acton Bell gains no enlarged view of mankind, giving a healthy action to his sympathies, but is confined to a narrow space of life, and held down, as it were, by main force, to witness the wolfish side of his nature literally and logically set forth. But the criminal courts are not the places in which to take a comprehensive view of humanity and the novelist who confines his observation to them is not likely to produce any lasting impression except of horror and disgust".|$|E
