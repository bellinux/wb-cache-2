5|$|The Middle Devonian {{is divided}} into three main groups. The lower part of the sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is {{dominated}} by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness <b>Flagstones</b> that were deposited in Lake Orcadie. The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and {{perched on}} a plinth of basalt rock. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder <b>flagstones</b> of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|There is {{the base}} of a stone cross on Townfield Lane, and wooden stocks nearby, {{probably}} dating from the 17th century. One of the more unusual listed structures in Warburton is the 25m stretch of wall constructed from <b>flagstones,</b> probably built in the 18th or 19th century. There are two listed structures in the grounds of the old Church of St Werburgh: a lychgate from the late 19th century, and a sundial from 1765.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven {{teams with}} two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought two different tyre compounds to the race; the Soft and the Medium dry compound tyres. The A1-Ring underwent minor safety {{changes in the}} run-up to the race. The modifications were new kerbs placed across the track with <b>flagstones</b> inside the kerbs to prevent dust from accumulating on the circuit. An additional row of tyres were erected at all corners and were designed to increase absorption in the event of a collision.|$|E
5|$|William {{also began}} to {{reconstruct}} {{the inside of the}} inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades. The work included a chapel, a hall and solar, and various service buildings. An open-backed square tower was built in stone along the wall on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because of pressure on it from the motte earthworks, and the top of the motte was relaid with <b>flagstones</b> to form pathways around the top. A stone gatehouse was built {{on the west side of}} the wall, leading from the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss <b>flagstones.</b> Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flagstone</b> is a {{sedimentary}} rock that is split into layers along bedding planes. <b>Flagstone</b> {{is usually a}} form of a sandstone composed of feldspar and quartz and is arenaceous in grain size (0.16 mm - 2 mm in diameter). The material that binds <b>flagstone</b> is usually composed of silica, calcite, or iron oxide. The rock color usually comes from these cementing materials. Typical <b>flagstone</b> colors are red, blue, and buff, though exotic colors exist.|$|R

5|$|The day's battle {{began on}} 18 June 1815 at about 11a.m. with a French attack on Hougoumont from the south-west, led by Napoleon's brother Jerome. The French {{gained control of}} much of the chateau's park, but the Allies {{retained}} possession of the farmhouse and courtyard surrounds. Jerome continued his attempts to take the farmhouse throughout the day, making four or five assaults, most of which were repulsed by the defenders, who fired through loopholes, windows, and doorways. One assault at about 12.30p.m. breached the north gate, which had been left open to allow allied troop and supply movements. Sous-Lieutenant Legro, of the French 1st Light Infantry, broke through the wooden doors with an axe, allowing French soldiers to flood the courtyard. Graham's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonnell, led his men through the melee in the courtyard to the gates, in an attempt to shut them against the pressing French. This was done with the help of three officers (Captain Wyndham, Ensign Hervey, and Ensign Gooch), Corporal Graham, and a few other soldiers including Graham's brother Joseph. James Graham was the one to slot the bar in place. <b>Flagstones,</b> carts, and debris were then piled against the gates to hold them secure. The Frenchmen trapped within the courtyard were all killed, apart from a young drummer-boy.|$|E

25|$|The Eday Group overlies the Rousay <b>Flagstones</b> and {{represents}} a change to dominantly fluvial/aeolian deposition with only occasional lacustrine intervals. The Eday Group {{consists of three}} sandstone units, the lower, middle and upper Eday Sandstones separated by the Eday <b>Flagstones</b> and Eday Marl respectively. The Eday Marl consists mainly of red and green mudstones and siltstones and {{is thought to have}} been deposited in a river floodplain environment. Locally pseudomorphs of halite have been found and rarely marine microfossils (scolecodonts) indicating that the basin was affected by occasional marine incursions at this time.|$|E

25|$|Rocks of {{probable}} lower Devonian age {{are exposed}} near Yesnaby, on western Mainland. A ridge of granitic basement divides the Hara Ebb Formation, {{a sequence of}} breccias, conglomerates and sandstones deposited in an alluvial fan setting, from the Yesnaby Sandstone which was deposited in an aeolian setting. The contact with the overlying Middle Devonian lacustrine Lower Stromness <b>Flagstones</b> is an angular unconformity.|$|E

25|$|The Pennine Way {{has long}} been popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission {{reported}} that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using {{all or part of}} the trail per year and that walkers contributed £2million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the route onto firmer ground, and laying <b>flagstones</b> or duckboards in softer areas. These actions have been generally effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Pleistocene ice ages Lunga {{was part}} of a long {{peninsula}} stretching south west parallel to Kintyre. The Firth of Lorn glacier sliced this peninsula into several islands, including Islay, Jura, Scarba, Lunga, Luing and Seil. Later changes in sea level left raised beaches over much of the west coast of Scotland and Lunga has several examples. The bedrock of Lunga comprises a mixture of quartzite, limestone and shale called 'Scarba conglomerate' which predominates to the west and in the tidal islands to the north, with schist and mica-schist to the east. Unlike the other Slate Islands immediately to the north there is no commercially viable slate on Lunga, although the slate workers of Belnahua made use of the fresh water spring known as Tobar a Challuim-Chille (the well of St. Columba's church) north west of Bidean na h-Iolaire during times of drought. It is a trough, made up of <b>flagstones,</b> which reputedly never runs dry.|$|E
