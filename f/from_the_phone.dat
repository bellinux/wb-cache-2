5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E

25|$|When a {{practical}} effect cannot be accomplished, the crew turns to Entity FX to create digital imagery {{for a given}} scene. Sometimes this imagery is to substitute action sequences that they cannot do on-site, and other times {{it is used to}} create subtle foreground or background effects. For instance, a matte painting is used to establish the Metropolis background, which is composed of buildings from several modern-day cities in addition to Vancouver; they include Singapore and Hong Kong among others. For the scene where Clark rips his shirt open in the phone booth, revealing the tattoo, visual effects were added to the tattoo illuminating it. But in order to add the effects, the middle pane of glass was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> booth so that the special effects team had a clear line to Welling’s chest; they re-added the middle pane digitally, adding reflections so that it looked natural.|$|E

One of the first British prisoners taken in the GPO was Second Lieutenant AD Chalmers, who was bound with telephone wire and lodged in a telephone box by the young Volunteer Captain and IRB activist, Michael Collins. Chalmers later recalled O'Rahilly's kindness to him. In a statement to a newspaper reporter, {{he said that he}} was taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> box after three hours and brought up to O'Rahilly, who ordered: [...] "I want this officer to watch the safe to see that nothing is touched.

2500|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (telecoil) mode {{is usually}} {{more effective than}} the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is often automatically switched off when the hearing aid is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be hearing-aid compatible. More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode. [...] Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used. [...] A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near the hearing aid the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static. [...] Another method is to use a [...] "neckloop" [...] (which is like a portable, around-the-neck induction loop), and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.). Then, with the hearing aids' telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> through the neckloop and into the hearing aids' telecoils.|$|E
