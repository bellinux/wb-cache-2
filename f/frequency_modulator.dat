40|$|Abstract — This paper gives a {{description}} of a modulator for burst-by-burst carrier frequency hopping in time-division multiple-access (TDMA) systems. The architecture consists of a digital frequency synthesizer/modulator for continuousphase modulations (CPM’s) and a fast frequency settling RF synthesizer consisting of one phase-locked loop (PLL). The performance of the digital <b>frequency</b> synthesizer/CPM <b>modulator</b> has been analyzed theoretically and simulated by a computer program. The analyses show that the proposed digital <b>frequency</b> synthesizer/CPM <b>modulator</b> achieves 2. 5 -W lower power consumption and 18 -dB lower spurious levels than the fast frequency hopping systems synthesizing digitally a full frequency band. In the computer simulations the effect of the digital <b>frequency</b> synthesizer/CPM <b>modulator</b> parameters on the power spectrum and the phase error is investigated.

40|$|The body of {{this thesis}} (chapters 3, 4 and 5) {{deals with the}} {{analysis}} and improvement of a specific class of voltage- or current controlled oscillators (VCO’s respectively CCO’s) called relaxation oscillators. Before going into detail on this particular class of oscillators, first the function and application of VCO’s will be discussed. VCO’s are oscillators whose frequency of oscillation is controllable {{over a wide range}} by means of a control voltage or current. VCO’s are widely used in applications like phase-locked loops (PLL’s), <b>frequency</b> <b>modulators,</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesisers and timing recovery circuits. As such, VCO’s form an important building block in many data transmission- and processing systems. In these systems, the VCO’s periodical output signal is used e. g. for frequency translation by means of multiplication or extracting data from an incoming modulated carrier signal or bitstream...|$|R

Here we report oscillators built on micron-size, atomically-thin graphene nanomechanical resonators, whose frequencies can be electrostatically tuned {{by as much as}} 14 %. The self-sustaining mechanical motion of the oscillators is generated and transduced at room temperature by simple electrical circuitry. The prototype graphene voltage controlled oscillators exhibit frequency stability and modulation bandwidth sufficient for modulation of radio-frequency carrier signals. As a demonstration, we employ a graphene oscillator as the active element for frequency modulated signal generation, and achieve efficient audio signal transmission.

50|$|An RF {{modulator}} (or radio <b>frequency</b> <b>modulator)</b> is {{an electronic}} device whose input is a baseband signal {{which is used}} to modulate a radio frequency source.|$|E
50|$|A <b>frequency</b> <b>modulator</b> also generates {{sideband}}s, {{but instead}} of one sideband {{on each side of}} the carrier, it generates many sidebands {{on each side of the}} carrier. The FM bandwidth is wider because of the many sidebands. The power output from an FM transmitter is constant with modulation, so as power goes into the sidebands, the carrier power is reduced.|$|E
50|$|GMSK {{is similar}} to {{standard}} minimum-shift keying (MSK); however the digital data stream is first shaped with a Gaussian filter before being applied to a <b>frequency</b> <b>modulator,</b> and typically has much narrower phase shift angles than most MSK modulation systems.

5000|$|In {{audio and}} music, {{frequency}} modulation synthesis (or FM synthesis) {{is a form of}} audio synthesis where the timbre of a simple waveform (such as a square, triangle, or sawtooth) is changed by modulating its <b>frequency</b> with a <b>modulator</b> <b>frequency</b> that is also in the audio range, resulting in a more complex waveform and a different-sounding tone that can also be described as [...] "gritty" [...] if it is a thick and dark timbre.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the terahertz absorption spectra associated with intersubband transitions in a semiconductor quantum wire {{in the presence}} of spin-orbit interaction and a transverse magnetic field. The frequencies and intensities of the absorption peaks are found to depend strongly on the spin-orbit coupling strength, which can be varied with an external electric field. This feature can be exploited to realize reconfigurable multispectral terahertz detectors and amplitude and/or <b>frequency</b> <b>modulators.</b> We also show that electric dipole transitions between spin-split levels in the same subband (which are normally deemed forbidden) become allowed because of spin texturing effects. The absorption associated with these transitions experience a redshift (blueshift) with increasing spin-orbit coupling strength for materials with negative (positive) g factor. The normally allowed transitions, on the other hand, experience the opposite shift, i. e., blue for materials with negative g factor and red for materials with positive g factor.

50|$|The BTSs are {{equipped}} with radios {{that are able to}} modulate layer 1 of interface Um; for GSM 2G+ the modulation type is Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK), while for EDGE-enabled networks it is GMSK and 8-PSK. This modulation is a kind of continuous-phase frequency shift keying. In GMSK, the signal to be modulated onto the carrier is first smoothed with a Gaussian low-pass filter prior to being fed to a <b>frequency</b> <b>modulator,</b> which greatly reduces the interference to neighboring channels (adjacent-channel interference).|$|E

The motors are permanently connected in series two by two.

50|$|The filter will self-oscillate (and blow an amplifier), but {{can also}} be scaled 1:1 with {{frequency}} so that the resonator {{can act as a}} 5th oscillator (sine wave). The <b>frequency</b> <b>modulator</b> in the 'EFFECTS' section can be used with the VCF envelope for pitch envelope control. A triangle wave {{can be used as a}} sub-oscillator to beef up the bass of the other oscillators: set a widespread chord in chord memory and then use the arpeggiator, and then switch back and forth between poly/chord memory. The Mono/Poly can be used as a rhythm machine, by setting the instrument in 'Poly' and setting the different footages of the oscillators and the different waveshapes (triangle actually works best), and then using the ring modulator/frequency modulators with the Arpeggiator; adjust the envelopes accordingly to percussive settings and fiddle with the cut-off and noise from time to time to add tone color, and finally, set the LFO to pitch and set it at a considerable amplitude. Further, the pedal inputs can be routed from synths like the Korg MS-20 so that external oscillators can further modulate above what's already available. Because the VCOs have separate tuning controls they tend to be slightly out of tuning phase no matter how well they're tuned; to play chords that are in direct tuning phase, play the notes in a rapid, descending order from high to low. Like most analog synthesizers, it tends to scale better from high to low than low to high.|$|E
50|$|Features include four voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is {{the master}} oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a detune control that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or voltage-controlled filter (VCF) envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an amplitude control (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four {{at a time in}} MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes an amplitude modulator (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a <b>frequency</b> <b>modulator</b> with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played. Poly is without explanation, and oscillators always play in sequenced order from 1-4.|$|E

40|$|Two high frequency, non-electro optic {{methods for}} {{modulating}} {{the intensity of}} a laser are examined theoretically and experimentally. The first modulation technique makes use of the Zeeman effect. Under an applied DC magnetic field, a splitting into two lines or three lines occurs. Modulation rates of 200 MHz have been proven possible with this technique. In the second technique, the properties of self phase modulation of a monochromatic light are explored. For a high intensity beam, the optical path of a beam can be altered due the dependence of the phase on intensity. Thus two coherent beams of light of different intensity {{can be made to}} constructively or destructively interfere even if the physical paths are identical.

40|$|Photonic {{transition}} {{occurs in}} optical structures {{that have a}} time-varying refractive index. The photons experiencing a photonic transition can hop from one optical mode to another, which not only leads to a redistribution of photon numbers {{in each of the}} optical modes, but also an extra imparted nonreciprocal phase for the photons. On the other hand, photonics become increasingly important especially in the telecommunication industry because electrical interconnects have clearly reached its limits, and the demand of high performance active silicon photonics devices such as modulators and isolators become greater. In this thesis, I will show both in theory and experiment, by inducing photonic transitions using basic silicon photonics modulators, CMOS compatible high <b>frequency</b> <b>modulators</b> and isolators can be realized. In addition, I will also show in theory that the non-reciprocal phase associated with photonic transitions can be utilized to generate an effective magnetic field for light. This effective magnetic field not only adds an extra degree of control to the flow of light, but also supresses optical backscattering, which is particularly important since the silicon waveguides made nowadays are both low loss and sensitive.
