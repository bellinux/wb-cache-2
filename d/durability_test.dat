This paper investigated the MOR of two different fiber-cement sheets samples before and after <b>durability</b> <b>tests</b> {{as well as its}} ductility and toughness. Results showed {{no significant difference between the}} MOR of control specimens and that of the specimens submitted to <b>durability</b> <b>tests</b> except in the case of the freezing and thawing test where after 100 cycles, a 7 â€“ 9 % decrease was observed. The differences between the MOR of the control specimens and that of the specimens submitted to <b>durability</b> <b>tests</b> were negligible and acceptable in accordance to the requirements of the standard. However, toughness and ductility decreased considerably in specimens of sample 1 by 25, 35, and 15 %, respectively, when exposed to soak-dry (25 and 50 cycles) and warm water conditions. In turn, the reduction in toughness and ductility for specimens of sample 2 exposed to soak-dry (50 cycles) and warm water conditions were of 40 and 7 %, respectively. The results of this investigation suggest that ductility and toughness should also be considered to assess {{the durability}} performance of fiber-cement sheets...|$|R

50|$|The Bastian {{chair was}} {{manufactured}} {{with and without}} armrests, its frame was mainly made in beech wood with leatherette and wool upholstery or bare wood veneer. The chair was stackable and well suited for assembly halls, meeting rooms, offices and receptions areas. Haug was personally convinced that quality and durability would win him sales, so all his chair designs underwent a thorough <b>durability</b> <b>test</b> at the Norwegian Institute of Wood Technology. All chairs produced by Haug scored the highest rankings for durability, quality and construction methods. This explains the enormous success the Bastian series enjoyed and the employment it created in Elverum. As {{what might have been}} the best warranty scheme in the business, each chair was dated underneath and sold with a 10 year warranty! Today, almost 60 years after one can find Bastian chairs and the â€˜36â€™ chair in excellent condition to both frame structure and upholstery. The story goes that Olav Haug met executives and buyers either at his office or their headquarters and that Haug guaranteed the quality of his products by throwing the chairs through the window. This clearly impressed buyers and the method won him numerous new orders. It was with this method that he secured a large order for Bastian chairs for the newly built Ulleval Hospital in Oslo.|$|E
