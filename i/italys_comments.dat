This debate focused on elections to designate a candidate to lead the government from the centre-left coalition. The findings indicate the new hybridisation of media: television’s centrality is confirmed regarding its domination in the public space in which political discussion occurs, and the web demonstrates its own capacity for {{an active role in}} an event central to Italian politics.

40|$|Elementary particles, i. e. {{the basic}} {{constituents}} of nature, {{are characterized by}} quantum recurrences in time. The flow of time of every physical system can be therefore decomposed in elementary cycles of time. This allows us to enforce the local nature of relativistic time, yielding interesting unified descriptions of fundamental aspects of modern physics, as shown in recent publications and reviewed in [arXiv: 1305. 2802].

40|$|I give a {{pedagogical}} {{discussion of}} thermal dark matter (DM) within the clockwork mechanism. The clockwork mechanism, {{which is a}} natural way to generate small numbers starting from order-one couplings, allows to have a long-lived, but unstable, DM particle that nevertheless has O(1) couplings with electroweak- or TeV-scale states. Remarkably, DM decays on time scales much longer than {{the age of the}} Universe and has at the same time sizeable couplings with light states, which therefore allow to produce it thermally within the WIMP paradigm. These new particles with large couplings can be searched for at current or future colliders. I also briefly comment on how this setup can minimally emerge from the deconstruction of an extra dimension in flat spacetime.

40|$|Wave-particle duality, {{together}} {{with the concept of}} elementary particles, was introduced by de Broglie in terms of intrinsically "periodic phenomena". However, after nearly 90 years, the physical origin of such undulatory mechanics remains unrevealed. We propose a natural realization of the de Broglie "periodic phenomenon" in terms of harmonic vibrational modes associated to space-time periodicities. In this way we find that, similarly to a vibrating string or a particle in a box, the intrinsic recurrence imposed as a constraint to elementary particles represents a fully consistent quantization condition. The resulting classical cyclic dynamics formally match ordinary relativistic Quantum Mechanics in both the canonical and Feynman formulations. Interactions are introduced in a geometrodynamical way, similarly to general relativity, by simply considering that variations of kinematical state can be equivalently described in terms of modulations of space-time recurrences, as known from undulatory mechanics. We present this novel quantization prescription from a historical prospective. Comment: 10 pages. Peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in J. Phys. : Conf. Ser. (2013).

The authors drew their conclusions partly from hitherto unpublished data, and partly from the literature.

The 44 Ti radioactive nucleus can provide invaluable information {{on the details of}} supernova explosions. Its lifetime of about 85 yrs makes it the best indicator of the youth of these stellar explosions through its three gamma-ray lines at 67. 9, 78. 4 keV and 1. 157 MeV. We focus on the youngest Galactic supernova remnants, namely: Cassiopeia A, for which the location and Doppler-velocity estimates of the 44 Ti-emitting regions in the remnant would offer {{for the first time a}} unique view of nucleosynthesis processes which occurred in the innermost layers of the supernova; SN 1987 A, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, whose progenitor is known, and for which the expected measurement of these lines would greatly constrain the stellar evolution models; Tycho and Kepler SNRs for which 44 Ti lines have never been detected so far.

The problems encountered when using cave surveys for scientific research, and their low reliability (especially in the case of old surveys) are then treated, since they represent a crucial point in the paper object of this discussion. Eventually, we present some final consideration on cave levels and terraces, and on the specific case study, pointing out once again to the need in including geological field data to correctly find a correspondance between flat landforms and sea level fluctuations. Our main conclusion is that field data and information on speleogenesis of the underground karst landforms cannot be disregarded in a study that claims to deal with the influence of sea-level changes on caves...|$|R
40|$|Under {{scenarios}} of increasing climate aridity and human pressure, Ecosystem Sensitivity to Desertification (ESD) {{is one of}} the most important targets for sustainable land management. This process is particularly complex in the Mediterranean region since it involves multifaceted, interacting factors that depend on endogenous conditions and exogenous pressures. Environmental indicators quantifying the ESD level at local scale should reflect the interaction among biophysical and socioeconomic factors that are (directly or indirect) associated to soil and land degradation. This paper illustrates a Geographical Information System (GIS) investigating the main factors determining ESD at land unit scale. This tool incorporates a Decision Support System (DSS) capable to simulate the effect of short-term environmental changes on the ESD (hereafter ‘DSS-ESI’). The final output of the DSS-ESI is a composite index of land sensitivity to desertification (ESI) calculated separately for representative land cover types. The illustrated system was supplemented by a web-based interface which estimates the overall level of land sensitivity under different climate, population, and policy scenarios. The paper illustrates the main results produced by the DSS-ESI in a study site application (Basilicata, <b>Italy)</b> and <b>comments</b> about its applicability to other Mediterranean areas.

Given {{the increasing number of}} fires on a world scale, the current piecemeal approach to fire which mainly concentrates on fire suppression must be integrated with better and more efficient prevention, embracing a wide range of measures and activities that either modify fuels, or try to reduce the human caused ignition risks and sources, also changing, when possible, human behaviour. Understanding the reasons why fires start is, therefore, a crucial factor in order to prevent or reduce their incidence, to mount significant prevention efforts and to design specific fire prevention campaigns.

One key cross-country difference is that children are found to significantly increase specialization in the US, but not in Denmark. We attribute this difference to the subsidized childcare services provided by the Danish social welfare system. However, our model does not explain the greater overall level of specialization in the US. We find indirect evidence that more egalitarian households are less specialized, and hypothesize that cultural differences favoring egalitarianism reduce specialization in Denmark relative to the US.

Surprisingly, few quantitative surveys have been devoted to old-growth forests, even if they constitute the most acknowledged forest biodiversity icons. In this framework, the use of probabilistic sampling may provide an effective as well as rigorous support for monitoring and assessing old-growth forests. To this purpose, the present paper proposes a two-phase sampling scheme. In the first phase, a coarse survey of few floristic and stand structural attributes is carried out by means of small plots systematically placed on the study area. Subsequently, in the second phase, a fine assessment {{of a large number}} of ecological attributes is performed on a subset of enlarged plots selected among the first-phase ones by means of simple random sampling without replacement.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 3rd century, the Roman navy had {{declined}} dramatically. Although Emperor Diocletian is held to have strengthened the navy, and increased its manpower from 46,000 to 64,000 men, the old standing fleets had all but vanished, and in the civil wars that ended the Tetrarchy, the opposing sides had to mobilize the resources and commandeered the ships of the Eastern Mediterranean port cities. These conflicts thus brought about a renewal of naval activity, culminating in the Battle of the Hellespont in 324 between the forces of Constantine I under Caesar Crispus and the fleet of Licinius, which was the only major naval confrontation of the 4th century. Vegetius, writing at {{the end of the}} 4th century, testifies to the disappearance of the old praetorian fleets in <b>Italy,</b> but <b>comments</b> on the continued activity of the Danube fleet. In the 5th century, only the eastern half of the Empire could field an effective fleet, as it could draw upon the maritime resources of Greece and the Levant. Although the Notitia Dignitatum still mentions several naval units for the Western Empire, these were apparently too depleted to be able to carry out much more than patrol duties. At any rate, the rise of the naval power of the Vandal Kingdom under Geiseric in North Africa, and its raids in the Western Mediterranean, were practically uncontested. Although there is some evidence of West Roman naval activity in the first half of the 5th century, this is mostly confined to troop transports and minor landing operations. The historian Priscus and Sidonius Apollinaris affirm in their writings that by the mid-5th century, the Western Empire essentially lacked a war navy. [...] Matters became even worse after the disastrous failure of the fleets mobilized against the Vandals in 460 and 468, under the emperors Majorian and Anthemius.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} relationship between news coverage of immigration and readers' reaction to such coverage. Quantitative content {{analysis was used to}} study the subject with a comparative approach across regions that constitute borderlands between first and second world countries: the state of Arizona in the United States of America and Italy in the European Union. Coders analyzed content of 800 stories published by four daily newspapers in 2013. Degree of antipathy or sympathy for immigrants was assessed from 1, 470 online comments posted by readers of those stories. Hypotheses stemming from theories of national identity were tested to evaluate frames used to talk about immigration in the outlets considered and audiences' feedback while controlling for regional particularities. News coverage of immigration was generally unfavorable to immigrants in both Arizona and <b>Italy.</b> Readers <b>commenting</b> online on immigration did generally not empathize with immigrants. No statistically significant correlation was found between degree of antipathy or sympathy for immigrants expressed in online comments and stories' degree of unfavorableness or favorability to immigrants. The study also concluded that the Associated Press style change banning "illegal immigrant" from a journalist's vocabulary resulted in a sharp decrease of use of the phrase in the pair of Arizona dailies examined. Frames criminalizing immigrants appeared with comparable frequency across all four newspapers considered. Nationalistic and patriotic attitudes recorded in the studies carried out across multiple countries did not provide the sociological lens suited to explaining the tone of journalistic coverage of immigration addressed in this study and the public's reaction to such coverage. However, stories framed episodically provided more positive representations of immigrants than stories framed thematically, and readers' reaction seemed less antipathetic to immigrants. Previous comparative research of immigration coverage recommended that journalists write fewer human interest stories and more articles providing context and analysis of the issue. Representations of immigrants in the four dailies and attitudes emerging from online comments analyzed in this study, instead, suggest that journalists should focus on human interest stories to reframe immigration issues and reverse the often stereotypical nature of immigration coverage...|$|R
