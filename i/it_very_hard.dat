5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did not throw <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for defenders to mark them.|$|E

For this reason, the Jordan normal form is usually avoided in numerical analysis; the stable Schur decomposition or pseudospectra are better alternatives.|$|E

In some cases {{the nature of the}} cycling infrastructure and the prevailing weather conditions may make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to both cycle and maintain the work clothes in a presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.|$|E

Often these factors go together, making <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for children to overcome the odds. A number of measures have been assessed to help those children reach their full potential.|$|E

25|$|The Department of Medical Equipments in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) is {{responsible}} for supervising imports in this segment, but the import and distribution of such equipment is mostly handled by the private sector. Iran has undergone the primary stages of development in terms of industrialisation and a rather strong indigenous manufacturing capability exists in the country. Therefore, one can expect to find a handful of local producers for basic medical equipment, making <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to penetrate into the Iranian market for similar imported ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} using the mould made {{process in which}} a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread {{can be made to}} surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking {{to reduce the number of}} corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows in the paper that make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to copy.|$|E

25|$|Some {{time later}} a local ruler named Amir Mohammad Khan, who with another local ruler named Taqi Khan (the ruler of Yazd), had {{recently}} defeated Jafar Khan and seized many riches, invaded Qajar territory, and marched towards Isfahan. Jafar Qoli Khan, {{who was still}} the governor of Isfahan, left the city before Taqi Khan could reach it and defeated the latter. Agha Mohammad Khan then went southwards once again. He met Jafar Qoli Khan at Isfahan in 1788, and after some time, made Taqi Khan accept Qajar suzerainty, and thereafter punished some Qashqai tribes, who fled into the mountains. Agha Mohammad then approached Shiraz, where he hoped to bait Jafar Khan out of the city, which was strongly fortified, making <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to besiege. Unfortunately for Agha Mohammad Khan, Jafar Khan remained in the city. Agha Mohammad Khan returned to Isfahan, where he appointed his brother Ali Qoli as its governor, succeeding Jafar Qoli Khan. He then left for Tehran.|$|E
25|$|Canadian {{military}} {{nurses were}} {{well known for}} their kindness, efficiency, and professional appearance. Canadian nurses worked alongside soldiers on the war front, and felt the full effect of wartime risks and death, disease, and pain was encountered daily by the nurses. Most C.A.M.C. Nursing Sisters served in mobile infirmaries, or Casualty Clearing Stations. These Casualty Clearing Stations, or the C.C.S., as they were titled were typically situated on railway siding, close {{to the front lines}} so they could quickly and efficiently retrieve and treat soldiers who had fallen on the nearby battlefield. The proximity to the fighting exposed the Nursing Sisters to the horrors and dangers particular to the front. The advance areas were often under attack from air raids and shellfire, which frequently placed the lives of the sisters in danger. The Casualty Clearing Stations served as an advanced surgical center that administered emergency surgeries staffed by Canada’s most brilliant nurses. One of the most widespread problems the Nursing Sisters had to deal with at the C.C.S. was the vile cases of gangrene. Gangrene, caused by lethal mustard gas getting into an open wound, caused an infection of such toxicity it would literally eat at the skin. Gangrene was such a dreadful problem among Casualty Clearing Stations because the infection spread rapidly making <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to contain. This variation of gangrene was certainly not something that the nurses would have been trained on prior to their arrival at a Casualty Clearing Station; however, they were able to treat the infection with much success. The Nursing Sister’s role in the efficiency of the Casualty Clearing Stations proved to be a great contribution to the Canadian war effort.|$|E
25|$|I find <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to {{say this}} truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part {{of the responsibility for}} this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|When {{the special}} was first broadcast, it was watched by 1.7 million viewers, 11% {{of the total}} audience. However, these ratings are poor {{compared}} to other programmes. For example, an episode of Desperate Housewives shown the previous night attracted 2.8 million viewers. Responses from critics were mixed. Matt Baylis said, [...] "Like a homegrown ER on laughing gas, this show will be sorely missed," [...] and Ian Johns said, [...] "It was like a Richard Curtis romcom, albeit one force-fed magic mushrooms." [...] Sam Wollaston in The Guardian wrote {{that it was one}} of the funniest shows on British television, alongside the satirical sitcom The Thick of It, saying, [...] "The Thick of It is clever-funny, Green Wing is mad-funny." [...] Wollaston said that while the dramatic element of the show, such as Mac's death, were good, it was Alan and Joanna's storyline that was most entertaining. [...] "Mark Heap and Pippa Haywood, who play them, have been the shining lights in an already glittering show. They, and it, will be sorely missed," [...] he said.

500|$|Christian {{elements}} especially—largely sacriligeous—are {{prominent in}} the book. [...] They are at first innocuous and unimportant: a zombie named Christian, another character who believes he has found Christ's face {{on a piece of}} adhesive tape. [...] With the fourth issue of Yummy Fur, Brown's surreal take on Christianity becomes central: the cover depicts the Virgin Mary holding not just the infant Christ, but also a severed hand. [...] Within is the story of Saint Justin, whose amputation becomes a key motif: Chet loses his own hand and finds another; his own appears mysteriously under Ed's pillow. [...] Only by praying for forgiveness for his adultery and by murdering his lover is Chet's hand miraculously restored. [...] According to the Lives of the Saints, the fictional Saint Justin severed his own hand, but in another version Brown presents, Justin's wife cuts it off with a woodaxe when she catches her husband masturbating after rejecting her advances. [...] Despite Saint Justin's story's exposure to the reader as a fraud, Chet's faith in the official version restores his severed hand. [...] The altered ending from 1992 has both Josie and Chet reunited in Hell, and the ghost of Chet's sister becomes a devil. [...] As Brown mixes surreal sacrilege with the sort of moralism that compels him to condemn Josie for her bloody revenge, Brian Evenson calls Brown [...] "deft at muddying the waters {{in a way that makes}} <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to pin him down as either belieever or satirist, as either anti-religionist or apologist".|$|E

2500|$|Inserting this {{expansion}} into the FRGE and expanding the trace on its right-hand side {{in order to}} extract the beta-functions, one obtains the exact RG equation in component form: [...] Together with the corresponding initial conditions these equations fix {{the evolution of the}} running couplings , and thus determine [...] completely.
