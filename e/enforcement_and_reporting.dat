Exploiting a unique <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> framework for insider trading in Italy, we present three main findings. First, board governance, such as chief executive- chairman duality {{and the proportion of}} non-executive directors, does not increase the propensity of firms to comply with regulation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{corporate}} governance on regulatory compliance {{and the performance of}} Italian corporate insider trading. Exploiting a unique <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> framework, we present three main findings. First, corporate governance does not influence the propensity of firms to comply with insider trading regulation. Firms that have concentrated ownership and control, together with those run by families and cooperatives are most likely to comply with regulation. Second, multiple trading, but not transaction size, affects the performance of corporate insider trading. Third, the market responds less to reporting by compliant and family firms...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine whether}} the {{mandatory}} introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards {{leads to an}} increase in institutional investor demand for equities. Using a large ownership database covering all types of institutional investors from around the world, we find that institutional holdings increase for mandatory IFRS adopters. Changes in holdings are concentrated around first-time annual reporting events. Second, we document that the positive IFRS effects on institutional holdings are concentrated among investors whose orientation and styles suggest they are most likely to benefit from higher quality financial statements, including active, value, and growth investors. These results are consistent with holdings changes being associated with the financial reporting regime change. Finally, we show that increased institutional holdings are concentrated in countries in which <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> incentives are strongest, and where the differences between local GAAP and IFRS are relatively high. Overall, our study helps shed new light on the channels by which IFRS information becomes impounded in market outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Anti-money {{laundering}} (AML) broadly encompasses procedures, processes, laws, or regulations {{designed to}} curtail the practice of generating funds through illicit or criminal activities. Since 2001, Malaysian law enforcement agencies have stepped up their capacities and efforts to curb money laundering. However, implementation costs incurred on AML activities could be burdensome to the regulating, <b>enforcement,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> agencies. Although these efforts are generally benefi cial, assessing their effectiveness before increasing the level of AML regulation is necessary. This paper reviews literature on various approaches used to estimate money laundering and assess the effectiveness of AML. Although different measures and models are used to estimate money laundering, no model to quantify money laundering is globally acceptable. The absence of an accurate measurement of costs incurred and the difficulty in linking benefits to AML efforts pose challenges in assessing the effectiveness of AML policy. Nevertheless, the use of both crime data and perceived data on cost and effectiveness serves as a step forward in {{the determination of the}} effectiveness of AML in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} identify the current 2 ̆ 2 status of state composting regulations in the U.

Questions were included regarding: background information on composting: status of regulations: regulatory details including feedstock specific provisions and regulatory framework with respect to MSW regulations: details regarding type, properties, and amount of materials handled by composting activities; outgoing materials and storage of materials; type of composting facilities: initial development of the regulations; level of rigor of regulations: <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements; efficiency and level of satisfaction with regulations: permitting fees; and modifications to regulations. A total of 37 states completed the survey. The majority of the surveyed states had regulations for composting activities and required pem 1 its for operation of composting facilities. In general, type of permit 2 ̆ 7 was ba,ed on operational conditions at a facility including type and size of facility, type of materials processed, and throughput of material with various exemptions. Pem 1 itting requirements for composting generally were less strict than the requirements for MSW. Residual content generally was not quantified for regulatory purposes. The majority of the surveyed states had regulations related to the duration of materials storage at a facility. In the survey, 16 and 11 out of 35 states {{indicated that they had}} standards for the composition or quality of waste that may be composted and standards for the quality of compost intended for different applications, respectively. Regulations were developed to minimize impact to the environment or nuisance to nearby residents. Criteria developed by U. S.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} tax <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> financial <b>reporting</b> quality. The government, due to its tax claim on firm profits, is de facto the largest minority shareholder in almost all corporations. Therefore, the government, like other shareholders, {{has an interest in}} the accurate reporting of (taxable) income and preventing insiders from siphoning corporate funds to obtain private benefits. We hypothesize and find evidence that higher tax enforcement by the tax authority has a positive association with financial reporting quality. Further, we find that this association is generally stronger when other monitoring mechanisms are weaker. Our evidence is consistent with the predictions from the Desai, Dyck, and Zingales (2007) theory that the tax authority provides a monitoring mechanism of corporate insiders. Our paper also adds to the literature on the determinants of financial <b>reporting</b> quality <b>and</b> how the relation between accounting standards <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> outcomes depends on country-level institutions.

40|$|Prompted by {{the recent}} {{statutory}} corporate income tax-rate reduction in China, in this study I investigate whether the constraining effect that quality auditors have on tax-related discretionary current accruals (DCA) differs for two sub-groups of listed firms with tax incentives to manage earnings upward versus downward. I also explore whether the effectiveness of tax authority scrutiny (i. e. tax enforcement) on DCA differs for the same two groups. I find that the firms’ two external monitors {{are sensitive to the}} direction of managerial incentives for earnings management. Specifically, higher-quality auditors are associated with smaller amounts of <b>reported</b> DCA <b>and</b> this association is stronger for firms with incentives to manage earnings upward and weaker for those with incentives to manage earnings downward, although the accrual decisions for all of the firms are driven by the same tax reporting incentives. The results are consistent with the notion that due to concerns with legal liability and reputation loss, auditors have incentives to ensure that firms report earnings conservatively. I also find a significantly positive association between tax <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> <b>reported</b> DCA for firms with incentives to manage earnings downward. This suggests that tax authorities constrain corporate accruals management that is likely to result in tax revenue loss. Taken together, my results suggest that a spillover effect exists between auditors and tax authorities, such that the two monitoring bodies compensate for each other’s lack of monitoring in one direction of accruals management. My results are robust to a set of sensitivity tests and have implications for academic researchers, policy makers, and capital market investors...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to illuminate the experience of injuries and the process of injury reporting within the Swedish skydiving culture. The study had a qualitative approach where data was collected in narrative interviews that were subsequently analyzed with content analysis. Seventeen respondents between the ages of 22 and 44 were recruited at three skydiving drop zones in Sweden. Injury events related to the full phase of a skydive were described. Risk of injury is individually viewed as an integrated element of the recreational activity counterbalanced by its recreational value. The human factor of inadequate judgment such as miscalculation and distraction dominate the descriptions as causes of injuries. Organization and leadership act as facilitators or constrainers for <b>reporting</b> incidents <b>and</b> injuries. On the basis of this study it is interpreted that safety work <b>and</b> incident <b>reporting</b> in Swedish skydiving may be influenced more by local drop zone culture than by the national association policy. Formal and informal hierarchical structures among skydivers seem to decide how skydiving is practiced, rule <b>enforcement,</b> <b>and</b> injury <b>reporting.</b> We suggest that initial training and continuing education need to be change from the current top-down, to a bottom-up perspective, where the individual skydiver learns to see the positive implications of safety work <b>and</b> injury <b>reporting...</b>|$|R
