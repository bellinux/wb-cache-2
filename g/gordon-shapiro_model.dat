Competitiveness is the ability to defeat in a competition, regardless of the environment in which it is carried out. To be competitive, the Romanian companies must establish certain goals such as flexibility, (value) position on the market, liquidity and profitability. These objectives can be achieved if: there is initiative, knowledge and rigor in the leading enterprise workers, through fiscal and monetary policy which is consistent and effective, quality of human factor (as factor of production) is increasing. According to previous statements we notice that the concept of competitiveness at the firm level (a complex notion) will have to be analysed based on aggregate financial and economic indicators that capture all these mutations at the level of this evolved concept and that encompass all the variables that define it. To this end, we think (infer) that such an indicator, which analyses competitiveness at the micro level, can be the firm value.

The standard approach relying on the Gordon-Shapiro equation fails to justify the current high price levels on US stock markets. Several limits to <b>Gordon-Shapiro's</b> perfect competition <b>model</b> are proposed in order to explain the gap between observed and "justified" data. Equity prices affect investment and consumption through several channels. Although monetary policy should not ignore asset price fluctuations, it is fairly generally thought that it should take them into account only in so far as they affect inflation. ...|$|R
