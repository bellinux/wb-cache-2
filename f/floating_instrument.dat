50|$|Dr. Fred Noel Spiess (December 25, 1919 - September 8, 2006) was a naval officer, {{oceanographer}} {{and marine}} explorer. His work created new advances in marine technology including the FLIP <b>Floating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform, the Deep Tow vehicle for {{study of the}} sea floor, {{and the use of}} acoustics for underwater navigation and geodetic positioning.|$|E
50|$|Spiess is {{probably}} best remembered {{for his role in}} the creation of R/P FLIP (<b>Floating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform), a unique 355-for long research platform that is towed to the work area and then rotated to a vertical position to form a stable observation post in deep water. FLIP has remained in use for more than 40 years primarily for physical oceanographic and acoustic experiments. Spiess collaborated with Fred Fisher and Phillip Rudnick in development of the vessel.|$|E
50|$|R/P FLIP (<b>FLoating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform) is an {{open ocean}} {{research}} platform owned by the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR) and operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The platform is 355 ft long and is designed to partially flood and pitch backward 90°, resulting in only the front 55 ft of the platform pointing {{up out of the}} water, with bulkheads becoming decks. When flipped, most of the ballast for the platform is provided by water at depths below the influence of surface waves, hence FLIP is stable and mostly immune to wave action similar to a spar buoy. At the end of a mission, compressed air is pumped into the ballast tanks in the flooded section and the platform, which has no propulsion, returns to its horizontal position so it can be towed to a new location. The platform is frequently mistaken for a capsized ocean transport ship.|$|E

40|$|This Thesis {{presents}} a prototype design for Sonobuoy Mobile Earthquake Recorder in Marine Areas by Independent Divers (Son-O-MERMAID), a <b>floating</b> <b>instrument</b> {{that acts as}} a freely drifting seismometer that captures acoustic signals caused by distant seismic activity. A first version of Son-O-MERMAID was built and deployed in October of 2012, but due to Hurricane Sandy the device was destroyed and data lost. A major limitation of this device was the fact that acoustic data was collected and stored in a submerged computer at a depth of 2, 000 feet and data was only accessible once the device was pulled out of the water at test completion. A new prototype system, version 2 is described, constructed and successfully tested which provides additional features not offered by the previous version. These additional features consist of providing an effective algorithm to transfer acoustic data from the submerged computer to the surface in real time to be stored there for future analysis. Additionally, a stratum one NTP server has been implemented with time synchronized to GPS so acoustic data can be time stamped. Testing demonstrates that data is transferred in its entirety and in real time to the surface unit which will subsequently enable the transfer of data to a land-based station via IRIDIUM for real time analysis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, a {{productive}} collaboration has grown between the Laboratoire d’Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), NKE and IFREMER to implement biogeochemical sensors on profiling floats. A first project (2003) was dedicated {{to the design of}} the so-called ProvBio floats (models A and B) that consisted of a PROVOR-CTS 3 <b>float</b> <b>instrumented</b> with three new optical sensors: a Wetlabs transmissometer (C-Rover), a 3 -wavelength Satlantic radiometer (OCR- 503) and an “ECO 3 ” Wetlabs sensor, measuring chlorophyll-a fluorescence, colored dissolved organic matter and particle backscattering coefficients (see First Success of ProvBio floats, Coriolis Letter n° 5). Then, the integration of biogeochemical sensors continued in the framework of ProNuts project (2009, autonomously profiling the nitrate concentrations in the ocean: the pronuts project, Coriolis Letter n° 8), by equipping a PROVOR with a nitrate concentration sensor. In parallel {{within the framework of the}} Carbocean EU project, the ProvCarbon and ProvDo floats were developed as in 2006 by fitting on a PROVOR a C-Rover and a 3830 Aanderaa optode, respectively. They were used to investigate new tools to assess marine carbon sources and sinks. These initial developments have led to a first invaluable dataset and to subsequent papers (Xing et al. 2012, Xing et al. 2011) and report (IOCCG 2011). Nevertheless, the above projects have grown partially dissociated, as related to specific and project-related needs, while a more integrated solution may have a lot of advantages. Undoubtedly, the scientific exploitation of data would be strongly improved if a unique multidisciplinary float, able to measure all accessible parameters, was available. Such a multidisciplinary float would also strongly reduce costs, by sharing the float itself, and by reducing deployment, validation and communication costs. The idea to merge all these sensors on the same profiling float was thus at the origin of the ProvBioII float project, which was developed in the framework of the remOcean and NAOS programs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{and attempts to}} mitigate persistent uncertainty and scatter among existing approaches for determining the rate of sea spray aerosol production by breaking waves in the open ocean. The new approach proposed here utilizes passive microwave emissions from the ocean surface, which {{are known to be}} sensitive to surface roughness and foam. Direct, simultaneous, and collocated measurements of the aerosol production and microwave emissions were collected aboard the <b>FLoating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform (FLIP) in deep water ~ 150 km off the coast of California over a period of ~ 4 days. Vertical profiles of coarse-mode aerosol (0. 25 – 23. 5 μm) concentrations were measured with a forward-scattering spectrometer and converted to surface flux using dry deposition and vertical gradient methods. Back-trajectory analysis of eastern North Pacific meteorology verified the clean marine origin of the sampled air mass over at least 5 days prior to measurements. Vertical and horizontal polarization surface brightness temperature were measured with a microwave radiometer at 10. 7 GHz frequency. Data analysis revealed a strong sensitivity of the brightness temperature polarization difference to the rate of aerosol production. An existing model of microwave emission from the ocean surface was used to determine the empirical relationship and to attribute its underlying physical basis to microwave emissions from surface roughness and foam within active and passive phases of breaking waves. A possibility of and initial steps towards satellite retrievals of the sea spray aerosol production are briefly discussed in concluding remarks...|$|E
40|$|Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, Vol. 61, 2544 - 2558. Although the {{importance}} of the aerosol contribution to the global radiative budget has been recognized, the forcings of aerosols in general, and specifically the role of the organic component in these forcings, still contain large uncertainties. In an attempt to better understand the relationship between the background forcings of aerosols and their chemical speciation, marine air samples were collected off the windward coast of Oahu, Hawaii, during the Rough Evaporation Duct project (RED) using filters mounted on both the Twin Otter aircraft and the <b>Floating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform (FLIP) research platform. Laboratory analysis revealed a total of 17 species, including 4 carboxylic acids and 2 carbohydrates that accounted for 74 % 6 20 % of the mass gain observed on the shipboard filters, suggesting a possible significant unresolved organic component. The results were correlated with in situ measurements of particle light scattering (ssp) at 550 nm and with aerosol hygroscopicities. Principal component analysis revealed a small but ubiquitous pollution component affecting the ssp and aerosol hygroscopicity of the remote marine air. The Princeton Organic-Electrolyte Model (POEM) was used to predict the growth factor of the aerosols based upon the chemical composition. This output, coupled with measured aerosol size distributions, was used to attempt to reproduce the observed ssp. It was found that while the POEM model was able to reproduce the expected trends when the organic component of the aerosol was varied, due to large uncertainties especially in the aerosol sizing measurements, the ssp predicted by the POEM model was consistently higher than observed...|$|E
40|$|Refining radiative-transfer {{modeling}} capabilities {{for light}} transmission through the sea surface requires {{a more detailed}} prescription of the sea surface roughness beyond the probability density function of the sea surface slope field. To meet this need, exciting new measurement methodologies now provide the opportunity to enhance present knowledge of sea surface roughness, especially at the microscale. In this context, two intensive field experiments using R/P <b>Floating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform were staged within the Office of Naval Research's Radiance in a Dynamic Ocean (RaDyO) field program in the Santa Barbara Channel and in the central Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii.

This contribution describes the ensemble of instrumentation deployed. It provides a detailed documentation of the ambient environmental conditions that prevailed during the RaDyO field experiments. It also highlights exciting new sea surface roughness measurement capabilities that underpin {{a number of the}} scientific advances resulting from the RaDyO program.

5000|$|The {{approximate}} bridge {{position of}} the [...] "floating" [...] (movable) bridge on the qinqin can be easily calculated by doubling {{the distance between the}} nut and the 7th fret. The 7th fret on the qinqin is an octave higher than open string. Since the distance between the nut and the 7th fret is about 11 inches, the bridge should be located about 22 inches from the nut. This means the bridge will be located about 60% across the drum head, or 40% before {{the tail end of the}} drum head. For more precise location, take a digital tuner and compare the notes produced on each string, first open string, and then stopped at the 7th fret. The bridge position should be slightly adjusted so the note produced is [...] "spot on" [...] (but an octave different) at both open string and stopped at fret 7. Doing this for all three strings will usually result in a slight tilt to the bridge with the bass string maybe 1 or 2 mm longer than the treble string. This method is often employed with other <b>floating</b> bridge <b>instruments</b> like banjos, stick dulcimers and cigar box guitars.

40|$|Nonlinear energy {{transfers}} {{from the}} semidiurnal internal tide to high-mode, near-diurnal motions are documented near Kaena Ridge, Hawaii, an energetic generation {{site for the}} baroclinic tide. Data were col-lected aboard the Research <b>Floating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform (FLIP) over a 35 -day period during the fall of 2002, {{as part of the}} Hawaii Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME) Nearfield program. Energy transfer terms for a PSI resonant interaction at midlatitude are identified and compared to those for near-inertial PSI close to theM 2 critical latitude. Bispectral techniques are used to demonstrate significant energy transfers in the Nearfield, between the low-mode M 2 internal tide and subharmonic waves with frequencies near M 2 / 2 and vertical wavelengths of O(120 m). A novel prefilter is used to test the PSI wavenumber resonance condition, which requires the subharmonic waves to propagate in opposite vertical directions. Depth–time maps of the interactions, formed by directly estimating the energy transfer terms, show that energy is transferred predominantly from the tide to subharmonic waves, but numerous reverse energy transfers are also found. A net forward energy transfer rate of 23 1029 W kg 21 is found below 400 m. The suggestion is that the HOME observations of energy transfer from the tide to subharmonic waves represent a first step in the open-ocean energy cascade. Observed PSI transfer rates could account for a small but significant fraction of the turbulent dissipation of the tide within 60 km of Kaena Ridge. Further ex-trapolation suggests that integrated PSI energy transfers equatorward of the M 2 critical latitude may be comparable to PSI energy transfers previously observed near 28. 88 N. 1...|$|E
40|$|Depth-time {{records of}} isopycnal {{vertical}} strain {{have been collected}} from intensive CTD profiling programs on the research platform (R/P) <b>Floating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform (FLIP). The associated vertical wavenumber frequency spectrum of strain, when viewed in an isopycnal-following frame, displays a clear spectral gap at low vertical wavenumber, separating the quasigeostrophic (vortical) strain field and the superinertial internal wave continuum. This gap enables both model and linear-filter-based methods for separating the submesoscale and internal wave strain fields. These fields are examined independently in six field programs spanning the period 1983 - 2002. Vortical and internal wave strain variances are often comparable in the upper thermocline, of order 0. 2. However, vortical strain tends to decrease with increasing depth (decreasing buoyancy frequency as N 2 = -g/ρ(dρ/dz) ~(N 2) 1 / 2, while internal wave strain variance increases as ~(N 2) 1 / 2, exceeding vortical variance {{by a factor of}} 5 - 10 at depths below 500 m. In contrast to strain, the low-frequency spectral gap in the shear spectrum is largely obscured by Doppler-smeared near-inertial motions. The vertical wavenumber spectrum of anticyclonic shear exceeds the cyclonic shear and strain spectra at all scales greater than 10 m. The frequency spectrum of anticyclonic shear exceeds that of both cyclonic shear and strain to frequencies of 0. 5 cph, emphasizing the importance of lateral Doppler shifting of near-inertial shear. The limited Doppler shifting of the vortical strain field implies surprisingly small submesoscale aspect ratios: k H /k z ~ 0. 001, Burger numbers Br = k H N/k z f ~ 0. 1. Submesoscale potential vorticity is dominated by vertical straining rather than the vertical component of relative vorticity. The inferred rms fluctuation of fluid vorticity is far less for the vortical field than for the internal wavefield. © 2014 American Meteorological Society...|$|E

Organics {{can change}} {{the manner in which}} {{aerosols}} scatter radiation directly as hydrated aerosols and indirectly as in-cloud activated aerosols, through changing the solution activity, the surface tension, and the accommodation coefficient of the hydrated aerosol. This work explores the kinetic and thermodynamic impacts of the organic component of marine aerosols through data collected over four field campaigns and through several models used to reproduce observations. The Rough Evaporation Duct (RED) project was conducted in the summer of 2001 off the coast of Oahu using the Twin Otter Aircraft and the <b>Floating</b> <b>Instrument</b> Platform research platform for data collection. The Cloud-Aerosol Research in the Marine Atmosphere (CARMA) campaigns were conducted over three summers (2002, 2004, 2005) off the coast of Monterey, California. During the CARMA campaigns, a thick, moist, stratocumulus deck was present during most days, and the Twin Otter Aircraft was the primary research platform used to collect data. However, the research goals and exact instrumentation onboard the Twin Otter varied from campaign to campaign, and each data set was analyzed individually. Data collected from CARMA I were used to explore the mechanism of oxalic acid production in cloud droplets. Oxalate was observed in the clouds in excess to below cloud concentrations by an average of 0. 11 mug m- 3, suggesting an in-cloud production. The tentative identification in cloud water of an intermediate species in the aqueous oxalate production mechanism lends further support to an in-cloud oxalate source. The data sets collected during the RED campaign and the CARMA II and CARMA III campaigns were used to investigate the impact of aerosol chemical speciation on aerosol hygroscopic behavior. Several models were used to correlate the observations in the subsaturated regime to theory including an explicit thermodynamic model, simple Kohler theory, and a parameterization of the solution activity. These models were also applied to a cloud parcel model to examine cloud condensation nuclei closure. The best agreement was found when the solution activity was calculated using Svenningsson's model estimates, suggesting the nonlinear impact of organics on solution activity is the most important impact of organics on the marine aerosol...|$|E
