5|$|This {{engagement}} was {{the turning}} point of the Prussians' campaign. Beset with food shortages and dysentery, their retreat continued well past the Rhine River. French troops soon struck <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> Germany, taking Mainz in October. Dumouriez once again moved against the Austrian Netherlands and Kellermann ably secured the front at Metz.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the cab. The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
5|$|During the {{confused}} fighting, French and Russian units moved <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> impenetrable smoke and were smashed by artillery and musketry fire that was horrendous even by Napoleonic standards. Infantry and cavalrymen had difficulty maneuvering over the heaps of corpses and masses of wounded. Murat advanced with his cavalry around the flèches to attack Bagration's infantry, but {{was confronted by}} Duka's 2ndCuirassier Division supported by Neverovsky's infantry.|$|E

50|$|Like other spider crabs, Libinia ferreirae has {{a roughly}} {{circular}} spiny carapace that extends <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> a rostrum between the two, stalked eyes. It has five pairs of walking limbs.|$|R
50|$|A {{special case}} message {{can be sent}} to EMAIL and these {{messages}} are pulled off the real-time APRS-IS by the WU2Z Email engine and wrapped into a standard Internet Email protocol and <b>forwarded</b> <b>into</b> regular Internet email.|$|R
5|$|Tolkien devised several {{themes that}} were reused in {{successive}} drafts of his legendarium, beginning with The Book of Lost Tales, written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during The Battle of the Somme. The two most prominent stories, {{the tale of}} Beren and Lúthien and that of Túrin, were carried <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> long narrative poems (published in The Lays of Beleriand).|$|E
5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming {{on the surface of}} the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E
5|$|As the day progressed, the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment counterattacked in the Bénouville area in {{an attempt}} to get through to the bridges. The coup-de-main force and the 7th Parachute Battalion held their position, {{knocking}} out 13 of the 17 tanks trying to get through. The British troops moved <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at the bridges. Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} {{hesitate}} now, Jemima," [...] said Lady Bothwell, and walked <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the inner room, where, surrounded by books, maps, philosophical utensils, and other implements of peculiar shape and appearance, {{they found the}} man of art.|$|R
50|$|The USAAF {{combat units}} {{remained}} until late 1944 until being moved <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the Marianas, being assigned to airfields on Guam and Saipan. The United States then used Kwajalein as a maintenance and supply hub, supplying forward bases with supplies and equipment.|$|R
50|$|The B46 design {{concepts}} were taken <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> a new weapon design in 1959, the TX-53, which was redesignated the B53 nuclear bomb and W53 warhead. 50 B53 bombs were in US inactive reserves from 1997 to 2011, though none were actively deployed during that period.|$|R
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Following Air Force's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return by the Hokies, Virginia Tech's offense began a {{drive at}} its 28-yard line. A five-yard false-start penalty pushed the Tech offense back five yards, but a long run by quarterback Mark Cox made up the penalty and earned Tech a first down. Another first down followed, and Tech {{penetrated}} into the Air Force side of the field. Once there, Eddie Hunter evaded Falcon defenders for a 33-yard run that took the Hokies inside Air Force's 20-yard line. Three more plays pushed Tech forward, inside Air Force's five-yard line, for a first down. On the next play, Maurice Williams ran <b>forward,</b> <b>into</b> the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 73 lead with 1:42 left in the quarter.|$|E
50|$|The {{tricycle}} undercarriage was retractable. The main units retracted inward, while the steerable nosewheel retracted <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> a bay covered by two doors. Though provisions {{were made for}} armament similar to the military version of the single-seat Yakovlev Yak-32, no armament {{was placed on the}} four prototypes.|$|R
5000|$|It {{used the}} {{standard}} 7.62mm NATO M13 link [...] "strip-out" [...] disintegrating link, {{in which the}} bolt pushes the round out of {{the bottom of the}} two-part link and then <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the breech. The old M1 link [...] "pull-out" [...] disintegrating links, which are pulled backwards out of the one-piece link by the extractor towards the bolt and then <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the breech, wouldn't feed through the new mechanism. The M1 links, which were designed for the longer and thinner [...]30-06 Springfield, would also be too narrow to fit the shorter and thicker 7.62mm NATO round. The US Navy, because of their narrower inventory of 7.62mm NATO ammunition, used linked belts of either 7.62mm M80 Ball or a 4:1 ratio mix of 7.62mm M80 Ball and 7.62mm M62 Tracer.|$|R
5000|$|Most NICA leagues have 4 to 5 races {{per season}} in either fall or spring {{depending}} on local climate. The {{results of the}} top eight riders in each team are combined into the teams full score.The scores are cumulative between races and the top teams move <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the championships.|$|R
5|$|Meldrum's Force, {{commanded}} by Brigadier-General W. Meldrum, was formed at 20:30 from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and their machine gun squadron, mounted {{sections of the}} 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment, the 29th Indian Mountain Battery, and the Ayrshire (or Inverness) Battery RHA. This force concentrated {{half an hour later}} east of Musallabeh, to begin their advance to Kh. Fusail where they arrived just before midnight. At the same time, the Commander Royal Artillery (CRA) pushed guns <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> Mellaha to attack Ottoman guns on Red Hill on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade took over the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade position at Madbeh.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November {{it crossed}} the Volturno River and took Venafro. The {{division}} had great difficulty {{moving across the}} rivers and through the mountainous terrain, and the advance was slow. After linking up with the British Eighth Army, which had advanced from the south, the combined force, under the 15th Army Group, commanded by British General Sir Harold Alexander, was stalled when it reached the Gustav Line. Until 9 January 1944, the division, now under Major General William W. Eagles (replacing Major General Middleton who, struck down with arthritis, was sent to England to command VIII Corps in the Normandy invasion), inched <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the mountains reaching St. Elia, north of Monte Cassino, before moving to a rest area.|$|E
5|$|One {{isolated}} Covenanter brigade {{that stood}} its ground {{was at the}} right of their front line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland. Lucas launched three cavalry charges against them. In the third charge, Lucas's horse was killed, and he was taken prisoner. Behind them, Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre, pushing four regiments (those of the Earl of Cassilis, William Douglas of Kilhead, Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the breach in the allied front line. Behind them in turn, the Earl of Manchester's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston's brigade.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later we started, each of us {{carrying}} {{his share of the}} impedimenta. I think that Tommy was the only really cheerful member of the party, for he skipped about and barked, running backwards and <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the mouth of the cave, as though to hurry our movements.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} reasons that caused package <b>forwarding</b> service <b>into</b> existence: ...|$|R
50|$|From November 1944, {{remnants}} of the brigade (some sources estimated its strength at up to 2,000) <b>forwarded</b> <b>into</b> the military training camp Münsingen, with a formation of the 600. Infanterie-Division (russisch)---Andrey Vlasov's Russian Liberation Army. The former RONA were used to form one of the division's regiments. Accompanying civilians were sent to work in Pomerania.|$|R
5|$|Scott {{eventually}} {{resumed his}} naval career, first {{as an assistant}} to the Director of Naval Intelligence and then, in August 1906, as Flag-captain to Rear-Admiral George Egerton on HMS Victorious. He had by this time become a national hero, despite his aversion to the limelight, and the expedition was being presented to the public as a triumph. This euphoria was not conducive to objective analysis, or to thoughtful appraisal of the expedition's strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the glorification by Scott of man-hauling as something intrinsically more noble than other ice travel techniques led to a general distrust of methods involving ski and dogs, a mindset that was carried <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> later expeditions. This mystified seasoned ice travellers such as Fridtjof Nansen, whose advice on such matters was usually sought, but often set aside.|$|E
5|$|The German 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment {{continued}} to attack Bénouville and Le Port, assisted by their tanks, mortars and infantry. The attack caused serious {{problems for the}} understrength 7th Parachute Battalion, until the leading tank was blown up with a Gammon bomb, blocking the road. During the attack, 13 of the 17 tanks {{trying to get through}} to the bridge were destroyed. The paratroopers were then reinforced by number One Platoon from 'D' Company. The platoon moved <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. Numbers Five and Six Platoons also moved into positions opposite the Gondrée Café, on {{the west bank of the}} canal. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at the bridges and the three glider platoons were moved back to their original positions.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known {{detailed}} {{record of}} the disease itself is in the Sakikku, a Babylonian cuneiform medical text from 10671046 BC. This text gives signs and symptoms, details treatment and likely outcomes, and describes many features of the different seizure types. As the Babylonians had no biomedical {{understanding of the nature}} of disease, they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means. Around 900 BC, Punarvasu Atreya described epilepsy as loss of consciousness; this definition was carried <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita (about 400 BC).|$|E
60|$|The {{boarders}} swarmed {{over the}} fence like monkeys, Squire and Gray fired again, and yet again; three men fell, one <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the enclosure, two back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened than hurt, for {{he was on his}} feet again in a crack, and instantly disappeared among the trees.|$|R

5|$|The post-patent {{negotiations}} {{were led by}} Moe Nadler. D'Amour no longer had leverage with a patent, but still demanded that Canadian Lady stop using the designs, and return the pattern templates. Moe Nadler ignored this demand and instead successfully acquired the Canadian, European, and Asian rights to the Wonderbra trademarks. This allowed the company to move <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the 1960s with the brand intact. By the mid-1960s Canadian Lady was exporting and licensing the Wonderbra line to Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, Israel and the West Indies. In the 1970s, Canadelle acquired the remaining worldwide rights to the trademark, and licensed Giltex (a Canadian pantyhose manufacturer acquired by Sara Lee in the 1980s) to use the Wonderbra brand on hosiery in Canada.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the division's positions, the 1st Brigade was brought <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> {{the front lines}} overnight. The next day, an attack was launched by the brigade's 1st Wellington Battalion. Supported by artillery, which suppressed an attack made by the Germans minutes {{before the start of}} the battalion's advance from Flers Village, Grove Alley was captured. That evening the weather deteriorated and over the next few days rain filled trenches and shell holes, and turned the ground to thick mud. The New Zealanders were continually harassed by German artillery and localised attacks from the spur overlooking Grove Alley. Despite the conditions, the 1st Brigade carried out operations to {{strengthen the}} division's exposed left flank, but it remained vulnerable to enfilade fire from the German positions.|$|E
5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward the icon that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it <b>forward</b> <b>into</b> the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring pushed {{the firing pin}} <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the bomb, which ignited the {{propellant}} in the bomb and launched {{it out of the}} trough and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew the firing pin backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.|$|R
50|$|Early designs often {{featured}} multiple weapons mounts, {{and this}} concept was carried <b>forwards</b> <b>into</b> the early interwar years in Britain, Germany and the Soviet Union, arguably reaching its most absurd {{expression in the}} British 'Vickers A1E1 Independent tank, though this attempt was soon abandoned while the Soviet Union's similar effort produced a 'land battleship' which was actually produced and fought in defence of the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|World War II is over, and Nazi {{officials}} remove Adolf Hitler's living {{head and}} hide {{it in the}} fictional South American country of Mandoras, {{so that they can}} resurrect the Third Reich for the future. Fast <b>forwarding</b> <b>into</b> the 1960s, the surviving officials kidnap a scientist in an attempt to keep Hitler alive. Various intelligence agencies, aware of the evil plot, recruit secret agents to bust the Nazi officials.|$|R
