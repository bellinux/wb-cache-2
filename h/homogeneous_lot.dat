Forest regrowth was encouraged by managing the natural growth of the local fallow vegetation and by bringing in seeds and other propagules from forest islands of Benin. The succession to shade-tolerant woody forest species of Guineo-Congolian origin {{at the expense of}} extra-regional herbs, the co-existence of species with slightly different requirements, and the fate of exotic trees in this natural forest are described. A quantitative assessment of a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>lot</b> indicated 397 trees per ha, with stem diameters > 10 cm, 43. 7 % of them below 20 cm, and a rich undergrowth of 72600 smaller plants per ha, proof of active rejuvenation. Only 4. 2 % of all plants resulted from the 1041 introduction events, i. e., species per date, mostly of the 253 plant species that were new to Drabo. A total of 635 species were recorded, but 50 did not survive and four are yet to be identified. In June 2016, the total of 581 known living species included 224 trees. Among all plants, 244 hailed from the Guineo-Congolian zone with 17 of Upper Guinean and four of Lower Guinean origin, 113 from the three savannah zones, and 224 were of extra-regional origin. Overall, 72. 8 % of all woody plants, such as many climbers, all shrubs and trees, were of forest and savanna origin (GC, SG, SZ and S), whereas 70. 4 % of all herbs came from other regions (At, PAL and Pt). Only 7. 0 % of all species from the GC zone were in decline; but the further away the plants originated from, the larger the decline in numbers and vigour, up to 64. 6 % among plants of pan-tropical origin. Particularly pan-tropical herbs became ever rarer, with 80. 0 % of them declining and confined to the few open spaces along paths. In 2017 the forest harboured 52 threatened species, with threat categories EW, CR, EN or VU on the Red List of Benin, out of 73 IUCN-listed species that could possibly survive in Drabo. Some of these species occur in only one or two other locations in Benin. The biodiversity richness of the rehabilitated forests of Drabo now rivals that of natural rainforest remnants of the region. As the surrounding landscape becomes ever more impoverished because of the high human population and its ever increasing impact, the maintenance of such managed islands of biodiversity is critical. By establishing rare local species from other locations we can compensate for direct human destruction and long-term stochastic loss of species in this highly fragmented landscape where natural seed dispersal is difficult.

40|$|Highly stable {{inbred lines}} were {{utilized}} {{in determining the}} mode of inheritance of resistance to bacterial wilt in maize caused by Phytomonas stewarti. The disease was produced artifically, each plant being inoculated {{by means of a}} hypodermic syringe. With the exception of certain tests of F 2 and back-cross progeny, a single highly virulent strain of the organism was used throughout. Many crosses were made between inbreds of various degrees of resistance and tested for dominance relations. In general, the crosses were approximately equal in resistance to that of the more resistant parent involved. A few of the crosses between inbreds intermediate in resistance, however, were more resistant than either of the parents. This was attributed to supplementary action of resistance factors. Inheritance studies were chiefly confined to the analysis of the later generation progenies of two crosses: OSF, a very resistant inbred of dent corn, x WF, a very susceptible inbred of flint corn, and OSF x W- 134, a very susceptible inbred of early yellow sweet corn. Tests of the F 1 progeny showed that dominance of resistance was fairly complete. Backcross progeny (F 1 x susceptible) of both crosses could readily be divided into four equal groups on the basis of resistance and susceptibility: Very resistant, moderately resistant, susceptible and very susceptible. It was assumed that these different degrees of resistance were due to the independent segregation of two supplementary factors, Sw 1 and Sw 2, completely dominant over their recessive alleles, sw 1 and sw 2, respectively. Accordingly, the very resistant genotypes contain both Sw 1 and Sw 2, moderately resistant genotypes contain only Sw 1, susceptible genotypes possess Sw 2 alone, and the very susceptible genotypes are double recessive, containing neither of the two dominant factors. In certain of the backcross tests made under different environmental conditions, it was evident that each of the four groups was not a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>lot.</b> Each could be subdivided into two groups, one being slightly higher in resistance than the other. This indicated that a third minor supplementary factor, Sw 3, was involved. According to the data this factor, when alone, produces a degree of resistance only slightly higher than that exhibited by the triple recessive types and when in combination with either or both Sw 1 or Sw 2 modifies their expression by slightly increasing resistance. Results of F 2 tests and tests of F 3 and backcross families substantiated the above factorial hypothesis. It was concluded, therefore, that at least three (two major and one minor) dominant, independently inherited, supplementary factors are involved in the inheritance of resistance to bacterial wilt in maize. The presence of all three factors either in heterozygous or homozygous dominant conditions (Sw 1 sw 1 Sw 2 sw 2 Sw 3 sw 3 or Sw 1 Sw 1 Sw 2 Sw 2 Sw 3 Sw 3) results in a high degree of resistance, whereas the triple recessive condition (sw 1 sw 1 sw 2 sw 2 sw 3 sw 3) results in a high degree of susceptibility. The various intermediate degrees of resistance or susceptibility between these two extremes may be explained by the presence of only one dominant factor or the different possible combinations of any two. It was demonstrated that the parental combinations, red cob color and resistance, and white cob color and susceptibility, were more frequent in the backcross and F 2 progeny than the non-parental. This signifies that one of the factors for resistance is genetically linked with the P-gene for cob color. The frequency of the non-parental types indicates that the linkage is not very close. It was also shown that the parental combinations, late maturity and resistance, and early maturity and susceptibility, tend to remain together in the later generation progenies. This might be attributed to genetic linkage, but it is possible that certain factors for early maturity may also modify resistance. Endosperm characters such as yellow or white color and starchy or sugary texture seemed to assort independently of resistance...|$|E
40|$|Supply chains which {{handle and}} process bulk {{materials}} such as food ingredients and food stuffs have unique needs and challenges. Bulk material supply chains are characterized by the aggregation of large, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>lots</b> of product intended for {{a wide spectrum of}} end uses. Transportation and storage functions are also completed within a large-scale system, which add complexity to the management of these types of supply chains (Thakur 2 Ì† 6 Hurburgh, 2009). Uncertainty and risk management are especially challenging. The systems approach of engineering technology offers strategies for managing operations, risk and uncertainty in bulk materials supply chains. Furthermore, engineering technology graduates often possess the necessary disciplinary background and skills to potentially assume leadership roles within the bulk materials production system. Yet, the preparation of technical professionals remains largely unfilled in both higher education and in workplace training programs. This paper will discuss the challenges and needs of process industry supply chains, potential engineering technology solutions, and outline the strategies used to define core learning competencies for curricular and training programs intended for several diverse groups of learners. Implications for the field of engineering technology will conclude the paper...|$|R

Optimal {{subdivision}} {{of land in}} {{agrarian reform}} projects: an analysis using genetic algorithms. Cien. Inv. Agr. 38 (2) : 169 - 178. The objective of this manuscript {{is to develop a}} new procedure to achieve optimal land subdivision using genetic algorithms (GA). The genetic algorithm was tested in the rural settlement of Veredas, located in Minas Gerais, Brazil. This implementation was based on the land aptitude and its productivity index. The sequence of tests in the study was carried out in two areas with eight different agricultural aptitude classes, including one area of 391. 88 ha subdivided into 12 lots and another of 404. 1763 ha subdivided into 14 lots. The effectiveness of the method was measured using the shunting line standard value of a parceled area lot`s productivity index. To evaluate each parameter, a sequence of 15 calculations was performed to record the best individual fitness average (MMI) found for each parameter variation. The best parameter combination found in testing and used to generate the new parceling with the GA was the following: 320 as the generation number, a population of 40 individuals, 0. 8 mutation tax, and a 0. 3 renewal tax.

In this goal, on the paternal line there have been used male sires from the Texel breeds and on the maternal line there were used local females from the Merinos de Palas, Tigaie and Turcana races. The obtained lambs have been left together with the mother sheep until the age of 60 days when the weaning. From that moment been made the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>lots</b> witch were submissive to an intensive technology of fattening with a total duration of 85 days, from witch: for starting, 60 days for fattening and 15 days for finishing.

Although effective against systemic damages, conventional antivenoms have limited efficacy against local tissue damage. Additionally, the hypersensitivity reactions, often elicited by antivenoms, {{the high costs}} for animal maintenance, the difficulty of producing <b>homogeneous</b> <b>lots,</b> and the instability of biological products instigate the search for innovative products for antivenom therapy. In this study, camelid antibody fragments (VHH) with specificity to Bothropstoxin I and II (BthTX-I and BthTX-II), two myotoxic phospholipases from Bothrops jararacussu venom, were selected from an immune VHH phage display library. After biopanning, 28 and 6 clones recognized BthTX-I and BthTX-II by ELISA, respectively. Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and immunoglobulin frameworks (FRs) of 13 VHH-deduced amino acid sequences were identified, {{as well as the}} camelid hallmark amino acid substitutions in FR 2. Three VHH clones (KF 498607, KF 498608, and KC 329718) were capable of recognizing BthTX-I by Western blot and showed affinity constants in the nanomolar range against both toxins. VHHs inhibited the BthTX-II phospholipase A 2 activity, and when tested for cross-reactivity, presented specificity to the Bothrops genus in ELISA. Furthermore, two clones (KC 329718 and KF 498607) neutralized the myotoxic effects induced by B. jararacussu venom, BthTX-I, BthTX-II, and by a myotoxin from Bothrops brazili venom (MTX-I) in mice. Molecular docking revealed that VHH CDRs are expected to bind the C-terminal of both toxins, essential for myotoxic activity, and to epitopes in the BthTX-II enzymatic cleft. Identified VHHs could be a biotechnological tool to improve the treatment for snake envenomation, an important and neglected world public health problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demand for a}} high and homogeneous technological quality of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) points out the necessity of improving wheat with by a higher protein (GPC) and gluten content, strength of dough (W) and dough stability. Among the current crop practices, late-season nitrogen (N) fertilization, from heading to flowering, is generally considered the practice that has the most effects on the storage proteins and technological quality of the grain. In order to explore the influence late-season N application can have on the dough properties and on the formation of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>lots</b> in more detail, a research was set up between 2007 and 2013, over 6 growing seasons at different sites in North West Italy using the Bologna cultivar {{in each of the}} trials. Three different late-season N fertilization strategies were compared: T 1, control without a late distribution of N; T 2, foliar N fertilization at flowering; T 3, top-dress granular soil fertilization at the beginning of heading. A randomized complete block experimental design with four replicates was adopted. The grain yield, GPC, W and P/L indexes were analyzed. Moreover, the rheological and enzymatic properties of the samples were studied using a MixolabÂ® analyser (ChÃ²pin Technologies, Paris, France). Grain yield was found to be unaffected by the fertilization treatments, while the late N application (T 2, T 3) significantly increased GPC. Only the granular N fertilization (T 3) increased the W index compared to T 1, while the P/L index was not affected by any of the fertilization strategies. Furthermore, the T 3 strategy was always more effective in reducing the variability of the W index than the T 2 and the T 1 strategies. Water absorption and dough development time were higher in T 3, than in T 1, while intermediate results were reached for T 2. The effect of late-season N fertilization was also significant on the starch behaviour of the dough, as an increase in starch gelatinization and retrogradation was observed. In short, the top-dress granular N fertilizer applied at the beginning of heading (T 3) led to a more constant increase in GPC and flour rheological quality than the foliar application. Moreover, the adoption of this fertilization strategy resulted in a reduction in qualitative variability under different environmental and soil conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the ovarian {{response}} and the percentage of gestation in Mexican tropic's heifers treated with melengestrol acetate (MGA). The work took place in the municipality of Tzitzio, MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico. Twenty-five, 43 Â± 4. 6 months old heifers, weighting 312. 72 Â± 25. 78 kg, and recording 3. 0 Â± 0. 25 of body condition were feded with 0. 5 mg of MGA pre-blended with 250 g of supplement through 21 days. At the end of the treatment the heifers ovaries were observed over ultrasonography daily until the ovulation time, and then four more times every 5 days to observe the corpus luteum development. The heifers were direct mated, and 88 % of them revealed dominant follicle post- treatment, and had their ovulation on the fifth to tenth day, focused on the eighth day (72. 7 %). Most of them (95. 5 %) were pregnant after the mating; realizing that ovaric response of the heifers treated with MGA at a dose of 0. 5 mg per day through 21 days standarize the estrous advent. Moreover, it shows that the ovum have the conditions to be fertilized. The MGA may be used as an important constituent to perform a strategy to achieve <b>homogeneous</b> calves <b>lots</b> in suitable times for production, thus contributing to the Mexican tropic's livestock reproductive parameters improvement...|$|R

Firstly, to select, {{stabilise}} and bottle suitable materials containing ca. 1 %, 5 % and 30 % total trans fatty acids (TFA) and demonstrate that packaging and storage does not affect oil composition, and secondly, to demonstrate that participating laboratories are able to achieve sufficient conformity of test results. Stabilising oil samples with tert. butylhydroquinone (250 mg/kg) and packaging in inert atmosphere in amber glass ampoules resulted in <b>homogeneous</b> and stable <b>lots</b> of preliminary test materials. Analytical precision of chromatographic methods to determine trans fatty acids (TFA) was acceptable (RSD(R) 1 g/ 100 g, but for levels 40 %). Misidentification of peaks and inconsistent peak integration practices {{are considered to be}} the major reasons for deviating results reported by the participants. Results obtained by chromatographic methods were in close agreement with those produced by spectroscopy (IR and NMR), thus proving that the applied chromatographic methods were not systematically biased. The intercomparison has to be repeated with new sets of samples. Special emphasis will be placed on the correct identification of trans polyenes in order to improve precision for low levels of TFA.

40|$|Overseas {{imports of}} {{soybeans}} from Brazil, the US and Argentina to Europe are increasing every year. Simultaneously, GMO farming {{in these countries}} is being expanded ever further. European farming of protein crops especially soybeans is being pushed by organizations and protein initiatives for economical and ecological reasons. In 2015 soybean acreages expanded drastically due to the additional Greening political measures which came into force. Therefore it is worth asking about the potential of a European non-GMO soybean market. The aim of this thesis was {{to work out the}} principal chances and limitations of a European soybean market under the current agricultural political conditions. Moreover, it should be discussed how many of the imported soybean commodities, of which more than 85 % are from overseas, could be replaced by soybeans planted in Europe. In order {{to get to the bottom}} of the interests in this market from the perspective of the market actors, ten interviews were carried out. The result made it clear. European soybeans cannot yet compete with the overseas soybeans in terms of quantity (homogenous commodity lot sizes), price and even quality (mainly protein content). Thats why European non-GMO soybeans are not yet of high importance on the most important consumer market, which is the feed market, as large processors favor <b>homogeneous</b> <b>lots</b> and a reliably supply of commodities as to avoid volatile qualities in production. The greatest constraint comes from the limited availability of arable land in Europe as well as from a lack of early maturing soybeans that are well adapted to the European growing conditions. The restricted availability of arable land lead to a competitive situation with other cash crops such as corn, but according to the results of this thesis, soybean growingÂ’s result in lower revenues and are therefore economical less competitive than corn. Thus, output (income) optimizing farmers under todayÂ’s conditions decide not to replace corn by soybeans. Furthermore, a limited practice experience in less experienced relatively new soybean growing regions slow down the development of a competitive European soybean market. Moreover, an insufficiently established non-GMO soybean industry hinder the market development due to difficulties of coexisting GMO and non-GMO commodities. Separated product flows in non-GMO processing plants, wholesale and collection points, are segments within the value chain which need to be further promoted for this market development. The zero tolerance regarding GMO traces in seed has been analyzed as a market barrier especially in the plant breeding industry. Thus, the thesis argued to establish a feasible GMO threshold value for seed as is already legal for food and feed. This is mentioned as a political constraint primarily, as well as too little effort towards specifically promoting a regional protein strategy, if more independence from overseas imports will be achieved. On the other hand, chances for the European soybean market are expected, as long as added value can be generated through special marketing programs, particularly trademarks. This means marketing products at higher prices according to regionality and non-GMO labelling. Therewith, a distribution of additional costs for testing and separation along the value chain could be achieved. Especially the Danube Soya Association is being described as a driving force. They mobilize market agents along the value-added chain, help to create uniform standards, test and monitors soybean commodities to be non-GMO and are finally labeled as such. In this way the non-GMO separation needs to be extended by European regulation to simplify the process to reach a European non-GMO soybean market. The consumers demand for local or organic products is constantly increasing. Consequently, non-GMO soybean components are being asked for in animal feed. A significant market opportunity for soybeans is that they are not really replaceable (in terms of quality) by any other protein crop without needing to reduce the economic efficiency of animal production. Therefore, the potential for demand is there principally. The analysis of the application of non-GMO feed shows that this is only of importance in smaller amounts in a few countries within Europe. Significant animal producing countries such as the Netherlands and Spain have no interest in non-GMO products. Thus, the intentions behind the European non-GMO soybean market, such as more independence from overseas imports, are likewise limited to specific regions of Europe. The European soybean production possibilities are economical and geographical limited and would not be able to do much more than satisfy certain consumer niches who are willing to pay the added value for non-GMO products...|$|R
