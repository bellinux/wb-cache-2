5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, the city of Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which {{would come to}} be known as Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along the valley of the Sambre and Meuse rivers – the sillon <b>industriel</b> ("industrial valley") – became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{is usually}} {{considered}} to have been spread from Britain to Belgium by two British industrialists, William and John Cockerill, who moved to Liège in 1807 and formed a company producing industrial machinery and iron. Industrial development was possible in Belgium because of large coal deposits located in the Sillon <b>industriel</b> along the Sambre-Meuse river valley. Although the town of Ghent, a centre of cotton production in Flanders, industrialised rapidly, {{the effects of the}} Industrial Revolution were most felt in Wallonia, particularly in the cities of Mons, Charleroi, Liège and Verviers. By the 1840s, Cockerill was the world's largest manufacturer of steel. Belgium also rapidly developed a large railway system. From the outset, the Belgian state supported the construction of railways, envisaging a railway link between the industrial region of Mons and the port of Antwerp via Brussels. The first stretch of this line, one of the first railways in Europe, opened in 1835 between Brussels and Mechelen.|$|E

25|$|For 50 {{years through}} World War II, French-speaking Wallonia was a {{technically}} advanced, industrial region, with its industry concentrated along the sillon <b>industriel,</b> while Dutch-speaking Flanders was predominantly agricultural with some industry, mainly processing agricultural products and textiles. This disparity {{began to fade}} during the interwar period. When Belgium emerged from World War II with its industrial infrastructure relatively undamaged thanks to the Galopin doctrine, {{the stage was set}} for a period of rapid development, particularly in Flanders. The postwar boom years, enhanced by the establishment of the European Union and NATO headquarters in Brussels, contributed to the rapid expansion of light industry throughout most of Flanders, particularly along a corridor stretching between Brussels and Antwerp, which is the second largest port in Europe after Rotterdam.|$|E
25|$|The modern, private {{enterprise}} economy of Belgium has capitalised on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. The first country to undergo an industrial revolution {{on the continent}} of Europe in the early 19th century, Belgium developed an excellent transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways, and highways to integrate its industry with that of its neighbors. Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flanders in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Liège and Charleroi, along the sillon <b>industriel.</b> Belgium imports raw materials and semi-finished goods that are further processed and re-exported. Except for its coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural resources other than fertile soils. Nonetheless, most traditional industrial sectors are represented in the economy, including steel, textiles, refining, chemicals, food processing, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, electronics, and machinery fabrication. Despite the heavy industrial component, services account for 74.9% of GDP, while agriculture accounts for only 1% of GDP.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the war, Belgium {{had been}} {{regarded}} as the foremost European country for the manufacture of armaments. Its Sillon <b>industriel,</b> or industrial valley, {{was one of the}} first fully industrialized and mechanized regions in Europe. The Poudreries Réunies de Belgique was among the oldest armament manufacturers on the Continent, known for its manufacture of mortars, artillery shells, and land mines. Graham Spicer, an official in the Ministry of Munitions who had worked in Belgium before the war and knew its armaments manufacturing capabilities, suggested that perhaps the Belgians might be able to help. An approach was made, and the result was that 1000 skilled Belgian armaments workers volunteered help train other volunteers. As the result of another suggestion (possibly from Spicer as well) most of these volunteers were drawn from the pool of soldiers who had been badly wounded at the front and declared unfit to return there; they were not so unfit they could not do a job of work, but were not capable of resuming life at the Front.|$|E

2500|$|Wallonia is landlocked, with {{an area of}} , or 55 {{percent of}} the total area of Belgium. The Sambre and Meuse valley, from Liège (...) to Charleroi (...) is an entrenched river in a fault line which {{separates}} Middle Belgium (elevation [...] ) and High Belgium (...) [...] This fault line corresponds to a part of the southern coast of the late London-Brabant Massif. The valley, along with Haine and Vesdre valleys form the sillon <b>industriel,</b> the historical centre of the Belgian coalmining and steelmaking industry, and is also called the Walloon industrial backbone. [...] Due to their long industrial historic record, several segments of the valley have received specific names: Borinage, around Mons, le Centre, around La Louvière, the Pays noir, around Charleroi and the Basse-Sambre, near Namur.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the north}} of the Sambre and Meuse valley lies the Central Belgian plateau, which is {{characterized}} by intensive agriculture. The Walloon part of this plateau is traditionally divided into several regions: Walloon Brabant around Nivelles, [...] Western Hainaut ( [...] , around Tournai), and Hesbaye around Waremme. [...] South of the sillon <b>industriel,</b> the land is more rugged and is characterized by more extensive farming. It is traditionally divided into the regions of Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse, Condroz, Fagne-Famenne, the Ardennes and Land of Herve, as well as the Belgian Lorraine around Arlon and Virton. Dividing it into Condroz, Famenne, Calestienne, Ardennes (including Thiérache), and Belgian Lorraine (which includes the Gaume) is more reflective of the physical geography. [...] The larger region, the Ardennes, is a thickly forested plateau with caves and small gorges. [...] It is host to much of Belgium's wildlife but little agricultural capacity. This area extends westward into France and eastward to the Eifel in Germany via the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms the highest point in Belgium at 694 metres (2,277ft).|$|E
2500|$|Wallonia {{exemplified}} {{the radical}} evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word [...] "houille" [...] was coined in Wallonia), the region geared {{up to become}} the 2nd industrial {{power in the world}} after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its Sillon <b>industriel,</b> 'Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, (...) there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'. Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: [...] "It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain." [...] "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of Ghent." [...] Michel De Coster, Professor at the Université de Liège wrote also: [...] "The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory (...) But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." ...|$|E
