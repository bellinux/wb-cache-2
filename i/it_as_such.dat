5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such.</b> The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such.</b> Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E

During the interview for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Schmidt stated that the software company would have strong competition against Apple, the designer of the iPad line of tablets. While he did not refer to <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such,</b> the device was inferred {{to be part of}} the Google Nexus series of consumer devices using the Android operating system and built by a partnering original equipment manufacturer (OEM).|$|E

5|$|The German-speaking {{scientists}} who isolated and described vitaminK (in addition to naming <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such)</b> {{did so because}} the vitamin is intimately involved in the coagulation of blood following wounding (from the German word Koagulation). At the time, most (but not all) of the letters from F through to J were already designated, so {{the use of the}} letter K was considered quite reasonable. The table nomenclature of reclassified vitamins lists chemicals that had previously been classified as vitamins, as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the B-complex.|$|E
5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such.</b> Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} most {{familiar}} with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such.</b>|$|E

5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such,</b> and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
5|$|Lem {{was awarded}} an honorary {{membership}} in the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA Honorary membership is given {{to people who do}} not meet the publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, but who would be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action that some of the SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke, and it seems that Lem interpreted <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such.</b> Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined. After many members (including Ursula K. Le Guin) protested against Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.|$|E

The following day, Congress adopted and transmitted to the Department of State a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth Amendment {{to be a part of}} the Constitution and directing the Secretary of State to promulgate <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such.</b> Both New Jersey and Ohio were named in the congressional resolution as having ratified the amendment, although Alabama was also named, making 29 states total.|$|E

5|$|The {{subspecies}} Oryzomys couesi pinicola {{was described}} in 1932 from a pine ridge in western British Honduras (now Belize); it is smaller and darker than nominate couesi, which also occurs in Belize, and has a more delicate skull. In 1901, Merriam described the Oryzomys of the island of Cozumel as a separate species, Oryzomys cozumelae, and Goldman kept <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such</b> because of its large size, dark fur, and long tail. In 1965, however, Knox Jones and Timothy Lawlor judged the differences between cozumelae and mainland couesi trivial and found that cozumelae was inside the range of variation of mainland Oryzomys populations; accordingly, they demoted the island form to a subspecies. Mark Engstrom and colleagues, writing in 1989, reaffirmed this conclusion. For an island form, this population is highly genetically variable. In its Cytb sequence data, it falls among populations of nominate couesi. Oryzomys couesi is also found on Turneffe Atoll {{off the coast of}} Belize and Roatán off Honduras.|$|E
5|$|The white-eyed river {{martin was}} seen in Thailand in 1972, 1977 and 1980, but not {{definitely}} since. There are unconfirmed sightings from Thailand in 1986 and Cambodia in 2004. It is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). This designation means that a species' numbers have decreased, or will decrease, by 80% within three generations. This species may be extinct, but the IUCN will not categorise <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such</b> until extensive targeted surveys have been conducted. Despite legal protection under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement, it was captured by locals along with other swallows for sale as food or for release by devout Buddhists. Following its discovery by ornithologists, trappers {{were reported to have}} caught as many as 120 and sold them to the director of the Nakhon Sawan Fisheries Station who was unable to keep them alive in captivity. The small population may therefore have become non-viable.|$|E

The Short Shetland and Short Seaford were rejected as replacements for the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. A maritime version of the promising Avro Lincoln {{had yet to be}} ordered by the time the Lend-Lease programme ended in August 1945. The Short Sunderland was forced to continue as the main operational type until the end of 1946. Most of the aircraft that operated in the command were the Second World War types; the Spitfire, Lancaster, Mosquito and Beaufighter.|$|E

5|$|Upon his {{election}} to the presidency, Bolivia was South America's poorest nation. Morales' government did not initiate any fundamental change in Bolivia's economic structure, and in their National Development Plan (PDN) for 2006–10, they adhered largely to the country's previous liberal economic model. Bolivia's economy was based largely on the extraction of natural resources, with the nation having South America's second largest reserves of natural gas. As per {{his election}} pledge, Morales took increasing state control of this hydrocarbon industry with Supreme Decree 2870; previously, corporations paid 18% of their profits to the state, but Morales symbolically reversed this, so that 82% of profits went {{to the state and}} 18% to the companies. The oil companies threatened to take the case to the international courts or cease operating in Bolivia, but ultimately relented. Thus, where Bolivia had received $173 million from hydrocarbon extraction in 2002, by 2006 they received $1.3 billion. Although not technically a form of nationalization, Morales and his government referred to <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>such,</b> resulting in criticism from sectors of the Bolivian left. In June 2006, Morales announced his desire to nationalize mining, electricity, telephones, and railroads, and in February 2007 nationalized the Vinto metallurgy plant, refusing to compensate Glencore, which the government asserted had obtained the contract illegally. Although the FSTMB miners' federation called for the government to nationalise the mines, the government did not do so, instead stating that any transnational corporations operating in Bolivia legally would not be expropriated.|$|E
