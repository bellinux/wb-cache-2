50|$|Cedar Rapids {{first began}} play in 1890 and have played 110 seasons through 2015. The {{franchise}} {{has been a}} member of various leagues preceding the Midwest League. They have been a member of the Central Association (1949), Western League (1934-1937), Mississippi Valley League (1922-1932), Central Association (1913-1917), Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League (1901-1909, 1920-1921, 1938-1942, 1950-1961), Western Association (1896-1899), Eastern Iowa League (1895) and the Illinois-Iowa League (1890-1891). The team also had numbeous nicknames prior to joining the Midwest League: Cedar Rapids Braves (1958-1962), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1953-1957), <b>Cedar</b> Rapids <b>Indians</b> (1950-1952), <b>Cedar</b> Rapids Rockets (1949), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1934-1942), Cedar Rapids Red Raiders (1963-1964), Cedar Rapids Bunnies (1904-1932), Cedar Rapids Rabbits (1896-1903) and Cedar Rapids Canaries (1890-1891).|$|R

50|$|Named for James Gaines, a {{merchant}} {{who signed the}} Texas Declaration of Independence and was born in Culpeper County, Virginia in 1779. The land was occupied purely by wild Comanche and Mexican Comancheros, traders who had a thriving business with the Plains Indians. In October 1875, Lt. Bullis who commanded the 24th Infantry encountered {{a large group of}} <b>Indians</b> at <b>Cedar</b> Lake. Lt. Bullis took over the Indians for food, supplies, buffalo hides, and utensils. It was then that Col. Shafter established a camp at Cedar Lake and continued to scout the area as far south as the Pecos River. That November he came across a draw where he found a water development. He discovered over 70 wells that reached levels 4 to 15 feet deep. This area became a regular place to trade goods.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} before he was married, Hennings {{completed}} his first prints, eight lithographs of various Southwestern subjects. The prints were made on zinc plates and printed in Chicago. Six of the lithographs; Across the Sage, The Frozen Stream, Through Sage and <b>Cedar,</b> <b>Indian</b> Bake Ovens, Beneath the Cottonwoods, and The Hunters, were first printed in an edition of 50, and later in a second edition of 100. The prints Taos Indian and Indian Maiden were produced in a more limited number. Hennings only completed one other print project, which consisted of four monotypes.|$|R
50|$|Because of its archaeological significance, {{the site}} was {{designated}} a State Historical Monument in 1970 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Edge of <b>Cedars</b> <b>Indian</b> Ruin in 1971. In 1974, the Utah Navajo Development Council donated the 6.65 acre site to the Division of Utah State Parks and Recreation. Shortly thereafter the Utah Legislature enabled the establishment of Edge of the Cedars State Park as a museum of Indian history and culture. The museum opened in 1978. The archaeological repository was completed in 1994. Today, the facility serves as the primary repository for archaeological materials excavated from public lands in southeast Utah, and includes archives and a research library.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although {{construction}} {{activities and}} urban land are frequently cited as causes of increased suspended-sediment transport, sediment loads have rarely been quantified from urbanizing watersheds since the widespread implementation of erosion-control practices at construction sites. In {{cooperation with the}} Johnson County Stormwater Management Program, the U. S. Geological Survey studied sediment transport across a continuum of land-use conditions (rural, urbanizing, urban) and watershed scales (3 - 66 mi 2) within Johnson County, Kansas. Suspended-sediment samples were collected along with continuous monitoring of streamflow and turbidity to characterize suspended-sediment transport at nine stream sites within an urbanizing, 57 -mi 2 watershed (Mill Creek) {{as well as from}} the four other largest (49 - 66 mi 2) watersheds (Blue River, <b>Cedar,</b> <b>Indian,</b> and Kill Creeks) in Johnson County. Simple linear regression analysis between turbidity and suspended-sediment concentration was used to compute sediment loads in 5 - to 15 -minute increments at monitoring sites. Sediment yields from the smallest watersheds (3 - 12 mi 2) with increased construction activity within the Mill Creek watershed were approximately two-three times larger than those from established urban or rural watersheds. Sediment concentrations at these sites were larger fo...|$|R
40|$|Salmonid fishes {{are known}} to inhabit streams with ambient summer {{temperatures}} approaching or exceeding lethal limits. Under these conditions, localized areas of cool water facilitate the persistence of coldwater fishes, but these may be altered in regulated rivers. In this study we examined the variation in brown trout behavioral thermoregulation within three streams of the Hudson River drainage, the <b>Cedar,</b> <b>Indian</b> and Hudson Rivers, the latter {{two of which are}} impacted by recreational discharge events from an upstream dam that supports a summer whitewater rafting industry. We were particularly interested in evaluating the potential of thermal refugia dilution by these flow releases. Based on both laboratory derived tolerance values and field-based thresholds that incorporated metrics of temperature magnitude, duration, and fluctuation, all three rivers were thermally marginal for brown trout during the summers of 2005 and 2006. Behavioral thermoregulation was observed by adult brown trout in our study in all river reaches, albeit infrequently in the Indian River. We found that brown trout in the Cedar River (38 %) were more often observed with body temperatures cooler than ambient river temperature than those in either the Hudson (29 %) or Indian Rivers (4 %). Fewer than 50 % of stocked fish persisted over a 67 day period in all three of our study reaches. Persistence of stocked brown trout in the Cedar River in 2006 was greater than in either the Hudson or Indian Rivers in both 2005 and 2006. While recreational discharge events did not alter the mean or maximum daily temperature in either the mainstem Indian or Hudson River reaches, the patches of relatively cool water near tributary confluences were diluted by release events. Both daily temperature maxima and ranges increased significantly at these locations in concert with recreational flow releases. Recreational flow releases were not an important factor accounting for the thermal behavior of brown trout during any time period in the reference Cedar River reach (without dam releases); however, behavioral thermoregulation was reduced during flow releases in both the Indian and Hudson River reaches. In the absence of recreational discharge events, the most important factors affecting behavioral thermoregulation were whether a fish was located near a tributary confluence and the ambient river temperature. Brown trout were consistently cooler relative to ambient river temperature when located near tributaries during times when river temperature was within the upper critical range for brown trout. Behavioral thermoregulation increased as river thermal conditions became more stressful. Our results suggest that accessible thermal refuge areas are important resources that provide brown trout a haven from lethal summer temperature conditions in thermally marginal streams, such as these study reaches in the Upper Hudson River drainage. When low flow conditions correspond with peak summer temperatures, these refuge areas are likely most important and most vulnerable to altered flow regimes. Our results showed that pulsed discharge events altered both the thermal characteristics of refuge areas at tributary confluences and behavioral thermoregulation by stocked brown trout. Although poor survival of these trout in the affected reaches may be due to severe summer temperatures regardless of recreational releases, the observed reduction in behavioral thermoregulation suggests that pulsed discharge events may impair the ability of coldwater fish to survive in regulated systems...|$|R
