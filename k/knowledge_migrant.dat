30|$|Particularly amongst {{highly skilled}} immigrants, {{there may also}} be people with high {{entrepreneurial}} ability. In some cases, however, policy hinders the implementation of entrepreneurial activities. Migrants entering on a work visa, for example, may not be allowed to start a business while on this specific visa. This may be a waste of their potential contribution to the local economy. An example from The Netherlands is that of “knowledge migrants” who are only allowed to work for their current employer. They are not allowed to start their own business next to this employment while on a <b>knowledge</b> <b>migrant</b> visa. At the same time, it is common for academics to start their own (consultancy) business next to their university work; this type of entrepreneurship is, however, restricted in the case of The Netherlands (Marchand and Siegel 2015).|$|E

As being a relatively new and young group within the Dutch context, insight of the migration group gives information about oversee Chinese and the debate surrounding migration. On a theoretical level, this thesis examines the concepts transnationalism and flexible citizenship. But this thesis comes {{to the conclusion that the}} deep bond between Chinese <b>knowledge</b> <b>migrants</b> and China has to be explained, not through national differences, but through the differences in civilizations. The Chinese socialization mechanism is described through the eyes of Chinese <b>knowledge</b> <b>migrants</b> in concepts like Xiao. Chinese <b>knowledge</b> <b>migrants</b> go where their opportunities are greatest, but this is not something new, it is an inherent part of Chinese civilization. This flexibility makes it easy for Chinese to adapt into a new society, also in Dutch society. This leads to the question of integration. Dutch policy towards integration has become more strict; what integration should be is more defined. This opposite to Chinese <b>knowledge</b> <b>migrants</b> attitude towards integration, where emotional integration is absent. This thesis argues that we can learn from Chinese <b>knowledge</b> <b>migrants</b> when looking at integration and knowledge migration; by achieving harmony in society through a thin national identity...|$|R

40|$|Migrant {{children}} from most countries are disadvantaged in school. We investigate which characteristics of both school and societal contexts influence {{the achievements of}} migrant students. We argue that living conditions and inequality in a {{society as a whole}} may affect the chances of minority members and the function that private schools perform in the process of social reproduction of inequality. We investigate in particular the question of whether migrant students attending private schools show a better performance than those attending public schools. The analyses of the paper are based on the data collected in the PISA 2006 survey. Our main results are that the lower mathematics and reading competencies of migrant students can partly be explained by the socioeconomic status and cultural capital of the family and—to a marginal degree—by school characteristics. Initially, students in private independent schools have some advantages that disappear after controlling for country attributes. In both fields of <b>knowledge,</b> <b>migrants</b> obtain better results in private government-dependent schools (interaction effect); this, however, {{can be traced back to}} their families' socioeconomic origin and cultural capital. We detect that students in private independent schools reach lower competency levels in wealthier societies (GNP) ...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} on the economic contribution of individual international labour migrants has been couched largely in terms of skills, and has focused on mobility within transnational corporations. This article explores some of the broader links between the literatures on international migration and management, and addresses four main questions: is <b>migrant</b> <b>knowledge</b> selective, is it distinctive, what are the barriers to <b>migrant</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer {{and what are the}} implications for individual migrants and firms. This largely conceptual review is informed by three main premises: the value of adopting a knowledge as opposed to a skills perspective on migration; the importance of examining the cycle of migration rather than static snapshots at particular stages, and the need to consider inter-firm and extra-firm migration, as well as intra-firm mobility. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. /London School of Economics 2007...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{tendency}} to think in primarily economic terms (e. g., economic and financial opportunities) when considering how major science, technology and business spaces, also known as science parks (e. g., Silicon Valley, USA; Science Vale, UK), attract international <b>knowledge</b> <b>migrants</b> (IKMs) from the global knowledge economy. However, other elements that make places attractive for IKMs to achieve desirable standards of living are often not sufficiently addressed in the recent literature. Using a single case study of the Dutch science park Novel-T, this paper investigates how science parks can deliberately be created to attract and retain IKMs using a new multidimensional model for understanding the attractive effects of science parks on human capital. The fieldwork element involved 20 semi-structured face-to-face interviews, which were analyzed using a narrative analysis technique. The results of the case study show that science parks should be understood as multidimensional networks that trigger both a social attraction effect for IKMs as well as regional economic development and growth. The importance of the spatial design of science parks as well as the creation of a highly international atmosphere were found to be two influential factors in attracting IKMs to a particular science park in a peripheral region. Moreover, the results show that the deliberate construction of a science park with four intended operational effects is not a simple and controllable process, since some operational effects (e. g., external recognition) appear to be more controllable than others (e. g., internal social dynamics) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Highly-skilled {{knowledge}} workers make location {{decisions in}} response to many determinants. This paper seeks to focus on life-time earnings {{and the desire to}} pursue a personal research program – a life-long pursuit of interesting puzzles. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual discussion and approach are taken. Findings – The paper argues that access to personally interesting research problems and institutional support structures which allow them to be pursued should be considered alongside pure earnings factors in understanding why researchers and scientists move internationally – and why they may stay put when the economic incentives to move appear high. A nation's innovation policies can be important for influencing such workers' decisions and the impact of these policies shaped by migration flows. This little-researched connection is explored in the final, policy-oriented section. Originality/value – Provides insights on why, in a world of intensifying competition for scarce knowledge workers, countries can ill afford negative net migration of highly-skilled workers. <b>Knowledge</b> economy, <b>Migrant</b> workers, Skilled workers...|$|R

40|$|Summary: ACCEM is an NGO {{that works}} {{in favour of}} {{refugees}} and immigrants in Spain. Since 1996, ACCEM has developed a strategy of observation that articulates national observation and local observatories. The objective of the local observatories {{is to improve the}} services which are offered to the migrants, thanks to a better knowledge of their needs and to the use of tools of territorial intelligence, CATALYSE and the trees of knowledge. Since 1996, the Gorion national observatory has gathered in Madrid the individual data of migrants from the regional centres and from the different programmes that were carried out by ACCEM. It provides a wider <b>knowledge</b> of the <b>migrants</b> and of their different demand profiles. Thus, it allows better programming the actions. It is also possible to answer the administration, economic actors and local centres demands of information about the actions and programmes. In the same way, two local observatories were developed in GIJÓN and SIGÜENZA in partnership with the local services and the public associations. The objective was to answer in a global way the needs of the migrants whilst establishing and reinforcing the synergies between the services in the respect of the local specificities. They notably improved the <b>knowledge</b> of the <b>migrant</b> population in its diversity within the community.

30|$|According to Choenni (1997), migrant {{entrepreneurship}} {{refers to}} business activities undertaken by migrants {{with a specific}} socio-cultural and ethnic background or migrant origin, and it distinguishes itself from ‘normal’ entrepreneurship through its orientation on migrant products, on migrant market customers, or on indigenous migrant business strategies(see also Sahin et al. 2009, 2010). Migrant entrepreneurship generates many urban-economic returns {{through the use of}} suitable market niches, and helps to reinforce the SME sector as a complement to bigger mainstream companies. In addition, existing business can also benefit from the experience and <b>knowledge</b> of <b>migrant</b> businesses that emerge {{as a consequence of the}} rise of migrant communities, with their protected markets and networks of mutual support. As the migrant share grows and diversifies, the opportunities for related migrant suppliers and customers will also rise (Cormack and Niessen 2002). Nowadays, migrant entrepreneurship is often seen as a great chance for revitalizing urban economic life. The seminal work of Waldinger has been particularly instrumental in this context (see, e.g., Waldinger 19881996;Waldinger et al. 1990). In his view, migrant businesses find their origin in the interplay of opportunity structures, group characteristics, and strategies for adapting to the urban environment.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to examine how adult {{immigrants}} in Romania describe the learning strategies that have helped them integrate in the new culture.

The study employs a qualitative methodology, information has been collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis and a framework approach to data analysis. The key findings of the thesis are that integration through education, specifically through language learning, takes place more effectively if migrants are driven by intrinsic goals or if they internalize the extrinsic rewards that they expect upon completion of their goals. These findings can be put into practice to form better strategies and actions steps in organizational programs that aim at integrating migrants. They can also be brought to the <b>knowledge</b> of <b>migrants</b> looking to successfully integrate, to make them aware of how their choices and goals, even those apparently unrelated, can impact the outcome of their integration efforts...|$|R

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of the knowledge economy and concomitant changes in the areas of technology and globalization of economy and labor market, the migration of knowledge workers and particularly Indian knowledge workers has received a lot of attention. However they are different from traditional migration flows because of the choice of migration destinations, widespread demand for such workers and diminished importance of push factors. Such knowledge workers are highly adaptable and their skills readily transferable to any region of the world. Canada has to firmly establish itself as a foremost destination for <b>migrant</b> <b>knowledge</b> workers and market its attractiveness, with its safe multi-ethnic urban regions, quality of life and strong and stable economy. This is essential in obtaining the desired migrant stocks and flows, but also in securing the highest quality and most desirable <b>migrant</b> <b>knowledge</b> workers. There is considerable discussion regarding the validity and completeness of contemporary migration theories. The analysis presented in the thesis shows the advantages of the use of structuration theory in international migration and extends the claims made by Goss and Lindquist on the validity of use of structuration theory for multi level analysis in the area of international migration. The study highlights the role of structure and agency through interviews of skilled Indian migrants to Canada and subsequent analysis of the data collected. In addition recent studies by the Canadian government, academic research and reports by organizations such as the World Bank have been leveraged to develop the structuration analysis. The study proposes policy changes such as highlighting the attractiveness of Canada as a migration destination at a micro level; develop a robust mechanism for recognizing migrant qualifications, wider deployment of fast track procedures for immigration processing and recognition of migration of semi-finished human capital as a means for meeting labor market needs...|$|R
40|$|Transfer of {{knowledge}} is a complex process. While codified knowledge is easy to transfer, tacit knowledge is not. "Tacit knowledge is difficult to exchange over long distance because it is heavily imbued with meaning arising from the social and institutional context {{in which it is}} produced, and this context specific nature makes it spatially sticky" (Gertler 2003). This thesis argues that there is certain tacit <b>knowledge</b> that <b>migrants</b> often transmit over long distances after customizing the knowledge to apply in different institutional settings. This thesis takes the example of Bangladesh, a country having an unfavorable socio- economic and institutional setting for receiving new technology, and explains how, despite the unfavorable conditions, some expatriates do transfer their knowledge to Bangladesh. Based on in-depth interviews with those expatriates creating the most impact in the economy of Bangladesh, the thesis shows that highly skilled Bangladeshi immigrants in the United States transfer tacit knowledge through building partnerships with individuals and organizations in Bangladesh. The thesis also finds that these partnerships are mostly based on trust, often coming from basic commonalities: same language, common "codes" of communication, shared norms, and personal knowledge about each other. by Moshahida Sultana.

40|$|This text {{is based}} on the {{researches}} on the migrants' representations of Europe and how their representations evolve during migrants' itineraries realised for the program Eurobroadmap. These researches have followed three major migratory 'routes' to the European Union: the Southern route that crosses the Mediterranean Sea (Mali, Senegal, Morocco, and Malta), the Eastern route through the former Soviet countries (Romania) and Central Asia (India), and finally Latin America (Argentina). Focusing on the evolution of the representations from candidates for migration prior to their departure, to migrants in transit and then to immigrants already settled in Europe, this text shows the ambivalence of these visions of Europe, between an image of the European Union as a pole of attraction and the European Union as a proving ground. In relation with this first issue is also studied the way the migrants develop some strategies to enter and settle in Europe linked with these visions (how migrants represent the constraints and opportunities offered by migration). Three specific issues concerning these visions are discussed: the articulation between memory and history, and especially the vision of Europe as a continent of democracy, freedom and rule of law, and the notion of debt; the vision of Europe as a space of welfare and opportunity but also of discriminations and racism; the representations and <b>knowledge</b> the <b>migrants</b> have of the European migratory policies, through their individual experience and social relations, and the strategies they use to get round these constraints...|$|R

The established scholarship on American empire in this period focuses on the domestic origins of US expansion into the markets of the Western Hemisphere.

Between 1865 and 1914, an American "colony" of expatriate businessmen emerged in London that is central to this study. The American "colony" integrated itself within the social and economic networks upon which British imperialism depended and mediated new inter-imperial collaborations. <b>Migrants,</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and investment flowed through these intersections, shaping the geography of American expansion around the global footprint of the British World.

40|$|China has {{experienced}} considerable migration from inland to coastal areas since the reforms of 1978, with migrants becoming an important population in many coastal cities. Compared with non-migrants (long-term residents), migrant vulnerability to typhoons is considered high due to {{limited access to}} job opportunities, social security, information, and other resources; however, there is no research on vulnerability of this population sector to natural hazards. This initial study analysed the perceptions and personal experiences of migrants living in Shanghai of typhoon hazards. During May 2010, empirical data were collected using an online questionnaire and face-face interviews. Response data indicated that risk <b>knowledge</b> of <b>migrants</b> was significantly lower than among non- migrants; differing risk perceptions between the groups were consistent with levels of personal typhoon experience; statistically significant differences in hazard knowledge within the sample also related to education and occupation; a variety of strategies to cope with typhoon hazards was being applied by residential committees; and that migrants were not generally recognised as a vulnerable group requiring special consideration in hazard risk management. To reduce the vulnerability of migrants to typhoons, we recommend expanding the range of accessible communication technologies distributing warning information; organising more educational and training programmes, at government and corporate level, to increase community awareness of natural hazards; e ncouraging local residential committees to promote social networks and engagement for migrants; and providing corporate incentives to develop insurances specifically for migrant needs. Further research is necessary to assess the differences in vulnerability between different types of migrants. 22 page(s...|$|R
