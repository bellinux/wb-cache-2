25|$|The {{value of}} a company's {{intangible}} assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall enterprise value. For this reason, the asset-based approach <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the fair {{market value of the}} business.|$|E

25|$|The Lufeng Dinosaurian Museum {{discovered}} a new specimen of Sinosaurus (ZLJT01) in 2007 from the Lufeng Basin. It consists of an incomplete skull and other postcranial fragments. Phylogenetic analysis of this specimen, demonstrates that Sinosaurus is a more derived theropod, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basal dilophosaurid, as held by Smith et al. A cladogram was identified by Christophe Hendrickx and Octávio Mateus. It placed Sinosaurus as the sister taxon to Cryolophosaurus, and together {{they were the most}} basal tetanurans.|$|E
25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} {{using the}} Latin script, the center, alphanumeric {{portion of the}} modern keyboard is most often based on the QWERTY design by Christopher Sholes, who laid out the keys {{in such a way}} that common two-letter combinations were placed on opposite sides of the keyboard so that his mechanical keyboard would not jam, and laid out the keys in rows offset horizontally from each other by three-eighths, three-sixteenths, and three-eighths inches to provide room for the levers. Although it has been demonstrated that the QWERTY layout <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> efficient layout for typing, it remains the standard.|$|E

25|$|Since clerids are predaceous in nature, {{they have}} been found feeding on fly larvae {{as well as the}} skin and bones of carrion. Most clerids are not useful in {{forensics}} because of their food choice, but some species such as the Necrobia rufipes can be useful. Necrobia rufipes is attracted towards carrion in the later stages of decomposition, so its arrival on carrion can help provide an estimate for the post-mortem interval or PMI. Although the checkered beetle <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant insect on carrion, the beetles predaceous nature and its ability to reproduce in carrion that is exposed to the environment provides some forensic importance.|$|E
25|$|However, {{although}} Transpersonal psychology {{has experienced}} recognition {{from the surrounding}} culture, it has also faced {{a fair amount of}} skepticism and criticism from the same surroundings. Several commentators have mentioned the controversial aspects of Transpersonal psychology. Zdenek, representing a moderate criticism from the 1980s, noted that the field was regarded as controversial since its inception. Other commentators, such as Friedman, and Adams, also mention the controversial status of the field. In 1998 the San Francisco Chronicle reported on the holistic studies program at the John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, which included a Transpersonal psychology department. The program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversial. Several commentators presented their skepticism towards the program. Another controversial aspect concerns the topic of psychedelic substances. Commenting upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, authors Elmer, MacDonald & Friedman observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement. The authors do however note that this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common form of transpersonal intervention in contemporary therapy.|$|E
25|$|The GDL {{electrically}} {{connects the}} catalyst and current collector. It must be porous, electrically conductive, and thin. The reactants {{must be able}} to reach the catalyst, but conductivity and porosity can act as opposing forces. Optimally, the GDL should be composed of about one third Nafion or 15% PTFE. The carbon particles used in the GDL can be larger than those employed in the catalyst because surface area <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important variable in this layer. GDL should be around 15-35µm thick to balance needed porosity with mechanical strength. Often, an intermediate porous layer is added between the GDL and catalyst layer to ease the transitions between the large pores in the GDL and small porosity in the catalyst layer. Since a primary function of the GDL is to help remove water, a product, flooding can occur when water effectively blocks the GDL. This limits the reactants ability to access the catalyst and significantly decreases performance. Teflon can be coated onto the GDL to limit the possibility of flooding. Several microscopic variables are analyzed in the GDLS such as: porosity, tortuosity and permeability. These variables have incidence over the behavior of the fuel cells. Two major GDL substrates, carbon cloth and paper, were compared, indicative of different cell performances.|$|E

25|$|Wardle {{was also}} a {{dangerous}} left-handed hitter, whose stocky build permitted him to drive powerfully.

500|$|Despite {{an often}} laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is {{described}} in the novel Liberty's Crusade as a decent and honorable man that is well liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is always {{willing to do the}} right thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series' main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy's eyes makes Raynor a [...] "true hero in the purest sense of the word". He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation. Raynor himself acknowledges that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.|$|E
