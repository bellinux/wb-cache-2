5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy logic, PI controlled shunt active power filter used {{to compensate for}} harmonic distortion in three-phase systems. The <b>Hybrid</b> active <b>power</b> filter employs a simple method for the calculation of the reference compensation current based on Fast Fourier Transform. The presented <b>Hybrid</b> Active <b>Power</b> filter is able to operate in balanced, load conditions. Classic filters may not have satisfactory performance in fast varying conditions. But auto tuned active power filter gives better results for harmonic minimization, and THD improvement. The proposed auto tuned <b>hybrid</b> active <b>power</b> filter maintains the THD well within IEEE- 519 standards. The proposed methodology is extensively tested and with improved dynamic behavior of <b>hybrid</b> active <b>power</b> filter using fuzzy logic, PI controllers. The results {{are found to be}} quite satisfactory to mitigate harmonic Distortions, and improve quality. The detailed simulations are carried out on MATLAB environment to validate the performance.

25|$|WHP {{was first}} {{established}} in 2008 and immediately set about {{developing a new}} flywheel energy-recovery system for the Williams F1 Team after the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) into Formula One for the 2009 season. While other teams were pouring their efforts into electric battery systems, Williams F1 opted {{to go down the}} flywheel route because of a strong belief in the technology's wider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since seen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP flywheel. WHP has also seen its flywheel technology introduced into a series of buses as part of a deal with the Go-Ahead Group, one of the UK's biggest transport operators. In April 2014, Williams <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Power</b> was sold to GKN.|$|E
25|$|In the Autumn of 2006 on {{the trade}} fairs in Hannover the world premier {{occurred}} of the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid with <b>hybrid</b> <b>power.</b> The model was made with the cooperation with Allison Transmission and Cummins, which already had been engaged in previous hybrid bus models in North America. The {{main part of the}} model is the Cummins ISLe4 engine with 8.9litre displacement which generates 248kW (340 HP) of power. The second main part of this model is the EP50 system of Allison Transmission with the Allison Ev50 engine. The concept is created by the use of one diesel engine and two electric engines with each having 75kW of power output, which links with the Ev DRIVE module. The system also uses the produced energy when braking, which is accumulated in a nickel-metal hydride batteries located on the roof {{in the front of the}} vehicle. The prototype appeared in mid-2006 and went into production in 2007. The location of the electric and diesel engines is in the front part of the bus between the two doors.|$|E
