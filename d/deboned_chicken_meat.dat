40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the biological properties of a protein hydrolysate obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat.</b> METHODS: Mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> was hydrolysed using Alcalase 2. 4 L FG and then dried in a spray-drier. Three groups (n= 6) of male Wistar rats received diets containing casein, mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> protein hydrolysate and a protein-free diet. The rats were randomly assigned to individual cages with controlled temperature (22 ºC) for 12 days. RESULTS: The mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> diet resulted in a good net protein utilization (3. 74) and high true digestibility (96 %). The amino acid composition of the hydrolysate was relatively well balanced, but the concentrations of methionine and cystine were low, making them the limiting amino acids. The proximate chemical composition of the hydrolysate showed protein content to be as high as 62 %. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this work suggest that mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> hydrolysate can be used as a protein enhancer in food preparations such as enteral formulations, and as an edible protein enhancer in general applications...|$|E

40|$|Advantages of air {{chilling}} (AC) methods over immersion chilling (IC) methods in quality retention and improvement of <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> breast <b>meat</b> depend on experimental conditions, such as deboning time. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of a dry-AC method on shear force and water-holding capacity (WHC) of broiler breast meat deboned 4 h postmortem compared to hot-boned (no chill) or immersion-chilled meat. Ready-to-cook broiler carcasses were hot-boned, chilled by ice water immersion (0. 3 °C, 50 min) or chilled by cross-flow cold, dry air (0. 7 °C, 150 min). Pectoralis (p.) major and p. minor were removed from the bone at 4 h postmortem. Shear force was measured using a Warner-Bratzler (WB) method and WHC was estimated using cooking yield, drip loss, amount of bound water (filter paper method) and water uptake (swell/centrifugation method). Regardless of muscle type, the WB shear force value of AC samples was significantly lower than that of hot-boned samples; however, there was no difference in the shear force between AC and IC. Regardless of measurement methods, there were no differences (P > 0. 05) in WHC between the three treatments. These results demonstrate that when compared to no chill, AC followed by 4 h postmortem deboning can lead to a difference in WB shear values while WHC properties can be retained. For broiler breast meat deboned 4 h postmortem, AC does not result in any significant differences in shear force and WHC when compared to IC...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Chicken {{broilers}} were electrically stunned {{prior to}} bleeding and slaughter in the processing plant at the Spelderholt Center. A nonstimulated (NS) control was used. Post-mortem intermittent electrical stimulation (ES) for 60 s was applied using 100 V immediately after bleeding. Birds were deboned from one breast half {{at various times}} (0 to 240 min) after evisceration. The remaining half was left attached to the carcass. Breast muscle pH was significantly lowered by ES compared with pH of control birds. There was an electrical stimulation X time interaction when measuring Warner Bratzler maximum shear, slope, and work values. Electrical stimulation at 0 or 15 min actually toughened the breast muscle, but ES significantly tenderized breast muscle deboned at 120 and 240 min, compared with the control. Breast muscles from ES carcasses were significantly darker in color, with lower lightness (L*) values when hot deboned at 60 min or earlier. Post-mortem ES significantly increased redness (a*) values at all deboning times except 30 min. Cooking losses and expressible moisture were significantly increased by ES. Hot deboning significantly decreased sarcomere length, but ES had no significant effect on sarcomere length.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{fatty acid}} {{profiles}} of the neutral lipid (NL) and seven phospholipid (PL) fractions were determined for raw and cooked mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> using HPLC for separating PL and gas chromatography for quantitating fatty acids (FA). The FA concentrations for each fraction were reported on a weight (mg FA per 100 g meat) and percentage (percentage FA of total FA) basis. The FA from the NL fraction constituted 94 % of the raw total lipid FA. The FA from the phosphatidylcho-line and lysophosphatidylethaiiolamine (PC-LPE) fraction constituted 38 % of the total PL FA. Lysophosphatidylcholine was the most unsaturated [70 % unsaturated FA (UFA) ] of the PL followed by phospriaadylethanolamine (59 % UFA), PC-LPE (58 % UFA), phosphatidylinositol (53 % UFA), sphingomye-lin (47 % UFA), and phosphatidylserine (46 % UFA).

40|$|ABSTRACT Mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> (MDCM) was {{extracted}} {{by using}} a pilot-scale, aqueous washing regimen. The resulting raw and cooked products were evaluated at 0 time and after 4 days of refrigerated storage (at 4 C) for thiobarbituric acid values (TBA), phospholipid (PL) content, and fatty acid profiles of the PL and neutral lipid (NL) fractions. Washing removed 88. 3 % of the total fat from MDCM, yet this meat had higher TBA values and oxidized {{to a greater extent}} during storage than the unwashed MDCM. This same oxidation was evident in the cooked, unwashed MDCM and cooked, washed MDCM. The PL comprised 4 % of the total fat in unwashed MDCM and 24 % of the total fat in washed MDCM. Phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (PC+LPE), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and sphingomyelin were significantly removed by washing, oxidation, or both during extraction. Washing removed 81 % of the NL fatty acids, in but only 57 % of the PL fatty acids. The fatty acids of PE and PC + LPE oxidized more readily during storage than the other PL fatty acids.

The uncooked HgCL 2 batter showed the poorest fat binding, The monovalent chloride salts produced stable cooked batters, whereas both divalent salts did not, CaC 12 produced a more unstable batter than MgC 1 2 High correlation was found between water and fat loss and total cookout losses from cooked batters. Texture was significantly affected {{by the type of}} chloride salt used. The divalent chloride salt batters had low brittleness and were simllar in texture. They had a different texture profile from monovalent chloride salt batters. Hardness and springiness were found to be related to batter stability. Microstructural differences between treatments reflected differences in batter stability and appeared to explain some of the textural differences. The protein matrices of the monovalent chloride salt batters were all simllar. However, LiCl produced a more tightly interwoven matrix than the others. Extensive coalescence was evident in the batters made with HgC 12 and CaC La which resulted in the format:ion of fat channels. In addition, their protein matrices were highly aggregated. Batter stability and texture appear to depend on the structure and integrity of the matrix as well as t he formation of a stable protein film around fat globules...|$|E
40|$|Mechanically <b>deboned</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> (MDCM) was {{prepared}} from backs and necks of freshly slaughtered birds. Samples were then subjected to aqueous washings at various pH conditions using water, 0. 5 % NaCl or NaHCO ₃. Approximately 73. 9 % {{of the total}} hemoprotein pigments and 52. 1 % of total lipids were removed by washing with a sodium bicarbonate solution which resulted also in the best colour improvement in the products. Extraction of these components with water and NaCl solution was less effective. The yield of proteins ranged from 58. 1 % after one washing with water to 41. 7 % after washing with water {{and then with a}} sodium bicarbonate solution. The amino acid content and protein efficiency ratio (PER) values of washed meats, calculated by an amino acid scoring methodology, were comparable to those of unwashed MDCM. [...] The concentration of flavour precursors, namely free amino acids and inosine 5 '-monophosphate was decreased by over 50 % in the washed samples. Similarly, the content of nucleic acids and cholesterol in the corresponding washed samples was reduced by 60. 5 and 42. 3 %, respectively. A slight increase in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids of phospholipids and content of phospholipids was also noted in the washed MDCM. The cook yield of washed MDCM was enhanced, while a decrease in sulphydryl groups and a proportionate increase in disulphide bonds due to washing was noted. The oxidative stability of washed raw products was less than their unwashed counterpart, however, the cooked washed meats were more resistant to lipid oxidation than the unwashed sample during a 2 -week storage at 4 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to analyze: consumer attitudes, the stages of the purchase decision making, and the factors that affected the purchase decisions of <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> in Bandar Lampung City. This research was conducted at three traditional markets in Bandar Lampung City, namely Tugu Market, SMEP Market, and Gintung Market. This research was a survey method, in which locations were determined on purpose, while the samples of 90 people were obtained by using accidental sampling technique. The data were analyzed by using descriptive qualitative analysis, multiatribute Fishbein analysis and logit regression analysis. The results showed that consumer attitudes toward the attributes of <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> were that they preferred ‘ras 2 ̆ 7 <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> than kampong <b>chicken</b> meat; particularly {{in terms of the}} meat price and weight. Consumer 2 ̆ 7 s decision making stages of <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> showed that they bought chicken because of their awareness on the need of protein and 60 percent of them preferred to buy ‘ras 2 ̆ 7 <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> than kampong <b>chicken</b> <b>meat.</b> Most consumers (61. 11...|$|R

40|$|Background: A main {{export market}} for <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> from industrialized {{countries}} is sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that antibiotic resistant bacteria could be exported {{to developing countries}} through <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> trade. The objective {{was to investigate the}} occurrence and molecular types of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus in <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> in Gabon and to assess their dissemination among humans. Results: Frozen <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> samples imported from industrialized countries to Gabon (n[*]=[*] 151) were screened for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus. Genotypes and resistance genes (SHV, TEM, CTX-M, CMY- 2) of isolates from meat were compared with isolates derived from humans. The contamination rate per chicken part (i. e. leg, wing) with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL E. coli, no other ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found) and S. aureus was 23 % and 3 %, respectively. The beta-lactamase CTX-M 1 was predominant in ESBL E. coli from meat samples but was not found in isolates from cases of human colonization or infection. S. aureus belonging to spa type t 002 (multilocus sequence type ST 5) were found both in <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> and humans. Conclusion: There is a risk to import ESBL E. coli to Gabon but molecular differences between isolates from humans and <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> argue against a further dissemination. No MRSA isolate was detected in imported <b>chicken</b> <b>meat.</b> <br...|$|R
