They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them.

500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever be. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E
500|$|Critics noted {{references}} and similarities to 1980s pop music throughout the album. Adrien Begrand from PopMatters found the hook of [...] "Sweet Music" [...] {{similar to those}} in songs by Prince and INXS. [...] "Still Standing" [...] was described by Helen Pidd from The Guardian as [...] "a magnificent blend of Prince's [...] "Kiss" [...] and Peter Gabriel's [...] "Sledgehammer"". [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] contains a reference to British band Dead or Alive's 1985 song [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)", in the line [...] "You got me spinning round, round, round, round like a record". The title of [...] "I Feel For You" [...] {{is the same as the}} 1979/1984 song by Prince and Chaka Khan, although it is not a cover of the song. [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] directly refers to urban contemporary band Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's 1984 song [...] "I Wonder <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Take</b> You Home", both in its title and refrain. The line of the song in which Minogue sings [...] "don't confuse emotions with the pleasure principle" [...] also refers to American recording artist Janet Jackson's 1987 song [...] "The Pleasure Principle".|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{refers to the}} ongoing Afghan war and also makes several allusions to World War I and World War II. The lyrics also criticise diplomacy, {{especially}} in the final refrain: [...] "what <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> my problem to the United Nations?" [...] This refrain {{is based on a}} lyric from Eddie Cochran's [...] "Summertime Blues" [...] and most reviews of Let England Shake recognised the similarity. Harvey was granted permission to use the lyric and noted the inclusion in the album's liner notes.|$|E

2500|$|Bettman's {{controversial}} decisions, {{as well as}} {{presiding over}} three labor stoppages, have made him unpopular among many NHL fans. He is regularly booed in various arenas around the league, ranging from his appearances at the yearly NHL Entry Draft to his annual presentation of the Stanley Cup to the league champions {{at the end of}} the playoffs. When asked if the booing ever bothers him, Bettman said, [...] "Not doing this job, no. You're always going to have critics.

2500|$|A right-arm off spinner, Ajmal's stock {{delivery}} {{turns into}} right-handed batsman {{but he also}} frequently uses the doosra which turns the other way, and he generally bowls flatter than most off spinners. The doosra has been an effective tool for Ajmal as batsmen have often failed to pick it. Explaining his bowling style in 2012, Ajmal said [...] "If I bowl with flight I cannot bowl well. If I bowl at a quicker speed I can then use variations in pace. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> 70% of my wickets with the doosra why should I not bowl it? Whether you bowl a doosra or an offbreak, the ball should be bowled on the right line and one should take a wicket with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Streisand {{changed her}} name from [...] "Barbara" [...] to [...] "Barbra" [...] because, she said, [...] "I hated the name, but I refused to change it." [...] Streisand further explained, [...] "Well, I was 18 and I {{wanted to be}} unique, but I didn't want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or {{something}} like that. (My middle name is Joan.) And I said, 'No, let's see, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique." [...] A 1967 biography with a concert program said, [...] "the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an [...] "a" [...] from the first instead." ...|$|E

The current tonsillectomy [...] "rate" [...] is 0.53 per thousand children and 1.46 per thousand children for combined tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. In the past decade, tonsillectomies have become increasingly low due to orders from the government; specifically by President Obama in 2009 where he commented on {{ear nose and throat}} doctors at a conference [...] "You come in and you’ve got a bad sore throat, or your child has a bad sore throat or has repeated sore throats. The doctor may say, 'You know what?

2500|$|Sometime in {{the third}} century, Zhang Zhao {{recommended}} Yan Jun to serve under the warlord Sun Quan, who controlled the territories in Jiangdong. Sun Quan appointed him as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉) and Assistant Officer (從事中郎). When Sun Quan's general Lu Su died in 217, Sun Quan wanted to let Yan Jun replace Lu and {{take charge of the}} military garrison at Lukou (陸口; around present-day Jiayu County, Hubei). The other officials congratulated Yan Jun on his new appointment, but Yan firmly declined to accept it and said, [...] "I'm only a simple scholar and I'm unfamiliar with military affairs. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> up this appointment which I'm not suited for, there will be regrets later." [...] He spoke very sincerely – to the point of breaking down in tears. Sun Quan then asked him to try riding on a horse, but he fell off after getting on the horse's back, so Sun decided to not let him replace Lu Su. Yan Jun received praise for being candid about his abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton was {{conflicted}} {{whether she}} {{wanted to take the}} position or remain in the Senate, and agonized over her decision. While the Senate leadership had discussed possible leadership positions or other promotions in rank with her even before the cabinet position became a possibility, nothing concrete had been offered. The prospect of her ever becoming Senate Majority Leader seemed dim. A different complication was Bill Clinton; she told Obama: [...] "There's one last thing that's a problem, which is my husband. You've seen what this is like; it will be a circus <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> this job", making reference to the volatile effect Bill Clinton had had during the primaries. In addition, there was a specific concern whether the financial and other involvements of Bill Clinton's post-presidential activities would violate any conflict-of-interest rules for serving cabinet members. There was as well considerable media speculation about what effect taking the position would have on her political career and any possible future presidential aspirations. Clinton wavered over the offer, but as she later related, [...] "But, you know, we kept talking. I finally began thinking, look, if I had won and I had called him, I would have wanted him to say yes. And, you know, I'm pretty old-fashioned, and it's just who I am. So {{at the end of the}} day, when your president asks you to serve, you say yes, if you can." [...] Chief of Protocol of the United States Capricia Penavic Marshall, who had known Clinton since her First Lady days, later confirmed the same rationale: [...] "When asked to serve, she does. And her president asked." ...|$|E
