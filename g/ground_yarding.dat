50|$|The Nebraska defense {{saw their}} string of touchdown-prevention {{quarters}} ended at 8 when Oklahoma State managed to squeak in {{a touchdown in}} the 3rd quarter, {{but that was all}} that would be heard from the Cowboys on this day since they were held to -13 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> compared to the 430 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> posted by the Cornhuskers.|$|R
50|$|Nebraska {{piled up}} 65 points, its highest total since 1922, and held Oklahoma State to just 64 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> as the Cornhuskers made short {{work of the}} Cowboys.|$|R
50|$|Nebraska intercepted an Indiana pass on {{the first}} play to set the tone as the Cornhuskers rolled with ease over the Hoosiers in Lincoln.

5000|$|Oklahoma {{completely}} dismantled Nebraska {{in every}} way, as the Cornhuskers were shut {{out for the}} first time since 1968, an indignity that would not be repeated until Miami defeated Nebraska in the [...] eighteen years later. The Cornhuskers were held to just 74 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> and 174 yards of total offense as the Nebraska offense never crossed mid-field.|$|R
50|$|Oklahoma {{completely}} {{shut down}} Nebraska's offensive machine, as the Cornhuskers' only score {{came on a}} 76-yard fumble return for a touchdown with just 26 seconds left to play, very narrowly avoiding {{what would have been}} Nebraska's first shutout in 147 games. There were only 19 total passes and 5 completions in the entire game, and although Nebraska had not previously allowed more than 157 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> this season, the vaunted Oklahoma wishbone attack netted the Sooners 423 yards.|$|R
50|$|The {{return of}} Nebraska IB Jarvis Redwine was short-lived, as {{both he and}} 2nd string IB Craig Johnson left the game with {{injuries}} in the 1st quarter. 3rd string IB Roger Craig was still too much for Colorado as Nebraska swept up the Buffaloes in Boulder while collecting 403 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> and a decisive 45-7 win, the 13th Cornhusker win in a row over Colorado, whose only score came in the 4th quarter against Nebraska reserves.|$|R

50|$|Tom Osborne {{brought his}} Nebraska Cornhuskers into Birmingham to face Bear Bryant's top-ranked Crimson Tide {{to start the}} 1978 season, and Nebraska put the first points on the board with a field goal halfway through the 1st quarter. Unfortunately for the Cornhuskers, the game belonged to Alabama {{for the rest of}} the day with no further answer from Nebraska. Alabama {{suffered}} no fumbles and rolled up twice as many <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> as Nebraska, showing that their #1 ranking was deserved.|$|R
50|$|Nebraska's 2010 ground {{offense has}} been revitalized further by the {{emergence}} of redshirt freshman quarterback Taylor Martinez, who is on pace after the season's first nine games to be just the third freshman quarterback in NCAA history to record over 1,000 <b>yards</b> on the <b>ground,</b> already accumulating over 900 yards on the year. Overall, Nebraska has surged into the nation's top rushing ranks with an average of 290 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> per game through the season's first eight games. The 451 yards accumulated against Kansas State was Nebraska's highest total in 109 games.|$|R

50|$|Nebraska QB Jerry Tagge broke {{a record}} while taking apart Minnesota in Minneapolis. The 587 total Cornhusker yards {{was the second}} highest total in school history, and his 219 air <b>yards</b> and 82 <b>ground</b> <b>yards</b> rang up to 301 on the day, easily {{breaking}} the previous record of 264 yards set in 1951 and tied in 1967. The game started in doubt as Minnesota struck first and forced Nebraska to a 14-14 tie at the half, {{but there would be}} no further scoring from the Golden Gophers to answer the additional 28 Nebraska points posted after the half.|$|R

50|$|Because fifty hens {{per acre}} {{represents}} 800 sq ft per hen (80 m² per hen), while the density {{inside the house}} at the time was normally four square feet per hen (0.4 m² per hen), this required that the yard be 200 times wider than the house, assuming a yard {{on one side of the}} house. That is, a house 20 ft wide required a yard 4000 ft wide to provide the necessary area. This would normally be provided as two yards, one on either side of the house, each 2000 ft wide. In reality, such yards are expensive to fence, and the chickens spend most of their time on the portion closest to the house, so sustainability was never achieved in practice except with portable houses, which were moved periodically to fresh <b>ground.</b> <b>Yarded</b> operations were operated with unsustainably small yards that were quickly denuded and which received excessive levels of manure.|$|R
40|$|The {{pollutant}} {{loads of}} surface runoff {{in an urban}} tourist area have been investigated {{for two years in}} the Wuhan City Zoo, China. Eight sampling sites, including two woodlands, three animal yards, two roofs and one road, were selected for sampling and study. The results indicate that pollutants ranked in a predictable order of decreasing load (e. g. animal yard > roof > woodland > road), with animal yards acting as the key pollution source in the zoo. Pollutants were transported mainly by particulate form in runoff. Particulate nitrogen and particulate phosphorous accounted on average for 61 %, 78 % of total pollutant, respectively, over 13 monitored rainfall events. These results indicate the treatment practices should be implemented to improve particulate nutrient removal. Analysis of the M(V) curve indicate that no first flush effect existed in the surface runoff from pervious areas (e. g. woodland, animal <b>ground</b> <b>yard),</b> whereas a first flush effect was evident in runoff from impervious surfaces (e. g. animal cement yard, roof, road) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} compost production yields as {{a percent}} of raw product mix using poultry litter, poultry processing plant dissolved air flotation skimmings, sawdust, wood chips and <b>ground</b> <b>yard</b> debris. Three different mixes were used and identified as Mixes 1, 2 and 3. Mixes 1 and 2 were produced using windrows and a windrow turner and Mix 3 was made using a covered in-channel compost turner. Mixes 1 and 2 were poultry litter compost with a screened mass yield of 80 and 77 percent, respectively. Mix 3 was a dissolved air flotation compost with a screened mass yield of 40 percent. Results from plant experiments show poultry litter compost can be used successfully in potting mixes for poinsettia and chrysanthemum production. A compost produced from dissolved air flotation skimmings, a poultry processing waste, can be used in field corn production but had little influence in the production of soybeans. Zntroduction Compost facility managers need to understand the amount of compost produced from a given amount of ingredients or yield they will have for sale. Bench-scale laborator...|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps Levy's most {{unconventional}} tactic {{in rebuilding}} the Chiefs was installing the [...] "Wing-T offense". [...] "It {{was a situation}} where we took over a team that had the worst defensive record {{in the history of the}} National Football League", Levy explained. [...] "We wanted to keep that defense off the field, so we ran the ball 60 times a game." [...] The 1978 Chiefs team ran and ran often, posting franchise records with 663 rushing attempts and 2,986 <b>ground</b> <b>yards.</b> Levy's squad ran the ball a staggering 69 times in a 24-23 Opening Day win at Cincinnati on September 3, the most rushing attempts in an NFL contest since 1948. Five different players had 100-yard rushing games during the year, including running back Tony Reed, who finished the season with 1,053 yards to become the team's first 1,000-yard back since 1967. Despite the squad's Opening Day success, the club lost 10 of its next 11 games, including a pair of overtime decisions. However, the team showed signs of improvement with the defense recording a 23-0 shutout against San Diego on November 26 as the club concluded its first 16-game schedule with a 4-12 mark.|$|R
