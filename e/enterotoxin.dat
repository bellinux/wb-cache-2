40|$|The {{study of}} <b>enterotoxins</b> {{began in earnest}} {{approximately}} 30 years ago with characterization of the cholera toxin. So far, more <b>enterotoxins</b> {{have been associated with}} Gram-negative rather than Gram-positive bacteria. These substances can be roughly divided into the cytotonic variety, which primarily interfere with intestinal cell metabolism, and those which are cytotoxic, responsible for cell destruction. Most cytotonic <b>enterotoxins</b> activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) producing watery diarrhea, resulting from fluid and electrolyte flux. This typically results after binding to a toxin-specific receptor site on the small intestinal epithe lium.

40|$|Staphylococcal {{foodborne}} intoxication, {{in which}} major symptoms are vomiting and diarrhoea, occurs after ingestion of thermostable staphylococcal <b>enterotoxins</b> produced in food by enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci. Staphylococcal <b>enterotoxins</b> are normally not or only slightly inactivated during food processing, storage, distribution {{or during the}} preparation of the food in the kitchen.

The legislation of the Republic of Serbia lays down criteria for coagulase- positive staphylococci in food.

25|$|This {{family is}} also known as Ct or Ctx, and {{includes}} the heat-labile <b>enterotoxin</b> family, known as LT. Cholera toxin’s discovery is credited by many to Dr. Sambhu Nath De. He conducted his research in Calcutta (now Kolkata) making his discovery in 1959, although it was first purified by Robert Koch in 1883. Cholera toxin is an infectious toxin composed of a protein complex that is secreted by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Some symptoms of this toxin include chronic and widespread watery diarrhea and dehydration that, in some cases, leads to death.|$|E
25|$|Pathogenic C. difficile strains produce {{multiple}} toxins. The most well-characterized are <b>enterotoxin</b> (Clostridium difficile toxin A) and cytotoxin (Clostridium difficile toxin B), both {{of which}} may produce diarrhea and inflammation in infected patients, although their relative contributions have been debated. Toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the Rho family of GTPases. Toxin B (cytotoxin) induces actin depolymerization by a mechanism correlated with {{a decrease in the}} ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Another toxin, binary toxin, also has been described, but its role in disease is not fully understood.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, the {{chemical}} warfare capabilities of the United States began to decline due to, in part, a decline in public opinion concerning the corps. The corps continued to be plagued with bad press and mishaps. A 1969 incident, in which 23 soldiers and one Japanese civilian were exposed to sarin {{on the island of}} Okinawa while cleaning sarin-filled bombs, created international concern while revealing the presence of chemical munitions in Southeast Asia. The same year as this sarin mishap, President Richard Nixon reaffirmed a no first-use policy on chemical weapons as well as renouncing the use of biological agents. When the U.S. BW program ended in 1969, it had developed seven standardized biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, VEE, and botulism.
