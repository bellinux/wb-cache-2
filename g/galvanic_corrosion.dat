5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by <b>galvanic</b> <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E

50|$|Methanol, like ethanol, {{contains}} soluble and insoluble contaminants. These soluble contaminants, {{halide ions}} such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the corrosivity of alcohol fuels. Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways; they chemically attack passivating oxide films on several metals causing pitting corrosion, and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electric, <b>galvanic,</b> and ordinary <b>corrosion</b> in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants, such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clog the fuel system over time.|$|R

25|$|<b>Galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{occurs when}} two {{different}} metals have physical or electrical contact {{with each other}} and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a galvanic couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series. For example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{intergranular}} corrosion and exfoliation corrosion of 2195 Al-Li alloy treated by multi-step heating-rate controlled aging (MSRC) are studied. The corrosion features of 2195 Al-Li alloys which are respectively treated by high-temperature nucleation MSRC (H-M) and low-temperature nucleation MSRC (L-M) are contrasted. And the corrosion mechanism of 2195 Al-Li alloy is also discussed {{from the viewpoint}} of microstructure (types, distribution, etc.) of the strengthening phase. The results show that 2195 Al-Li alloy after H-M is more susceptible to {{intergranular corrosion}} and exfoliation corrosion than that of alloy after L-M. The degree of intergranular corrosion increases with the increase of predeformation amount and the surface parallel to the rolling direction is more prone to exfoliation corrosion.

40|$|Abstract Chemistry {{programs}} at universities include oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions.

However, the standard conditions differ from {{the conditions under which}} the real experiment is carried out. Therefore, instead of the standard potentials the author of the paper suggests to use stationary metal potentials which have proved them in practice. The formula for calculation of EMF is replaced by the modified formulas: when metals are dissolving in acids and bases E ≅ ϕpHoxid. agent − ϕpHreduc. agent; in case of <b>galvanic</b> cells and <b>corrosion</b> E ≅ ϕpHcathode − ϕpHanode.

25|$|<b>Galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> is an {{electrochemical}} {{process whereby}} one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact {{with each other}} in the presence of an electrolyte, such as moisture and salts. This is because the dissimilar metals have different electrode potentials. The potential difference between the dissimilar metals is the driving force for the accelerated attack on the metal with the lower galvanic number (i.e., the anode). Over time, the anode metal dissolves into the electrolyte.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{bones are}} {{reinforced}} with metal. These implants must be designed and installed with care. Stress shielding occurs when plates or screws carry too large of {{a portion of}} the bone's load, causing atrophy. This problem is reduced, but not eliminated, by the use of low-modulus materials, including titanium and its alloys. The heat generated by the friction of installing hardware can accumulate easily and damage bone tissue, reducing the strength of the connections. If dissimilar metals are installed in contact with one another (i.e., a titanium plate with cobalt-chromium alloy or stainless steel screws), <b>galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> will result. The metal ions produced can damage the bone locally and may cause systemic effects as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{susceptibility}} of a polymer to degradation {{depends on}} its structure.

High-temperature matrices such as bismaleimides (BMI), condensation polyimides (with an O-C-N bond), triazines (with a nitrogen (N) containing ring), and blends thereof are susceptible to polymer degradation in the form of <b>galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> when bare carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP is in contact with an active metal such as aluminium in salt water environments.|$|E

Magnesium alloys offer excellent weight reduction, specific strength, and deep space radiation mitigation. Traditionally, magnesium has been perceived as having too poor of a flammability resistance and corrosion resistance to be used for flight.

40|$|Corrosion has {{significant}} {{adverse effects on}} the durability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures, especially those exposed to a marine environment and subjected to mechanical stress, such as bridges, jetties, piers and wharfs. Previous studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate the corrosion behaviour of steel rebar in various concrete structures, however, few studies have focused on the corrosion monitoring of RC structures that are subjected to both mechanical stress and environmental effects. This paper presents an exploratory study on the development of corrosion monitoring and detection techniques for RC structures under the combined effects of external loadings and corrosive media. Four RC beams were tested in 3 % NaCl solutions under different levels of point loads. Corrosion processes occurring on steel bars under different loads and under alternative wetting - drying cycle conditions were monitored. Electrochemical and microscopic methods were utilised to measure corrosion potentials of steel bars; to monitor galvanic currents flowing between different steel bars in each beam; and to observe corrosion patterns, respectively. The results indicated that steel corrosion in RC beams was affected by local stress. The point load caused the increase of <b>galvanic</b> currents, <b>corrosion</b> rates and corrosion areas. Pitting corrosion was found to be the main form of corrosion {{on the surface of the}} steel bars for most of the beams, probably due to the local concentration of chloride ions. In addition, visual observation of the samples confirmed that the localities of corrosion were related to the locations of steel bars in beams. It was also demonstrated that electrochemical devices are useful for the detection of RC beam corrosion...|$|R
25|$|In June 2009, c2c and Bombardier began a {{repainting}} programme on the Class 357 units {{beginning with}} 357 203.

The corrosion was treated by rubbing the aluminium down and repainting it with two-pack paint. More serious corrosion caused by water seeping in through a poorly-sealed join between panels was found behind several panels on {{the lower part of the}} vehicle bodysides, which had spread to the outside. A thick, tight mastic seal was introduced between the panels to prevent this issue from re-occurring. To save money during construction, stainless steel bolts were used to secure the external aluminium panels in place; however, this resulted in <b>galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> of the more reactive aluminium, so the bolts have been replaced by aluminium ones.

25|$|Graphite and {{graphite}} powder are valued in industrial applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties. There {{is a common}} belief that graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure. However, {{it has been shown}} that in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space), graphite degrades as a lubricant, due to the hypoxic conditions. This observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers, such as air and water, which are naturally adsorbed from the environment. This hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed. Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite's lubricating properties. The use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel, and to promote <b>galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> between dissimilar metals (due to its electrical conductivity). It is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture. For this reason, the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft, and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons. Even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion. Another high-temperature lubricant, hexagonal boron nitride, has the same molecular structure as graphite. It is sometimes called white graphite, due to its similar properties.|$|E
25|$|The National Park Service {{chose to}} {{refinish}} the statues using brush electroplating. Workers discovered {{that because the}} interior of each pedestal was exposed to bare earth, excessive condensation built up inside the hollow statues. Additionally, the statues had not been completely seated on their plinths, and additional moisture worked its way inside through the poorly sealed joint. Extreme temperature changes (due to daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the bronze) and proximity to the river also led to extensive condensation inside the statures. Workers found the interior of each statue damp, even wet, and water pooled in every recess. The moisture build-up created tremendous <b>galvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> inside the sculptures. The steel joint bolts were so extensively corroded that some had almost completely disintegrated, {{and many of the}} steel angle irons were close to failure. National Bureau of Standards workers believed all four statues {{were on the verge of}} structural collapse. The corrosion problem was worsened by the presence of gypsum. Gypsum was used to make the molds from which the bronze was cast. But the gypsum was never completely cleaned from the interior of the two The Arts of Peace statues, leading to additional corrosion in these pieces. The corrosion problems were solved by removing the steel bolts and angle irons and replacing them with bronze components, and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors. More than 1,000 brass bolts were used in Music and Harvest and Aspiration and Literature alone.|$|E
