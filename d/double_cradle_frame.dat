50|$|There were {{sporting}} four strokes, of course, {{but they}} were, {{for the most}} part, derivatives of regular motorcycles and those that came from Japan were, regardless of manufacturer, almost all the same. Built around an in-line four-cylinder air-cooled engine wrapped in a steel <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> they were so similar, in fact, that they {{became known as the}} Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM).|$|E
5000|$|With minor {{variations}} {{over the}} years, in 1988 the GPX model is released with major changes, {{like a new}} <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> <b>frame,</b> a different anti dive system (ESCS-Electronic Suspension Control System) improving the AVDS (Automatic Variable Damping System) from the GPZ. Also, the GPX brought more power (84 hp against 76 in the GPZ) and a higher top speed (140 mph against GPZ's 135 mph) ...|$|E
50|$|In the (very limited) {{production}} application the water-cooled engine {{retained the}} vertical cylinder but placed the crank driven supercharger piston and its cylinder under the crankcases. The radiator was mounted between the twin downtubes of the plunger suspended <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> and drive {{was taken to}} the four speed gearbox via a chain primary drive and dry multidisc clutch. Girder forks equipped the front end and were fitted with a full width hub as was the rear wheel.|$|E

50|$|The Hero Honda Splendor is a {{motorcycle}} manufactured in India by Hero Honda. It has an electronic ignition and a tubular <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> type <b>frame</b> with a 97.2 cc engine. The engine {{is based on}} the Honda cub C100EX with a similar bore and stroke of 50mm X 49.5mm. , Splendor models were selling at a rate of one million per year.|$|R
2500|$|Yamaha began {{competing}} internationally in 1956 {{when they}} entered the Catalina Grand Prix, again with the YA-1, at which they placed sixth. [...] The YA-1 {{was followed by the}} YA-2 of 1957, another 125cc two stroke, but with significantly improved frame and suspension. [...] The YD-1 of 1957 was a 250cc two-stroke twin cylinder motorcycle, resembling the YA-2, but with a larger and more powerful motor. [...] A performance version of this bike, the YDS-1 housed the 250cc two-stroke twin in a <b>double</b> downtube <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> and offered the first five-speed transmission in a Japanese motorcycle. [...] This period also saw Yamaha offer its first outboard marine engine.|$|R
5000|$|This {{opened an}} {{opportunity}} for aftermarket tuners, such as Flink and Lindström. Based on the stock Husqvarna 282 engine, Göte Lindström cast larger bore cylinders of his own design and production, {{that resulted in a}} 236 cc displacement with the stock crank. Stroking the crank resulted in a 246 cc displacement, just under the 250 cc class limit. The engines also featured high compression heads, higher crankcase compression through the use of round balances, a larger bore, 32 mm Bing carburetor and a custom made, dynamometer tested, expansion chamber exhaust system. The chassis was custom made by Egon Gustavsson, who crafted light yet rigid <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> with a rear swingarm sprung by two Girling units. The front fork was a Ceriani motocross telescope-type, an improvement over the earlier [...] "Earls type" [...] swingarm front forks, that had previously been favored by light weight motocrosses. What remained of the stock Husqvarna were the wheel hubs and the engine cases.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 50s, while {{continuing}} to work in the aviation industry, the Belletti Workshop began to establish important relationships in the motorcycle racing industry, working closely with Eng. Lino Tonti, building motorcycle frames for racing competitions. Some of the first frames were built for Paton in Milan, who they continued to work with until 1973. Paton motorcycles with Belletti frames, or replicas of the same, are identified with the initials BL, {{as can be seen in}} the BL3-R model which is still in production today. Starting in the 60s, other important brands such as Linto, Puch Frigerio, and Guazzoni begin to commission the Belletti family to build prototypes and special motorcycle frames for racing. One of the most significant achievements within the motorcycle industry dates back to 1967. That year, Mike Hailwood was to take part in the World Championship with a Honda 500 GP, but after the initial testing carried out that winter, the road racer began to complain about the performance of the frame. In 1967, the engineers at the Japanese company had been focused on developing the engine (which turned out to be among the most powerful in the Championship) and consequently decided not to make any further changes to the chassis. Referred by specialist Giuseppe Pattoni, Hailwood approached Stelio and Antenore Belletti as a private customer and commissioned them to construct a new chassis for his Honda 500 GP. They completed the tubular-steel <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> in just 16 days. The Honda 500 GP motorcycle equipped with the new Belletti frame was used for the first time at the Mototemporada Romagnola, in the Rimini stage on May 14, 1967. The road racer won the race, breaking the winning streak of racer Giacomo Agostini who rode a MV Agusta. The motorcycle was also used in the World Championship while testing the Hockenheim circuit, but Honda forbade the use of the motorcycle during the race and for all subsequent races. In 1968, they also began construction on a limited series of frames to equip the Gran Prix motorcycle Linto 500 GP; all the frames for this model were designed by Belletti’s friend, Lino Tonti, and built by Belletti. The Belletti workshop continued to work in the motorcycle industry until the early 70s.|$|E
50|$|The Ducati 125 T (Turismo) and 125 TV (Turismo Veloce) {{were single}} cylinder, {{four-stroke}} OHV motorcycles built by Ducati from 1956 to 1960, featuring a <b>double</b> downtube full <b>cradle</b> steel <b>frame</b> and full-width drum brakes.|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} frame for the Powerplus had a conventional rigid rear wheel mounting, but the Powerplus was also available with Indian's <b>Cradle</b> Spring <b>Frame.</b> Introduced in 1913, the <b>Cradle</b> Spring <b>Frame</b> had a rear swingarm linked to trailing leaf springs.|$|R
50|$|Clearly Suzuki were {{returning}} the GSXRs to their race-bred roots.Whilst Suzuki had clearly felt a great {{attachment to the}} <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> {{it is an interesting}} irony that the Gsx-R250 and Gsxr400 used an alloy beam frame in the four model years 1986 - 1989 (inclusive).|$|R
5000|$|The Yamaha XS Eleven motorcycle, {{also called}} XS11 and XS1100, is a Japanese {{standard}} produced from 1978 to 1981, {{powered by a}} air-cooled [...] 4-stroke, DOHC inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely in a duplex <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> with swingarm rear suspension, shaft drive, and telescopic forks.|$|R

50|$|A {{lightweight}} {{long wheelbase}} (1715 mm) frame was designed using {{aluminum die casting}} to minimize weight, with a <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> design to provide the strength. Suspension consists of a die cast aluminum swinging arm and a hidden single horizontal rear shock absorber and large diameter front forks.|$|R
50|$|The Himalayan {{features}} a half-duplex split <b>cradle</b> <b>frame.</b> Suspension is telescopic {{in the front}} while the rear is provided with monoshock suspension. Front forks are 41 mm with 200 mm of travel and the rear suspension offers 180 mm of travel. The motorcycle has a ground clearance of 220 mm.|$|R
2500|$|Indian {{introduced}} the 221cc single cylinder two-stroke Model K [...] "Featherweight" [...] in 1916. The Model K had an open <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> {{with the engine}} as a stressed member and a pivoting front fork {{that had been used}} earlier on single-cylinder motorcycles but had mostly been replaced on other Indian motorcycles by a leaf-sprung trailing link fork.|$|R
50|$|On a Garratt locomotive, {{the shared}} boiler and cab are {{carried on a}} <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> which is {{suspended}} on pivot centres attached to the frames of the two engine units, which are both free to align itself to the track curvature. To accommodate the pivoting, the steam and exhaust pipes have flexible connections between the engine units and the central cradle.|$|R
50|$|The BSA W33-7 was a 499cc 4.99 hp {{over head}} valve single {{cylinder}} four stroke. The full duplex <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> had fixings for a sidecar fitted as standard. The fuel tank was chrome plated with green side panels. The 6 volt electrical switches and ammeter were {{mounted in the}} middle of the top of the fuel tank. Only produced in 1933 it was replaced by the BSA W33-8 BSA Blue Star in the same year.|$|R
50|$|The Model O had a <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> {{supporting}} the engine {{at the bottom}} of the crankcase, while the gearbox was mounted under the frame, below the rear cylinder. The rear wheel was rigidly mounted to a subframe bolted to the frame. The front suspension was initially a pivoting fork used on the Indian Single from 1906 to 1910 and on the Model K Featherweight. This was replaced during 1917 by a leaf-sprung trailing link fork.|$|R
50|$|Back in the '70s, with motorcycle's {{manufacturing}} rights {{sold to the}} Murcian company Motomur, they produced the Nevada and Elite 2 models, and the Sport variant which mounted cast rims instead of spoked, {{as well as other}} aesthetic improvements. However the scheme and the engine of the Gimson motorcycles remained the same as the original from Figueres, changes being mostly aesthetic, such as the appearance of a false <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> in the tubular frame.|$|R
5000|$|The Cahuilla and Pima {{used the}} fibers for sturdy {{construction}} material and firewood. The Havasupai split the twigs {{and used them}} for basketry, but also used the twigs as a broom to brush off metates. The O'odham (formerly called Papago) used the broken twigs for baskets, and were curved to make intricate weaves in the baskets. The Pima used the dried bushes to pile {{them to make a}} brush fence. The branches were used to make <b>cradle</b> <b>frames</b> as well.|$|R

50|$|Between 1949 and 1962 the Suhl factory {{produced}} more than 209,000 four-stroke motorcycles. They were designated 425, derived {{from the fact that}} they had a four-stroke engine with 250 cc displacement. The 425 has overhead valves in a V-formation, has a four-speed transmission, shaft final drive and has a duplex <b>cradle</b> <b>frame.</b> It earned a high reputation in the Eastern Bloc countries. The motorcycles were branded AWO (an abbreviation of Awtowelo) from 1949 until 1955, when the Simson name was revived. Some had Stoye sidecars fitted, and a Stoye Campi luggage trailer could also be fitted.|$|R
50|$|The UJM {{template}} {{featured a}} four-cylinder engine, standard riding position, carburetor for each cylinder, unit construction engine, disc front brake, conventional tubular <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> and telescopic front forks and twin-shock rear suspension. As the major Japanese motorcycle manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha, began replicating each others designs, the UJMs created a homogeneity of form, function and quality. UJMs included such prominent models as the Honda CB500, the Kawasaki Z1, and the Suzuki GS750. Such machines had massive sales, and UJMs {{continued to be}} produced {{for more than a}} decade, with some examples like the CB750 Nighthawk continuing into 2003.|$|R
50|$|The {{superheated}} Class GA had a commodious cab and had plate frames, with {{a copper}} Belpaire firebox and combustion chamber. The piston valves were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, driven from the coupled wheels furthest from the respective cylinders {{and controlled by}} steam reversing gear which was fitted under the boiler barrel between the <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> plates. The bissel trucks at the extremities of the locomotive were fitted with Cartazzi axle box control to allow the axles sideways play since the truck itself did not pivot, but was compensated with the adjacent pair of coupled wheels.|$|R
50|$|The SR400 has an {{air-cooled}} 4-stroke {{single cylinder}} SOHC 2-valve engine with a dry-sump — with the downtubes of the motorcycle's frame {{serving as the}} engine's oil reservoir and cooling system — thereby {{eliminating the need for}} an external oil cooler, reducing engine pumping losses, and allowing increased ground clearance as well as reduced overall width. The bike's semi-double <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> uses high-strength steel. The SR400 had a kick-starter and no electric start. To aid with starting, the bike had a sight glass {{on the right side of}} the cylinder head indicating the optimal cylinder position for starting, as well as a decompressor lever on the left handlebar.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the GS Series was the four-cylinder GS750 {{released}} alongside the GS400 parallel twin in November 1976. (1977 Model Year). The GS750 engine was essentially patterned off the Kawasaki Z1-900, and became the design basis for all air-cooled Suzuki four-stroke fours until {{the release of the}} GSX-R. The GS750 engine was fitted into a dual <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> with telescopic forks, twin rear shocks and a front disc brake. The new GS750 was lauded for its handling {{at the time of its}} release, which was a significant improvement over its Japanese contemporaries, the older Honda CB750, the shaft-driven Yamaha XS750, and the more powerful but wayward handling Kawasaki 900.|$|R
50|$|The main <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> {{was carried}} on {{adjustable}} pivots. The front pivot was a spherical type, {{located on the}} front engine unit's frame between the driving and trailing coupled wheels, while the rear pivot was a flat oil-bath type, located on the rear engine unit's frame over the driving wheels. Each engine unit’s frames were formed of two continuous bars, 33 ft long and extending from the buffer beams at the outer ends to the cross-beams over the Bissel wheels at the inner ends. The front engine unit was equipped with steam as well as vacuum brake gear, while the hind unit was equipped with steam brake gear and handbrake gear.|$|R
5000|$|Hero Honda Passion is a {{motorcycle}} manufactured in India by Hero Honda. It {{is one of}} the world's largest selling motorcycles, second only to Hero Honda Splendor. Passion debuted in the year 2001. [...] Its graphics and colours were first refreshed in the year 2003 and it was rechristened Passion Plus. Its graphics were again updated in the year 2008 and now black alloy wheels are standard with an all black engine. [...] The engine is a 97.2 cc air-cooled, four-stroke single-cylinder. The chassis is a tubular <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> type. Although it is under 100 cc, it is marketed as an executive class bike due to its styling and price.|$|R
50|$|The Standard was {{discontinued}} in 1923, and the <b>Cradle</b> Spring <b>Frame</b> was discontinued with it. Indian {{would not}} offer rear suspension on a production motorcycle again until 1940, when the Chief and the Four {{would be given}} plunger suspension.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} way Ducati had sought Seely's frame {{expertise}} in 1970, Cagiva now went to Massimo Tamburini of Bimota to design a new frame {{and look for the}} 750 F1. The Ducati Paso was born, and was named in honour of Renzo Pasolini. The engine was no longer a stressed member of the <b>frame.</b> The <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> used M1R Marzocchi forks and rising rate rear suspension. It weighed 195 kg and had almost fully enclosed bodywork. The rear cylinder head was reversed so that both cylinders could share a single twin throat Weber carburettor. The Paso was the second proposal from Tamburini, the first, considered too expensive to produce by the Ducati board, became the Bimota DB1.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a {{stressed}} {{member of the}} heavy duty open <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> with a central box section front downtube between the forward cylinders. A small car-sized starter motor and generator were fitted. It had a five-speed transmission, {{at a time when}} most motorcycles had four. Ceriani developed the suspension package, but riders today would be alarmed by the inadequate front and rear single leading shoe 8.675 in drum brakes. The stopping distance was huge, and had to be allowed for. It had a 61.2 in wheelbase, and weighed 596 lb dry. Taglioni dismissed the Berliners' suggestion of shaft drive, and chose chain final drive. The police specification stipulated 16-inch tyres, so there was little choice in that.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Y 2726 -type <b>double</b> <b>cradle</b> {{straight}} {{bevel gear}} milling machine has been widely used at home and abroad, it cut {{straight bevel gear}} to barrel-type teeth by gear generating motion method. To avoid changing and adjusting transmission system at cutting different gears, this paper presents an innovation project that utilizes four servo motors to drive rotation of two cradles and two work piece heads with computer numerical control technology. Most transmission chains are removed. The generating motion of gear cutting is finished by interpolation of two servo motors controlled by CNC system. The producing efficiency is improved over 50 % and the precision of manufactured gear is reached to class of seven...|$|R
50|$|The Class FC Modified Fairlie was, in essence, an {{adaptation}} of the Kitson-Meyer concept. It was similar in appearance to a Garratt, but with the boiler, cab, coal and water bunkers all mounted on a single rigid frame which extended almost over {{the full length of}} the locomotive. This superstructure was supported on two engine units by means of pivots. The pivot centres were located approximately at the centre of the coupled wheelbase of each engine unit. In the Garratt design, by comparison, the coal and water bunkers are mounted directly on the engine units and pivot with them, while the boiler, firebox and cab are mounted on a rigid <b>cradle</b> <b>frame</b> which is suspended between the two engine units.|$|R
