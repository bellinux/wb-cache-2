5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory numerus clausus rule under Miklós Horthy's regime. The {{political}} climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot, and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Werner Heisenberg said that it was the hardiness of Teller's spirit, rather than stoicism, that allowed him to cope so well with the accident.|$|E
5|$|When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> adult, Samson {{left the}} hills of his people to see the cities of Philistia. He {{fell in love with}} a Philistine woman from Timnah, whom he decided to marry, {{ignoring}} the objections of his parents, who were concerned because the Israelites were forbidden to marry Gentiles. In the development of the narrative, the intended marriage was shown to be part of God's plan to strike at the Philistines.|$|E
5|$|General George S. Patton {{himself had}} a gunfight when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> second {{lieutenant}} chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted {{men had been}} sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa's men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his obsolete single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1956–57 season, the {{selectors}} met {{to choose}} a team for a short non-Test tour of New Zealand. The leading contender for the captaincy was 28-year-old Victorian Neil Harvey, who had been a regular member of the team for eight years and was the senior batsman. However, both Harvey and Miller had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. The selectors thus thrust Craig into the leadership at the age of 21 and a half. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> player leading an inexperienced team—the youngest cricket team from any country to be sent overseas, with no players older than 30. It was seen as a bold move, as Craig had only played six Tests, was far from being a regular member of the team and had only a year of captaincy at first-class level.|$|E

Many of his works reflect daily life, customs and traditions of the state. Some of his better known works include Niño indígena mexicano, Catedral de Puebla, and Pensando en Puebla.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in the late 1790s with the name Humehume. His father was King Kaumualii, ruler of the islands of Kauai and Niihau. His mother was a commoner, of whom not much is known. This might explain an {{important}} event that happened when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy.|$|E
25|$|His father, Thomas Meagher (1796–1874), was {{a wealthy}} {{merchant}} who had retired to enter politics. He was twice elected Mayor of the City, which he represented in Parliament from August 1847 to March 1857. He {{had lived in}} the city since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man, having migrated from Newfoundland in present-day Canada.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy, he {{was also}} {{interested}} in investigating the history of Granada. During excavations carried out in 1872, he discovered the first remains at Medina Elvira, an archaeological site in the Baetic Cordillera, which was probably the origination point for the Taifa of Granada, a medieval Berber kingdom.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> {{engineer}} {{right out}} of college when he received his first of his over 200 patents. He purchased an outboard motor manufacturing company in Cedarburg, Wisconsin in 1939, intending to make magnetic separators for the area's dairy industry. The company had 300 defective motors, which he rebuilt and sold to catalog company Montgomery Ward. Orders kept coming for the motors, and Kiekhaefer Corporation was born.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} {{referred to}} as Cameron Phillips, that surname was used only in the pilot episode. Since then, she generally poses as John Connor's sister and, accordingly, uses whatever surname is {{being used by the}} Connors at the time. In the first season, that name is Baum, an in-episode homage to L. Frank Baum, whose novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Sarah used to read to John when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy.|$|E

25|$|Galileo {{also was}} {{interested}} {{by the laws}} of the pendulum, his first observations was when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man. In 1583, while he was praying in the cathedral at Pisa, his attention was arrested by the motion of the great lamp lighted and left swinging, referencing his own pulse for time keeping. To him the period appeared the same, even after the motion had greatly diminished, discovering the isochronism of the pendulum.|$|E
25|$|Born as Rudolf Stöger in {{the village}} of Pernegg an der Mur, Styria, in the then Austrian Empire in 1861, Stöger-Steiner's father died when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy, leading his mother to marry a then Oberleutnant in the Austrian Army, Joseph Steiner. Stöger-Steiner's stepfather, a veteran of the Danish {{campaign}} where he had been mentioned in dispatches to the Kaiser, had a profound influence on the young man's development and encouraged him to enlist in the Army.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln {{arrived in}} the Springfield area when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man in 1831, though he would not {{actually}} {{live in the city}} until 1837. He spent the ensuing six years in New Salem where he began his legal studies, joined the state militia and was elected to the Illinois General Assembly. In 1837 Lincoln moved to Springfield and spent the next 24 years as a lawyer and politician. Lincoln delivered his Lyceum address in Springfield. His farewell speech when he left for Washington is a classic in American oratory.|$|E
