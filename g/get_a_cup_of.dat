2500|$|Connolly's biography, Billy, {{written by}} wife Pamela Stephenson, {{documented}} years {{of physical and}} sexual abuse by his father, which began when he was ten and lasted until he was about fifteen. [...] "Sometimes, when father hit me, I flew over the settee backwards in a sitting position. It was fabulous. Just like real flying, except you didn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea or a safety belt or anything." [...] In 1949, Mona {{gave birth to a}} son, Michael, by a [...] "local man". He was presented as a brother to Billy and Flo, and nobody questioned it.|$|E

2500|$|During {{their time}} with EMI Records the band {{consistently}} experienced troubles with their contract: upon their initial negotiations only {{three members of}} the group (Rowland, Archer and Geoffrey [...] "Jeff" [...] Blythe), called the [...] "nucleus", were signed to the label, which caused a stir within the group. They were also only being paid 6% of the royalties, whereas most bands receive 10–12%. This led to Rowland threatening to steal the album from the studio and hold it ransom until their pay was increased, which EMI laughed at. However, {{on the last day of}} mixing the record, while Wingfield was out of the studio to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, the members of the group locked the door to the studio, each taking a carton of magnetic tape and ran through the building to their getaway vehicle, a Morris Minor which belonged to Saunders' girlfriend, and drove to Rowland's parents' house in Birmingham. EMI demanded the tapes back but the band had already set off on their sell-out UK tour. The band gave the tapes back when EMI raised their pay to 9%, but they almost destroyed them by travelling through the London Underground, which could have demagnetized them and wiped everything.|$|E
60|$|Gavin {{found his}} mother {{wondering}} how one should set about <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea in <b>a</b> {{house that had}} a servant in it. He boldly rang the bell, and the willing Jean answered it so promptly (in a rush and jump) that Margaret was as much startled as Aladdin {{the first time he}} rubbed his lamp.|$|R
5000|$|An old Jewish man {{riding on}} a train begins to moan: [...] "Oy, am I thirsty; oy, am I thirsty", to the {{annoyance}} of the other passengers.

Feeling satisfied, the other passenger sits down again, only to hear [...] "Oy, was I thirsty; oy, was I thirsty".|$|R

6000|$|... 'No; {{it is of}} no use {{to fight}} against it,' said Amy, {{as soon as he}} was a little better. 'Never mind Philip, I'll go to him. You must keep quiet, and I will <b>get</b> you <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> hot tea.' ...|$|R

60|$|Come, my friends. Here {{is enough}} of ordinaire and port for to-day. My bottle has run out. Will anybody have any more? Let us go up stairs, and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea from the ladies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, go {{and change}} your clothes at once, Jack; {{it has taken}} all the colour out of your face. I will <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> hot tea ready for you {{by the time you}} come down." ...|$|E

The motorcyclists are ordered to leave the county, albeit paying for all damage. However, Johnny returns alone to Wrightsville, and re-visits the cafe to say goodbye to Kathie one final time. He first tries to hide his humiliation and acts as though he's leaving after <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, but then he returns, genuinely smiles, and gives her the stolen trophy as a memory gift, and as a sign that he will end up with that violent lifestyle.|$|R
6000|$|The ex-king reflected. 'That's {{about the}} best thing that could have happened,' he said. 'Where are the bombs? In that farm-house on the {{opposite}} hill-side! Why! the place is in sight! Let us go. I'll dress. Is there any one in the place, Firmin, to <b>get</b> us <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee?' ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a user evaluation to design a glanceable user interface presenting physical activity feedback to office workers during the workday. The feedback is presented on a central and public display next to the coffee machine in the office building. Users should be able to receive the feedback quickly and easily while <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee − the user interface should be glanceable. The feedback should communicate the (real-time) amount of physical activity and the progress toward the goal of the user for a day. Three mock-ups of user interfaces were developed and evaluated in a user evaluation study. Differences on reaction time and user preferences were found. None of these results were significant. Adding group information to the mock-up increases reaction time and therefore lowers the glanceability negatively...|$|R
6000|$|Toward {{the close}} of the entertainment, I {{suggested}} to Peggy, one of the girls who had waited upon us, that <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea would be a nice thing to take; and I would thank her for one. She replied that {{it was too late for}} tea; but she would <b>get</b> me <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> [...] "swipes" [...] if I wanted it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well; a Florentine doesn't mind bidding a {{fair price}} for news: it stays the stomach a little though he may win no hose by it. If I {{take you to the}} prettiest damsel in the Mercato to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> milk--that will be a fair bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Munger seized her opportunity. [...] "Yes; {{and it is}} {{just such}} cases as this that the Social Union is {{designed}} to meet.

6000|$|Now it {{was plain}} enough. She {{was still a}} child at heart, in spite of those marks of time and toil on her countenance, still full of wonder and delight at this {{wonderful}} world of Chilmorton set amidst its limestone hills, under the wide blue sky--this poor squalid little village where I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea! ...|$|E

60|$|The rain {{began to}} fall sharply and {{we were forced to}} camp on the {{opposite}} bank as swiftly as possible, in order {{to get out of the}} storm. We worked hard and long to put everything under cover and were muddy and tired at the end of it. At last the tent was up, the outfit covered with waterproof canvas, the fire blazing and our bread baking. In pitching our camp we had plenty of assistance at the hands of several Indian boys from a near-by village, who hung about, eager to lend a hand, in the hope <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee and <b>a</b> piece of bread in payment. The streaming rain seemed to have no more effect upon them than on a loon. The conditions were all strangely similar to those at the Muddy River.|$|R

6000|$|But {{it was not}} so {{thought by}} the Jacky Jorams or by the Serjeant Burnabys. They made their final speeches,--the leading lawyer on each side, but they knew well what was coming.

He had given Meinik a small sum to lay out in cooking pots and {{necessaries}} for his own use.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep back, sirrah!--keep back! Suppose I AM your father, do {{you want}} to murder me? Good heavens! how the boy smells of gin and tobacco!

Egad, my dear Abbe, I think it is very likely that what the lad says is true." ...|$|E
5000|$|On June 5, 1986, Robert DiBernardo was {{lured to}} the {{basement}} offices of Sammy Gravano's drywall company on Stillwell Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.

Paruta got up, but instead of getting the coffee, Paruta took a [...]38-caliber revolver from a cabinet behind DiBernardo and shot him {{in the back of the}} head.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had another}} moment of {{weakness}} when I saw you. I determined to give myself a last chance of life. That is to say, I determined {{to offer you}} a last opportunity of treating me kindly. I asked you to <b>get</b> me <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea. If, in paying me this little attention, you only encouraged me by one fond word or one fond look, I resolved {{not to take the}} second dose of poison.|$|R
