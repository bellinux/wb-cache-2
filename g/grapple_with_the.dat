5|$|Further reviews came in {{this time}} as Defence {{planners}} attempted to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> questions regarding strategy following the wars of diplomacy of the previous three decades. The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine as the foundation upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb's 1986 review of Australia's defence capabilities seemed to provide the Reserves with a definite role. Nevertheless, there remained a reluctance to rebuild the Reserves and despite these major reviews, {{as late as the}} 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well-structured reserve force, as it had continued to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> competing demands of maintaining large-scale general readiness over developing a 'hard core' of capability within the Reserves that would be able to provide the Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency.|$|E
5|$|If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's {{intellectual}} awakening, it {{also was}} where he came to mature socially. Here he began to cast off the shyness and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming {{a regular contributor to}} the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> political and social issues facing South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The vital {{nature of}} coping {{with the lack of}} {{resources}} available in international emergency medicine may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E

5|$|Between the wars, Krueger {{served in}} a number of command and staff positions, and {{attended}} the Naval War College at his own request. In 1941, he assumed command of the Third Army, which he led in the Louisiana Maneuvers. He expected, in view of his age, to spend the war at home training troops, but in 1943 he was sent to General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area as commander of the Sixth Army and Alamo Force, which he led in a series of victorious campaigns against the Japanese. As an army commander, Krueger had to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> problems imposed by vast distances, inhospitable terrain, unfavorable climate, and an indefatigable and dangerous enemy. He had to balance MacArthur's need to speed up the tempo of operations in order to win campaigns with the more cautious approach of subordinates who often found themselves confronted by unexpectedly large numbers of Japanese troops. In the Battle of Luzon in 1945, his largest, longest and last battle, he was finally able to maneuver his army as he had in 1941 against a Japanese army under Tomoyuki Yamashita.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{anticipated}} that Labour would legislate for two years, then seek {{a general election}} and be returned with {{a majority of the}} seats. Were this to occur, he would be 67 when that term expired, and according to him perhaps too old to hold office. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only to learn that the newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back. During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself.|$|E
5|$|Prince Paul {{recognised}} {{the lack}} of national solidarity and political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Maček, {{the leader of the}} dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović met with Maček at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinović was unwilling or unable to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb ruling class. In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December. In this background, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) commander, General Dušan Simović had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the Concordat with the Vatican, and another coup plot following the December election.|$|E

25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E
500|$|The war film genre is not {{necessarily}} tightly defined: the American Film Institute, for example, speaks of [...] "films to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great War" [...] without attempting to classify these. However, some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that [...] "a war film’s objective, no matter how personal or emotional, {{is to make a}} viewer feel war." [...] John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans.|$|E

500|$|Dworkin {{warned in}} 1978 that [...] "Powell's opinion suffers from {{fundamental}} weaknesses, {{and if the}} Court is {{to arrive at a}} coherent position, far more judicial work remains to be done than a relieved public yet realizes". The Supreme Court has continued to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> question of affirmative action in higher education. [...] In the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger, it reaffirmed Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that Bakke might not be binding precedent due to the fractured lineup of justices in a plurality opinion. The court's decision in the 2013 case of Fisher v. University of Texas made alterations to the standards by which courts must judge affirmative action programs, but continued to permit race to be taken into consideration in university admissions, while forbidding outright quotas.|$|E

[...] In the storyline, Khan rushes to deal with the threat in Manhattan. However, Wilson revealed, [...] "She will face a very personal enemy as the chaos in Manhattan spills over into Jersey City, and she will be forced to make some very difficult choices. There will also be a very special guest appearance by a superhero Kamala—and the fans—have been waiting to meet for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the {{controversy}} the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) {{that he too}} was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him, [...] "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that {{it felt like the}} book [...] "wrote me". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E

500|$|The musical {{performances}} in this episode were mostly praised by critics, {{though there was}} little said {{about the quality of}} the abbreviated performance by the Hipsters in competition. There was near-universal approval for the first song heard, [...] "Don't Cry For Me Argentina", which Stack called [...] "totally beautiful" [...] and gave an [...] "A-"; he, like Burns, who said it was [...] "fantastic", loved having [...] "Rachel and Kurt get a chance to sing together". Jen Harper of BuddyTV echoed Kurt's words in the episode; she said [...] "Rachel really is as talented as she is irritating", but wished she [...] "didn't always look like she's crying while she's singing", and added that she was [...] "really digging Kurt in a lower register". Futterman noted that Rachel, as is usual with her [...] "power ballads", [...] "uses the time to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> latest obstacle to her future stardom, while we see Kurt deliver a clear, restrained take. Benigno called Michele's voice [...] "astounding", and added that her solo alternated [...] "with Kurt's audition with the Warblers, which is predictably outstanding", and gave the song a [...] "B+". Even those who disliked the song or the composer were won over by the performance: Berk gave it three stars out of five, and Burns thought it was [...] "fantastic"; both liked the song's tag-team presentation.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} {{cited as a}} factor in the success of the civil rights {{movement}} in the 1960s, however, in that it [...] "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it [...] "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" [...] and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as [...] "an act of humanity" [...] in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel [...] "gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 4, 1910. The film was released outside of the planned order due to a scheduling conflict. Originally The American and the Queen was planned to be released on this date, but it was instead pushed back to November 11. The film received mixed reviews from critics, H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News stated that the costuming and lace curtains on {{the windows of the}} home betrayed the supposed poverty of the Morgan family. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News, stated, [...] "This title would be completely misunderstood by the majority of moving picture show attendants. Some sporadic 'reformer' who does not know the original and who has never seen the film will fill 'space' on the iniquity of moving pictures founded on this title. If he did see the film it has not the necessary power to <b>grapple</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> terrible reality of a too common incident in daily life." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more picky in its wording and praise, stating: [...] "It was to be supposed that some company would finally present this familiar drama in pictorial form, and a reviewer must feel glad that it is over, for the film doesn't materially exalt the level of film output." [...] The review found the acting to be good, but found fault {{in the shadows of the}} actors fell towards a lamp instead of away from it. The New York Dramatic Mirror was not a neutral party for reviews and took a shot at the Thanhouser Company by running an article that stated: [...] "The Selig Company announces the production of Ten Nights in a Bar Room will not be confined to one reel, but will be given all the film that it requires for proper production. This departure from the restrictive limit of 1,000 feet gives promise that the drama will have adequate treatment." [...] Bowers states that the paper [...] "was acting the role of a spoiler, for the Selig version was not released until a half year later, in June 1911, and, except for spite, there was no reason to mention it now." ...|$|E
