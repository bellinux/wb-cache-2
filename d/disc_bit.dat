Despite the name, Parchive uses more advanced techniques that do not use simplistic parity methods of error detection and correction.|$|R
50|$|The first {{digital audio}} {{recorders}} were reel-to-reel decks introduced by {{companies such as}} Denon (1972), Soundstream (1979) and Mitsubishi. They used a digital technology known as PCM recording. Within a few years, however, many studios were using devices that encoded the digital audio data into a standard video signal, which was then recorded on a U-matic or other videotape recorder, using the rotating-head technology that was standard for video. A similar technology was used for a consumer format, Digital Audio Tape (DAT) which used rotating heads on a narrow tape contained in a cassette. DAT records at sampling rates of 48 kHz or 44.1 kHz, the latter being the same rate used on compact <b>discs.</b> <b>Bit</b> depth is 16 bits, also the same as compact discs. DAT was a failure in the consumer-audio field (too expensive, too finicky, and crippled by anti-copying regulations), but it became popular in studios (particularly home studios) and radio stations. A failed digital tape recording system was the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC).|$|R
5000|$|The {{technology}} {{is similar to}} FMD <b>discs.</b> The <b>bit</b> of data being held as a change in fluorescence characteristics once irradiated {{with one or two}} lasers. The target is irradiated with a pulse of laser(s) then a CCD or photodiode wait for an emitted light by the medium due to the Fluorescence effect (bit value set to [...] "1" [...] if emitted, else [...] "0").|$|R
50|$|In modern {{semiconductor}} memory, such as dynamic random-access memory, the two {{values of}} a bit may be represented by two levels of electric charge stored in a capacitor. In certain types of programmable logic arrays and read-only memory, a bit may be represented by {{the presence or absence}} of a conducting path at a certain point of a circuit. In optical <b>discs,</b> a <b>bit</b> is encoded as {{the presence or absence of}} a microscopic pit on a reflective surface. In one-dimensional bar codes, bits are encoded as the thickness of alternating black and white lines.|$|R
5000|$|I Am the Resurrection {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon its release, although most were favorable or equivocal. In his Allmusic review, critic Alex Henderson noted the [...] "interesting {{thing about this}} Fahey tribute compilation {{is the fact that}} it isn't dominated by fingerpickers and Fahey disciples." [...] and [...] "this compilation wasn't assembled with purists in mind." [...] He called the <b>disc</b> a <b>bit</b> uneven but it [...] "is full of pleasant surprises and is a memorable demonstration of the fact that Fahey's compositions can be useful well beyond the fingerpicker field." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Compact Disc has {{a similar}} [...] "no copy" [...] bit in the subcode, but nearly all disc-copying {{software}} ignores it, and usually removes it on copies. Consumer-grade dedicated hardware audio disc copiers usually honor the bozo bit, and will refuse to copy a <b>disc</b> with the <b>bit</b> set. Professional <b>disc</b> copiers ignore the bozo bit and will copy a protected disc.|$|R
50|$|Émily took to her self-titled {{second album}} {{becoming}} involved in the style and writing some songs. The result is a <b>disc</b> a <b>bit</b> more daring, resolutely focused on the textures of the 1980s. The first single from the album was 'Laissez-moi danser' originally performed by Dalida. Émily recalls her mother listening to the song when cleaning with her mother on the weekends. The song {{was the first to}} become a video from the album. The second radio single for 'Émily was' Adrénaline.' The third single, and second video for the album was for the song 'Au Grand Jour' which made a splash due to its provocative nature regarding sexuality of those of the same sex.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic site {{awarded the}} album 3 stars stating [...] "This <b>disc</b> is a <b>bit</b> unusual {{in a few}} ways. Vibraphonist Dave Pike sticks here {{exclusively}} to the marimba, while pianist Herbie Hancock is heard throughout on organ, an instrument he rarely played again... Most of the music consists of obscurities and {{is open to the}} influences of the boogaloo and pop rhythms of the era... An interesting effort".|$|R

50|$|BCore Disc {{began in}} Barcelona 1990, with the {{edition of the}} first record by the Barcelonian band Corn Flakes, called No Problem. The {{following}} editions resulted from recovering the investment for the first record and re-investing it on a second release, and so on. It was then that BCore <b>Disc</b> became a <b>bit</b> {{more than a simple}} hobby. It became a small label with a very specific line and style and with a small fan base. Oral communication {{was the only way to}} distribute information about the label. There were no promos nor advertisements.|$|R
40|$|The {{bit rate}} used for high quality digital signal is 16 bit at a {{sampling}} frequency of 44. 1 kHz (compact <b>disc).</b> Reducing the <b>bit</b> rate for stereo signals requires {{knowledge of the}} statistics.

DTS-HD High Resolution Audio is implemented as a core DTS stream plus an extension containing the two additional channels plus deltas to enable 96/24 sound reproduction.|$|R
60|$|From the {{foregoing}} cases {{it is certain}} that bits of meat and albumen, if at all damp, excite not only the glands to secrete, but the lobes to close. This movement is widely different from the rapid closure caused by one of the filaments being touched. We shall see its importance when we treat of the manner in which insects are captured. There is a great contrast between Drosera and Dionaea in the effects produced by mechanical irritation on the one hand, and the absorption of animal matter on the other. Particles of glass placed on the glands of the exterior tentacles of Drosera excite movement within nearly the same time, as do particles of meat, the latter being rather the most efficient; but when the glands of the <b>disc</b> have <b>bits</b> of meat given them, they transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles much more quickly than do these glands when bearing inorganic particles, or when irritated by repeated touches. On the other hand, with Dionaea, touching the filaments excites incomparably quicker movement than the absorption of animal matter by the glands. Nevertheless, in [page 299] certain cases, this latter stimulus is the more powerful of the two. On three occasions leaves were found which from some cause were torpid, so that their lobes closed only slightly, however much their filaments were irritated; but on inserting crushed insects between the lobes, they became in a day closely shut.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Accretion <b>discs</b> are a <b>bit</b> like waterfalls. Potential energy gets {{converted}} into kinetic and finally into thermal energy. The waterfall {{with the largest}} mass flux in Europe is Dettifoss in {{the northeast corner of}} Iceland with M = 1 : 5 Θ 10 5 kg=s. If Dettifoss were to be {{converted into}} a power plant, and if its efficiency was close to one hundred per cent, it would produce the equivalent of a luminosity of L = 100 MW. This is comparable with the power generated by an ordinary power plant, but less than the power produced by a nuclear power plant, which produces typically around 1000 MW. One is tempted to work out the change in water temperature per unit time due to viscous heating as the accretion stream splashes to the bottom. Equating the change of internal energy, c v ffiT, with the potential energy difference suggests a temperature i...|$|R
2500|$|Human Target – The Complete 1st Season was {{released}} as a widescreen three-disc region 1 DVD box set {{as well as}} a two-disc region free Blu-ray version on September 21, 2010. In addition to the 12 episodes of the season, which have an enhanced audio mix, a number of extras are included; several unaired and deleted scenes, an audio commentary by Mark Valley, Chi McBride, Jonathan E. Steinberg and Peter Johnson for the pilot episode and two featurettes; [...] "Human Target: Full Contact Television" [...] and [...] "Human Target: Confidential Informant". The set received a rating of 4.5 out of 5 from Blu-ray.com, with concerns expressed that [...] "squeezing twelve episodes onto two <b>discs</b> takes a <b>bit</b> of a toll" [...] and caused some artifacting. The site also questioned the use of a lossy 640 kbit/s audio track and the small number of special features, calling it [...] "a tad pricey for twelve episodes". By contrast, DVD Verdict said that the DVD's gave [...] "a better-than average offering of supplements".|$|R
40|$|The {{likelihood}} of development of degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{is related to}} the integrity of the TMJ disc. Predilection for mechanical failure of the TMJ disc may reflect inter-individual differences in TMJ loads. Nine females and eight males in each of normal TMJ disc position and bilateral disc displacement diagnostic groups consented to participate in our study. Disc position was determined by bilateral magnetic resonance images of the joints. Three-dimensional (3 D) anatomical geometry of each subject was used in a validated computer-assisted numerical model to calculate ipsilateral and contralateral TMJ loads for a range of biting positions (incisor, canine, molar) and angles (1 - 13). Each TMJ load was a resultant vector at the anterosuperior-most mediolateral midpoint on the condyle and characterized in terms of magnitude and 3 D orientation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for effects of biting position and angle on TMJ loads. Mean TMJ loads in subjects with disc displacement were 9. 5 - 69 % higher than in subjects with normal disc position. During canine biting, TMJ loads in subjects with disc displacement were 43 % (ipsilateral condyle, p= 0. 029) and 49 % (contralateral condyle, p= 0. 015) higher on average than in subjects with normal <b>disc</b> position. <b>Biting</b> angle effects showed that laterally directed forces on the dentition produced ipsilateral joint loads, which on average were 69 % higher (p= 0. 002) compared to individuals with normal TMJ disc position. The data reported here describe large differences in TMJ loads between individuals with disc displacement and normal disc position. The results support future investigations of inter-individual differences in joint mechanics as a variable in the development of DJD of the TMJ...|$|R
40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used and convenient method for many mining and civil applications to break rocks, especially hard rocks. Because of many environmental, safety and productivity issues (i. e. Cycle time), the industry and contractors are looking for an alternative system of breaking of rocks. In underground rock breakage applications such as tunneling, continuous mechanical excavation method, normally with tunnel boring machines (TBMs) or road headers is becoming more popular and commonly used by contractors. One of the main disadvantages of such system is that, it cannot handle very hard rocks and uneconomical major <b>disc</b> or <b>bit</b> wear takes place. Today, novel explosive free rock breaking technologies (thermal, electrical, nuclear energy and microwave) are available and could be used on their own or assist mechanical conventional machines to be able to break harder rock material. This is possible because it is hoped that the microwave will reduce the strength of the rock prior to the impact of mechanical device. Three main mechanical parameters of rocks such as compressive strength, tensile strength and abrasivity index value were used to highlight the influence of microwave on to the mechanical properties of rocks. Seven different rock types were prepared and tested. Each individual specimen was exposed to the microwave energy in three power levels 800, 1250 and 3000 watts, within 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 seconds time of exposure. Different rocks due to their mineralogy behave differently when exposed to microwave energy. CERCHAR abrasivity index value of almost all samples shows reduction of about 30 % as the power level of exposure increases. The tensile strength of certain samples reduces significantly as in basalt reduces of up to 80 %. The unconfined compressive strength value of almost all samples reduces about 30 % as well. The reduction of the strength and abrasivity of hard rock cause the penetration rate and the life time of cutter tools of a TBM to be increased by combining the microwave energy to the cutter head of the mechanical excavator...|$|R
