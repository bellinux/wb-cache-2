5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> but migrate to the lung.|$|E

50|$|During the thrust, <b>the</b> {{acceleration}} of <b>leg</b> mass {{away from the}} floor develops upward linear momentum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the {{acceleration of}} the angular expansion between legs and trunk develops angular momentum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> When <b>the</b> thrust is completed, movement of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> {{with respect to the}} trunk ceases suddenly and, as a result, the linear and angular momentum of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are transferred to the entire body.|$|R

5|$|During the attacks, both hotels were {{surrounded}} by Rapid Action Force personnel and Marine Commandos (MARCOS) and National Security Guards (NSG) commandos. When reports emerged that attackers were receiving television broadcasts, feeds to the hotels were blocked. Security forces stormed both hotels, and all nine attackers {{were killed by the}} morning of 29 November. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan of the NSG was killed during the rescue of Commando Sunil Yadav, who was hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> by a bullet during the rescue operations at Taj. 32 hostages were killed at the Oberoi Trident.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{days later}} Dundas claimed a {{probable}} victory against a Bf 110, after {{a battle with}} German aircraft six miles north of RAF Warmwell at 16:30.

During the battle Dundas was hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew again the next day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, R6915, still exists, having been preserved by the Imperial War Museum. By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|For acute cases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least}} five days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E

5|$|For this campaign, Robertson {{was made}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), but later that month he was hospitalised for varicose veins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> he had broken in 1917. He was {{replaced}} as commander of the 19th Infantry Brigade by Alan Vasey. When Robertson recovered he was given responsibility for the training of AIF reinforcements in the Middle East. Robertson's service {{in the field and}} his long experience in training troops made him an ideal candidate for the post. For his services, Robertson was mentioned in despatches a third time.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Johannes Theodor Reinhardt {{proposed}} {{they were}} ground doves, based on studies of a dodo skull he had rediscovered {{in the royal}} Danish collection of Copenhagen. This view was met with ridicule, but later supported by Strickland and Melville, who suggested the common descent of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848, after dissecting the only known dodo specimen with soft tissue and comparing it with the few solitaire remains then available. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> bones, features which were otherwise known only in pigeons.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman known for his fitness. He developed his skills through persistent training with professional sprinters {{in order to improve}} his anticipation and speed off the mark. Brown often fielded at slip or in the covers. With Australia boasting the leg spin pairing of O'Reilly and Grimmett in the 1930s, close-catchers were frequently used. Along with Fingleton, Brown often fielded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> trap position.|$|E

5|$|In {{competitions}} using two-legged matches, {{each team}} competes at home once, with an aggregate score {{from the two}} matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule {{may be used to}} determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.|$|E
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E

The fighting continued until all the personnel trapped in the basement either surrendered or were killed.|$|E
