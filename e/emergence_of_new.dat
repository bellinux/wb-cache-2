5|$|From {{specimens}} {{collected in}} 1888, Ridgway {{was the first}} to describe hood mockingbird, large cactus finch, and medium tree finch, all endemic to the Galápagos. The latter two are members of the so-called Darwin's finch group of tanagers, significant for their impact on Charles Darwin's reasoning about evolution and the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> {{forces of}} urban factions, rural voters, and others, {{engaging}} in continued conflict {{with each other}} for their own interests, meant that the problem of effective governance awaited resolution. The populist government of the Gracchi had come to an end by violence; and this provided a brutal precedent that would be followed by many other rulers of Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{new wave}} of British heavy metal (commonly {{abbreviated}} as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper Sounds to describe the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, {{during the period of}} punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.|$|E

5|$|Also of {{historical}} importance were the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms {{to the south}} of the Kongo Empire, in the Ambundu area. Additionally, the Lunda Empire, in the south-east of the present day DRC, occupied a portion of what today is north-eastern Angola. In the south of the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were a reflection of ethnic cleavages that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and were instrumental in consolidating these cleavages and fostering the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> and distinct social identities.|$|E
5|$|Amman is {{introducing}} {{itself as a}} business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E

5|$|The new {{treaties}} gave minorities {{the right}} to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In {{the case of the}} Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction. The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny of others and to the threat of sanction and intervention from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E

25|$|The expolitation {{of sites}} with mineral {{resources}} may have increased during Satavahana period, {{leading to the}} <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> settlements in these areas.
