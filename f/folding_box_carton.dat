This research aims to obtain the best secondary packaging for cube chili, determine the level of consumer preference towards the packaging and get the information about the added value of packaged cube chilli. Selection of the best secondary packaging for cube chili according assessment from 5 experts with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, distributing hedonic test questionnaires to 25 customers for the selection of the preferred packaging, analyzed with Kruskal Wallis method and determination of the added value packaging with Hayami method.

Result of this research showed that the best secondary packaging according to expert assessment is PS box 1 mm (0, 468). The packaging of cube chili that most preferred by consumers is FC-box 0. 5 mm (4, 44). The highest added value is owned by the cube chili that packed with PS boxes 0. 167 mm (51. 89...|$|E

40|$|Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) {{strategy}} has been adopted by apparel supply chain recently. In the apparel industry, finished products are usually manufactured, packed and shipped in bulk to retailers and packing is carried out using <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> with various standardized dimensions. VMI-based supply chain cannot allow ordering <b>boxes</b> from <b>carton</b> suppliers after receiving an order of apparel retailers. Each order is different in style with small quantities.

40|$|Abstract. The {{curriculum}} {{construction is}} a very important work leading to the excellent course. Processing Technology of Paper <b>Box</b> and <b>Carton</b> (including 32 class hours) is a new elective course to the printing engineering in our college. It is very important and necessary to construct the course in time. At first, the current states and difficulties were introduced in the paper, which was that teaching contents, teaching courseware and teacher team should be all improved. Especially, the teaching content proportion on both paper <b>box</b> and <b>carton</b> was set. And then the ideas and ways used for building up the curriculum system are presented as integrating the teaching contents, reforming the teaching mode and strengthening the teaching management. Finally, the significance of carrying out the teaching reform was put forward, and the achievements of course construction should be applied to the usual teaching work. The Current Situation of the Curriculum In order to broaden the employment channel and the scope of knowledge for the students majored in printing engineering, a curriculum Processing Technology of Paper <b>Box</b> and <b>Carton</b> was added in new training programs. The curriculum was carried out three times since 2009, but there are some questions at the aspects of the teaching outline, teaching courseware and teacher team...|$|R
