Technologies are driving public institutions to sustain a participatory democracy and leading citizens to act as active co-producers of social, democratic and public value. Sustainability of public organizations seems to rely on embracing new technologies for opening up to contribution and participation of citizens in order to make effectively participatory and democratic government agencies and public administration...|$|E

40|$|Governments {{across the}} industrialised world suffer a deep {{legitimacy}} crisis. Survey after survey shows a steady decline in citizen's confidence toward their governments (Inglehart, 1997). Despite vigorous debates on {{the causes and}} the consequences of this legitimacy crisis (Pharr and Putnam, 2000), a stream of analysis points to the technocratic and undemocratic nature of public institutions. Conventional politics is increasingly causing dissatisfaction, disenchantment and even alienation among citizens. "Governments are in a crisis of identity, some would say of legitimacy, with election turnouts low in many OECD countries and a widespread feeling <b>of</b> <b>disenchantment</b> among <b>citizens</b> with government and the democratic process " (OECD, 2001 : 8). The Commission of the European Communities (2001 : 7) notes that "Europeans feel alienated from the Union’s work " despite the fact that "it has a double democratic mandate through a Parliament representing EU citizens and a Council representing the elected governments of the Member States. " These observations have fed into a relatively recent call to begin thinking about democracy outside conventional institutions. At the centre <b>of</b> this <b>disenchantment</b> is the crisis of representation. Th...|$|R

40|$|This article {{makes use}} of the reading of de Tocqueville put forward by Agnes Antoine in order to think through the link that unites modem {{democracy}} and Christianity. Antoine turns to Toqueville to show that democracy arose {{on the basis of}} Christian resources and that it must be able to lean on a religious consciousness in order to respond to the existential questioning <b>of</b> <b>citizens.</b> The much more recent analyses by Gauchet <b>of</b> the <b>disenchantment</b> <b>of</b> the world make it possible to render this double thesis more precise and more refined. However, the confrontation of Gauchet with the reading of Tocqueville developed by Antoine leads us above all to realise that the link uniting democracy with a specific religion incites us to inquire into the capacity of democracy to integrate authentic religious pluralism within itself (transl. by J. Dudley) ...|$|R

50|$|Modernity is the {{psychology}} behind the <b>disenchantment</b> <b>of</b> {{the people with}} their surroundings. As society modernizes, or advances, the external conditions around each individual evolves, therefore stimulating changes in the individual's attitude. Over a period of time, the attitude towards society and its goals will become negative, and whichever stage (public purpose/private interest), will cease to be ideal. Studies and surveys show that in the 20th century, this critical time period to develop discontent has decreased, implying that people are quickly dissatisfied with the ever-changing society.|$|R
