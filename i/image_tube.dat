It was not until 1934 that Holst, working for Philips, created the first successful infrared converter tube. This tube consisted of a photocathode in proximity to a fluorescent screen. Using a simple lens, an image {{was focused on the}} photocathode and a potential difference of several thousand volts was maintained across the tube, causing electrons dislodged from the photocathode by photons to strike the fluorescent screen. This caused the screen to light up with the image of the object focused onto the screen, however the image was non-inverting. With this image converter type tube, it was possible to view infrared light in real time, for the first time.|$|E

50|$|Early color cameras {{used the}} obvious {{technique}} of using separate red, {{green and blue}} image tubes {{in conjunction with a}} color separator, a technique still in use with 3CCD solid state cameras today. It was also possible to construct a color camera that used a single <b>image</b> <b>tube.</b> One technique has already been described (Trinicon above). A more common technique and a simpler one from the tube construction standpoint was to overlay the photosensitive target with a color striped filter having a fine pattern of vertical stripes of green, cyan and clear filters (i.e. Green; Green+Blue & Green+Blue+Red) repeating across the target. The advantage of this arrangement was that for virtually every color, the video level of the green component was always less than the cyan, and similarly the cyan was always less than the white. Thus the contributing images could be separated without any reference electrodes in the tube. If the three levels were the same, then that part of the scene was green. This method suffered from the disadvantage that the light levels under the three filters were almost certain to be different, with the green filter passing not more than one third of the available light.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic Gating (or 'gating') is a {{means by}} which an <b>image</b> {{intensifier}} <b>tube</b> may be switched ON and OFF in a controlled manner. An electronically gated <b>image</b> intensifier <b>tube</b> functions like a camera shutter, allowing images to pass through when the electronic [...] "gate" [...] is enabled. The gating durations can be very short (nanoseconds or even picoseconds). [...] This makes gated <b>image</b> intensifier <b>tubes</b> ideal candidates for use in research environments where very short duration events must be photographed. As an example, in order to assist engineers in designing more efficient combustion chambers, gated imaging tubes have been used to record very fast events such as the wavefront of burning fuel in an internal combustion engine.|$|R

50|$|For {{many years}} the {{photocathode}} {{was the only}} practical method for converting light to an electron current. As such it tends {{to function as a}} form of 'electric film' and shared many characteristics of photography. It was therefore the key element in opto-electronic devices, such as TV camera tubes like the orthocon and vidicon, and in <b>image</b> <b>tubes</b> such as intensifiers, converters, and dissectors. Simple phototubes were used for motion detectors and counters.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, Field-sequential color {{systems were}} {{developed}} which used synchronized motor-driven color-filter disks at the camera's <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> {{and at the}} television receiver. Each disk consisted of red, blue, and green transparent color filters. In the camera, the disk was in the optical path, and in the receiver, it {{was in front of}} the CRT. Disk rotation was synchronized with vertical scanning so that each vertical scan in sequence was for a different primary color. This method allowed regular black-and-white image tubes and CRTs to generate and display color images. A field-sequential system developed by Peter Goldmark for CBS was demonstrated to the press on September 4, 1940, and was first shown to the general public on January 12, 1950. Guillermo González Camarena independently developed a field-sequential color disk system in Mexico in the early 1940s, for which he requested a patent in Mexico on August 19 of 1940 and in the USA in 1941. Gonzalez Camarena produced his color television system in his laboratory Gon-Cam for the Mexican market and exported it to the Columbia College of Chicago, who regarded it as the best system in the world.|$|E

40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 38 A brief {{description}} is given {{of the various}} types of image tubes presently used in astronomical research and a review is presented of the past applications of image tubes to direct astronomical photography. A detailed laboratory evaluation of the Carnegie <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> is summarized and photographs at the telescope are presented to confirm and extend the results obtained in the laboratory. Iris photometry of stellar images can be carried out on Carnegie tube photographs with about the same accuracy as is obtained by normal photographic techniques. Compared to unaided plates the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> typically requires about 1 / 15 the exposure time to record stellar images of a specified threshold magnitude. When exposures are made to near the sky limit, however, the Carnegie tube cannot record stars as faint as can be recorded with an unaided plate. When exposed at a given focal length telescope, the limiting magnitude of an <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> record is about 1 magnitude brighter than that of an unaided photograph. Primarily two characteristics of the Carnegie tube, an over-all mottled sensitivity pattern and a light- induced background, are found to be responsible for the loss in limiting magnitude of a Carnegie tube record. The mottle pattern is characterized by an rms variation in sensitivity of ± 1. 3 percent. It modulates the photographic record of the night-sky radiation and seriously affects the signal -to -noise ratio of the threshold images. The additional background produced by the light- induced background of the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> generally amounts to 25 percent of the night-sky radiation on a sky-limited photograph. In order to record the same sky-limited magnitude on a Carnegie tube plate and an unaided plate, the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> record must be exposed at a longer focal length telescope. The exposure time required by the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> is then about 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 that of the unaided plate. Because of the higher scale of the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> photograph in such a case, however, the effective gain provided by the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> over the unaided plate is generally somewhat larger than the relative exposure time. The photography of extended objects is found to be particularly affected by the nonuniformities of the <b>image</b> <b>tube.</b> Besides reducing the over-all signal-to-noise ratio of the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> record, the generalmottle pattern and additional discrete patches and ripples in sensitivity of the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> tend to mimic low contrast features of galaxies and nebulae. The rather subjective effects of the nonuniformities can be significantly reduced by using telescopes with moderately long focal lengths, so that the seeing image is then large in comparison to the nonuniformities. The photography of astronomical sources through narrowband interference filters {{has been found to be}} a particularly promising application of the Carnegie <b>image</b> <b>tube.</b> Preliminary tests reported in the present study include the photography of supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, galaxies, and reflection nebulae. The basic quality criterion for comparing the <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> to unaided photographic emulsions is argued to be the detective quantum efficiency. Typical values of the gain over unaided emulsions provided by the Carnegie tube are calculated to be in the range 10 to 20. It is emphasized, however, that because of the variety of requirements in specific research areas and because of the several unique characteristics of a given <b>image</b> <b>tube,</b> no single figure of merit may be defined that will predict the usefulness of an <b>image</b> <b>tube</b> in all applications. It is suggested that the resolution of a detector should not generally be combined into the calculation of a single figure of merit but should be considered as a separate quality criterion. Certain problems with the Carnegie tube (and other image tubes as well) potentially limit its usefulness in specific research areas. Besides the problems already mentioned, other problems include low resolution, geometrical distortion, the complexities of analyzing the final record (as compared to an unaided photograph), and the limited field of the <b>image</b> <b>tube.</b> Each of these characteristics can be highly significant or entirely inconsequential in different applications...|$|E
