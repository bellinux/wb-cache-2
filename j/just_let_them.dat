She {{was friendly}} with Bodger, {{but not enough}} for him to let her know about Badger. She was briefly the acting Headmistress after Mrs Trout was sent back to Teacher Training School, but returned to her old post when Mrs Bogart took over as Headmistress. As a teacher she was incompetent - she never made the children do any work and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> play games all day when she was acting Headmistress.|$|E
25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

500|$|During the {{creation}} of [...] God of War, the game's director David Jaffe attempted to create a version of Kratos that looked brutal but had a different appearance from what {{is considered to be}} the traditional Greek hero. The character's traditional armor was removed to show the character's individualism, and details such as hair and other [...] "flowing things" [...] were removed. Jaffe said of his final version of the character, that while [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie Wen, {{director}} of visual development on God of War and God of War II, {{is responsible for}} designing Kratos. Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture, which led him to sketch a series of images of Kratos on napkins at a restaurant, introducing {{the idea of the}} double-chained blades and eventually Kratos' iconic design. Double-chained blades were chosen as Kratos' signature weapon because they emphasized the character's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid. Jaffe said of the final version of [...] the character, [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} Nimrod, Green Day {{explained}} to Cavallo {{their desire to}} create a more experimental album as the band had grown tired of its traditional three chord song structure. [...] Armstrong drew inspiration from The Clash's landmark record London Calling, and referred to Nimrod as [...] "the record I've wanted to make since the band started." [...] The album was intended to break the constraints of typical punk rock music. [...] To preserve the quality of his songwriting, Armstrong began writing each song on acoustic guitar, to which the rest of the band would later add heavier instrumentation and faster tempos. [...] Green Day recorded around 30 songs for Nimrod and picked 18 of them for the record. Dirnt explained that the recording was much more loosely structured than previous albums, and that creating songs was the focus as opposed to making a cohesive record. [...] He observed, [...] "We've always screwed around with different types of music during our jams, but we'd say, 'OK let's stop and get back to the album.' This time we <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> come up." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E

2500|$|There were {{plans to}} {{relocate}} the Danubian Cossack Host to the Kuban, where Gladky visited in 1830.

Instead the Tsar allowed Gladky to remain in Novorossiya and find a piece of land that was uninhabited (Rather than <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> remain). Gladky chose the northern coast of the Azov Sea, next to Berdyansk. In May 1832 Gladky carried his men over to the new land and there they formed the Azov Cossack Host. [...] Initially numbering 2336 people (including 687 women), the new Host was the only Cossack force in Russia which had a Naval role, acting as a coast guard for the Caucasus and Crimean coasts, by defending them from Turkish and Circassian raiders.|$|E

And all throughout my career I’ve noticed that the main thing people try to point out is the Illuminati, Satanic symbols and references in music videos—specifically in my shit. And like, in no way shape or form am I the type of individual that will be ever thinking of that type of shit while {{we were working on}} these videos. But it’s so interesting to see how sure of themselves people are, talking about this. It’s like, 'No, I know it, I know it! He sold his soul to the devil! I know he’s friends with Satan! I can feel it.' You know what I mean? Niggas be knowing I guess. So my way of tricking everybody, being that I had that control, I was like, 'Oh man. Wouldn’t it be cool if we just threw a bunch of fucking Satanic devil-worship Illuminati symbols into the video, just like abruptly popping up all over the place and fuck people up?' Just to fuck with them and then not say anything, like wait months and not say shit. <b>Just</b> <b>let</b> <b>‘em</b> trip out, <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>‘em</b> talk.
