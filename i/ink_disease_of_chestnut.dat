40|$|Much new {{information}} produced on Phytophthora diseases {{of trees in}} Europe since the 2007 IUFRO meeting will be reviewed. The presentation will include updates on P. alni induced dieback of alders, including first reports of the pathogen from devastated riparian stands in Spain and evidence for the selection of frost resistant strains in P. alni ssp. alni in alpine and continental parts of Germany; advances in understanding deciduous and mediterranean oak declines; dieback of European beech and <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>chestnut,</b> including a possibly climatically driven northward migration of P. cinnamomi; and serious {{new developments in the}} spread of P. ramorum and P. kernoviae in Europe. Further evidence will be presented for the importance of (i) the international nursery trade as an intercontinental pathway for alien invasive Phytophthora species; (ii) the planting of infested nursery stock as a primary pathway into forests and natural ecosystems. Also covered will be the monitoring of Phytophthora populations in streams; the development of new molecular-based identification tools; the unravelling of the P. citricola complex; and the current status of the remarkable array of new Phytophthora taxa recovered from forest and natural ecosystems in Europe over the past 15 years...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora {{translates}} to ‘plant destroyer’ and are fungal-like, hemibiotrophic plant pathogens. Phytophthora {{was discovered in}} the mid 19 th century, as the causal agent of the widespread collapse of potato crops throughout Europe. Today, more than 150 Phytophthora species have been identified {{and they continue to}} cause massive problems, both in agriculture and forest ecosystems. There are many Phytophthoras species responsible for dramatic forest diebacks. In Europe, Phytophthoras are casual agents of oak decline, <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>chestnut,</b> beech decline and dieback of alders. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine which forest Phytophthora species are present in southern Sweden. Symptomatic trees were identified in five urban forest settings in Southern Skåne. Stem tissue and soil surrounding symptomatic trees were collected. Phytophthora isolates were cultured on artificial media and their DNA sequenced by sanger-­sequencing. The obtained sequences were compared with the known reference sequences using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at NCBI. Five Phytophthora species were identified: P. cactorum, P. cambivora, P. gonapodyides, P. plurivora and P. syringae. The result includes the first findings of P. gonapodyides causing stem lesions on trees in Sweden. Confirmation of pathogenicity of P. gonapodyides in an inoculation trial using obtained P. gonapodyides isolates confirmed that they were able to infect healthy beech seedlings, resulting in stem lesions. Many common tree species in Southern Sweden are susceptible to the Phytophthora species found in this study. Trade with nursery seedlings is an important pathway of dispersal and establishment of Phytophthoras in natural environments. There is no efficient treatment and it is practically impossible to eradicate Phytophthora once it has become established in a site. If the identified Phytophthora species become widely established in Sweden, they may cause severe damages to forest ecosystems as well as for the Swedish forestry sector...|$|E

Phyllosphere bacteria can have important effects on plant health. The sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is an economically important tree species affected worldwide by the fungal pathogens Cryphonectria parasitica and Phytophthora cinnamomi. We examined the culturable phyllosphere bacterial community <b>of</b> the sweet <b>chestnut</b> at two nearby locations in Central Spain in order to know its geographical variability and to explore its potential as source of biological control agents against these two pathogenic fungi. The bacterial diversity at strain level was high but it varied significantly between locations; however, phylotype richness and diversity were more comparable.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{economic}} interest in the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>chestnuts</b> for both timber and nut production has resurfaced in the Mediterranean area. However, chestnut cultivation has suffered in recent years from the spread of exotic pests, such as the gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus, and from the resurgence <b>of</b> previously present <b>diseases,</b> most likely due to anomalous climate dynamics. This {{is the case with}} chestnut <b>ink</b> <b>disease,</b> caused by the soilborne pathogens Phytophthora cinnamomi and P. cambivora.

40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi is a soil-borne {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} crown and root rot of many horticultural, ornamental and forestry crops. It preferentially attacks 'feeder' roots. The geographical origin of P. cinnamomi is not clearly established. It was first described on Cinnamonum burmannii (Lauraceae) in Sumatra (ID) in 1922, but {{now has a}} nearly worldwide distribution, including most of Europe (CABI. 1991). The pathogen is found in tropical and subtropical countries and in the Mediterranean and some mild, temperate regions where it has almost certainly been introduced (EPPO/CABI, l 998). P. cinnamomi is the most widely distributed Phytophthora species, with over 1000 host species (Zentmeyer, 1983). The most significant food-crop losses due to P. cinnamomi root rot occur in avocado but the pathogen also attacks Ananas comosus, Castanea dentata and C. sativa, Cinchona spp., Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Cinnamomum spp., conifers, Ericaceae (including Rhododendron spp.), Eucalyptus spp., especially E. marginata. Fagus spp., Juglans spp., Pinus spp., Prunus spp., Quercus spp. and many ornamental trees and shrubs, including Vaccinium macrocarpon. It has caused extensive damage to natural Eucalyptus Forest in Western Australia. The recorded host range includes most of the temperate fruit trees, {{but these are not}} relevant hosts in practice. In the EPPO region, the most significant hosts are nursery stock of ornamental and amenity trees and avocados, in the limited areas where they are grown. It has been reported to be the main causal agent <b>of</b> <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> C. sativa in southern France and has been indicated as a possible causal agent of oak decline in the Iberian Peninsula. Propagules are spread by soil movement, including wind-blow or debris, or by water flow and run-off in drainage/irrigation ditches. Control is complicated by the very wide host range {{as well as by the}} longevity (often many years) of propagules (mainly sporangia and encysted zoospores) in nonsterile moist soil and root debris at depths at which soil fumigation is not always effective (Munnecke, 1984). Symptomless plants are a major means of spreading the pathogen to disease-free areas and this is the main problem for intensive production systems in the nursery industry. The first line of control is therefore planting disease-free stock. Imported plants for planting should be kept well separated in nurseries and preferably grown in containers for several months until their phytosanitary status has been checked. Strict hygiene should be observed at all times...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} mechanisms underpinning the ecological success of plant pathogens {{is critical to}} develop strategies for controlling <b>diseases</b> and protecting <b>of</b> crops. Recent observations have shown that plant pathogenic bacteria are not just interacting with the plant itself, but {{with a variety of}} potential predators present in the soil, such as nematodes, aphids, larvae and amoebae. Bacteria are therefore under strong selective pressure to avoid or survive predation and I hypothesise that bacteria have evolved mechanisms to escape predation. To identify the gene systems that contribute to the ecological success of P. syringae, with a specific focus on anti-predation and pathogenicity mechanisms I have used a Rapid Virulence Annotation (RVA) screening. Three cosmid libraries for P. syringae pv. aesculi, pv. tomato and pv. phaseolicola comprising approximately 2000 cosmids each were screened and a number of potential genes involved in bacterial survival identified. These included also genes encoding for Type 6 secretion system, hemolysins and biofilm formation, motility and adhesion. A comparison of the genes conferring resistance within other P. syringae strains showed differences in the organization of these clusters, indicating evolutionary changes. These data provide an important understanding of how bacteria cope with different biotic pressures and to give insight to the function of the genes and their role in ecological success. Objective of this thesis was also to characterize virulence mechanisms of P. syringae pv. aesculi the agent of the bleeding canker <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> Horse <b>Chestnut.</b> In this thesis I characterized the origin of this pathogen, its evolution and the factors that allow it to cause disease, focussing on the Type 3 Secretion System. hopAB 1 gene was identified to be the main determinant in virulence both in N. benthamiana and A. hippocastanum.
