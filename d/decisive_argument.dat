40|$|Summary In this paper, {{in order}} to examine service {{development}} as practice, we draw on extensive ethnographic material covering an entire service development process. Through a rhetorical lens, we identify what types of customer-related arguments the project members use {{in order to}} drive the development process forward and confront these findings with service development literature. We find that customer orientation is rhetorically present mostly when it comes to what the team should do (i. e. appeals to ethos, expressed as identification with the customer but also as guilt). However, this type of rhetoric does not lead to action as prescribed by normative marketing literature - such as formal acquisition of and reliance on market research - due to more <b>decisive</b> <b>arguments</b> about resources.

60|$|My father's unbelief had set me {{thinking}} about the evidences of religion and I weighed the matter perpetually with great anxiety, for I did not think I could live without religion. All my religious emotions were, I think, connected with clouds and cloudy glimpses of luminous sky, perhaps because of some bible picture of God's speaking to Abraham or the like. At least I can remember the sight moving me to tears. One day I got a <b>decisive</b> <b>argument</b> for belief. A cow was about to calve, and I went to the field where the cow was with some farm-hands who carried a lantern, and next day I heard that the cow had calved in the early morning. I asked everybody how calves were born, and because nobody would tell me, {{made up my mind}} that nobody knew. They were the gift of God, that much was certain, but it was plain that nobody had ever dared to see them come, and children must come in the same way. I made up my mind that when I was a man I would wait up till calf or child had come. I was certain there would be a cloud and a burst of light and God would bring the calf in the cloud out of the light. That thought made me content until a boy of twelve or thirteen, who had come on a visit for the day, sat beside me in a hay-loft and explained all the mechanism of sex. He had learnt all about it from an elder boy whose pathic he was (to use a term he would not have understood) and his description, given, as I can see now, as if he were telling of any other fact of physical life, made me miserable for weeks. After the first impression wore off, I began to doubt if he had spoken truth, but one day I discovered a passage in the encyclopaedia, though I only partly understood its long words, that confirmed what he had said. I did not know enough to be shocked at his relation to the elder boy, but it was the first breaking of the dream of childhood.|$|E

On the other hand, several passages show clearly that Thucydides had no illusions about Alcibiades (esp. VIII 81. 3 and 86. 4).

Coin toss is particularly inappropriate in cases of life and death, even when participants agree that the protagonists {{should have the same}} chance of being saved. Using a randomizer may seem to conflict with traditional ideas about argument-based rationality and personal responsibility of the decision maker. Moreover, a concrete randomizer like a coin appears more repulsive than the abstract principle of using a random device.

Implications of the aversion to use randomizers, even under circumstances in which there are compelling reasons to do so, are briefly discussed. coin toss, randomizers, equipoise, decision aversion. ...|$|R

The methodological background from which the analysis starts is the concept of «indigenization», a well-known category debated in contemporary anthropological research. In this article, the author compares the Christian texts under analysis with other Greco-Roman treatments of the figure of Orpheus, as well as with archaeological remains representing a male figure (identified with Orpheus by scholars, often with no <b>decisive</b> <b>arguments)</b> in the meanwhile he is tranquilizing beasts with his music. The comparison with such elements appears as really central in this essay: the musical imagery employed by Clement and Eusebius emerges as a specific discursive practice in order to carry out a program of indigenization as regards the Christian ideological proprium. As an alternative to the traditional interpretation of such texts in light of the so-called Orphic representations attested in Greco-Roman contexts (including Jewish and Proto-Christian remains), scholastic debates concerning music appear as a sort of ‘natural background’ in light of which it is possible to contextualize Clement and Eusebius’ discursive practices...|$|R
