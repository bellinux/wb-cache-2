I attempt to explain family living arrangement by two forces, dispersing and assembling. Considering family members live together to reduce their cost of living, financial wealth functions as dispersing force, while large dwelling size works the other way. Another assembling factor is care-giving. Parents see their adult daughter as a potential caregiver while daughters expect their elderly parents to give care to their children.

40|$|In {{promoting}} urban consolidation, Australia’s strategic urban {{plans have}} the unintended consequence of reducing, if not eliminating, an individual household’s capacity to directly engage with new dwelling production. Contrasts {{exist between the}} production processes of a free-standing home, typically constructed to contract, and that of a multi-unit building, typically speculatively designed and sold off-the-plan; with the latter removing the capacity for future occupants to directly influence <b>dwelling</b> <b>function</b> or design. Hence, in providing a vision of higher-density urban communities, Australia’s strategic urban plans arguably contribute to a disjunction between the function of higher-density dwellings and the individual households who seek to call them home. In response, {{a small number of}} Australian households and industry professionals have proposed alternative production processes to realise multi-unit housing suited to future occupants’ collective needs. This thesis examines the relational network of social and technical actors in existing multi-unit housing development. Structures of housing provision are visualised through an actor-network lens, and network relations are analysed to identify which (or what) network actors (or actants) influence design decisions, particularly regarding <b>dwelling</b> <b>function</b> and cost. The existing actor-network is compared with those of four alternative Australian cases. Employing both network analysis and primary interview data, impediments to collective self-organised housing in Australia are identified. Comparison of the actor-networks of the alternative cases recognises different types of network change in each case, reflecting participants’ motivations and resources, with associated variation in outcomes. Means of addressing the impediments identified in the Australian cases are drawn from two international cases, building groups in Berlin, Germany and collective custom build in the United Kingdom. The thesis argues successful consolidation of the Australian Dream advocated by contemporary urban planning policies requires that future residents be provided with greater capacity to influence design decision-making within the multi-unit structure of housing provision. Drawing lessons from the alternative cases, it proposes reconfiguring the actor-network of multi-unit housing to enable this to occur. The comparison of Australian and international case studies builds knowledge applicable to the development of policies and programs promoting collective self-organised housing in Australia, with relevance also to other dwelling densities. The actor-network visualisations developed to represent the structures of housing provision under examination in this thesis provide unique insights in these cases and, with further development, may prove equally useful to other research examining the complex web of social and technical actors in housing systems.

Za razliku od okvirno utvrđenog oblika rimskog domusa, koji je izgledno pokrivao većinu stambenih blokova Jadera, o tipu ranosrednjovjekovnih kuća, kakve su primjerice prepoznate u Splitu ili Trogiru, postoje vrlo skromna saznanja. Zabilježene funkcionalne i prostorne transformacije klasičnog domusa na izmaku antike, upućuju na određeni kontinuitet stanovanja, kojega se međutim, u nedostatku materijalnih potvrda, još uvijek ne može pratiti u nadolazećim stoljećima ranosrednjovjekovne transformacije grada. Zadar is {{the only}} colony in {{what was once the}} Province of Dalmatia whose urban {{continuity}} has lasted from the time of its founding to today. Even though it has been inhabited since the 9 th century BC, a permanent mark on the spatial organisation of the historical nucleus was made by the Roman re-urbanisation of the Liburnian settlement. Its transformation into a colony of Roman citizens was accompanied by extensive structural changes in accordance with the general principles of classical ancient urbanism, such as an orthogonal network of streets and corresponding blocks of buildings for public, religious and residential use. Due to a series of unfortunate events in recent history, the oldest urban layers of Zadar are also the most investigated. There is still plenty of space inside the city walls and relevant urban elements to complement current reconstruction of their spatial organisation. This is particularly true of the Late Antique and Early Medieval phase. In order to illuminate neglected issues surrounding the transformation of the Antique city into the Late Antique, Early Medieval and Medieval one, this article presents the current state concerning the continuity, conversion or interruption of the <b>dwelling</b> <b>function</b> of individual residential blocks, smaller units and individual buildings.

The main objective was to reconstruct the environmental and vegetation dynamics associated {{with the establishment of}} the lake-dwelling and land-use during the last 2, 000 years. A lacustrine sediment core located adjacent to a Late Iron Age lake-dwelling, medieval castle and Post-medieval manor was sampled in Lake Āraiši. The core was dated using spheroidal fly-ash particles and radiocarbon dating, and analysed in terms of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, diatoms, loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility and element geochemistry. Associations between pollen and other proxies were statistically tested. During ad 1 – 700, the vicinity of Lake Āraiši was covered by forests and human activities were only small-scale with the first appearance of cereal pollen (Triticum and Secale cereale) after ad 400. The most significant changes in vegetation and environment occurred with the establishment of the lake-dwelling around ad 780 when the immediate surroundings of the lake were cleared for agriculture, and within the lake there were increased nutrient levels. The highest accumulation rates of coprophilous fungi coincide with the occupation of the lake-dwelling from ad 780 – 1050, indicating that parts of the <b>dwelling</b> <b>functioned</b> as byres for livestock. The conquest of tribal lands during the crusades resulted in changes to the ownership, administration and organisation of the land, but our results indicate that the form and type of agriculture and land-use continued much as it had during the preceding Late Iron Age...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Bu tez kapsamında Deliballılar Köyü, kentsel koruma çerçevesinde incelenmiştir. Bu inceleme sekiz ana bölümden oluşmaktadır. Birinci bölümde, bölgenin önemi vurgulanarak yapılan çalışmanın kapsamından bahsedilmiştir. İkinci ve üçüncü bölümler, bölgenin coğrafi konumunu tanımlamaya çalışırken, tarihsel gelişimi ve sosyo-kültürel yapısı hakkında bilgi vermektedir. Deliballılar Köyü, Bursa İli’nin Orhaneli İlçesi’ne bağlı eski tarihli köylerden biridir. Köyün tarihsel süreçteki gelişimi Orhaneli ile paralellik göstermektedir. Uludağ’ın güney yamacında bulunan köy için net bir iklimden bahsedilemez, iklimi ılıman akdeniz ve karasal ege ile marmara bölgesi iklimlerinin karışımıdır. Ekonomik yapı tarıma dayalıdır. Ancak yakın çevrede kurulan fabrikalar, termik santral ve köyde taşımalı eğitim yapılmasından dolayı köyün nüfusu ciddi oranda azalmış, ekonomik faaliyetler sekteye uğramıştır. Deliballılar Köyü’nün kentsel doku özellikleri ve sivil mimarlık örnekleri, dördüncü bölümün inceleme konusunu oluşturmaktadır. Deliballılar Köyü, köy meydanındaki okulu, muhtarlık/kahvehane binası, köy meydanının güneyinde bulunan camisi ve köyün doğu çeperinde yer alan tarihi meşe ağacı ile geleneksel Anadolu köylerinden ayrılsa da, köy meydanının etrafında şekillenen geleneksel sivil mimarlık örneklerinin oluşturduğu dokusuyla Anadolu’nun bir parçasıdır. İncelemenin beşinci bölümünde, hazırlanan 1 / 1000 ölçekli analizler değerlendirilmiş ve tablolarla ifade edilmiştir. Bu tablolardan elde edilen veriler ve gözlemler ışığında dokuyu tehdit eden etkenler altıncı bölümde ele alınmıştır. Deliballılar Köyü ile ilgili geçmiş yıllarda yapılan imar planı çalışmalarına ve tabiat varlıklarının korunmasına yönelik kararlara bakıldığında, 2009 yılında Deliballılar Köyü’nde tek yapı ölçeğinde tescil tespit çalışması yapıldığı ve Kentsel Sit Alanı sınırının belirlendiği görülmektedir. ancak henüz Deliballılar Köyü Sit Koruma Alanı için Koruma Amaçlı İmar Planı yapılmamıştır. Bu durumla ilgili olarak, yedinci bölümde, alan çalışması sonucunda hazırlanan 1 / 1000 ölçekli analiz ve öneri paftaları, 1 / 200 plan ve cephe paftaları paralelinde belirlenen koruma kararları, müdahale ve işlevlendirme önerileri geliştirilerek, bölge ile ilgili tarıma dayalı ekonomik canlanmayı amaçlayan bir plan kurgulanmıştır. Bu sayede Deliballılar Köyü kentsel doku ve sivil mimarlık örneklerinin yok olma tehlikesinden uzak bir şekilde gelecek nesillere aktarılması için izlenmesi gereken yolun belirlenmesi hedeflenmiştir. Sekizinci bölüme gelindiğinde, tez kapsamında yapılan çalışmalardan elde edilen sonuçlar açıklanmıştır. This {{thesis is}} {{involved}} with the analysis of Deliballılar Village within urban conservation aspects and the analysis consists of 8 sections. The first section {{emphasizes the importance of}} the region and mentions about the the borders of investigation. In the second section, the geographical location of the Orhaneli is described, the historical background and socio-cultural structure are instructed. Deliballılar Village is a part of Orhaneli District and there are not many written sources about the village. To understand the geographical location and the history of the village, it is better to give detailed information about Orhaneli. The foundation of Orhaneli, starts with Publius Aelius Traianus Hadrianus(76 - 138), who is the emperor of Roman Empire. The name of Orhaneli has been Atranos before 1934, pointer of the dedication of the region to Hadrianus. Orhan Bey, the son of Osman Bey, conquered Orhaneli in 1325. Orhaneli is located {{on the south side of}} Uludağ and the climate possess temperate Akdeniz climate with the effects of the continental climate of Ege and Marmara. The vegetation of Uludağ and Orhaneli consists of a forest, which contains pine, oak, juniper and beech trees. Orhaneli Region is a fertile area for minerals including chromium, nickel, lignite coal, magnesite, manganese, asbestos and some limestone types. The local economy is based on agricultural activities, like farming and livestock, trading and thermal power plant. In the third section, the geographical location of Deliballılar Village is described, the historical background and socio-cultural structure are instructed. The foundation of the Delibalılar Village is unknown, however the name of the village is seen in a ledger of Atranos town of Ottoman Empire from the year of 1530. Deliballılar Village was registered with 54 dwelling houses in yearbook of 1908 and the name of the village is not on the list of The Greek Tragedy. The village is located near to Orhaneli Town, on the south side of Uludağ and the climate possess temperate Akdeniz climate with the effects of the continental climate of Ege and Marmara, however, the climate temperature values are higher than Orhaneli. The vegetation of Deliballılar Village consists of a forest, which contains pine, oak, juniper and beech trees. The local economy is totally based on agricultural activities, like farming and livestock. The urban texture and examples regarding civil architecture are covered in Section 4. The hills which are located around the settlement, the forest which covers the hills and the roads describes the general landscape of Deliballılar Village. The road which is from Orhaneli to Deliballılar Village direction goes beyond to the village side with a bridge which crosses over Kocasu River. The main roads reach the west border of the village and the roads merge and continue through the south border to the east exit. As a typical village settlement, the inside streets of Deliballılar Village show organic form. The public square of the village is surrounded by the primary school building in Early Republic Period Style, government building and other historical traditional dwelling houses. There are two short and narrow roads from square to the courtyard of the mosque. The urban texture of Deliballılar is shaped around the public square like other Anatolian villages. The location of the primary school, which is on the border of the public square and the location of the monumental oak tree, which is on the east edge of the village differ from  typical traditional Anatolian villages. Agricultural activities are the essential parts of economical life in the village. Buildings are situated alone on the parcels and a large garden left around the buildings as private green areas. Some gardens include greenhouses which have metal structures to grow more various plants. In the area, there are single-floored hayloft buildings except dwelling houses. In Section 5, the existing 1 / 1000 scale plans are analyzed in detail. The number of floors, functions of buildings, building materials and systems, structural condition, the conservation condition and the usage of buildings have been analyzed and evaluated. The number of floors analysis shows that the two-floored buildings have 60, 9 % rate in the area. The most of the buildings(52, 7 %) have the <b>dwelling</b> <b>function.</b> Traditional building system is masonry stone ground floors and timber framework upper floors. The building materials and systems analysis  shows that the 55, 2 % rated buildings of the area have been built with both masonry and framework systems. The structural conditions of the buildings are good with 88, 7 % rate and the conservation conditions are “good” in 45, 7 % rate. 40, 7 % of the buildings have continuous usage, 21, 1 % of them have periodical usage and 38, 0 % of the buildings are not in use. The changes in historical texture and the impact of these changes upon urban texture and architecture are covered in Section 6. Because of the decreasing population of the village, the texture of Deliballılar Village is preserved from serious changes and deterioration. Although the texture is preserved, many changes in plan scheme can be seen in order to reach the comfort of today’s conditions. The changes upon urban texture occur generally as concrete wet area additions. The changes upon buildings occur as alterations of plan schemes, revisions of original door and window frames, usages of modern building materials. When the decisions regarding conservation of cultural and natural themes and reconstruction plans are examined, it is found that 53 buildings and one oak tree have been recorded as cultural and natural properties in 2009. However, a reconstruction plan for conservative purposes has not been prepared for the Deliballılar Village yet. According to this, a field study has been made and the conservation rules and regulations set regarding the 1 / 1000 scale analysis in Section 7. 1 / 100 scale plans and façades of sixteen dwelling houses are drawn, analyzed and compared during the field study. The purposes of the present study are not only to express methods for preservation of the urban texture and civil architecture for the future generations but also to increase population of the settlement as before it was by agricultural economical regulation advices. The advices about urban texture are in a rehabilitation concept to attract previous users. The decisions about transportation and urban furnitures aim to arrange the inner and outer streets and routes and also to make an easier accessibility to Deliballılar Village. The decisions about agricultural activities aim to develop those original economical activities. The support of the Bursa City Government is predicted for production and marketing regulations. The advices about rehabilitation and transportation are explained in a selected part of the urban conservation area. The predicted interventions for buildings are expanded. The results of the study are presented in Section 8. The locations of buildings are expressed, the traditional plan schemes and façade properties are described in detail. Types of buildings are explained in another paragraph in Section 8. The results of analysis are emphasized as the reasons of intervention decisions. The primary problem of Deliballılar Village is decreasing population. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Honolulu, the {{building}} permit {{process has been}} likened to a black box, synonymous with regulatory barriers and unbearable delays. In response, homeowners cultivate gray spaces: ambiguous accessory spaces such as “Hobby, ” “TV ” or “Rumpus Rooms ” that are issued permits and then frequently converted illegally into an independent dwelling unit. In essence, these Illegal Accessory <b>Dwellings</b> <b>function</b> as non-permitted second units on land zoned for single-family use. This paper proposes to quantify the number of Illegal Accessory Dwellings in Honolulu, {{based on the number}} of residential buildings permits issued for spaces that could be easily converted into a separate rental unit. Using building permit data provides a systematic method to analyze all legally sanctioned building activity, pinpointing only those residential layouts that are highly suspicious for being converted into a separate rental unit. In so doing, this paper makes a key distinction: a structure can be built to code, but its occupancy – how it is used – can still be illegal. From 2005 - 2012, this paper found that Illegal Accessory Dwellings comprised a low of 30 % up to 46 % of all new one and two-family dwellings units created. The highest rate of production was in 2008, during the Great Recession. Thus, this paper suggests that Illegal Accessory Dwellings contribute a substantial number of units to the overall housing supply. This paper also raises questions such as – How are these units being counted in the official US Census? Are they counted as separate households or as part of the primary residence? Given the significant number of this type of housing, how Illegal Accessory Dwellings are characterized could potentially shift the landscape of where urban growth is occurring. Research methods include correlational research, GIS mapping and case studies, to explain how homeowners circumvent the rules...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{experience}} of a four-year research at the University of Naples ???Federico II??? focused on environmental performances of urban space in small towns and villages of Southern Italy. The study proposes a knowledge-oriented methodology aimed at enhancing the value of the urban form in terms of relationships between natural and built environment, empirically demonstrating the existence of a (somehow implicit) ecological design approach of the primary urban patterns that characterizes ???urban signatures??? in terms of pattern itself, building shape, use of materials, construction technologies. The research wants to point out the value of the original construction process and it aims at highlighting the coherence between city form and the natural environment notably focused on the sustainable use of local resources (vegetation, soil and water) corresponding to ecological cycles and fit on human activities. Ancient towns and villages in Southern Italy are a meaningful example of ecological design in which built technologies were strongly oriented by the site and by the availability of natural resources. They intermediate the relationship between natural and built environment and supply dwelling performances coherently with local context. Harmonization of nature and architecture in many historic towns shows this positive integration and represents an important topic in terms of urban management and urban planning. Ancient villages, especially, present urban patters deeply linked to topography and to the natural environment thus also urban signatures are designed in such a way to give environmental benefits to the whole built-up area in terms of improving microclimate, managing rain fall water and controlling environmental risk. Moreover urban signatures are featured by a common constructive approach aimed at a sustainable use of local resources, as some sort of ???instinctive care??? to Life Cycle of building materials. This kind of implicit sustainability of urban space is now treated by the impact of modern transformation of historic assets - even by the aim of rehabilitation or maintenance - in which the misunderstanding of primary, sustainable building processes could upset local ecological balance and site identity. The common and acceptable instance of updating services and performances of historic urban space by modern <b>dwelling</b> <b>functions</b> ??? such as accessibility by car, improving infrastructure and nets, developing commerce, etc. - ought to be compared to the original state of the site and ought be adequate to local, specific carrying capacity. According to these remarks, {{the purpose of the study}} is to propose a methodology for ???scanning??? city space in a way of emphasizing the coherence between the urban pattern, urban signatures and some key constructive elements. Three key assumptions drive the study. First assumption is the ante litteram sustainability of ancient town, tangible evidence of building tradition devised by economic opportunity and by environment understanding, a special condition that drove constructive solutions towards forms and functions adequate to local carrying capacity According to this, the second assumption regards the application of LCA to the urban signatures. The study aims at recognizing the original life cycle design approach aimed at preserving natural resources, reducing transport costs and optimizing the life service of each element. Third and last assumption concerns the qualitative approach to LCA. It is targeted on a sort of eco-balance more than an inventory itself, focusing on pre-industrial constructive process and local design strategy. From this side, attention will be given at some environmental parameters such as the use of natural resources (local and global), the life cycle management (urban and natural), the re-use and re-cycling of materials that could act as constrains in rehabilitation or management projects...|$|R

40|$|Video {{mediated}} communication (VMC) is a two way {{real time}} {{audio and video}} communication between remote places. VMC {{has the potential to}} be applied favourably to many activities, services and functions in smart homes. The concept of smart homes refers to homes equipped with technological systems and appliances enabling centralised or remotely controllable integrated functionalities and services. The main question for the current research work is formulated accordingly: How can spaces for video mediated communication be designed and integrated into smart homes? The governing idea is that there are two main perceptions of space in the design and integration of video mediated communication into smart homes. One concerns the conception of private and public spaces, the other relates to the idea of physical and digital spaces. The interrelationship between these two concepts is supposed to become important when VMC is considered for smart home applications. This thesis is written from an architectural perspective. It refers to the functionalistic paradigm here defined basically as the set of essential functions of the home that have to be solved in order to achieve good <b>dwellings.</b> The <b>function</b> of the home can be described as the organisation of space and furniture to support activities and processes in and around it. The thesis is based upon five papers and a covering text providing background, analysis and reflection, as well as ideas on further development. The research method can be described as mainly explorative and design-oriented. A principal result from the study is that a novel modality of space, the public digital space, appears when VMC is introduced into smart homes. Further, it is advocated that this modality is a relevant issue for the architectural profession and architectural research...|$|R
5000|$|An {{estimated}} 30-40% of all {{the rooms}} at Aşıklı Höyük have hearths. This estimate is based on partially damaged and eroded structures possibly giving a number lower than accurate. Based on a limited group of fully exposed buildings 54% of single room units contained a hearth, while only 29% of the multiple room units. The average percentage on base of these building units is 47%: probably a more realistic estimate for the site in total.Hearths do not occur in a courtyard context, and are more represented in single room dwellings than multiple room units. Still: multiple room units do have {{a substantial number of}} hearths. It has been suggested that the [...] "multiroom <b>dwellings</b> may have <b>functioned</b> as “incomplete” houses for new families still heavily dependent on the larger extended group”. The buildings containing the hearths do not show particular characteristics that distinguish them from structures without hearths; neither do they differ in size or special orientation. Even the hearth itself does not follow an apparent norm in terms of size or location. The position varies considerably, but it always has one side to the wall. The positioning of the heart {{does not seem to be}} determined by general macro-ecological factors, such as prevailing wind directions, nor determined by cultural norms regarding spatial features within buildings.|$|R
40|$|Ventilation systems play an {{important}} role in the energy consumption of heating and cooling, defining hygrothermal conditions and air quality of <b>dwellings.</b> Among other <b>functions,</b> they are absolutely necessary to ensure oxygen levels needed for household combustion appliances. In Portugal in multifamily housing and with natural ventilation systems, installing a mechanical exhaust fan in every kitchen (decentralized ventilation) is common. In this paper, the impact of such a device is evaluated regarding the performance of a water heating appliance for heating the indoor environment or for domestic hot water (B-type gas appliance usually installed in the kitchen). The combination of natural or mechanical ventilation in the kitchen with the natural exhaust of the gas appliance’s combustion products were tested as well as the evaluation of critical conditions that lead to stopping the gas appliance safely or to reversing the combustion products in the respective exhaust duct. One of the main conclusions to be drawn is that in the case of mechanical exhaust in the kitchen simultaneously with the natural exhaust of the gas appliance’s combustion products, the kitchen’s exterior air inlet is a key device for ensuring proper exhaust of combustion products. In extreme situations, reduced air intake by other means or high extraction flows, they can prevent safely stopping the appliance or even reversing the flow of the combustion products. For this purpose, the maximum flow of mechanical exhaust should also be limited...|$|R
40|$|Environmental concerns, {{together}} with increasing development costs {{have created the}} need for urban housing which can provide {{an alternative to the}} popular, but low density detached house. Coaxing Australians into denser housing, however, is proving a difficult task, particularly as many regard the detached house as the ideal home. The concept of home is extremely complex, incorporating many physical, social and psychological factors. However, attempting to understand and incorporate these attributes into the development of denser housing will surely produce a greater acceptance of urban housing in Australian cities. This approach must be preferable to simply insisting that Australians modify their lifestyles and values in order to accept urban housing. This thesis will explore one important component of housing design - spatial organisation, in order to establish its role and importance in creating home in Australia. Spatial organisation describes the method of arranging dwellings, external spaces and associated facilities on a site. It forms a particularly important consideration in the design of urban housing where it is often necessary to design a number of individual <b>dwellings</b> and <b>functions</b> on a common block of land. This research is therefore not concerned with the internal spatial arrangement of the dwelling, instead focusing on the relationship, both physically and socially, between the individual dwelling and the broader community and urban fabric. The major component of this research traces the historical development of spatial organisation in Australian housing. This occurred in two distinct phases involving: a) the modification of English cultural models; and b) the post World War II application of Modernist housing principles. These two phases were characterised by contrasting spatial organisations which produced very different concepts of home. The traditional model, for example, favoured individual and private homes whereas the Modernist models emphasised mass housing developments with communal facilities. Evaluation of these models reveal that many Australians have a clear preference for the domestic qualities produced by the traditional spatial organisation while contemporary housing design still incorporates many aspects of Modernist spatial organisation. This thesis examines this paradox from a number of perspectives and concludes with a new direction for spatial organisation in urban housing, based on an Australian perception of home. In addition, it demonstrates the value of multi-disciplinary research in the development of contemporary design theory, which balances the needs of the broader population against the inclinations of the design profession...|$|R
40|$|A System of Prefabricated Concrete Housing for Chile Sammy Liberman The final {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} solution of the habitational problem for families of meager means in Chile. To bring about this objective, I propose the following: A rational system of construction or execution of works that involves the participation of the government, the community, and the individual. A design: a) that possesses flexibility, permitting a natural and step by step evolution of the <b>dwelling</b> as a <b>function</b> of economic resources and the progressive necessities of the inhabitant. b) that permits an effective control of functional, esthetic and stable aspects of a dwelling considered as a unit and as an entity within the urban frame. c) that reconstitutes the potentialities of the dwelling to provide to its ten- ants an adequate environment where equilibrium and dignity can be found. 3) A prefabrication system whose fundamental components are composed of concrete. The methodology for the verification of this approach includes the following: A qualitative and quantitative appreciation of the existing situation of housing in Chile. An analysis of the most common solutions and designs in use today in order to qualify their effectiveness {{and to be able to}} evaluate proposed solutions. A structural design of the main components of the dwelling. A proposal for a joint government-community venture for implementation of the project. To make evident, with respect to flexibility, the efficacy in various circumstances seen from the following points of view: From an urban scale.

40|$|Abstract Background Poor housing {{conditions}} in remote Indigenous communities in Australia {{are a major}} underlying factor in poor child health, including high rates of skin infections. The {{aim of this study}} is to test approaches to data collection, analysis and feedback for a follow-up study of the impact of {{housing conditions}} on child health. Methods Participation was negotiated in three communities with community councils and individual participants. Data were collected by survey of dwelling condition, interviews, and audit health centre records of children aged under seven years. Community feedback comprised immediate report of items requiring urgent repair followed by a summary descriptive report. Multivariate models were developed to calculate adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) for skin infections and their association with aspects of household infrastructure. Results There was a high level of participation in all communities. Health centre records were inadequate for audit in one community. The records of 138 children were available for development of multivariate analytic models. Rates of skin infection in <b>dwellings</b> that lacked <b>functioning</b> facilities for removing faeces or which had concrete floors may be up to twice as high as for other dwellings, and the latter association appears to be exacerbated by crowding. Younger children living in older dwellings may also be at approximately two-fold higher risk. A number of socioeconomic and socio-demographic variables also appear to be directly associated with high rates of skin infections. Conclusion The methods used in the pilot study were generally feasible, and the analytic approach provides meaningful results. The study provides some evidence that new and modern housing is contributing to a reduction in skin infections in Aboriginal children in remote communities, particularly when this housing leads to a reduction in crowding and the effective removal of human waste. </p...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{need to be}} {{adaptable}} {{with relative}} ease to new requirements, regulations and uses for diverse and changing users. Designing buildings which can adapt to changing demands poses a considerable challenge. Residential satisfaction on <b>dwelling</b> is a <b>function</b> of three groups of variables; the user’s characteristics, the physical attributes of a space and the beliefs and perceptions of the user’s on the experienced space. Particularly in residential environments, the user tries to solve the emerging spatial problems by making some alterations and thus adapting the space to his/her changing needs. With this regard, flexible and adaptable design solutions {{can be an important}} potential to meeting the needs of various users throughout a building’s life-cycle. Adaptability reduces the effort and expense involved in adding, changing or replacing building components (such as partitions, doors or plumbing features) throughout the building’s life-cycle. This increases the building’s value, sustainability and most importantly, the users’ satisfaction. In practice however, most buildings are designed and constructed to cater for the present use for the present users. Future adaptability is ignored and not designed for. This research intends to focus on the evaluation of the “dwelling space” in terms of the physical attributes of space. The research will critically review literature on adaptability and flexible designing in order to construct a theoretical platform for understanding the knowledge on how buildings change can be used to inform design decisions of internal spaces of Social Housing units. The research follows an approach which is based on the systemic separation of building components and adjusting buildings to accommodate the frequently changing needs of inhabitants. The objective of the research is to develop a methodology which supports the design of internal unit spaces {{so that they can be}} adapted throughout the building’s life-cycle.

40|$|Set {{up by the}} French authorities, the Observatory on Indoor Air Quality (OQAI) aims at {{collecting}} data on population exposure to pollutants in indoor environments (dwellings, schools, offices, etc.). Accordingly, OQAI undertook a national survey from 2003 to 2005 {{in order to assess}} the air quality inside the French dwellings. A large amount of information has been collected from 567 dwellings (1, 612 individuals questioned), representative of the 24 millions dwellings in mainland France. This snapshot of indoor pollution, the first available reference on indoor air quality in French homes, focuses on more than 30 chemical (carbon monoxide, 20 volatile organic compounds), biological (cat, dog and dustmite allergens) and physical (particulate matter, radon activity, gamma radiation) variables, monitored over a one-week period in several rooms of each home, in attached garages and outdoor. The first results showed differences between the indoor and outdoor environments, with higher levels of pollutants indoors than outdoors, some compounds being present indoors but not outdoors. The majority of target compounds were found in most of the dwellings studied, reflecting the presence of numerous sources of indoor pollution (building materials, equipment, furniture, household cleaning products, human activities, outdoor environment, etc.) and the poor or satisfactory degree of ventilation. A minority of dwellings (around 10 %) exhibited very high levels of several pollutants at the same time; by contrast, 45 % of dwellings presented very low levels of all the pollutants measured. Furthermore, the distributions of the number of <b>dwellings</b> as a <b>function</b> of pollutant levels were usually highly asymmetric, with some dwellings presenting values higher by several orders of magnitude than the median levels observed throughout the housing stock. Attached garages had higher VOC levels than the dwellings themselves. Finally, house dust mites constitute the most frequent source of allergens. Pollutant levels are in agreement with previous localized studies and other national surveys. Variable percentages of dwellings exceeded the rare guideline levels that were comparable over the same periods of time measured, available in France or at an international level: a few percent for carbon monoxide, between a few percent and nearly 87 % for formaldehyde (depending on the guidelines considered), and 50 % for dust mite allergens...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} wooden towers {{belongs to the}} more {{combined}} questions than it seems, particulary when it's considered against a broad comparative background. In the late 12 th century began to appear little "conoidal" strongholds, which are regarded as the prototypes of the castles with the dwelling towers by some scholars or as some reduction of the larger constructions by the others. The towers performed the <b>dwelling</b> and defensive <b>function.</b> Their distant patterns can be recovered in the West-European constructions dated back as early as {{to the end of}} the 10 th century. Recent excavations (Siedląeków) threw a little more light upon the questions of the so called knights' strongholds both in formal and functional aspects, and the new studies supported the supposition that defensive and dwelling towers were located also within the ramparts along side the ground-floor dwelling and husbandry constructions (Kaszowo, Raciąż, Chmielno). Thus the functional character of the towers extends and they can be regarded as the last defence objects which usually played a role of the watching posts. The material concerning the towers is to be divided into two groups: 1. towers survived until nowadays or readable while excavating, 2, information about the towers derived from the wrlsten and iconographic sources as well as from the toponomastic names. In the north-east region of the Baltic the towers occured in number, along the important water routes, especially along those leading from the Finnish Bay inside Russia. The towers from this region can be cinsidered as the examples of the earliest constructions of this kind. That type of construction is know also from Finland, Estonia and Sweden and dates back to the 11 th or 12 th century at least. The towers standing along the Swedish water routes controlled and blocked the fords. The former investigations provided the ascertainment that the towers were built in the laft constructions, in three or more floors with the dwelling room. In a case of necessity they were used as the pi. sons. The problem of the wooden or stone towers is still an open question and one may suggest that the further investigations will bring new determinations.

40|$|The German Passivhaus {{building}} standard, {{with its}} emphasis on airtightness and very high levels of insulation, has become well known. It is widely applied to produce buildings that have a very low heating energy demand in winter whilst providing thermal comfort. However, there have been, over the last decade, instances of summertime overheating in Passivhaus buildings. Research has shown that the high internal air temperatures during summer in Passivhaus dwellings are mainly due to excessive solar gain through large south-facing glazing and a lack of natural ventilation. A number of well-established passive adaptation measures have received a great deal of research attention, and several have been implemented in to Passivhaus designs to reduce summer discomfort. Some of these approaches, such as window opening and blinds, are user-dependent, while other interventions, such as overhangs, are truly passive and do not require the occupants’ attention. Although thermal mass is not a user-dependent intervention, it typically works in conjunction with night purge ventilation, which is controlled by building users. The research presented here investigated a less examined passive approach to reducing overheating - the potential implementation of the envelope shape as an environmental design strategy to self-shade. This approach is architectural in nature, and so could have both aesthetic and environmental consequences. The research tested if altering the geometric form of a UK Passivhaus (by tilting the south facade to give self-shading) might be capable of passively protecting the house from the excessive solar gain in summer, both for current and future climate scenarios. This study used probabilistic climate change scenarios from the UK Climate Change Projections to determine the overheating risk in an existing Passivhaus dwelling under a high emission 50 -percentile scenario in London. Dynamic thermal simulation modelling software (DesignBuilder) was used to examine the impact of various inclinations of the south façade of the Passivhaus dwelling {{to make use of the}} self-shading that this form created. A sensitivity analysis of internal temperatures and thermal comfort conditions in the <b>dwelling</b> as a <b>function</b> of building facade inclination and prevailing climatic conditions was undertaken. The research found that implementing an optimum angle tilted façade would moderate indoor temperature variations between day and night in summer and could potentially act as an effective shading device and reduce overheating by a significant amount while still being practical for collecting solar gains in winter. The proposed inclined façade could eliminate the risk of overheating for current climates; however, it was found that using only the geometric considerations would not solely be fully capable of eradicating the risk of future thermal discomfort overheating, particularly for UK climate scenarios of the 2080 s. The suggested tilted façade was then analysed alongside other conventional approaches, such as overhangs and reduced window to wall ratios, to compare their relative effectiveness in reducing overheating risk. Manipulating the tilt of the south facing façade will clearly have other impacts on, for instance, winter heating demand, daylighting and natural ventilation air flows, and these parameters have also been examined using the lighting and computational fluid dynamics CFD algorithms in DesignBuilder. The consequences of a slight tilt of the south façade on daylight levels and airflows through the dwelling were apparent but not overly large. The research noted a concurrent increase in the heating demand and artificial lighting, but it was concluded that this increase was an acceptable trade-off compared to the reduced summer overheating risk...|$|R
