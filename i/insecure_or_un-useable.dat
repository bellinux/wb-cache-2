50|$|For {{the first}} eight years, the Almohad {{rebellion}} was limited to a guerilla war along the peaks and ravines of the High Atlas. Their principal damage was in rendering <b>insecure</b> (<b>or</b> altogether impassable) the roads and mountain passes south of Marrakesh - threatening the route to all-important Sijilmassa, the gateway of the trans-Saharan trade. Unable to send enough manpower through the narrow passes to dislodge the Almohad rebels from their easily defended mountain strong points, the Almoravid authorities reconciled themselves to setting up strongholds to confine them there (most famously the fortress of Tasghimout that protected the approach to Aghmat), while exploring alternative routes through more easterly passes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Steganography {{is often}} {{combined}} with cryptographic mechanisms. This enhances steganography by valuable properties that are originally left to cryptographic systems. However, new problems for cryptographic mechanisms {{arise from the}} context of steganography. There are two sorts of steganographic tools: commercial tools with <b>insecure</b> <b>or</b> badly implemented cryptography and academic proof-of-concepts that abstain from the actual implementation of the cryptographic part. Comparably to cryptography, steganography evolves in an iterative process of designing and breaking new methods. In this paper we examine the encoding properties and cryptographic functionality of steganographic tools to enable the detection of embedded information in steganograms even if the embedding part was otherwise secure. ...|$|R

25|$|C-PTSD is also {{characterized}} by attachment disorder, particularly the pervasive <b>insecure,</b> <b>or</b> disorganized-type attachment. DSM-IV (1994) dissociative disorders and PTSD {{do not include}} insecure attachment in their criteria. As a consequence of this aspect of C-PTSD, when some adults with C-PTSD become parents and confront their own children's attachment needs, they may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively especially to their infants' and young children's routine distress—such as during routine separations, despite these parents' best intentions and efforts. Although {{the great majority of}} survivors do not abuse others, this difficulty in parenting may have adverse repercussions for their children's social and emotional development if parents with this condition and their children do not receive appropriate treatment.|$|R
40|$|Recently Zhang et al. {{proposed}} a hierarchical identity-based encryption scheme {{which is the}} first efficient scheme where both ciphertexts and private keys achieve O(1) size, and is the best trade-off between private key size and ciphertext size at present. However, in this paper, it will be pointed out that their scheme exists an ambiguity or shortcoming which makes their scheme be <b>insecure</b> <b>or</b> non identity-based. Then,  in order to overcome this problem, an improved hierarchical identity based encryption scheme is proposed with the same efficiency with Zhang et al. ’s scheme (the private keys and ciphertexts of O(1) size). And, the security proof of the improved scheme also is given in the selective-identity model...|$|R

As embodied in the DynInst API library, dynamic instrumentation allows easy construction of tools that can: (1) inspect a running process, obtaining structural information about the program; (2) control the execution of the program, (3) cause new libraries to be dynamically loaded into the process' address space; (4) splice new code sequences into the running program and remove them; and (5) replace individual call instructions or entire functions...|$|R
50|$|Other {{paintings}} chronicle {{the daily}} {{activities such as}} the gambling parlors (Ridotti) that proliferated in the 18th century. Nearly half of the figures in his genre paintings are faceless, hidden behind Venetian Carnival masks. In some, the <b>insecure</b> <b>or</b> naive posture and circumstance, the puppet-like delicacy of the persons, seem to suggest a satirical perspective of the artists toward his subjects. That this puppet-like quality was an intentional conceit on Longhi's part is attested by the skillful rendering of figures in his earlier history paintings and in his drawings. Longhi's many drawings, typically in black chalk or pencil heightened with white chalk on colored paper, were often done for their own sake, rather than as studies for paintings.|$|R
