5|$|Following {{the season}} eight Giants—tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Bavaro, {{offensive}} lineman Brad Benson, nose tackle Jim Burt, linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson, punter Sean Landeta, running back Morris, and defensive end Leonard Marshall—were selected to the Pro Bowl. Taylor, who recorded a league-leading 20.5 sacks, {{became one of}} just three defensive players to win the NFL Most Valuable Player award and the only defensive player to ever win the award unanimously.* Sprechman and Shannon. pg. 13 Taylor also won his record third Defensive Player of the Year Award and coach Bill Parcells won his first NFL Coach of the Year Award.|$|E

Three short rushes by fullback Speedy Neal resulted in 12 yards and a first down. With time running out in the quarter, Kelly attempted and completed a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Rocky Belk, driving the Hurricanes to the Tech 30-yard line and bringing the quarter to an end. Miami led, 70 {{at the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|On Indianapolis' {{first drive}} of the game, {{defensive}} back Chris Harris intercepted a deep, third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning {{and returned it}} 6 yards to the Bears' 35-yard line. However, Chicago could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and {{they were forced to}} punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears' lead to 7–6. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7–6, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt. On the ensuing kickoff, Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff while being tackled by Robert Mathis; Colts linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball. However, on the next play, Indianapolis gave the ball back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the handoff and Bears defensive <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Anderson recovered it.|$|E

5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a decision to go forward with replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the running game, which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three of the Giants linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E
5|$|The NFLPA went {{on strike}} for a month in 1987 upon the {{expiration}} of the 1982 CBA; the league's free-agent policy was the major matter in dispute. This time, however, the strike only canceled one week of the season. For three weeks, the NFL staged games with hastily assembled replacement teams, made up principally of players cut during training camp and players left out of work from {{the closure of the}} United States Football League two years prior (along with, to a lesser extent, the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL, who had folded just three months prior to the strike). They were joined by a few veterans who crossed the picket lines, including New York Jets defensive <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie, and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent.|$|E

In the second half, Jacke kicked two field goals while the 49ers could only manage two touchdowns: a 1-yard run by Young and a 2-yarder by running back Derek Loville.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of their excellent starting field position, New England drove 53 yards in 7 plays and scored on an 18-yard touchdown run by Martin to cut the Packers' lead to 27–21. But on the ensuing kickoff, Howard returned the ball 99 {{yards for a touchdown}} – the longest play in Super Bowl history (later broken in Super Bowl XLIII, and broken again in Super Bowl XLVII). Favre then completed a pass to tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Chmura for a successful two-point conversion, giving the Packers a 35–21 lead.|$|E
25|$|The Giants {{scored on}} their opening {{possession}} of the game with kicker Eric Schubert's 47-yard field goal. Then in the second quarter, New York defensive back Terry Kinard intercepted a pass from 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and returned it 15 yards to set up Phil Simms' 18-yard touchdown pass to tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Bavaro. San Francisco managed to drive inside the Giants 10-yard line with a 15-play drive that included two personal fouls and a holding call against New York's defense. However, they could not get {{into the end zone}} and had to settle for Ray Wersching's 21-yard field goal, cutting the score to 10-3 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|The lost {{opportunity}} was devastating. Indianapolis went three-and-out {{on their}} ensuing possession and Mason returned their punt 19 {{yards to the}} Colts 42-yard line, setting up Del Greco's fourth field goal to make the score 19–9. The Colts then turned the ball over on downs with their next drive, but managed {{to get it back}} with 3:11 left when defensive <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Thomas recovered a fumble from George on the Indianapolis 39. The Colts then drove 61 yards in nine plays to score on a 15-yard touchdown run by Manning, but by then there was only 1:50 left in the game and Titans receiver Yancey Thigpen sealed the victory by recovering Vanderjagt's onside kick.|$|E

25|$|Early in the game, Tampa Bay {{sent their}} field goal unit {{onto the field}} three times, but failed to get any points each time. After the game started with a punt from each team, the Bucs drove to the Green Bay 25-yard line, but Packers {{defensive}} tackle Bob Kuberski blocked Michael Husted's 43-yard field goal attempt. Green Bay then drove 67 yards, including a 26-yard catch by Antonio Freeman, to score on Brett Favre's 3-yard touchdown pass to tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Chmura. Tampa Bay responded with a drive to the Packers 25-yard line, but came up empty again.

25|$|Playing without star {{receiver}} Sterling Sharpe, who {{had suffered}} a career-ending neck injury {{at the end of}} the season, Green Bay scored first with a 14-play, 76-yard drive. Packers quarterback Brett Favre completed 7/8 passes for 57 yards, while Dorsey Levens finished it off with a 3-yard touchdown run on fourth and inches. In the second quarter, Packers kicker Chris Jacke missed a 37-yard field goal attempt, but with 2:56 left in the half, he increased the score to 10-0 on a 51-yard field goal (a franchise posteason record) at the end of a 37-yard drive jump-started by Favre's 20-yard completion to tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Chmura. Detroit responded with Dave Krieg's 46-yard completion to Brett Perriman, earning them a first down on the Packers 11-yard line. But after two incompletions and a 1-yard loss by Sanders, Jason Hanson's 30-yard field goal attempt was no good.|$|E
25|$|On the 49ers' {{first drive}} of the game, wide {{receiver}} Jerry Rice caught {{a very long}} pass from quarterback Joe Montana {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 50-yard touchdown; however, the future Hall of Famer inexplicably fumbled the football into the Giants end zone without being touched. (John Madden said during the telecast that the artificial turf at Giants Stadium may have been a factor.) Giants safety Kenny Hill recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. New York then drove 80 yards in 10 plays to score on Simms' 24-yard touchdown to tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Bavaro. San Francisco responded with a 26-yard field goal by Ray Wersching, but in the second quarter, Giants safety Herb Welch intercepted a pass from Montana and lateralled the ball to Elvis Patterson, who ran for 16 yards before being tackled. New York then converted with the turnover into a touchdown on Joe Morris' 45-yard run.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, the Giants {{lost their}} first two games before the players strike. Unlike the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a {{decision}} to use replacement players, but still lost all three replacement games, putting them at 0–5 when the strike ended. Though the Giants went 6–4 over their final 10 games, they finished out of the playoffs at 6–9. [...] Bright spots for the season included tight <b>end</b> <b>Mark</b> Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three New York's linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carson, and Carl Banks.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the players}} that would play key roles on the Giants Super Bowl teams emerged in 1985. Joe Morris, known as [...] "Little Joe" [...] for his {{diminutive}} stature (Morris stood 5ft 7in and weighed 195pounds), emerged as the main running threat on the Giants, rushing for 1,336yards, scoring 21 touchdowns and making the Pro Bowl.
