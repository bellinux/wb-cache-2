Significant intra-individual variation was observed in all of the estimates of DNA damage. <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> was overestimated because a considerable amount (~ 29 %) of the DNA damage was derived from apoptosis and necrosis. The remaining DNA damage in dolphin leukocytes was caused by factors unrelated to apoptosis and necrosis.

Here we show that the DNA damage response is perturbed in cells inactivated with an E 2 Nedd 8 conjugating enzyme UBE 2 M, measured by RAD 51 foci formation kinetics and cell based DNA repair assays. UBE 2 M knockdown increases <b>DNA</b> <b>breakages</b> and cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, further suggesting heightened genomic instability and defective DNA repair activity. Investigating the downstream Cullin targets of UBE 2 M revealed that silencing of Cullin 1, 2, and 4 ligases incurred significant DNA damage. In particular, UBE 2 M knockdown, or defective neddylation of Cullin 2, leads to a blockade in the G 1 to S progression and is associated with delayed S-phase dependent DNA damage response. Cullin 4 inactivation leads to an aberrantly high DNA damage response that is associated with increased <b>DNA</b> <b>breakages</b> and sensitivity of cells to DNA damaging agents, suggesting a DNA repair defect is associated. siRNA interrogation of key Cullin substrates show that CDT 1, p 21, and Claspin are involved in elevated DNA damage in the UBE 2 M knockdown cells.

The CcdB poison acts by trapping DNA gyrase in a cleaved complex with the gyrase A subunit covalently closed to the cleaved DNA, causing <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> and cell death in a way closely related to quinolones antibiotics.

50|$|Eukaryotic DNA is {{organized}} with histone proteins in specific complexes called chromatin. The chromatin structure functions and facilitates the packaging, organization {{and distribution of}} eukaryotic DNA. However, it has {{a negative impact on}} several fundamental biological processes such as transcription, replication and DNA repair by restricting the accessibility of certain enzymes and proteins. Post-translational modification of histones such as histone phosphorylation has been shown to modify the chromatin structure by changing protein:DNA or protein:protein interactions. Histone post-translational modifications modify the chromatin structure. The most commonly associated histone phosphorylation occurs during cellular responses to DNA damage, when phosphorylated histone H2A separates large chromatin domains around the site of <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage.</b> Researchers investigated whether modifications of histones directly impact RNA polymerase II directed transcription. Researchers choose proteins that are known to modify histones to test their effects on transcription, and found that the stress-induced kinase, MSK1, inhibits RNA synthesis. Inhibition of transcription by MSK1 was most sensitive when the template was in chromatin, since DNA templates not in chromatin were resistant to the effects of MSK1. It was shown that MSK1 phosphorylated histone H2A on serine 1, and mutation of serine 1 to alanine blocked the inhibition of transcription by MSK1. Thus results suggested that the acetylation of histones can stimulate transcription by suppressing an inhibitory phosphorylation by a kinase as MSK1.|$|E

40|$|The esperamicins {{represent}} {{a class of}} antitumor antibiotics characterized by an unusual chemical core structure and extremely potent cytotoxicity. The mechanism by which these drugs produce cytotoxicity was investigated and {{found to be related}} to the formation of single- and double-strand DNA breaks. Using five structurally related analogs, we defined a structure-activity relationship for cytotoxicity in various eukaryotic and DNA-repair-deficient prokaryotic cell lines, for <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> in a human colon carcinoma cell line, and for <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> in vitro in pBR 322 DNA. Mild reducing agents such as dithiothreitol greatly increased the <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> potency of these analogs in vitro. Results suggest that the pendant aromatic chromophore of esperamicin A 1 may contribute to the uptake of the drug into cells but may also hinder double-strand DNA break formation. Little <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> specificity was observed for the drug in a 139 -base-pair fragment of pBR 322 DNA. Evidence supports a previously proposed mechanism whereby esperamicins may produce the observed DNA breaks through reduction of the methyl trisulfide group to a thiolate anion followed by a Michael addition of the anion across the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. This addition may result in the saturation of the bridgehead double bond, thus allowing the two triple bonds to approach each other, causing cyclization of the diyn-ene to form a phenylene diradical.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{extensive}} inflammation, neutrophils undergo secondary necrosis causing myeloperoxidase (MPO) {{release that}} may damage resident lung cells. Recent observations suggest that MPO has pro-inflammatory properties, independent of its enzymatic activity. The {{aims of the}} present study were to characterise MPO internalisation by lung epithelial cells and to investigate the effect of MPO on oxidative stress, DNA damage and cytokine production by lung epithelial cells. Human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells were stimulated with MPO, with or without priming the cells with pro-inflammatory stimuli. MPO protein was detected in the cell cytoplasm. Expression of haemoxygenase (HO) - 1 and <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> were determined. The production of interleukin (IL) - 8 and- 6 were measured. Analyses of MPO-stimulated cells demonstrated MPO presence in the cells. HO- 1 expression was increased after MPO stimulation and increased further when cells were primed before MPO stimulation. MPO exposure also induced <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage.</b> Interestingly, MPO inhibited IL- 8 production in bronchial, but not alveolar epithelium. In conclusion, alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells can internalise myeloperoxidase. Stimulation with myeloperoxidase increases haemoxygenase- 1 expression and <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage,</b> suggesting cell damaging capacity of myeloperoxidase.

The present study was carried out to examine the role of NO/ONOO- in mediating renal tubular cell apoptosis in sickle cell mouse kidneys. MethodsMercaptoethylguanidine (MEG), a compound that selectively inhibits iNOS and also is a scavenger of ONOO-, was administered intraperitoneally over a five-day period to control and βs mice.

A more intensive <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> was observed during maturation of spermatides, embryo development, and differentiation of myotubes, epidermal cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils. In general, accumulation of DNA strand breaks in differentiating cells cannot be attributed to decrease of the DNA repair efficiency. Poly(ADP) ribose synthesis often follows the <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> in differentiating cells. We hypothesize that DNA fragmentation is an epigenetic tool for regulation of the differentiation process. Scarce data on localization of the differentiation- associated DNA strand breaks indicate their preferred accumulation in specific DNA sequences including the nuclear matrix attachment sites and repeats. Recent data on non-apoptotic functions of caspases provide more evidence for possible existence of a <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> mechanism in differentiating cells resembling the initial stage of apoptosis.

40|$|Catechins, {{the dietary}} phytochemicals present in green tea and other beverages, are {{considered}} to be potent inducers of apoptosis and cytotoxicity to cancer cells. While it is believed that the antioxidant properties of catechins and related dietary agents may contribute to lowering the risk of cancer induction by impeding oxidative injury to DNA, these properties cannot account for apoptosis induction and chemotherapeutic observations. Catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC) and epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) are the four major constituents of green tea. In this article, using human peripheral lymphocytes and comet assay, we show that C, EC, EGC and EGCG cause cellular <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> and can alternatively switch to a prooxidant action in the presence of transition metals such as copper. The cellular <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> was found to be significantly enhanced in the presence of copper ions. Catechins were found to be effective in providing protection against oxidative stress induced by tertbutylhydroperoxide, as measured by oxidative <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> in lymphocytes. The prooxidant action of catechins involved production of hydroxyl radicals through redox recycling of copper ions. We also determined that catechins, particularly EGCG, inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB- 231 leading to a prooxidant cell death. Since it is well established that tissue, cellular and serum copper levels are considerably elevated in various malignancies, cancer cells would be more subject to redox cycling between copper ions and catechins to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage.</b> Such a copper dependent prooxidant cytotoxic mechanism better explains the anticancer activity and preferential cytotoxicity of dietary phytochemicals against cancer cells...|$|E

Because the metabolic pathways of folate and other methyl donors are closely coupled, the effects of methionine and choline deficiency alone or in combination with folate deficiency were determined. Feeding male Hooded Lister rats a folate-free diet for 10 weeks created a moderate folate deficiency (25 – 50 % (approx.) decrease in plasma, red blood cell and hepatic folate concentrations (P < 0. 05) and a 20 % rise in plasma homocysteine (P < 0. 05)).

The resistant lines were obtained by intermittent exposure of the KBM- 3 cells to the highest tolerated concentration of m-AMSA so that the culture would be repopulated only by the most resistant subpopulation after each exposure. Two distinct phases were apparent during the development of resistance. During the first 14 months of intermittent exposure to maximally tolerated concentrations of m-AMSA, the cells developed low-degree m-AMSA resistance (5 - 7 -fold as compared with the parent line, as measured by cell survival). This low-degree resistance was characterised by a somewhat suppressed level of <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> and no measurable change in cellular protein levels. Subsequently, a single escalation of the m-AMSA retreatment concentration resulted in a cell population that was approximately 100 -fold resistant, as assessed by cloning. This rapid phenotypic change temporally coincided with the acquisition of an almost complete refractoriness to m-AMSA-induced <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> and the loss of a cellular 76 kDa protein.

Here, we isolated "suppressor-of-death" mutations, that is, secondary changes that allow a gyrA 208 recB double mutant to survive a prolonged exposure to 43 degrees and subsequently to form colonies at 28 degrees. In most isolates, the secondary change was itself a ts mutation. Three ts alleles were mapped in genes coding for amino acyl tRNA synthetases (alaS, glnS, and lysS). Allele alaS 216 completely abolished <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> in a gyrA 208 recA double mutant. Likewise, treating this mutant with chloramphenicol prevented death and DNA damage at 43 degrees. Additional suppressors of gyrA 208 lethality include rpoB mutations and, surprisingly, icd mutations inactivating isocitrate dehydrogenase. We postulate that the primary effect of the gyrase alteration is to hamper replication fork movement. Inhibiting DNA replication under conditions of continuing macromolecular synthesis ("unbalanced growth") activates a mechanism that causes <b>DNA</b> <b>breakage</b> and cell death, reminiscent of "thymineless" lethality...|$|E
40|$|U 937 human monoblast cells {{incubated}} with leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4) rapidly released {{arachidonic acid}} metabolites into the culture medium. Release was suppressed by the high-affinity LTD 4 receptor antagonist SK&F 104353. Arachidonic acid release induced by LTD 4 {{has been linked}} to a rapid induction of gene expression, and the propagation of the receptor binding signal is probably associated with enzymes that regulate gene expression. We have studied the participation of DNA topoisomerase I in LTD 4 signal transduction. LTD 4 -specific release of arachidonic acid metabolites was inhibited (60 - 80 %) by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. LTD 4 increased protein-linked <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> induced by camptothecin in U 937 cells; this enhancement was prevented by coincubation of the cells with LTD 4 plus the receptor antagonist SK&F 104353. In addition, LTD 4 produced a rapid transient increase in extractable topoisomerase I activity, which was maximum within the first 10 min after addition of LTD 4 to the culture medium. Incubation of cultures for greater than 10 min with LTD 4 before the addition of camptothecin resulted in no enhancement of camptothecin-induced <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage,</b> consistent with a reversal of topoisomerase I activation. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocked LTD 4 -induced arachidonic acid release and attenuated the effect of LTD 4 on camptothecin-induced <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage.</b> These results are consistent with the view that the regulation of topoisomerase I activity is involved in the propagation of LTD 4 -mediated signals in U 937 cells...|$|R
40|$|Increasing lead {{contamination}} in Egyptian ecosystems and high lead concentrations in food items have raised concern {{for human health}} and stimulated studies on monitoring ecotoxicological impact of lead-caused genotoxicity. In this work, the alkaline comet assay was modified for monitoring <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> in sensitive early life stages of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Following exposure to 100, 300, and 500 microg/L lead nitrate, <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> was quantified in embryos at 30, 48, 96, 144, and 168 h post-fertilization (PFS). For quantitative analysis, four commonly used parameters (tail % DNA, %TDNA; head % DNA, %HDNA; tail length, TL; tail moment, TM) were analyzed in 96 nuclei (in triplicates) at each sampling point. The parameter %TDNA revealed highest resolution and lowest variation. A strong correlation between lead concentration, time of exposure, and <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> was observed. Here, genotoxicity detected by comet assay preceded the manifested malformations assessed with conventional histology. Qualitative evaluation was carried out using five categories are as follows: undamaged (%TDNA 75 %) nuclei confirming a dose and time-dependent shift towards increased frequencies of highly and extremely damaged nuclei. A protective capacity provided by a hardened chorion is a an interesting finding in this study as DNA damage in the prehatching stages 30 h-PFS and 48 h-PFS was low in all treatments (qualitative and quantitative analyses). These results clearly show that the comet assay is a sensitive tool {{for the detection of}} genotoxicity in vulnerable early life stages of the African catfish and is a method more sensitive than histological parameters for monitoring genotoxic effects. 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Green-lipped mussels (Perna viridis) {{were exposed}} to {{water-borne}} benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) at nominal concentrations of 0, 0. 3, 3 and 30 μgl - 1 for up to 12 days, and both the relative levels of DNA strand breaks (assessed using an alkaline comet assay) {{and the proportion of}} micronucleus (MN) formation were monitored in mussel haemocytes at days 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12. The results of the comet assay indicated that an increase in the proportion of strand breaks occurred generally with increasing B[a]P concentration, but a significant decrease in the levels of DNA damage was observed after exposure for 12 days at all concentrations tested, suggesting that the patterns of changes in the levels of <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> {{can be explained by the}} threshold dependent DNA repair theory. Moreover, the relatively slow development and recovery of the DNA damage response in mussel haemocytes in comparison with previous findings utilizing P. viridis hepatopancreas suggests that the response of DNA alteration upon exposure to B[a]P may be tissue-specific in this species. Monitoring the frequency of micronucleus development in mussel haemocytes indicated both dose- and time-response relationships within the exposure period. Furthermore, the levels of <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> correlated well with the levels of micronucleus induction, suggesting a possible cause and effect relationship between the two damage types. We suggest that <b>DNA</b> strand <b>breakage</b> and micronucleus formation in mussel haemocytes can potentially be used as convenient biomarkers of exposure to genotoxicants in the marine environment. © 2003 Elsevier B.
