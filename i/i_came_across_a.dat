It {{looked exactly like}} the pressed specimen that I had in front of me. I then began to compare the two and found that they matched exactly, including the hairiness, except for the following differences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music of}} BLACKsummers'night {{is rooted in}} general soul music, and it {{features}} a more straightforward musical structure than Maxwell's previous work such as Embrya (1998). Maxwell's lyrics concern his falling {{in and out of}} love during his sabbatical period prior to the album's release. In an interview with Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Maxwell stated [...] "The inspiration was real life itself. You know, while I was taking time away from the industry, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> relationship that took me by surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{living with}} his father, an engineer, Edgard was pushed to further his {{scientific}} understanding at the Institute Technique, {{a high school in}} Italy that specialized in teaching mathematics and science. It was here where Edgard became particularly interested in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. It was through Edgard's love of science that he began to study sound, as he later recalled [...] "When I was about twenty, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> definition of music that seemed suddenly to throw light on my gropings toward music I sensed could exist. Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński, the Polish physicist, chemist, musicologist and philosopher {{of the first half of}} the nineteenth century, defined music as 'the corporealization of the intelligence that is in sounds.' It was a new and exciting conception and to me the first that started me thinking of music as spatial—as moving bodies of sound in space, a conception I gradually made my own." ...|$|E

Unlike rock-collecting, tautonym-collecting is clean, requires very little exertion, {{and only a}} small amount of storage space.

60|$|I was {{reminded}} of Jack because <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> letter to-day which is over thirty years old that Jack wrote. Jack was doomed to consumption. He was very long and slim, poor creature; and {{in a year or}} two after he got back from that excursion, to the Holy Land he went on a ride on horseback through Colorado, and he did not last but a year or two.|$|E

He was a marvellous little fellow. He {{used to say that}} all good detective work was a mere matter of method. My system is based on his--though of course I have progressed rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully clever." ...|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, I {{instituted a}} {{rigorous}} private {{search for the}} corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his party. The result was that, after some days, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>an</b> old dry well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the bottom, I discovered what I sought.|$|R
60|$|By {{the way it}} {{was while}} I was waiting {{on the banks of the}} river that <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>an</b> old friend of mine, a Zulu named Magepa, with whom I had fought at the battle of the Tugela.

60|$|In Malaga, for me, {{there are}} dark churches, with massive, tall pillars; the light falls softly through the painted glass, regilding the golden woodwork, the angels and the saints and the bishops in their mitres. The air is heavy with incense, {{and women in}} mantillas kneel in the half-light, praying silently. Now and then <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>an</b> old house with a {{fragment}} of Moorish work, reminding me that here again the Moors have left their mark.|$|R

For instance, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> {{man with a}} badly sprained wrist {{the other day and}} he offered me two dollars for {{anything}} that would cure it. Now it would have been singularly easy to have affixed a different label to my unrivaled peach-bloom cosmetic and have supplied him with a sure-to-heal embrocation. As it was, I got my supper at his place and recommended cold-water bandages. There was another man I cured of a broken leg, and I resisted the temptation to brace him up with hair-restorer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I found I {{had a knack}} {{of writing}} verses and things, and I wrote a few {{vaudeville}} songs. Then <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> man named Bevan at a music publisher's. He {{was just starting to}} write music, and we got together and turned out some vaudeville sketches, and then a manager sent for us to fix up a show that was dying on the road and we had the good luck {{to turn it into a}} success, and after that it was pretty good going. George Bevan got married the other day. Lucky devil!" ...|$|E

"With {{reference}} to that case," [...] his companion commenced, [...] "the facts {{were all so}} simple {{that there was no}} need for the prosecution to consider any other motive than the obvious one of attempted robbery. Therefore, no very searching investigation has been made into the dead man's papers. Yesterday afternoon, it occurred to me to look them through once more, in case anything had been overlooked. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> clumsy sort of document purporting to be the deeds of a gold-mine.

50|$|Anderson's {{practice}} began {{primarily with}} video. In 2011, this took {{a new direction}} following her personal exhibition at the Freud Museum in London, where she worked on Anna Freud's loom and initiated geometrical works of lines and grids. This is also when Anderson began to use copper-coloured wire in her studio. ‘I took objects apart {{and put them back}} together again, and during one of these dismantling sessions <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>an</b> alarm clock with a bobbin of copper wire inside it’.|$|R

As long as I'm master of Gangoil I'll be master; and when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> swindle I'll tell the man who does it he's a swindler.

6000|$|After {{the storm}} {{which had been}} raging in my stomach had subsided, and no more good Samaritans {{happening}} along, I went on borrowing handkerchiefs again and blowing them to atoms, as had been my custom {{in the early stages}} of my cold, until <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> lady who had just arrived from over the plains, and who said she had lived in a part of the country where doctors were scarce, and had from necessity acquired considerable skill in the treatment of simple [...] "family complaints."

60|$|I was so restless {{early this}} morning that before {{daylight}} I was out exploring on the mountain-side. By chance <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> secret place just as the day was breaking. Indeed, it was by the change of light as the first sun-rays seemed to fall down the mountain-side that my attention was called to an opening shown by a light behind it. It was, indeed, a secret place--so secret that I thought at first I should keep it to myself. In such a place as this either to hide in or {{to be able to}} prevent anyone else hiding in might on occasion be an asset of safety.|$|E
60|$|Yesterday while I was rummaging {{in a pile}} {{of ancient}} note-books of mine which I had not seen for years, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> {{reference}} to that biography. It is quite evident that several times, at breakfast and dinner, in those long-past days, I was posing for the biography. In fact, I clearly remember that I was doing that--and I also remember that Susy detected it. I remember saying a very smart thing, with a good deal of an air, at the breakfast-table one morning, and that Susy observed to her mother privately, a little later, that papa was doing that for the biography.|$|E
40|$|In August, 2016 I {{was walking}} between my {{accommodation}} and a conference venue {{on my way}} to deliver a lecture on social work history when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>an</b> art installation with the phrase ‘the future has a long history’, which I captured in the above photograph. As I attend other social work conferences I am increasingly aware that the history of social work and its influence is attracting much interest. This article tries to capture some of the debate which is arising using some of these experiences and also indicates ongoing developments...|$|R

"I took {{a suit of}} Freddie's clothes away {{to brush}} just now; and happening"--Mr. Judson paused and gave a little cough--"happening to glance at the {{contents}} of his pockets <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> letter. <b>I</b> took a sort of look at it before setting it aside, and it was from a fellow named Jones; and it said that this girl, Valentine, was sticking onto young Freddie's letters what he'd written her, and would see him blowed if she parted with them under another thousand. And, as I made it out, Freddie had already given her five hundred.|$|R
6000|$|One {{more thing}} too I did. On its {{confines}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> group of dead Zulus {{who appeared to}} have been killed by a shell. Dismounting I took the headdress of one of them and put it on, for I forgot to say that I had lost my hat. It was made of a band of otterskin from which rose large tufts of the black feathers of the finch which the natives call [...] "sakabula." [...] Also I tied his kilt of white oxtails about my middle, precautions to which I have little doubt I owe my life, since from a distance they made me look like a Kaffir mounted on a captured pony.|$|E
6000|$|... 'After a few days' {{stay here}} I {{returned}} to the coast. While there <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> curious fish-trap, a description of {{which may not be}} uninteresting. Across a stick planted in the river-bed a light piece of bamboo was tied, and at its further extremity was suspended a string carrying fish-hooks. Above these a broad piece of wood, suspended so as to be half in and half out of the water, acted as a float and spindle. Above this again were tied four large shells, so that when a fish is hooked the shells begin to jingle, and the fishermen, hid in the bush, immediately rush out and secure the fish.' ...|$|E
60|$|Chairman. Have you {{not seen}} any of the German copies {{of some of the}} great Italian masters, which are {{generally}} esteemed very admirable works?--I have not much studied the works of the copyists; I have not observed them much, never having yet found an exception to that rule which I have mentioned. When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>a</b> copyist in the Gallery of the Vatican, or in the Gallery at Florence, I had a horror of the mischief, and the scandal and the libel upon the master, from the supposition that such a thing as that in any way resembled his work, and the harm that it would do to the populace among whom it was shown.|$|E

40|$|While {{checking}} one of {{the card}} indexes <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>an</b> entry for Charles Babbage, listing him as {{one of the}} authors of an 1837 petition to the U. S.

This turned out to be a large folded parchment, much of which was taken up by a list of names, and a set of 51 signatures, either on the manuscript itself, or (as with the case of Charles Babbage) cut out from, presumably, a letter and pasted to the manuscript. The main text on the manuscript started: “Address of certain Authors of Great Britain to the Senate of the United States in Congress assembled...|$|R
