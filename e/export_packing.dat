Bulk mate is used both as the raw material for brands and as an ingredient in other products, such as energy drinks. The Middle East, accounting for roughly 60% of exports, is such a major market because there was a reverse migration in the 1950s. Those who returned had been in Argentina for several generations and had therefore picked up the local habits, such as drinking mate in the traditional way. New markets are being developed in Europe and in North America. Most of the new markets are teabag ones, but Poland is an exception. There, traditional mate is a seen as quick and easy adventurous experience, perhaps similar to smoking a hookah, which also has an inherent social component.|$|R

40|$|Our {{analysis}} {{is motivated by}} cases of cigarette smuggling in Canada and in the UK. In the 1990 s, domestic cigarettes were legally exported to be subsequently illegally imported. At first, smuggling was done by individual consumers who bought cigarettes abroad and brought them back through policed points of entry. This Mom and Pop smuggling was a mechanism to implement a second-degree price discrimination scheme by cigarette manufacturers. Regrets from committing tax evasion and labels on <b>exported</b> cigarettes <b>packs</b> permit vertical differentiation of illegal and legal cigarettes. Paradoxically, labeling measures can make illegal sales more resilient to tax reductions, and stricter border enforcement encourages a switch to a less benign smuggling technology exclusive to criminal organizations. High export taxes terminated export-to-smuggle schemes, but brought about a surge of counterfeit cigarettes. Because of a second-degree price discrimination scheme, the elimination of taxes need not suffice to eradicate smuggling. Copyright � 2009 The Authors.

To demonstrate its effectiveness, we implemented our prototype ReconPD based on QEMU. The experiments show that ReconPD is able to analyze the packed DLLs, yet practical in terms of performance. Moreover, the reconstructed binary files can be successfully analyzed by static analysis tools, such as IDA Pro. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|This project {{presents}} {{a vision of}} how New Zealand could work smarter to capitalise on a lucrative global trade opportunity, by offering {{an alternative to the}} current logistics and transportation infrastructure of refrigerated exports. With the aid of a world-first FTA (Free-Trade Agreement) (Barber, 2014), New Zealand frozen lamb exports to China are rapidly growing (Meat Industry Association of New Zealand, 2013). However, the current transportation and logistical systems used to export this product were developed over 37 years ago (Chua, 1978). With significant growth in the Chinese market, these systems are now inefficient and outdated (Levinson, 2006; & Food Science Australia, 2005). New systems and new infrastructures need to be developed to accommodate the needs of the new, lucrative Chinese market. The system designed in this project comprises a flat-pack refrigerated shipping container system with integrated internal packing modules. The flat-pack design of the container increases space efficiency when transporting empty and improves security when transporting <b>export</b> product. Internal <b>packing</b> modules divide and organise the cargo in manageable units which eliminate ergonomic issues and decrease the risk of injury while also increasing product safety and quality assurance...|$|R
5000|$|Many nano reef aquarists prefer their {{displays}} {{to be as}} natural-looking as possible, {{and therefore}} choose to use as few mechanical filtration methods as possible. A primary filtration method in nano reefs is live rock and live sand, which are pieces of rock and sand that have broken from the coral reef and are populated with beneficial bacteria and other organisms that aid in breaking down organic wastes produced by larger organisms in the nano reef. Other nano reef aquarists use devices such as protein skimmers to remove excess waste from the aquarium, before it {{has a chance to}} be broken down to nitrate. Removing the excess wastes mechanically can reduce the frequency of water changes needed to keep nitrate levels low. Delaying the action of the mechanical filters, such as by means of a day-night timer, can allow invertebrates to filter-feed naturally.

40|$|The North Atlantic U. S. {{groundfish}} and scallop processing {{industries are}} {{a tale of}} two fisheries. The groundfish processing industry has suffered a steep, almost continual decline in landings starting in 1984 that resulted in 2014 landings that were only 16 % of 1983 landings. US scallop landings increased from 5 million mt in 1998 to 30 mill mt in 2004, remaining around that peak until 2012. Both processing industries had to adjust: groundfish processors had to find new sources of fresh groundfish and other products to fill customers’ orders and scallop processors had to find new customers to buy its surplus product. This study used interviews with processors and data on landings, imports and exports to examine the marketing strategies of these processing industries to adjust to trends in landings and to evaluate their success within the confines the US Magnuson-Stevens Act. After imported whole groundfish from Canada were eliminated as substitutes for local landings, groundfish processors increased diversification of products as substitute for fresh groundfish to fill their customers’ orders, scouring the world for products such as Pacific cod, other groundfish, and some pelagic species. They also skipped the wholesale market to sell direct to retailers and restaurants. Not all succeeded, processing plants declined by almost half since 1990. Scallop processors successfully developed new markets for scallops, through <b>exports</b> and IQF <b>packing</b> for restaurants. The doubling of ex-vessel scallop prices, adjusted for inflation, since 2000 shows their success, which also supports processors’ claims that steady increasing supply improves product sales...|$|R

40|$|In Sri Lanka the {{agricultural}} structure of smallholder production has changed with {{population growth and}} land reforms. In former days a farm family could life from the production of their home garden through subsistence farming and barter economy. Additional income was achieved by selling surplus products like spices on the local markets. Today living standards and life style have changed and monetary needs for housing, schooling, electricity, telephone, household goods and transport facilities are much higher. Many smallholders are involved in single cash crop cultivation and outside employment for income generation. Lack of available arable land and infrastructure are main reasons for the limited economical success of many smallholders in Sri Lanka. This study investigated whether the formation of farmer groups under patronage of an organisation and private company next to adoption of organic agriculture practices can be recommended as an economical viable and ecological sound alternative. Hence a survey was conducted in Kandy District of Sri Lanka, as well as field and laboratory experiments carried out in co-operation with the Tea Research Institute, Talawakele and the Post Graduate Institute of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya. Data from 529 organic tea smallholders (TSHs) were collected between 1997 and 1999. From the findings the study describes the present situation of organic TSHs production systems in Kandy District, Sri Lanka organised under Bio Foods Ltd. Organic Tea and Spices and Gami Seva Sevana (GSS) a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO).

40|$|New food {{packaging}} protects the product, seduces the consumer, and follows the law. The challenge {{is in keeping}} up with the latest trends. At Owino market in Kampala, Uganda, there are times when the market becomes flooded in more ways than one. First with the rains, and then with an excess of produce due to over-production after the rains. Crop production and yields in Uganda, like elsewhere, depend very much on the rainy seasons. In the market, Sarah Masaaba beats her competitors by cleaning her fresh produce and then wrapping it in fine green leaves and dry produce in transparent polythene sheets. It gives her produce that added attraction for some customers. Packaging {{is as important as the}} product itself. It protects the product against damage and spoilage, improves handling, transport, informs the buyers about the contents and will make the produce easier to use. Sarah Masaaba and thousands of other tradeswomen know that the crucial determinants for profitable and safe trade in horticultural produce, as with all other perishable goods, are that the goods reach the consumer safe and whole. In many ACP countries, the packaging of horticultural produce for the domestic market is usually carried out at the production area, but some farmers transport their produce from farms to go downs or retailer shops in containers not specifically designed to carry produce. This affects the nutritional and storage quality. More still, in particular in larger enterprises, or where produce is pooled for <b>export,</b> it is <b>packed</b> in containers that facilitate accumulation of ethylene gases in storage. This accelerates the aging of produce. In Uganda, post harvest losses account for 30 % of cost of production in agricultural produce. In Senegal, research has shown that half the failures of small-scale food enterprises are due to bad distribution, and spoilage from poor packaging. The boxes box It is not just customer care and being economical with your produce that make it necessary for food processors and retailers to pay more attention to {{food packaging}}. There is also a growing volume of legislation. Each country has its own requirements for local and imported produce, and its standards are often derived from the guidelines of the international Codex Alimentarius Commission. This has drawn up standards for processing, labelling, presentation, advertising, weights, hygiene, and practices in processing and handling as well as packaging material requirements. They are complex, and sometimes hard for the small-scale operator to obtain, but they are available in national bureaux of standards, ministries, chambers of commerce, university food science departments, and embassies. Importing countries also require evidence that processed food has had a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point check. The HACCP check examines critical points on the path taken by food from the farm-gate to the final distributor: purchase, storage, pre-preparation, cooking, cooling and packaging. It is in the West that Codex Alimentarius and HACCP standards are applied most stringently, but since they directly affect exports from ACP countries, they will soon be incorporated into the laws of most ACP countries. They may not be rigorously applied, for lack of adequate mechanisms, but they will be there, in a statute book near you. The role of technology A similar trickle-down effect will affect the nature of packaging, and its production, from the paradoxal perspective of environmental laws. Many Western nations are reducing the amount of material and energy used in packaging food and non-foods, while respecting hygiene laws. The use of non-recyclable plastics is being minimised, with recyclable materials such as cloth and non-wood paper being preferred. An extreme example: a factory in Wageningen in The Netherlands, about two kilometres from the Spore offices, produces degradable waste-bags from maize cobs, for the collection of household organic waste to central composting sites. Here lies a future business opportunity for a resourceful ACP packager! The concern for dematerialisation is not, though, always anti-plastic. In Switzerland, consumers shopping bags in plastic are about twenty times thicker than the ubiquitous thin blue plastic bags which now pollute cities and green belts the whole world over. The reason: a thicker bag will be used more often, and the energy used in production will be lower. Similar calculations lie behind recent changes in the shape of juice cartons in Europe. Taller and thinner, more can be shipped in a lorry, and more placed on shop shelves all requiring less energy. Banana leaf, or banana skin? The sums guiding the choice of packaging are complex, and in the future rare will be the times that a banana leaf wins over something manufactured. Yet for ACP processors and shippers, it is not just a question of getting proper information about laws and trade trends. It is much more about accessing the technology to produce the right cartons and cans. The sale of obsolete packing plants to ACP entrepreneurs, and the adoption of complex HACCP practices, may not be deliberate ploys to exclude some produce from Western markets, but one can see how the idea arises. While trade barriers fall, the technology barriers get higher. That requires a different strategy than demanding exemptions and quotas. It requires machines.
