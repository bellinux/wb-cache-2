5|$|The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has {{proposed}} to MDOT that I-475 should {{be connected to}} US23 {{in the southern part}} of Genesee County. The board approved a study to investigate the economic <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an extension. The study will also examine how such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex. Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but was indefinitely postponed in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
25|$|As Gibbons was {{campaigning for}} {{governor}} in October 2006, it was brought to light that {{more than ten years}} earlier, his wife Dawn had employed Martha Patricia Pastor Sandoval, a then-illegal immigrant from Peru, as a housekeeper and babysitter.

25|$|Despite the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> {{changes on}} the United States' {{political}} structure and on workers' empowerment, some scholars have criticized the impacts of these policies from a classical economic perspective. Cole and Ohanian (2004) find that the New Deal's pro-labor policies are {{an important factor in}} explaining the weak recovery from the Great Depression and the rise in real wages in some industrial sectors during this time.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{that he did}} consider practical was tightened government fiscal policy, based on using tax revenue to reduce the national debt. Tightened fiscal policy would {{have the effect of}} slowing economic growth, thereby slowing coal consumption, at least until the debt was erased. Still, Jevons admitted that the overall <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a measure, even if it were implemented, would be minimal. In short, the prospect that society would voluntarily reduce consumption was dim.|$|E
25|$|The diet of the thorntail {{stingray}} {{consists of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It {{has been known}} to gather in large groups during summertime. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The venomous stinging spine of the thorntail stingray can inflict a painful injury, though it is not aggressive towards humans. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers, though the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> activities on its population is unknown. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} results of petrophysical laboratory experiments {{in studies of}} decompression phenomena associated with consequences of abrupt displacements in fault zones. Decompression was studied in cases of controlled pressure drop that caused sharp changes of porosity and permeability parameters, and <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> decompression were analyzed. Healing of fractured-porous medium by newly formed phases was studied. After experiments with decompression, healing of fractures and pores in silicate rock samples (3 × 2 × 2 cm, 500 °C, 100 MPa) took about 800 – 1000 hours, and strength <b>of</b> <b>such</b> rocks was restored to 0. 6 – 0. 7 of the original value. In nature, fracture healing is influenced by a variety <b>of</b> factors, <b>such</b> as size <b>of</b> discontinuities in rock masses, pressure and temperature conditions, pressure drop gradients, rock composition and saturation with fluid. <b>Impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> factors are reviewed. </span...|$|R

25|$|Another {{remedy that}} Singapore courts might apply if an {{appropriate}} case arises – {{though it has}} yet to do so – is the granting of temporary validity to unconstitutional laws. When a piece of legislation is ruled as unconstitutional, a lacuna or gap in the law may ensue as the legislation is void retrospectively and prospectively. The situation is exacerbated if the legislation is one with far-reaching effects. Hence, to overcome the negative <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a lacuna, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the remedy of granting temporary validity to unconstitutional legislation for the minimum time necessary for the legislature to enact alternative laws.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Reference re Manitoba Language Rights (1985), the Official Language Act, 1890 purported to allow Acts of the Legislature of Manitoba to be {{published}} and printed only in English. The Supreme Court held that the Official Language Act was unconstitutional 95 {{years after it was}} passed, as it was inconsistent with section23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 (part of the Constitution of Canada) which requires Acts to be published in both English and French. The <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an outcome was that all laws of Manitoba which had not enacted in both English and French were never valid. These laws included, among others, laws governing persons' rights, criminal law, and even the laws pertaining to election of the Legislature.|$|E
25|$|The {{coming of}} {{independence}} to Latin America saw {{the formation of}} two parties in every country: Liberal and Conservative. Conservatives looked toward Europe, and particularly Spain, for social and political inspiration. They wished to retain the Catholic Church in the position which she had from the first settlement; furthermore, they wanted the great estates to remain like those of Europe—self-contained communities which, despite failing to make {{a great deal of}} money for their owners, did build social stability. The Liberals looked to the United States as a guide, wanted separation of Church and State, and wished to turn the great estates into money-making concerns, like factories. These two groups had clashed since independence. The Conservatives produced some notable leaders, like Mexico's Agustín de Iturbide and Guatemala's Rafael Carrera. As the 19th century progressed, both parties were faced with the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> inventions as the railroad.|$|E

25|$|In May 1915 a {{full-blown}} controversy was erupting, with the angels {{being used as}} proof of the action of divine providence {{on the side of}} the Allies in sermons across Britain, and then spreading into newspaper reports published widely across the world. Machen, bemused by all this, attempted to end the rumours by republishing the story in August in book form, with a long preface stating the rumours were false and originated in his story. It became a bestseller, and resulted in a vast series of other publications claiming to provide evidence of the Angels' existence. Machen tried to set the record straight, but any attempt to lessen the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an inspiring story was seen as bordering on treason by some. These new publications included popular songs and artists' renderings of the angels. There were more reports of angels and apparitions from the front including Joan of Arc.|$|E
25|$|Snape's {{memories}} then {{reveal that}} Dumbledore had impetuously {{tried to use}} the Gaunt ring which had been cursed by Voldemort, and had been suffering from a powerful curse. Snape's knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow {{the spread of the}} curse from Dumbledore's hand through his body, but he would have died within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied that this kind of coup de grâce would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would. Snape agreed to do as the Headmaster requested. Snape's memories also provide Harry with the information he needs to ensure Voldemort's final defeat, in the form of conversations Snape had with Dumbledore.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Justice and FBI {{have not}} {{enforced}} the DMCA as rigorously {{as had been}} feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated {{that he will not}} release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA. Cryptanalyst Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lock-in, while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security. Both Alan Cox (longtime Linux kernel developer) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the MPAA sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash triggered by the perceived <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> notices on fair use and free speech.|$|E

500|$|The volcano usually generates Plinian eruptions, {{which produce}} swift-moving {{currents}} of hot gas and rock called pyroclastic flows.

[...] The <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an eruption is increased as the hot gas and lava melt the mountain's snowcap, adding large quantities of water to the flow. On November 13, 1985, a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and destroyed the town of Armero in Tolima, causing an estimated 25,000 deaths. This event later became known as the Armero tragedy—the deadliest lahar in recorded history. Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845, consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar.|$|E
