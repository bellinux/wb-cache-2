50|$|A {{hydraulic}} hammer {{is a modern}} type of piling hammer used in place of diesel and air <b>hammers</b> <b>for</b> <b>driving</b> steel pipe, precast concrete, and timber piles. Hydraulic hammers are more environmentally acceptable than the older, less efficient hammers as they generate less noise and pollutants. However, {{in many cases the}} dominant noise is caused by the impact of the hammer on the pile, or the impacts between components of the hammer, so that the resulting noise level can be very similar to diesel hammers.|$|R
50|$|The handle {{can range}} from 50 cm to a full 1 m long, {{depending}} on {{the mass of the}} head. The head mass is usually 1 to 3 kg. Modern heavy duty sledgehammers come with 10 to(-) 20 lb heads. Sledgehammers usually require two hands and a swinging motion involving the entire torso, in contrast to smaller <b>hammers</b> used <b>for</b> <b>driving</b> in nails. The combination of a long swinging range, and heavy head, increases the force of the resulting impact.|$|R
50|$|As a {{field of}} research, human-computer {{interaction}} is situated {{at the intersection of}} computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study. The term was popularized by Stuart K. Card, Allen Newell, and Thomas P. Moran in their seminal 1983 book, The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, although the authors first used the term in 1980 and the first known use was in 1975. The term connotes that, unlike other tools with only limited uses (such as a <b>hammer,</b> useful <b>for</b> <b>driving</b> nails but not much else), a computer has many uses and this takes place as an open-ended dialog between the user and the computer. The notion of dialog likens human-computer interaction to human-to-human interaction, an analogy which is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.|$|R
40|$|Complexes of {{physically}} {{interacting proteins}} {{are one of}} the fundamental functional units responsible <b>for</b> <b>driving</b> <b>key</b> biological mechanisms within the cell. Their identication is therefore necessary to understand not only complex formation but also the higher level organization of the cell. With the advent of "high-throughput" techniques in molecular biology, signi¯cant amount of physical interaction data has been cataloged from organisms such as yeast, which has in turn fueled computational approaches to systematically mine complexes from the network of physical interactions among proteins (PPI network). In this survey, we review, classify and evaluate some of the key computational methods developed till date for the identi¯cation of protein complexes from PPI networks. We present two insightful taxonomies that re°ect how these methods have evolved over the years toward improving automated complex prediction. We also discuss some open challenges facing accurate reconstruction of complexes, the crucial ones being the presence of high proportion of errors and noise in current high-throughput datasets and some key aspects overlooked by current complex detection methods. We hope this review will not only help to condense the history of computational complex detection for easy reference but also provide valuable insights to drive further research in this area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Complexes of {{physically}} {{interacting proteins}} {{are one of}} the fundamental functional units responsible <b>for</b> <b>driving</b> <b>key</b> biological mechanisms within the cell. With the advent of high-throughput techniques, significant amount of protein interaction (PPI) data has been catalogued for organisms such as yeast, which has in turn fueled computational methods for systematic identification and study of protein complexes. However, many complexes are dynamic entities - their subunits are known to assemble at a particular cellular space and time to perform a particular function and disassemble after that - and while current computational analyses have concentrated on studying the dynamics of individual or pairs of proteins in PPI networks, a crucial aspect overlooked is the dynamics of whole complex formations. In this work, using yeast as our model, we incorporate 'time' in the form of cell-cycle phases into the prediction of complexes from PPI networks and study the temporal phenomena of complex assembly and disassembly across phases. We hypothesize that 'staticness' (constitutive expression) of proteins might be related to their temporal "reusability" across complexes, and test this hypothesis using complexes predicted from large-scale PPI networks across the yeast cell cycle phases. Our results hint towards a biological design principle underlying cellular mechanisms - cells maintain generic proteins as 'static' to enable their "reusability" across multiple temporal complexes. We also demonstrate that these findings provide additional support and alternative explanations to findings from existing works on the dynamics in PPI networks. </p...|$|R

50|$|Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet is run as {{a working}} museum, with works and {{buildings}} dating from between 1714 and 1876. The museum demonstrates the process making blister steel from iron and coke, then refining this steel using techniques that originated with Benjamin Huntsman's invention of the crucible steel process. The river provides water power via a water wheel. There are several wheels on the site <b>for</b> <b>driving</b> a tilt <b>hammer,</b> <b>for</b> the initial forging of the scythe blades; grinding machinery, which also has steam installed as backup for times of drought, {{and a set of}} bellows. The blades were also hand forged for finishing.|$|R

5000|$|The self-signal, as Kubler contends, is {{the obvious}} purpose of objects—artwork or tool. The self-signal of a <b>hammer,</b> <b>for</b> example, is its [...] "mute declaration" [...] that its {{intended}} use is to be grasped by the handle, thus extending the individual's fist through the peen <b>for</b> <b>driving</b> a nail into a plank(24). The adherent signal of the hammer is the patent and protected trademark of a specific manufacturing address stamped on the handle. Using the example of fine art, Kubler explains that the self-signal of a painting is its colors and their arrangement on the two-dimensional surface that alerts the viewer to concede to a visual language that will produce enjoyment. [...] "Part of the self-signal," [...] writes Kubler, [...] "is that {{thousands of years of}} painting still have not exhausted the possibilities of such an apparent simple category of sensation" [...] (24, 25). The adherent signal of the painting is, for example, the culturally recognized depiction of a well-known myth or historical scene.|$|R
