50|$|The area is {{difficult}} for agriculture with lower temperatures, more exposure and <b>heavier,</b> <b>wetter</b> soils than the surrounding lowlands. However it has proved excellent for forestry and there are extensive plantations of Sitka spruce at the higher elevations.|$|R
50|$|Biliran has a {{combination}} of warm and cool climatic zones, thus the prevailing climate is ideal for the cultivation {{of a wide range}} of agricultural crops. There is no distinct dry season but the <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> season generally occurs in December.|$|R
50|$|A {{large green}} tree, valued mainly for its fruits, both green and ripe. It can {{grow up to}} 15 - 30 m tall. The tree grows best in well-drained sandy loam; it does not grow well in <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> soils. The optimal pH of the soil should be between 5.2 and 7.5.|$|R
50|$|Trollius is a genus {{of about}} 30 {{species of plants}} in the family Ranunculaceae, closely related to Ranunculus. The common name of some species is {{globeflower}} or globe flower. Native to the cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity of species in Asia, trollius usually grow in <b>heavy,</b> <b>wet</b> clay soils.|$|R
50|$|An {{investigation}} by The Washington Post in 2010 faulted Pepco for poor reliability. The report {{noted that the}} company's performance had slipped since 2005, comparing poorly to other major utilities in the frequency and duration of power outages. Thousands of people lost power {{for as many as}} five days after only 5-8 inches of <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow.|$|R
50|$|The 2010 Colombian {{rainy season}} was an unusually <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> season that {{affected}} Colombia {{during the second}} semester of 2010. The continuous rainfalls in combination with unstable grounds and dwellings located in high risk zones contributed to the widespread damages.The flooding and associated landslides killed 174 persons, left 225 wounded and 19 others missing. 1.5 million were left homeless.|$|R
50|$|The same storms {{brought a}} {{blizzard}} of <b>heavy,</b> <b>wet</b> snow to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, notoriously stranding the train City of San Francisco on January 13. The greatest flooding in Northern California since the 1800s occurred in 1955 {{as a result of}} a series of Hawaiian storms, with the greatest damage in the Sacramento Valley around Yuba City.|$|R
50|$|The second race in 1989 {{almost did}} not happen because of an early nor'easter that {{deposited}} more than six inches of <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow on the course {{at the start of}} the race. Approximately 400 runners completed the race in near whiteout conditions. In 1990, apple pies were given out to all runners; a tradition that continues every year.|$|R
5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, {{also known}} as constructors, were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought four different tyre types to the race: one dry compound, the Soft and three wet-weather compounds, the Intermediate, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Wet</b> and the Soft wet tyres.|$|R
25|$|In lieu of {{traditional}} seasons, the Guinea-type climate affords alternating dry and wet periods. The year begins {{in a long}} dry season that lasts from December to May. This {{is followed by a}} light wet season from May to June and a short dry season from July to October. A <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> season begins around October and lasts through November.|$|R

50|$|On Saturday, October 29, 2011, Washingtonville {{was also}} ravaged by an {{unexpected}} early snow storm. Up to {{a foot of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow fell on the town. The major {{problem is that the}} leaves had not fallen off the trees yet, so limbs and branches had fallen blocking most roads including State Route 94. Over 90% of residents were left without power.|$|R
50|$|East Kimberley Regional Airport, {{commonly}} referred to as Kununurra Airport, is located 3.7 km (2.3 mi) west of the town centre. <b>Heavy</b> <b>wet</b> seasons often result in this area being cut off from essential outside services and deliveries. The airport is a crucial piece of infrastructure which enables people and goods to enter or leave from the region and especially supports tourism and economic development.|$|R
50|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} is around 1530 mm. Rain may fall in every {{season of the}} year. The city often experiences <b>heavy,</b> <b>wet</b> snowfall (snowfall of 30 cm/12 inches or more per single snowstorm is not uncommon) in the winter, but the snow cover usually does not last {{for more than a}} week. Kutaisi experiences powerful easterly winds in the summer which descend from the nearby mountains.|$|R
50|$|Laying a firehose up a {{stairwell}} takes time, {{and this}} time is saved by having fixed hose outlets already in place. There is also a tendency for <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> hoses to slide downward when placed on an incline (such as the incline seen in a stairwell), whereas standpipes do not move. The use of standpipes keeps stairwells clear and is safer for exiting occupants.|$|R
50|$|A snow boot {{is a type}} of boot, {{generally}} waterproof, or water-resistant. The boot, {{in almost}} all cases, has a high side, keeping snow from entering the boot, and a rubber sole, to keep water out. Because of their water-resistant material, snowboots are often used in wet, slushy, or muddy situations. This means not a half inch dusting of snow, of water, but quite deep, <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow, slush, or mud.|$|R
50|$|The CET (Central England Temperature) mean of -4.0 °C was of note on this day, due to {{it being}} the lowest November CET mean since -4.6 °C was {{recorded}} on 24 November 1904. The lowest {{temperature of the}} month was also recorded today, of -17.5 °C at Llysdinam, Wales. <b>Heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow affected Southern and Eastern Scotland widely giving 10-20 cm, but 20-30 cm in places. Thundersnow was reported around Dundee.|$|R
50|$|In March 2009, {{a similar}} {{incident}} occurred when <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow that fell overnight melted quickly during the day. With the outflows once again closed off, {{this time to}} prevent flow in from the Bow River that could occur from winter ice dams, the water flowing down from Rosedale quickly accumulated in Sunnyside. Several homes on 1 Ave NW between 5A Street NW and 6 Street NW experienced basement flooding.|$|R
5000|$|Washington D.C. {{received}} 5 to {{10 inches}} of <b>heavy,</b> <b>wet</b> snow. As many as 650,000 people lost {{power as a}} result of the blizzard. [...] Commutes across the region were difficult the afternoon of the storm, with many people spending four to eight hours in traffic on the way home; some, on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, were stuck for up to fourteen hours, and many abandoned their vehicles on the roadway.|$|R
50|$|In New York City, 20.9 in fell in Central Park, {{mixed with}} slushy {{accumulation}} due to above-freezing temperatures during the day. Falling tree branches {{due to the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow and strong winds resulted in one casualty in Central Park and created dangerous conditions on the streets. The New York City Sanitation Department deployed 1600 snow plow and 365 salt spraying trucks to keep traffic flowing smoothly on the highways and city streets of the five boroughs.|$|R
50|$|The {{plants have}} {{specialized}} roots for living in <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> soils. The scented, thick, white roots are adapted {{to live in}} environments low in oxygen. Blooming occurs in mid to late summer and after blooming long, relatively thin, rounded, pods are produced that grow uprightly. The pods split open in late summer to late fall, releasing seeds that are attached to silky hairs, which act as parachutes that carry the seeds on the currents of the wind.|$|R
5000|$|The Forest is {{situated}} in the western Weald. It lies in the Gault clay vale that separates the chalk ridge which runs between Farnham and Alton from the malmstone (Greensand) hills or [...] "hangers" [...] (from the Old English hangra, wood on a steep slope) around Binsted. It occupies a low plateau with steeply sloping edges where deposits of stony Pleistocene drift, the remnants of ancient pre-glacial river terrace of the [...] "Proto-Wey", overlie the <b>heavy,</b> <b>wet</b> Gault.|$|R

The airport is a crucial piece of infrastructure which enables people and goods to enter or leave from the region and especially supports tourism and economic development.|$|R
25|$|Cairns {{salvaged}} {{its economy}} after a <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> season in early 1882 closed {{the road from}} Port Douglas, resulting in calls for a railway from Herberton to the coast. Linking mining areas to ports by railway was already Queensland Government policy. In August 1877 the Queensland government had approved three railways to connect mining towns to their principal ports: Charters Towers to Townsville (Great Northern railway line); Mount Perry to Bundaberg (Mount Perry railway line); and Gympie to Maryborough (North Coast railway line).|$|R
25|$|The April or Spring Nor’easter of 2007 was a nor'easter that {{affected}} mainly the eastern parts of North America during its four-day course, from April 14 to April 17, 2007. The combined effects of high winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides led to flooding, storm damages, power outages, and evacuations, and disrupted traffic and commerce. In the north, <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> snow caused {{the loss of}} power for several thousands of homes in Ontario and Quebec. The storm caused at least 18 fatalities.|$|R
6000|$|Of course, also, we {{relieved}} the tedium of enforced indoor life by {{song and}} talk, but these resources {{could not make}} up for lost time, and the depth to which I had been sunk was revealed to me by the sudden rebound of joy when, after a week of <b>heavy</b> <b>wet,</b> there was a break in the universal grey and the sun came feebly out. Blessed sun, if thou wert to roast me alive, methinks I would love thee still! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} broke dull and grey with {{curtains}} of smoky fog and mist hanging to the hills; and the <b>heavy</b> <b>wet</b> made the paths greasy and slippery. Leaving Bellevue House, we {{walked along the}} whole length of the ridge in half an hour; and, descending the north-western slope, we struck the main thoroughfare--such as it is. Reaching the level, we found more 'women's washings,' and the highly auriferous ground looked as if made {{for the purpose of}} hydraulic mining.|$|R
