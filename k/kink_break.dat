Using this method, the existence of symmetric and non-symmetric wave solutions of the osmosis K(2, 2) equation is studied. Besides abundant symmetric forms such as smooth wave solutions, peaked waves, cusped waves, looped waves, stumpons and fractal-like waves, this equation also admits non-symmetric ones including <b>breaking</b> <b>kink</b> wave solutions, <b>breaking</b> anti-kink wave solutions and rampons. As regards this equation most of those solutions, either symmetric or non-symmetric solutions, have not appeared in the literature. We also study the limiting behavior of all periodic solutions as the parameters tend to some special values...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermal equilibrium properties of kinks in a classical φ 4 field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. The distribution function, kink density, and correlation function are determined from large scale simulations. A dilute gas description of kinks {{is shown to}} be valid below a characteristic temperature. A double Gaussian approximation to evaluate the eigenvalues of the transfer operator enables us to extend the theoretical analysis to higher temperatures where the dilute gas approximation fails. This approach accurately predicts the temperature at which the <b>kink</b> description <b>breaks</b> down. e-mail...|$|R
40|$|The {{fluctuations}} of 5 D self-gravitating non-abelian kinks which {{arise from}} {{the breaking of the}} SU(5) X Z 2 symmetric theory are analyzed within the context of brane-worlds. While tensor and vector sectors of these fluctuations behave like its counterparts in the standard abelian Z 2 kinks, the mixing between the field excitations of the non-abelian kink and the scalar components of the metric makes the pure scalar sector of the theory very interesting. The spectrum of these scalar fluctuations, which includes gravitationally trapped massless modes on the core of the wall associated to the broken symmetries, is discussed for the two classes of <b>kinks</b> that <b>break</b> SU(5) to its maximal subgroups.

500|$|In April 1969 Davies helped {{negotiate}} {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, {{which allowed}} plans for a North American tour. Davies went into a state of depression, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was [...] "sick of it all" [...] at a gig in White City Stadium. A review of the concert published in Melody Maker stated: [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'... He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset. Davies proceeded to try to announce that the <b>Kinks</b> were <b>breaking</b> up, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the plug on the microphone system.|$|R
40|$|The protein {{backbone}} {{is described as}} a smooth curved and twisted line in three-dimensional (3 D) space and characterized by its curvature κ(s) and torsion τ(s) both expressed as a function of arc length s. It is shown that the function τ(s) is sufficient to analyze the contributions of all amino acids to the conformation of the {{protein backbone}}. The characteristic peak and trough patterns of the τ(s) diagrams can be translated into a 16 -letter code, which provides a rapid identification of helices, strands, and turns, specifies entry and exit points of secondary structural units, and determines their regularity in terms of distortions, <b>kinks</b> or <b>breaks.</b> Via computer encoding, 3 D protein structure is projected into a 1 D string of conformational letters. The 3 D- 1 D-projection procedure represents an extension of the Automated Protein Structure Analysis (APSA) method. APSA has been applied to describe 155 super secondary structures from 94 proteins and to compare results with Efimov's classification system of super secondary structure.

40|$|Self-organized Bi {{lines that}} are only 1. 5 nm wide can be grown without <b>kinks</b> or <b>breaks</b> on Si(0 0 1) {{surfaces}} to lengths of up to 500 nm. Constant-current topographical images of the lines, obtained with the scanning tunneling microscope, have a striking bias dependence. Although the lines appear darker than the Si terraces at biases below ≈∣ 1. 2 ∣ V, the contrast reverses at biases above ≈∣ 1. 5 ∣ V. Between these two ranges the lines and terraces are of comparable brightness. It {{has been suggested that}} this bias dependence {{may be due to the}} presence of a semiconductor-like energy gap within the line. Using ab initio calculations it is demonstrated that the energy gap is too small to explain the experimentally observed bias dependence. Consequently, at this time, there is no compelling explanation for this phenomenon. An alternative explanation is proposed that arises naturally from calculations of the tunneling current, using the Tersoff–Hamann approximation, and an examination of the electronic structure of the line...|$|R
40|$|We use angle-resolved photoemission {{spectroscopy}} {{to image}} {{the emergence of}} substantial dispersion and spectral-weight anomalies in the electronic renormalization of the actinide compound UCoGa_{ 5 } that was presumed {{to belong to a}} conventional Fermi-liquid family. <b>Kinks</b> or abrupt <b>breaks</b> in the slope of the quasiparticle dispersion are detected both at low (approximately 130  meV) and high (approximately 1  eV) binding energies below the Fermi energy, ruling out any significant contribution of phonons.

It is composed of tandem, antiparallel coiled-coil repeats. We report four related crystal structures at 1. 45 Å, 2. 0 Å, 3. 1 Å, and 4. 0 Å resolution of two connected repeats of chicken brain α-spectrin. In all of the structures, the linker region between adjacent units is α-helical without <b>breaks,</b> <b>kinks,</b> or obvious boundaries. Two features observed in the structures are (1) conformational rearrangement in one repeat, resulting in movement of the position of a loop, and (2) varying degrees of bending at the linker region. These features form the basis of two different models of flexibility: a conformational rearrangement and a bending model. These models provide novel atomic details of spectrin flexibility...|$|R

40|$|There are N- 1 {{classes of}} kink {{solutions}} in SU(N) × Z_ 2. We show how interactions between various kinks {{depend on the}} classes of individual kinks {{as well as on}} their orientations with respect {{to each other in the}} internal space. In particular, we find that the attractive or repulsive nature of the interaction depends on the trace of the product of charges of the two kinks. We calculate the interaction potential for all combinations of kinks and antikinks in SU(5) × Z_ 2 and study their collisions. The outcome of kink-antikink collisions, as expected from previous studies, is sensitive to their initial relative velocity. We find that heavier <b>kinks</b> tend to <b>break</b> up into lighter ones, while interactions between the lightest kinks and antikinks in this model can be repulsive as well as attractive.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ three recent {{analytical}} approaches to investigate sev-eral classes of traveling wave solutions {{of the so-called}} extended-reduced Ostrovsky Equation (exROE). A recent extension of phase-plane analysis is first employed to show the existence of <b>breaking</b> <b>kink</b> wave solutions and smooth periodic wave (compacton) solutions. Next, smooth traveling waves are derived using a recent technique to derive convergent multi-infinite series solutions for the homoclinic or-bits of the traveling-wave equations for the exROE equation. These correspond to pulse solutions respectively of the original PDEs. We perform many numerical tests in different parameter regime to pinpoint real saddle equilibrium points of the corre-sponding traveling-wave equations, as well as ensure simultaneous convergence and continuity of the multi-infinite series solutions for the homoclinic orbits anchored by these saddle points. Unlike the majority of unaccelerated convergent series, high accuracy is attained with relatively few terms. And finally, variational methods are employed to generate families of both regular and embedded solitary wave solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{platelet}} marginal band {{consists of}} a single peripheral microtubule (MT) that is wound in 8 to 12 coils and maintains discoid cell shape. About 90 % of -tubu-lin in the marginal band is of the diver-gent, megakaryocyte (MK) /platelet-restricted 1 isoform. 1 -tubulin–null mice show reduced proplatelet forma-tion, thrombocytopenia, and platelet spherocytosis. Here, we show that struc-tural abnormalities in resting 1 -tubu-lin/ platelets include frequent <b>kinks</b> and <b>breaks</b> in the marginal band. Platelets derived from mice lacking the transcrip-tion factor GATA 1 show similar defects, probably as {{a direct consequence of}} ab-sent 1 -tubulin. 1 -tubulin/ platelets have normal ratios of -tubulin isotypes but the marginal band is half the normal thickness, which is sufficient to maintain elliptical cell shape. Thus, a threshold 50 % or less of the normal amount of 1 -tubulin is required to preserve mar-ginal band integrity and cell shape. 1 -tubulin/ platelets have normal size and contents and show no defects in seroto-nin release or aggregation. Accordingly, the apparently isolated spherocytosis al-lows investigation of the role of discoid platelet shape in hemostasis. On agonist stimulation, the disorganized MTs in 1 -tubulin/ platelets fail to condense into central rings and instead are dispersed in short bundles and linear arrays. Neverthe-less, intravital microscopy and flow cham-ber studies demonstrate full functionality of these spherocytic platelets under physiologic shear conditions. Together, these findings highlight the essential re-quirements of the MK/platelet-restricted 1 -tubulin isoform in platelet structure and suggest that spherocytosis does not impair many aspects of platelet function...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermal equilibrium properties of kinks in a classical ^ 4 field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. From large scale Langevin simulations we identify the temperature below which a dilute gas description of kinks is valid. The standard dilute gas/WKB description {{is shown to}} be remarkably accurate below this temperature. At higher, "intermediate" temperatures, where kinks still exist, this description breaks down. By introducing a double Gaussian variational ansatz for the eigenfunctions of the statistical transfer operator for the system, {{we are able to}} study this region analytically. In particular, our predictions for the number of kinks and the correlation length are in agreement with the simulations. The double Gaussian prediction for the characteristic temperature at which the <b>kink</b> description ultimately <b>breaks</b> down is also in accord with the simulations. We also analytically calculate the internal energy and demonstrate that the peak in the specific heat near the kink characteristic temperature is indeed due to kinks. In the neighborhood of this temperature there appears to be an intricate energy sharing mechanism operating between nonlinear phonons and kinks.

[...] In the example he used a LTI Criterion 400 Laser Survey instrument to map the tree canopies. It is essentially a device that includes a laser-rangefinder, clinometer, and a compass. The LTI Criterion 400 uses an infrared semi-conductor laser diode for slope distance measurement. A vertical tilt-sensing encoder provides vertical inclination, while a fluxgate electronic compass measures magnetic azimuth, completing the data required to establish a point’s three-dimensional location in space. It is used to map the position of every branch point in the canopy down to a certain size and also the positions of various reiterations, <b>breaks,</b> <b>kinks,</b> or any other eccentricities in the tree. This is usually done from a set position or a series of positions within the tree. Sketches and photographs are used to facilitate the process. Trees were climbed and the architecture mapped in accordance with criterion previously established. This involves mapping {{the location of the}} main stem and all reiterated trunks, in addition to all branches that originate from trunks. Each mapped trunk and branch was measured for basal diameter, length, azimuth, Climbers measure specific circumferences and detail other features within the tree. In addition a footprint map of the base of the tree is made to calculate the exact volume of the basal section of the tree. The data is processed in Excel to generate a volume calculation. Graphing functions can be used to create a 3-dimensional figure of the tree data. Dr. Van Pelt also uses an Excel macro to rotate the image {{so that it can be}} viewed from different angles. In the cases of the Middleton Live Oak and Sag Branch Tulip each of the trees were mapped from a single set station from within the canopy of each tree.|$|R
