5|$|During {{this time}} of great {{creativity}} for the British musical scene {{in the summer of}} 1967, Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band The Searchers, contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> together, to be called Roundabout. The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners, Ron Hire and John Coletta, and the three of them founded Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises.|$|E

5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve his}} wife's estate, Fownes Luttrell {{obtained}} a sanction from the Court of Chancery {{to sell the}} manors of Heathfield and Kilton, but found no buyers; he subsequently attempted to sell the manor of Minehead, and also offered {{at least one of}} the Parliamentary seats for the Borough of Minehead for £30,000, but there were no serious bidders, largely due to the high prices and the fact that Fownes Luttrell had in fact not inherited much control over the seats <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> up for sale. However, frugal spending helped to recover the estate and Fownes Luttrell invested in 1760 in the manor of Foremarsh, near Dunster, which he purchased from John Poyntz. He went on to buy the manor of Staunton Fry in 1777 and a number of tenements in Dunster. In leisure, he particularly enjoyed hunting, keeping hounds and horses, and cockfighting.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Zito Switched his Uniform Number to 75 (which {{he would}} wear {{throughout}} the rest of his career) finished third in the American League (AL) in strikeouts per nine innings (8.61), fourth in strikeouts (205), sixth in wins (17), eighth in ERA (3.49), and tenth in winning percentage (.680). Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 or younger since 1902 to strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, Zito struggled through {{the early part of the}} 2001 season, posting a 6–7 record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely and by August, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball.|$|E

5|$|In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court, {{the wealthy}} Australian {{investor}} who owned ATV Music Publishing, announced <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> the ATV catalog up for sale. In 1981, McCartney {{was offered the}} ATV music catalog for £20 million ($40 million). According to McCartney, he contacted Yoko Ono about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost at £10 million each, but Ono thought they could buy it for £5 million each. When {{they were unable to}} make a joint purchase, McCartney, {{who did not want to}} be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, did not pursue an offer on his own. According to a negotiator for Holmes à Court in the 1984 sale, McCartney was given first right of refusal and declined to purchase. Jackson was informed of the sale by his attorney, John Branca, in September 1984. An attorney for McCartney also assured Branca that McCartney was not interested in bidding. McCartney reportedly felt it was too expensive, but several other companies and investors were interested in bidding. Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984. His agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate. In May 1985, Jackson's team left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations. In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million; however, in early August, Holmes à Court's team contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million, which was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music. Jackson also agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Jackson's purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.|$|E

25|$|Dyer ran unsuccessfully {{for reelection}} in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the Great Depression. Black voters had been {{disappointed}} that the Republicans had failed to deliver on their promise to pass an anti-lynching law, {{part of the national}} platform in 1920, and by President Hoover's approach to dealing with economic problems. The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> people to work through the Works Progress Administration and providing social aid programs.|$|E
25|$|Cecan's status {{improved}} {{with the union}} of Bessarabia with Romania, following which he was reinstated a Protoiereus of the Romanian Orthodox Church. He returned to his Nișcani parish, where he built a church, and continued to involve himself in political and religious disputes. By 1925–1926, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> out the magazine Unirea (or Yedineniye), which was a continuation of Obyedineniye. Here and in his propaganda brochures, Cecan took a strongly anti-communist and anti-Soviet position, describing communism as being intertwined with Pan-Slavism and Russian Orthodoxy. He looked into ways of emancipating Romanian Orthodoxy from its Slavic counterparts, looking into the precedent set by the Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic.|$|E

25|$|The Khalkha nobles' {{power was}} {{deliberately}} undermined by Qianlong, when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal {{family of the}} eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba, instead of the Khalkha Mongol which {{they wanted to be}} appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles, and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor. Nevertheless, Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols.|$|E

[...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in {{the feel of the}} album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Noting {{that these}} Elders {{themselves}} had very different opinions on Gardnerian Wicca, he {{also stated that}} the Elders ceased providing him with new information in the early 1980s. He stated that these various Elders had chosen him to disseminate the information {{because he had been}} involved in both hereditary witchcraft and Gardnerian Wicca and because he was based in New Zealand, thereby making it hard for anyone to trace their identities. Despite Liddell claiming that the material <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> forward came from various sources, the historian Ronald Hutton noted that it was all presented in a [...] "single, dogmatic, authorial voice", with no indication of where the different pieces of information came from. Hutton also asserted that Liddell's changing claims would be entirely consistent with a single individual making up stories and changing them as they went along.|$|E
500|$|On July 6, Philando Castile was {{fatally shot}} by Jeronimo Yanez, a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer, after being pulled over in Falcon Heights, {{a suburb of}} St. Paul. Castile was driving a car with his girlfriend and her 4-year-old {{daughter}} as passengers when he was pulled over by Yanez and another officer. According to his girlfriend, after being asked for his license and registration, Castile told the officer he was licensed to carry a weapon and had one in the car. She stated: [...] "The officer said don't move. As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> his hands back up, the officer {{shot him in the}} arm four or five times."
