2500|$|In {{his memoir}} Songs <b>I</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> Sing, Charlton H. Lyons, Jr., of Shreveport recalls his father's {{recollection}} of the tranquil life in Melville: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{turn the}} pages, {{and she was}} some time silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know there}} isn't, because <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> asking about it," [...] added Ben. [...] "But I {{think we ought}} to get him down to the bungalows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Almayer, vivaciously, [...] "you cannot {{imagine what}} is before you. I myself {{have not been}} to Europe, but <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> talk so often that I seem to know all about it. We shall live a--a glorious life. You shall see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{beautiful}} Lady Alice," [...] replied Clayton, [...] "of whose many {{virtues and}} remarkable personal charms <b>I</b> often have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father speak. Poor woman," [...] he murmured sadly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since I saw you I've heard {{everything}} about the past. I won't tell it you--I think you knew when we met at June's. She says you did. If you did, Fleur, {{you ought to have}} told me. I expect you only heard your father's side of it. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b> It's dreadful. Now that she's so sad I can't do anything to hurt her more. Of course, I long for you all day, but I don't believe now that we shall ever come together--there's something too strong pulling us apart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{less the}} family {{interfered}} the better," [...] said Lord Marney; [...] "and for my part, I {{was very much}} alarmed when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had gone down." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were silent}} for some time. After a while, a rather long while, she came upstairs and found mother—and {{at the end}} of some minutes <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> go to him.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{summer day}} that dawned held Claremore as a possibility. And such was my {{capacity}} for joy that my appetite would depart completely when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say, questioningly and with proper wifely respect-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} on the 8th of December, 1394, and shall be {{therefore}} seventeen in a fortnight's time. I was born {{a few minutes after}} midnight, for <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say that the castle bell had sounded but a few minutes before I was born. She said that she had been anxious about it, because an old woman had predicted that if she ever had a child born on the 7th day of the month, it would be in every way unfortunate; so <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was greatly pleased that I had escaped the consequences predicted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{could be}} done till <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was gone and my uncle returned. The {{delirium}} was on me, and whatever I tried to say turned to raving, all the worse if <b>I</b> saw or <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> till Dr. Sandys forbade her coming near me. She was invited to the Queen's Sunday card party moreover, so she fortunately quitted Bowstead just before Mr. Belamour's return." ...|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth Danvers, his mother, an Italian, prodigeous {{parts for}} a Woman. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> father’s <b>mother</b> {{say that she}} had Chaucer at her fingers' ends. A great Politician; great Witt and spirit, but revengeful: knew how to manage her estate {{as well as any}} man; {{understood}} Jewels as well as any Jeweller. Very Beautiful, but only short-sighted. To obtain Pardons for her Sonnes she maryed Sir Edmund Carey, cosen-german to Queen Elizabeth, but kept him to hard meate.|$|R
60|$|One {{night as}} I lay buried in deep sleep {{close to the}} garret eaves <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> call me--and {{something}} in her voice pierced me, roused me. A poignant note of alarm was in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Methinks, {{a moment}} gone, [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> pray! [...] I heard, sir knight, the prayer for me [...] Wherein she passed away; [...] And I know the heavens are leaning down [...] To hear what I shall say." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{played there}} were no deeper seas, [...] Nor any wider plains than these, [...] Nor other kings than me. [...] At last <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> call [...] Out from the house at evenfall, [...] To call me home to tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prut!" [...] said she, [...] "and is that so! Why, I {{thought that}} thou wert a great tall fellow at least, and here thou art {{a little boy}} no older than Carl Max, the gooseherd." [...] Then, after a little pause--"My name is Pauline, and my father is the Baron. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him tell <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> all about thee, and so I wanted {{to come here and}} see thee myself: Art thou sick?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{say that}} {{this was one of the}} darkest moments of her life and if you think about it you will {{understand}} the reason why. My sister was only five years old, I was three and Frank was a babe in the cradle. Broken hearted at the thought of the long separation, and scared by visions of battle <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> begged the soldier not to go; but he was of the stern stuff which makes patriots--and besides his name was already on the roll, therefore he went away to join Grant's army at Vicksburg. [...] "What sacrifice! What folly!" [...] said his pacifist neighbors--"to leave your wife and children for an idea, a mere sentiment; to put your life in peril for a striped silken rag." [...] But he went. For thirteen dollars a month he marched and fought while his plow rusted in the shed and his cattle called to him from their stalls.|$|R
6000|$|What I do remember, is <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{reading to}} me Miss Edgeworth's Frank {{and the little}} do Trusty, as I lay in my crib in her bedroom. [...] I made one of my nieces hunt up the book for me the other day, and the story brought back at once the little crib, or the watered blue moreen canopy of the big four-poster to which I was {{sometimes}} lifted for a change; even the scrawly pattern of the paper, which my weary eyes made into purple elves perpetually pursuing crimson ones, the foremost of whom always turned upside down; and the knobs in the Marseilles counterpane with which my fingers used to toy. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> tell that whenever I was most languid and suffering I used to whine out, 'O do read Frank and the little dog Trusty,' and never permitted a single word to be varied, in the curious childish love of reiteration with its soothing power.|$|R
60|$|That was my name, Jesse. I did {{not know}} my surname, though <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> call my father John. I have a dim {{recollection}} of hearing, {{at one time or}} another, the other men address my father as Captain. I knew that he was the leader of this company, and that his orders were obeyed by all.|$|E
60|$|My next {{bout with}} John Barleycorn {{occurred}} when I was seven. This time my imagination was at fault, and I was frightened into the encounter. Still farming, {{my family had}} moved to a ranch on the bleak sad coast of San Mateo County, south of San Francisco. It was a wild, primitive countryside in those days; and often <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> pride herself that we were old American stock and not immigrant Irish and Italians like our neighbours. In all our section {{there was only one}} other old American family.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems all confused," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I don't even {{remember}} going out of the house. I can remember his striking {{me in the face}} again and again, and then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> scream, and everything seems to have become misty. But I know I was walking about; I know that I was worrying to get at him, and that if I had met him I should have attacked him, and if I had had anything in my hand I should have killed him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Bill, but as <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say, {{it would}} be very hard to {{understand}} if this world were the only one; but you see we are only here a little time, and after that there's on and on and on, right up without any end, and what does it matter if we are poor or unhappy in this little time {{if we are going to}} be ever so happy afterwards? This is only a sort of little trial to see how we behave, as it were, and if we do the best we can, even though that best is very little, then you see we get a tremendous reward. For instance, you would not think a man was unkind who kept you five minutes holding his horse on a cold day, if he were going to give you enough to get you clothes and good lodging for the rest of your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell her {{the simple}} truth," [...] added Sigismund, 'it cannot long be concealed, and it were better {{that she knew}} it; but tell her, also, my firm {{dependence}} on our father's innocence. God, {{for one of those}} inscrutable purposes which set human intelligence at defiance, has made him a common executioner, but the curse has not extended to his nature. Trust me, dearest Adelheid, a more gentle dove-like nature does not exist in man than that of the poor Balthazar--the despised and persecuted Balthazar. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> dwell upon the nights of anguish and suffering that have preceded the day on which the duties of his office were to be discharged; and often have <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that admirable woman, whose spirit is far more equal to support our unmerited fortunes, declare she has often prayed that he and all that are hers might die, so that they died innocently, rather than one of a temper so gentle and harmless should again be brought to endure the agony she had witnessed!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I often {{saw that}} tray, after I was the innocently smiling cause (or more likely {{screeching}} one) of the doctor's standing {{it up on}} a table against the wall in his consulting-room. Whenever my own father and mother were {{in that part of}} the country, I used to put <b>my</b> head (<b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mother</b> say it was flaxen curls at that time, though you wouldn't know an old hearth-broom from it now till you come to the handle, and found it wasn't me) in at the doctor's door, and the doctor was always glad to see me, and said, [...] "Aha, my brother practitioner! Come in, little M.D. How are your inclinations as to sixpence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But think! There {{may never}} come another hour like this. Know, know now, {{that you have}} made me happy. I can never be so alone again. I share my secretest thoughts--my imagination, with you; isn't that a kind of love? I assure you that it is. Once <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> talking, and {{sometimes}} I have wondered myself, if I am quite like--oh, {{you know what they}} say: a freak of Nature. Tell me; if by some enchantment I were really and indeed come from those snow mountains of yours, and that sea, would you recognize me? Would you? No, no; it's only a story--why, even all this green and loveliness is only skin deep. If the Old World were just to shrug its shoulders, Mr Anon, we should all, big and little, be clean gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} very remarkable, Frances. We {{all of us}} {{sometimes}} see our dear lost ones in sleep. I saw my mother again, as I used {{to see her in}} the nursery at bedtime--tall and beautiful, with her long dark hair failing over her white dressing-gown to the waist. She stooped over me, and kissed me; and she looked surprised. She said, 'My little angel, why are you here in a strange house? I have come to take you back to your own cot, by my bedside.' I wasn't surprised or frightened; I put my arms round her neck; and we floated away together through the cool starry night; and we were at home again. I saw my cot, with its pretty white curtains and pink ribbons. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> tell me an English fairy story, out of a book which my father had given to her--and her kind voice grew fainter and fainter, while I grew more and more sleepy--and it ended softly, just as it used to end in the happy old days. And I woke, crying. Do you ever dream of your mother now?" ...|$|E

6000|$|When the parting {{moment was}} over, and when Mr. Welwyn, unable {{to bear the}} shock of being present {{in the house of}} death {{at the time of his}} wife's funeral, left home and went to stay with one of his {{relations}} in a distant part of England, Ida, whom it had been his wish to take away with him, petitioned earnestly to be left behind. [...] "I promised mamma before she died that I would be as good to my little sister Rosamond as she had been to me," [...] said the child, simply; [...] "and she told me in return that I might wait here and see her laid in her grave." [...] There happened to be an aunt of Mrs. Welwyn, and an old servant of the family, in the house at this time, who understood Ida much better than her father did, and they persuaded him not to take her away. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say that the effect of the child's appearance at the funeral on her, and on all who went to see it, was something that she could never think of without the tears coming into her eyes, and could never forget to the last day of her life.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{although}} I {{had been}} eager to see Black Matt kill Tom Morrisey that morning, I did not care to furnish to the dancers the spectacle of a knife sticking in my back. I had not yet learned to distinguish between facts and theories. My faith was implicit in <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> exposition of the Italian character. Besides, I had some glimmering inkling of the sacredness of hospitality. Here was a treacherous, sensitive, murderous Italian, offering me hospitality. I had been taught {{to believe that if}} I offended him he would strike at me with a knife precisely as a horse kicked out when one got too close to its heels and worried it. Then, too, this Italian, Peter, had those terrible black eyes <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> talk about. They were eyes different from the eyes I knew, from the blues and greys and hazels of my own family, from the pale and genial blues of the Irish. Perhaps Peter had had a few drinks. At any rate, his eyes were brilliantly black and sparkling with devilry. They were the mysterious, the unknown, and who was I, a seven-year-old, to analyse them and know their prankishness? In them I visioned sudden death, and I declined the wine half-heartedly. The expression in his eyes changed. They grew stern and imperious as he shoved the tumbler of wine closer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh seek not {{to dissuade}} me, Pierre. Wouldst thou slay me, and slay me {{a million times}} more? and never have done with murdering me? I must come! I must come! God himself can not stay me, for it is He that {{commands}} me.--I know all that will follow my flight to thee;--my amazed <b>mother,</b> <b>my</b> enraged brothers, the whole taunting and despising world.--But thou art <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>my</b> brothers, and all the world, and all heaven, and all the universe to me--thou art my Pierre. One only being does this soul in me serve--and that is thee, Pierre.--So I am coming to thee, Pierre, and quickly;--to-morrow it shall be, and never more will I quit thee, Pierre. Speak thou immediately to her about me; thou shalt know best what to say. Is there not some connection between our families, Pierre? <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> sometimes trace such a thing out,--some indirect cousinship. If thou approvest then, thou shalt say to her, I am thy cousin, Pierre;--thy resolved and immovable nun-like cousin; vowed to dwell with thee forever; to serve thee and her, to guard thee and her without end. Prepare some little corner for me somewhere; but let it be very near. Ere I come, I shall send a few little things,--the tools I shall work by, Pierre, and so contribute {{to the welfare of}} all. Look for me then. I am coming! I am coming, my Pierre; for a deep, deep voice assures me, that all noble as thou art, Pierre, some terrible jeopardy involves thee, which my continual presence only can drive away. I am coming! I am coming!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Because {{there is}} no {{inscription}} on the grave she sets out to discover whose it might be. After asking several locals and searching maps and guidebooks without success, she eventually finds that [...] "Granny Caunter" [...] knows the story: [...] "Yes, miss, it be a grave sure 'nough," ... J's grave 'tis called. No, I can't tell 'ee how 'tis spelt for I never couldn't spell. Mary Jay was the poor maid's name. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> tell of it, when I was a li'l maid. It happened when her was a li'l maid herself. Her could just mind hearing tell of it." ... "'Tis a suicide's grave, miss." ... "Her was an orphan from the workhouse, 'prenticed to Barracott Farm between Manaton and Heatree. One day, when her was quite young, her tooked a rope {{and went to the}} barn there on the Manaton Road, and hanged herself from a beam. Her was quite dead when the farmer found her." ... "Us reckoned 'twas the same old story, miss—a young man, who wadn't no gude to her, poor maid." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the porch}} of the house at Satanstoe stood my dear {{grandmother}} and the notable Tom Bayard, to receive us. The first glance at the latter {{told me that he was}} a [...] "proper man;" [...] and by the second, I got the pleasing assurance that he had no eye, just then, but for Kate. This was pleasant to know, as I never could have been happy in consenting to yield that dear girl to any but a man who appreciated her worth, and fully admired her beauty. As to my dear [...] "ole, ole" [...] grandmother, who was not so very old neither, being still under seventy, her reception of us was just what I had ever found it; warm, affectionate, and gentle. She called my father, the general, Corny, even when she spoke to him in a room full of company; though, for that matter, <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> who was much more of a woman of the world, having lived a great deal in society, do the same thing, when she thought herself alone. I have read some priggish book or other, written no doubt by one who knew men only through pages like his own, decry such familiarities; but I have generally found those the happiest families, and at the bottom, the best toned, where it was Jack, and Tom, and Bob, and Dick, and Bess, and Di. As for your Louisa Adelinas, and Robert Augustuses, and all such elaborate respect, I frankly declare I have a contempt for it. Those are the sort of people who would call Satanstoe, Dibbleton; Hellgate, Hurlgate; and themselves accomplished. Thank heaven, we had no such nonsense at Lilacsbush, or at the Neck. My father was Corny; <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> Anneke; Katrinke, Kate; and I was Mordy, or Mord; or, when there was no hurry, Mordaunt.|$|R
60|$|For the {{conversion}} of my father I have to thank <b>my</b> dear <b>mother,</b> Miss Bell Brady, daughter of Ulysses Brady of Castle Brady, county Kerry, Esquire and J.P. She {{was the most beautiful}} woman of her day in Dublin, and universally called the Dasher there. Seeing her at the assembly, my father became passionately attached to her; but her soul was above marrying a Papist or an attorney's clerk; and so, for the love of her, the good old laws being then in force, my dear father slipped into my uncle Cornelius's shoes and took the family estate. Besides the force of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> bright eyes, several persons, and of the genteelest society too, contributed to this happy change; and <b>I</b> have often <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> laughingly tell the story of my father's recantation, which was solemnly pronounced at the tavern in the company of Sir Dick Ringwood, Lord Bagwig, Captain Punter, and two or three other young sparks of the town. Roaring Harry won 300 pieces that very night at faro, and laid the necessary information the next morning against his brother; but his conversion caused a coolness between him and my uncle Corney, who joined the rebels in consequence.|$|R
6000|$|Amelius {{answered}} rather sadly, {{with his}} eyes bent on the deck. [...] "I remember something happening which threw a gloom over us at home in England. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was concerned in it. When I grew older, I never presumed to ask my father what it was; and he never offered to tell me. I only know this: that he forgave her some wrong she had done him, and let her go on living at home--and that relations and friends all blamed him, and fell away from him, from that time. Not long afterwards, while I was at school, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died. I was sent for, to follow her funeral with my father. When we got back, and were alone together, he took me on his knee and kissed me. 'Which will you do, Amelius,' he said; 'stay in England with your uncle and aunt? or come with {{me all the way}} to America, and never go back to England again? Take time to think of it.' I wanted no time to think of it; I said, 'Go with you, papa.' He frightened me by bursting out crying; {{it was the first time}} I had ever seen him in tears. I can understand it now. He had been cut to the heart, and had borne it like a martyr; and his boy was his one friend left. Well, by the end of the week we were on board the ship; and there we met a benevolent gentleman, with a long gray beard, who bade my father welcome, and presented me with a cake. In my ignorance, I thought he was the captain. Nothing of the sort. He was the first Socialist I had ever seen; and it was he who had persuaded my father to leave England." ...|$|R
