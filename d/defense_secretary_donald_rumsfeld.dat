5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that <b>Defense</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E

Previously, he commanded the 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division from 1991-1993, served as the operations officer/G3 of the 3rd Infantry Division from 1994-1995, and commanded the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division from 1995 to 1997, during which time the brigade was deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina {{as one of the}} two US brigades during the IFOR mission to implement the terms of the Dayton Peace Accords from December 1995 through November 1996.

500|$|On June 26, {{two days}} before the summit, US Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns and US Ambassador to Russia Alexander Vershbow wrote a joint {{newspaper}} article in which they commented that the relations between NATO and Russia were good and that NATO and Russia took [...] "a little-noticed but enormous step in our maturing partnership", referring to [...] "Exercise Kaliningrad 2004" [...] which brought together some 1,000 personnel from 22 NATO member and partner countries for a terrorism response exercise. In practice, several rifts between Russia and NATO were visible and became increasingly more so during the summit. One rift existed about NATO's non-ratification of the adapted CFE treaty and Russia's non-fulfillment of its OSCE obligations (the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova and Georgia). Even before the summit commenced, the rift was visible as US <b>Defense</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> stopped, en route to Istanbul, in Moldova where he called for the withdrawal of Russian forces from the country. Another reason for tension was the accession of seven Eastern European states to NATO in March 2004 and NATO's increasing cooperation with other Eastern European and Caucasian states. On June 27, Russia warned NATO to respect its security interests and expressed concern over NATO's stepped up activity in the Caucasus and Central Asia.|$|E

40|$|The Baltimore SunThe United States is {{conducting}} what President Bush has {{described as a}} preventive war to eliminate Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalOn September 11, 2001, terrorists used {{commercial}} airliners {{as weapons}} of terror inside the United States, and America's approach to security was forever changed. While commercial airliners were {{the weapons of}} choice on that day, the 9 / 11 Commission recognized that Al Qaeda and other groups had, prior {{to the use of}} airlines, used suicide vehicles, namely, truck bombs, to commit terrorist acts. The threat from hazmat trucks continues today. There {{can be no doubt that}} terrorists are interested in using hazmat trucks as weapons within the borders of the United States. In 2004, <b>Defense</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>Donald</b> <b>Rumsfeld's</b> visit to Iraq was punctuated by a fuel-truck attack that burned a section of Baghdad. More recently, terrorists in Iraq have used chlorine-based truck bombs repeatedly as a weapon in the Iraq war. The Department of Transportation (DOT) recognizes that hazmat trucks are "dangerous and ready-made weapons" and are "especially attractive" to terrorists. Stephen Gale, a University of Pennsylvania professor and terrorism expert, agrees that hazmat trucks are essentially ready-made bombs that are "tailor-made" for terrorists to conduct an attack at the lowest cost and with the greatest impact. In fact, terrorism experts consider trucks to be one of the best tools a terrorist can use to breach security measures and carry explosives since the U. S. airline industry significantly increased security procedures. The ability of the government to secure every hazardous materials motor carrier against terrorist attack is severely limited, yet the potential that hazardous materials trucks will be used in terrorist attacks is great. Therefore, it is important to consider whether the security of hazardous materials motor carriers can be improved voluntarily and quickly by realigning existing resources and instituting a plan that leverages market forces and other incentives. This thesis introduces a unique voluntary incentive-based program, Security Through Assessed Risk (STAR) that can be used to increase security for a vast number of presently under protected hazardous materials motor carriers. It explains how TSA can leverage existing resources as well as successful ideas from both private sector and governmental programs to rapidly and significantly enhance the security of hazardous materials motor carriers.
