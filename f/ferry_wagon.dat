5000|$|In the 1920s, wagons with {{interchangeable}} parts, the Austauschbauart wagons, {{were developed}} for the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG). They had similar overall dimensions, but were clearly built to a different design from their forebears. Once again there was a covered wagon with 21.3 m² loading area, classed as the Gr Kassel and a large-volume wagon with 29.4 m² loading area, called the Gl Dresden. In addition, the Austauschbau series saw two new wagon classes being developed. The Glt Dresden was largely similar in design to the [...] "standard" [...] Gl Dresden, but had end doors. These vans were bought to provide sheltered transport for motor vehicles. A second, newer type of wagon was the <b>ferry</b> <b>wagon</b> developed during the 1920s for rail ferry services to Great Britain. This wagon had the same length over buffers as the Gl Dresden, but a loading area of only 22.4 m², because of its narrower wagon body constrained by the smaller loading gauge of British railways. This was designated as the Gfh Trier.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ferry</b> <b>wagons</b> {{with smaller}} loading gauges for traffic {{travelling}} to Great Britain, which were designated {{with a lower}} case letter f.|$|R
50|$|The type of unit {{passing through}} the {{marshalling}} yard changed {{towards the end of}} the century as container or freightliner flats and car flats replaced <b>ferry</b> <b>wagons.</b> The boat trains also declined as passenger trends changed and today there are no dedicated boat trains except for specials servicing cruise vessels.|$|R
50|$|Covered {{goods wagons}} {{designed}} for goods services to Great Britain have {{to comply with}} the smaller loading gauge in the United Kingdom and therefore had less loading volume than the equivalent wagon for services on continental Europe. The wagons with individual sliding doors have also been replaced by modern sliding wall wagons. In Germany these vehicles were formerly designated as <b>ferry</b> <b>wagons</b> (Fährbootwagen).|$|R
50|$|After 2006, most railway <b>wagon</b> <b>ferry</b> {{services}} ceased operating, and {{the rail}} tracks at the jetties saw little use. In 2012, Rift Valley Railways restarted {{operation of the}} rail <b>wagon</b> <b>ferry</b> service between Port Bell and Mwanza using the refurbished MV Kaawa.|$|R
50|$|In 1807 {{and again}} in 1808 a railway or {{tramroad}} connection was proposed, {{and at the end}} of 1808 a <b>wagon</b> <b>ferry</b> at Redbrook was suggested.|$|R
50|$|An early roll-on/roll-off {{service was}} a train ferry, started in 1833 by the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway, which {{operated}} a <b>wagon</b> <b>ferry</b> on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|There were 25 marine vessels under Mechanical Department {{at the end}} of 2004-2005. The {{fleet of}} the marine vessels {{consists}} of 2 Passenger vessels, 4 Tugs, 4 <b>Wagon</b> <b>Ferry</b> Barges, 5 Pontoon ramps, 5 Flats and 5 Berthing flats.|$|R
50|$|The Interislander {{operates}} three {{roll-on roll-off}} ferries: Aratere, Kaiarahi and Kaitaki. Aratere is a rail <b>ferry,</b> carrying rail <b>wagons</b> {{on the lower}} vehicle deck and road vehicles on the upper vehicle deck. Kaitaki and Kaiarahi do not have rail capacity, and carry road vehicles across two decks.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} preceded by the Bingerbrück-Rüdesheim train ferry, opened in November 1861, making the first {{connection}} between the Nassau Rhine Railway of the Nassau State Railway (Nassauische Staatsbahn) and the Nahe Valley Railway of the Rhine-Nahe Railway Company (Rhein-Nahe-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). This created a freight connection between the Rhine-Main and Saar areas and opened a new market for Saar coal. The freight <b>ferry</b> carried <b>wagons</b> until 1900. The passenger ferry was operated by Prussian State Railways until July 1907. After that passengers {{were able to use}} the tram to Bingen and the Bingen-Rüdesheim ferry.|$|R
50|$|The Bingerbrück-Rüdesheim {{train ferry}} was opened between Rudesheim and Bingen in 1862, {{connecting}} {{the line to}} the Rhine-Nahe Railway Company’s (Rhein-Nahe-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) Nahe Valley Railway. This created a freight connection between the Rhine-Main and Saar areas and opened a new market for Saar coal. The <b>ferry</b> carried freight <b>wagons</b> until 1900.|$|R
5000|$|Council Bluffs {{is a city}} in and {{the county}} seat of Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. The city is the most populous Omaha suburb and a {{principal}} city in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. It {{is located on the}} east bank of the Missouri River, across from Omaha, Nebraska. Council Bluffs was known, until at least 1853, as Kanesville. It was the historic starting point of the Mormon Trail. Kanesville is also the northernmost anchor town of the other emigrant trails, since there was a steam powered boat to <b>ferry</b> their <b>wagons,</b> and cattle, across the Missouri River.|$|R
50|$|At Granton, the world's first train <b>ferry</b> took goods <b>wagons</b> by boat to Burntisland in Fife. The service {{commenced}} on 3 February 1850. Thomas Bouch {{designed the}} ferry slip. The ferry was the Leviathan, and {{was designed by}} Thomas Grainger. The through train ferry service was withdrawn in 1876, but a passenger ferry continued for many years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Dobbs ferry {{was said}} to be a periauger, a row-and-sail dugout, sometimes with two masts. [...] Mollie Sneden would have known this, and she probably began her ferry with periaugers. They were popular colonial craft capable of negotiating shallow water while carrying heavy loads. [...] Vessels of this variety were typically used in early ferry operations on the Hudson, and several miles downriver by Fort Lee, Stephen Bourdette began his ferry service using one. [...] In addition to periaugers, Mollie Sneden would have used larger craft; for she <b>ferried</b> <b>wagons</b> as well as people. [...] A larger type of ferry used on the Hudson during this period was powered by a paddle wheel, which in turn was rotated by horses or mules on a treadmill. [...] She definitely would have required a larger vessel for a crossing she is said to have made in 1775 carrying a coach. It bore Martha Washington and her son, John, complete with his wife, liveried footmen and postillon, when Martha was en route to visit George Washington in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [...] The Hudson River is relatively wide between Sneden's Landing and Dobbs Ferry, and a crossing varied in duration. The length of time was affected by variable winds and the tides, which are still strong only a few miles above New York Harbor. Not only did the Sneden ferry cross the Hudson River, it also transported goods southward to New York City.|$|R
50|$|To {{encourage}} {{the transport of}} coal by rail and to compete more effectively with river barges, the Rhine-Nahe Railway and the Nassau State Railway (which now owned the Nassau Rhine line) decided {{to set up a}} <b>ferry</b> for freight <b>wagons</b> between Bingerbrück and Rüdesheim. The freight ferry was put into operation on 1 September 1862. A passenger ferry opened on 5 November 1861 on the Bingerbrück-Bingen-Rüdesheim route.|$|R
50|$|An early {{train ferry}} was {{established}} {{as early as}} 1833 by the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway. To extend the line over the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland, the company began operating a <b>wagon</b> <b>ferry</b> to transport the rolling stock over the canal. In April 1836, the first railroad car ferry in the U.S., Susquehanna, entered service on the Susquehanna River between Havre de Grace and Perryville, Maryland.|$|R
50|$|Launched in 1858, the Carrier was {{the third}} and {{smallest}} vessel in a fleet of six train ferries introduced by Thomas Bouch, the engineer of the ENR/NBR, to carry the company's trains across the Forth and Tay estuaries. Bouch was not only responsible for their design but also that of the linkspans and associated equipment. The <b>ferries</b> carried goods <b>wagons</b> and, occasionally, empty passenger coaches. The passengers themselves crossed by conventional paddle steamers.|$|R
25|$|Transport, {{especially}} by sea, {{is an important}} segment of the economy. Nearly all the cargo arriving for Sakhalin (and the Kuril Islands) is delivered by cargo boats, or by <b>ferries,</b> in railway <b>wagons,</b> through the SSC train ferry from the mainland port of Vanino to Kholmsk. The ports of Korsakov and Kholmsk are the largest and handle all kinds of goods, while coal and timber shipments often go through other ports. In 1999, a ferry service was opened between the ports of Korsakov and Wakkanai, Japan, and operated through the autumn of 2015, when service was suspended.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue and}} white livery was {{introduced}} by Phillip Shirley with the two arrow NSW Sydney Transport logo being applied on buses, suburban electric trains and <b>ferries</b> while freight <b>wagons</b> were painted in a teal blue livery which Mr Shirley brought with him from his time at British Rail. The trains and ferries would revert to their tuscan and green liveries in the 1980s.The two arrow NSW Sydney Transport logo was replaced by The L7 logo which was introduced in 1975. It {{would continue to be}} used, albeit with different colours, on buses and ferries until 1989 and on trains until 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Rhenish Railway Company {{opened a}} <b>ferry</b> for freight <b>wagons</b> on 23 August 1866 and a ferry for {{passenger}} carriages on 1 September 1866. The {{third and fourth}} ferry were completed in 1867. Train ferry services were halted for about four weeks by storms, floods and icy conditions each year. Nevertheless, traffic on the train ferry increased from 104,000 wagons and 51 locomotives in 1867 to almost 350,000 wagons and 286 locomotives {{in the last year}} of operation in 1873. Coal traffic carried over the Rhine increased from 8 million hundredweight in 1867 to over 28 million hundredweight in 1873.|$|R

50|$|After the war, Ridge {{moved his}} family to the Cherokee town of Head of Coosa (present-day Rome, Georgia). He {{developed}} a plantation, owned 30 African-American slaves as laborers, and became a wealthy planter. The plantation consisted of nearly three hundred cleared acres whose main cash crops were corn, tobacco and cotton. He built his house. Major Ridge also developed and owned a profitable <b>ferry</b> that carried <b>wagons</b> and their teams across the Oostanuaula River. as another business, Ridge founded a trading post in partnership with George Lavender, a white man; the post provided staples and luxury European-American goods such as calico and silk fabrics.|$|R
50|$|The {{extensive}} {{marshalling yard}} {{to the west}} of the main station provided stabling for the carriage sets which were used on the boat trains and local services, the large numbers of lorries used for servicing Parkeston Quay, and the huge throughput of export and import wagons which were shipped over the train ferry service from Harwich Town. Cargoes were assembled at Parkeston and brought to Harwich for a specific sailing, as there was no long-term storage capacity at the <b>ferry</b> terminal. Import <b>wagons</b> were subject to customs clearance at Parkeston and delays could at times be considerable on individual wagons, cargoes having arrived from various European origins.|$|R
50|$|The {{initiative}} for the railway line {{came from the}} industrialists of Krefeld and Mönchengladbach, who intended to give domestic industry cheap access to raw materials from overseas via the port of Antwerp and to cheap supplies of coal from the Ruhr. At {{the same time the}} rail links would facilitate the marketing of their products. To avoid the difficult transhipment of goods for the crossing of the Rhine-the military had not allowed the construction of a railway bridge from Ruhrort to Homberg-the Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company signed a contract on 29 March 1849 with the Cologne-Minden Railway Company to operate a train <b>ferry</b> for freight <b>wagons</b> and passenger carriages across the river between Ruhrort and Homberg.|$|R
500|$|As {{more troops}} were evacuated, more {{were ordered to}} {{withdraw}} from the lines and march to the <b>ferry</b> landing. <b>Wagon</b> wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British and convince them that nothing was going on. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate. Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly. Washington exclaimed [...] "Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us." [...] Mifflin explained that he had been told that {{it was his turn to}} evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.|$|R
500|$|In 1907 {{the first}} ferry, an unmotorized barge named Tinnsjø was completed; the steam ship Skarsfos {{was used to}} haul it between the two railways. The first {{self-propelled}} ferry was SF Rjukanfos, a 338 gross tonne ferry launched in 1909. She got a major overhaul in 1915 after the sister ship SF Hydro at 494 gross tonnes was launched the same year. The third steamship was SF Ammonia at 929 gross tonnes. Lake Tinn freezes in winter, and all the ships had to be built as icebreakers. The <b>ferries</b> transported the <b>wagons</b> and passengers [...] across Lake Tinn; until 1936 Norsk Transport had to compete with a passenger steamship service, but after their closing the railway ferries were responsible for all passenger traffic on the lake, which also helped boost passenger traffic on the trains.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2016, Roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) {{service was}} {{introduced}} from Bihta (private freight terminal) to Turki station in Muzaffarpur district covering {{a distance of}} 88 km through the Digha-Sonepur rail-cum-road bridge. This is second such service in India. Before this, Railways started RoRo services in the Konkan region. The railway <b>wagons</b> <b>ferry</b> loaded trucks to their destination. This is started by Railways to attract more loadings, reduce carbon emission and reduce load on Mahatma Gandhi Setu. Approximately 44 loaded or empty trucks move in a rake and one rake do three trips a day. Ferrying of trucks weighing 15 MT (metric tonnes) cost [...] and of empty trucks of average 6 MT (metric tonnes) weight [...] Similarly, trucks weighing over 15 MT are charged Rs 200 more for every tonne over 15MT. The maximum weight allowed is 66 MT. From July 3 onwards, starting destination is changed to Danapur instead of Bihita.|$|R
50|$|In 1857, President James Buchanan {{appointed}} Edward Fitzgerald Beale {{to survey}} {{and build a}} 1,000 mile (1,600 km) road from Fort Defiance in northern New Mexico Territory, to the Colorado River. The road was meant for immigrants, traveling to the California gold fields and crossed the Colorado at Beale's Crossing within Mohave territory. Beale's Crossing in 1857 {{was little more than}} a shallow point in the river until a party of emigrants known as the Rose-Baley Party arrived. The wagon train set out from Santa Fe and when they got to the Colorado, they made camp and built a dock for the construction of rafts to <b>ferry</b> the heavier <b>wagon</b> equipment across. Chiefs Irataba, Cairook and Sickahot approached the American settlers and in a pow wow the Mohave asked the party's leader, L. J. Rose if they intended to build a town along the river. Rose responded with no and informed the chiefs that they were headed for California and would only be staying for a short while.|$|R
50|$|On 17 October 1859, both {{stations}} were {{connected by a}} bridge. Bingerbrück station therefore became a border station on the former border between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Hesse. On 15 December 1859, the Koblenz-Bingerbrück section of the left bank was opened by Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). In order to improve the carriage of freight from the Saar region to the region of Wiesbaden and Frankfurt, the Rhine-Nahe Railway (Rhein-Nahe-Eisenbahn, {{the owner of the}} Nahe Valley Railway) and the Nassau State Railway (Nassauische Staatsbahn) decided to set up the Bingerbrück-Rüdesheim train <b>ferry</b> for freight <b>wagons.</b> This <b>ferry</b> went into operation on the Rhine between Bingerbrück and Rüdesheim on 1 September 1862. In 1900, operations were discontinued and some years later it replaced by the Hindenburg Bridge. This railway bridge, connecting Bingerbrück and Rudesheim, was built in the years 1913 to 1915 and destroyed during the Second World War. Since then there has been no way for trains to cross the Rhine near Bingen.|$|R
50|$|Following his {{raid on the}} B&O railroad, central Maryland and aborted {{attack on}} Washington D.C. at the Battle of Fort Stevens, Confederate General Jubal A. Early retreated to Virginia, {{crossing}} the Potomac at Conrad's Ferry on July 14, making camp at Big Springs just north of Leesburg. On the 15th a detachment of Federal cavalry from Harpers Ferry led by General George Crook crossed into Loudoun from Berlin and skirmished with Confederates at Lovettsville. Early's Federal pursuers under General Horatio Wright reached Leesburg on the 16th and fought with Early's rearguard at Leesburg in the morning. Crook's cavalry skirmished with Confederate cavalry at Waterford later in the day. Late in the afternoon on the 16th, Federal cavalry under Alfred N. Duffié, also operating from Harpers <b>Ferry,</b> raided Early's <b>wagon</b> trains as they traveled west towards Snickers Gap on the Leesburg and Snickers Gap Turnpike just east of Purcellville at Heatons' Crossroads. That evening at dusk, Duffié's cavalry attacked and routed a detachment of Confederate cavalry in camp at Woodgrove. Early safely withdrew across the Blue Ridge on the 17th and established a line near Berryville in the Shenandoah Valley. The Union infantry under Wright drove off a small force of Confederates holding Snickers Gap in {{the afternoon of the}} 17th and were later attacked in camp by elements of Mosby's Rangers. The following day the pitched Battle of Cool Spring, or Snickers Ferry, was fought on its western slope as Union infantry tried unsuccessfully to force a crossing of the Shenandoah River. On the 19th, Mosby's Rangers engaged a detachment of Federal cavalry that was dispatched south to Ashby's Gap to conduct a flanking movement on Early's lines. The brief campaign was locally known as the Snickers Gap War.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{expedition}} {{was ready}} and started from Fort Rice, Dakota Territory on June 20, 1873. The surveying party and six companies under Major E. F. Townsend, 9th Infantry had started four days earlier from Fort Abraham Lincoln on the Missouri River, being directed to travel west until the main command might overtake them. In the first seventeen days of marching it rained fourteen days, {{in some instances}} {{with three or four}} heavy rain-falls in twenty-four hours. After taking a day to cross the main command over the Heart River, Colonel Stanley received a report from Mr. Rosser, the chief engineer, and Major Townsend, that on June 24, the surveying party and its escort had [...] "been overtaken by a most furious hail-storm...in which men had barely escaped with their lives, and the animals stampeding on the march had broken up their wagons to such an extent as to completely cripple both engineers and escort." [...] Stanley sent the remainder of the 7th Cavalry and the mechanic outfit ahead to the surveyors to help repair the damages, while the infantry stayed with the heavy wagon train. By July 1, the infantry and wagon train had crossed over the Muddy River, which was flooded approximately 60 feet wide, via a makeshift pontoon bridge of overturned wagon beds, designed by the chief commissary officer, Lieutenant P. H. Ray of the 8th Infantry. At this time Stanley sent 47 wagons back to Fort Rice for additional supplies. On July 5, the infantry escorting the wagons had caught up with the surveying party under Mr. Rosser, Major Townsend's Infantry detachment, and the 7th Cavalry under Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer. The expedition pushed on, crossing the flooded Little Missouri River, and entering into Montana Territory, reaching the Yellowstone River, on July 13, 1873. Custer and two squadrons of cavalry then going across a rough trail, reached the mouth of Glendive Creek on the Yellowstone, there meeting the steamboat Key West, which had established a supply depot at that point. After Stanley reached the depot, he left two 7th Cavalry companies and one 17th Infantry company to guard it, and on July 26, had the Key West <b>ferry</b> troops and <b>wagons</b> over to the north bank of the Yellowstone. After traveling west, on August 1, Stanley's column met the Steamship Josephine under Captain Grant Marsh eight miles above the mouth of the Powder River. Captain William Ludlow of the engineers had brought the boat up with a supply of forage and some necessary clothing. That night the expedition had the first evidence of the presence of Indians, the camp guards firing on several during the night, and the trail of ten being plainly seen going up the valley the next morning, August 2. In marching up the left bank of the Yellowstone, an escort of one company of infantry and one of the 7th Cavalry took care of the surveying party, which aimed to follow the valley, while the wagon train had to take many detours, leaving the valley and crossing the plateaus where the river ran close the bluffs.|$|R
