All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel.

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has {{been referred to}} as the [...] "imageability effect". According to this idea, the ease with which a mental image can be created for a word is strongly related to the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> reading the word. In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> reading it. This variable, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> predication, is a rating of {{how easy it is to}} come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word. For example, when presented with the word [...] "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or predicates, such as [...] "has four legs", [...] "is an animal", or [...] "barks and wags its tail". Words with higher <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> predication scores are more easily read aloud by deep dyslexics than words with lower <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> predicaton scores, yet there is no correlation between <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> predication and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> reading seen in normal adult readers. <b>Ease</b> <b>of</b> predication may not explain specific symptoms of deep dyslexia, but rather indicates that deep dyslexics read using imagery, or a predicational route, rather than the more precise mechanisms used in normal reading.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide information about the relationships between computer information system interface types in determining user performance, user-perceived system control, user-perceived <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system use, and user-perceived <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system understanding. The type of computer information system interface was the primary independent variable with two levels: a command-language interface and a graphic-user interface. The dependent variables were user performance, user-perceived system control, user-perceived <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system use, and user-perceived <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system understanding. An experimental research was conducted to examine the relationships between the variables. Participants in the study included 29 students enrolled in Northern Illinois University's Master of Business Administration program. A pre-test was administered to measure subjects' previous computer information system experience and locus-of-control orientation. Subjects were assigned to one of two interface-type systems in the experiment based upon previous computer information system experience. An accounting-based computer information system was used. Subjects were administered a post-test to measure their perceived system control, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system use, and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system understanding. Eight null hypotheses were tested in this study. To test the hypotheses, performance scores and pre-test with post-test scores were analyzed using t tests and ANOVA tests. The significance level of. 05 was established for all of the tests. The following were the findings: user performance scores were not significantly different for the two interface-type groups. User performance scores were not significantly different based upon user-perceived system control, user-perceived <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system use, or user-perceived <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> system understanding.

Statistical modeling using a logistic regression model was used to fit the data and estimate the contribution of each physical parameter to the goodness of the fit.
