50|$|The London <b>Electrobus</b> Company, was a bus {{operator}} in London {{that started in}} 1906 and had to close {{a couple of years}} later. The fleet of the company was powered by electricity and batteries, with the largest fleet of electric buses in the 20th century, making it a forerunner of today's electrical public buses that are experiencing growth in the early 21st century.|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} sector rapid development {{has led to}} the number of serious problems, such as: deterioration of the ecological situation in the world, shortage of energy resources, large accident rate, etc. Therefore, the application and implementation of energy-efficient technologies in transport is an urgent problem, the solution of which begins with the analysis and structuring of all its components. The paper was proposed to divide the energy-saving technologies in transport into two areas: transport and infrastructure. Particular attention is paid to urban bus transport. Comparative analysis of different types of one-class buses utilization was conducted: diesel, hybrid and <b>electrobus</b> for one of the intercity lines. The operating cost calculation for these types of buses was performed, which is shown that electrobuses have a substantial advantage over other buses. It was proposed to use an ultracapacitor <b>electrobus</b> as a small class bus in urban environment and also we presented a schematic diagram of an ultracapacitor <b>electrobus.</b> As for the development of transport infrastructure, the authors offered design of smart roads, which consist of multifunctional pavement slabs...|$|E
40|$|The impact {{response}} of sandwich panels with an improved structure {{to increase their}} impact resistance isinvestigated. In order to compare the impact performance of sandwich structures, a specific and instrumenteddrop-weight impact tester was designed and developed. The experimental part of this work is an evaluation oncomposite sandwich panels behavior used in the manufacturing of the UNAM <b>Electrob√∫s</b> chassis. Two differentsandwich structures are analyzed: the first type is a structure composed by a glass fiber-polyester matrix compositefacesheets and a polyethylene honeycomb core. The second one consists of facesheets made from a glass fiberepoxymatrix composite laminate and core formed by internal phenolic honeycomb structure. The first structurewas specifically designed to improve crashworthiness for transport applications. The main {{results of this study}} areevaluated from the absorbed energy performance of the sandwich structures subjected to a single impact, and thedevelopment of useful criteria for materials selection...|$|E
