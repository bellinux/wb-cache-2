500|$|Communities may {{refer to}} FGM as [...] "pharaonic" [...] for {{infibulation}} and sunna circumcision <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> Sunna means [...] "path or way" [...] in Arabic and {{refers to the}} tradition of Muhammad, although none of the procedures are required within Islam. The term infibulation derives from fibula, Latin for clasp—the Ancient Romans reportedly fastened clasps through the foreskins or labia of slaves to prevent sexual intercourse. The surgical infibulation of women {{came to be known}} as pharaonic circumcision in Sudan, but as Sudanese circumcision in Egypt. In Somalia it is known simply as qodob ("to sew up").|$|E
500|$|The poem {{consists}} of an address by the speaker to an unnamed listener, and contains two parallel sections, about two of Sappho's brothers, Charaxos and Larichos. Sappho hopes that Charaxos will return successfully from his trading voyage, and that Larichos will grow up and become a man. [...] In the first surviving stanza of the poem, the speaker upbraids the addressee for repeating that Charaxos will return home safely, saying that only the gods can know such a thing. [...] In the next stanza, the speaker tells the addressee to send her to pray to Hera for Charaxos' safe return. [...] This is followed by an exhortation to trust in the gods <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> and two traditional pieces of wisdom – that fortunes are changeable, and that the gods can bless those they favour with good fortune. [...] The poem ends with the speaker hoping that Larichos will [...] " [...] his head high" [...] and [...] "become an ανερ [...] in all senses", as Obbink puts it.|$|E

2500|$|The measure, {{which came}} into effect on January 2, 2009, has clear {{differences}} with the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). There is a tax deduction for contributions to an RRSP, and withdrawals of contributions and investment income are all taxable. In contrast, there are no tax deductions for contributions to a TFSA. Beginning in 2013, contribution room in the TFSA has increased to $5,500 per calendar year. The Canada Revenue Agency describes {{the difference between the}} TFSA and an RRSP as follows: [...] "An RRSP is primarily intended for retirement. The TFSA is like an RRSP <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in your life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Old English was a {{moderately}} inflected language, using an extensive case system {{similar to that}} of modern Icelandic or German. Middle and Modern English lost progressively more of the Old English inflectional system. Modern English is considered a weakly inflected language, since its nouns have only vestiges of inflection (plurals, the pronouns), and its regular verbs have only four forms: an inflected form for the past indicative and subjunctive (looked), an inflected form for the third-person-singular present indicative (looks), an inflected form for the present participle (looking), and an uninflected form <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> (look). While the English possessive indicator s (as in [...] "Jane's book") is a remnant of the Old English genitive case suffix, it is now considered not a suffix but a clitic.|$|E
