5|$|In the 2009 off-season, the Avalanche named Greg Sherman the new {{general manager}} and Joe Sacco the new head coach. The {{following}} month, top scorer Ryan Smyth {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Kings and Joe Sakic, the only team captain the Avs had ever known, retired after 21 seasons in the NHL. The Avs named Adam Foote team captain to replace him. Sakic's jersey retirement ceremony took place on October 1, 2009, before the season opener at home against the San Jose Sharks in front of a sold out crowd where the Avalanche won 5–2. The Avalanche started the season off strong until the Olympic break. Three Avs played in Vancouver: Paul Stastny for the United States, Ruslan Salei for Belarus and Peter Budaj <b>for</b> <b>Slovakia.</b> Following the Winter Olympics, the Avs struggled but eventually clinched a playoff spot with 95 points on the season, a 26-point improvement from the previous year's effort, and good enough for eighth place in the Western Conference. The Avalanche fell in the Western Conference Quarter-finals to the top-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games.|$|E

25|$|After the Munich Agreement, Slovakia gained {{autonomy}} inside Czecho-Slovakia (as {{the former}} Czechoslovakia had been renamed) and lost its southern territories to Hungary under the First Vienna Award. As the Nazi Führer Adolf Hitler was preparing a mobilisation into Czech territory {{and creation of}} his Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, he had various plans <b>for</b> <b>Slovakia.</b> German officials were initially misinformed by the Hungarians that the Slovaks wanted to join Hungary. Germany decided to make Slovakia a separate puppet state {{under the influence of}} Germany, and a potential strategic base for German attacks on Poland and other regions.|$|E

25|$|Tatra Film {{commissioned}} the screenplay from the Slovak-American Jozef Žák-Marušiak (1885–1979; immigrated in 1911) from Lakšárska Nová Ves, western Slovakia, who based it on a two-volume novel by the Slovak-American journalist Gustáv Maršall-Petrovský (1862–1916). The novel was the filmmakers' original inspiration {{for making the}} movie. The screenplay had features of a shooting script. It was typed in Slovak, on a US typewriter without diacritics, with English camera directions. However, Žák-Marušiak delivered barely {{a third of the}} screenplay before the team's departure <b>for</b> <b>Slovakia,</b> some of it arrived by mail during the shoot, and the rest did not reach them before the film was finished. The filmmakers improvised and used the play Jánošík by Jiří Mahen translated to Slovak by Martin Rázus in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Hantuchová played three Fed Cup matches <b>for</b> <b>Slovakia</b> in April {{and then}} in the German Open in May, where she lost in the second {{qualifying}} round to Francesca Schiavone.

Hantuchová's form saw her qualify automatically for the French Open, beating Alexandra Stevenson in the first round and losing to eighth seed Conchita Martínez in the second round. She again teamed up with Nagyová in the doubles, reaching the third round.|$|E
25|$|At the French Open, Hantuchová lost in {{the second}} round in a {{marathon}} match to Harkleroad again, 6–7(2), 6–4, 7–9, making 101 unforced errors, leading to long-time coach Nigel Sears criticising her attitude publicly. Following the match, her extremely thin physique was noticed for the first time publicly, and some wondered about Hantuchová's health. Kicking off the grass season in Eastbourne, Hantuchová {{lost in the}} quarterfinals to Conchita Martínez, but more famously she lost {{in the second round}} of Wimbledon to Shinobu Asagoe, 6–0, 4–6, 10–12, with Hantuchová breaking down crying during the latter stages of the match and making 57 unforced errors. Some theorized that the media's continued interest regarding her weight and the pressure of success at 19 years of age, in addition to her on-court breakdown and her parents' divorce, as well as her coach's walked out during the middle of the match, led to this breakdown. Following Wimbledon, Hantuchová went 6–8 for the rest of the year, 0–4 against top-10 players She ended the year with an overall record of 28–23, and she fell to No. 17 in the world. Further signs of the pressure and problems she was facing during this period was that, in July, she made herself unavailable <b>for</b> <b>Slovakia</b> in the Fed Cup, in order to concentrate on her singles career, and in November she parted company with Sears.|$|E
