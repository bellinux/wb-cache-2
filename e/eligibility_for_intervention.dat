This paper estimates the long-term impacts of early-life interventions (e. g. lead remediation, nutritional assessment, medical evaluation, developmental surveillance, and public assistance referrals) recommended for lead-poisoned children. Using linked administrative data from Charlotte, NC, we compare outcomes for children who are similar across observable characteristics but differ in <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> due to blood lead test results. We find that the negative outcomes previously associated with early-life exposure can largely be reversed by intervention...|$|E
40|$|In this commentary, I {{focus on}} the notion of {{competence}} and issues related to the distinction between knowing how mathematical problems are solved versus knowing how to teach mathematics. Although definitions of competence may necessarily be affected by value judgements and thus less amenable to factual answers, providing a defensible definition is important because it affects <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> and treatment. One way to tackle this issue is to {{focus on the}} identification of prerequisite skills and concepts needed for particular domains of mathematics. Recent work on fraction and algebra has shown that long held assumptions may need to be re-examined. On knowledge versus application, some cautionary notes are made on the importance of not losing sight of translating our knowledge of processes involved in mathematical problem solving into better pedagogical practices.

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} psychiatric comorbidity in adolescents with a gender identity disorder (GID). We focused on {{its relation to}} gender, type of GID diagnosis and <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> medical <b>interventions</b> (puberty suppression and cross-sex hormones). Methods: To ascertain DSM-IV diagnoses, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) was administered to parents of 105 gender dysphoric adolescents. Results: 67. 6 % had no concurrent psychiatric disorder. Anxiety disorders occurred in 21 %, mood disorders in 12. 4 % and disruptive disorders in 11. 4 % of the adolescents. Compared with natal females (n = 52), natal males (n = 53) suffered more often from two or more comorbid diagnoses (22. 6 % vs. 7. 7 %, p =. 03), mood disorders (20. 8 % vs. 3. 8 %, p =. 008) and social anxiety disorder (15. 1 % vs. 3. 8 %, p =. 049). Adolescents with GID considered to be 'delayed eligible' for medical treatment were older [15. 6 years (SD = 1. 6) vs. 14. 1 years (SD = 2. 2), p =. 001], their intelligence was lower [91. 6 (SD = 12. 4) vs. 99. 1 (SD = 12. 8), p =. 011] and a lower percentage was living with both parents (23 % vs. 64 %, p 1. 0 for all psychiatric diagnoses except specific phobia. Conclusions: Despite the suffering resulting from the incongruence between experienced and assigned gender {{at the start of}} puberty, the majority of gender dysphoric adolescents do not have co-occurring psychiatric problems.

40|$|Traditional standardized, norm-referenced {{assessments}} are used most often to determine children’s <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> specialized services. These traditional tests {{have at least}} two drawbacks: (a) test items and activities often do not reflect children’s functional repertoires; and (b) outcomes are difficult to link directly to goal development, intervention, and evaluation. A promising alternative is the use of an assessment approach that reflects children’s functional repertoires in familiar environments (i. e., authentic), and directly connects outcomes to programmatic efforts (i. e., linked). This study investigated the validity and reliability of an authentic and linked alternative assessment. Sixty-eight toddlers, with and without disabilities, were given traditional and alternative eligibility assessments.

40|$|Background: Smoking, {{excessive}} drinking, lack {{of exercise}} and a poor diet remain key causes of premature morbidity and mortality globally, yet {{it is not clear}} what proportion of patients attending for routine primary care are eligible <b>for</b> <b>interventions</b> about these behaviours, the extent to which they co-occur within individuals, and which individuals are at greatest risk for multiple unhealthy behaviours. The aim of the trial was to examine ‘intervention eligibility’ and co-occurrence of the ‘big four’ risky health behaviours – lack of exercise, smoking, an unhealthy diet and excessive drinking – in a primary care population. Methods: Data were collected from adult patients consulting routinely in general practice across South Wales as part of the Pre-Empt study; a cluster randomised controlled trial. After giving consent, participants completed screening instruments, which included the following to assess <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> an <b>intervention</b> based on set thresholds: AUDIT-C (for alcohol), HSI (for smoking), IPAQ (for exercise) and a subset of DINE (<b>for</b> diet). The <b>intervention</b> following screening was based on which combination of risky behaviours the patient had.

40|$|In June 2011, Senator the Hon Jan McLucas {{asked the}} Department to seek expert advice about {{evidence}} <b>for</b> early <b>intervention</b> {{in relation to}} the types of childhood disability and developmental delay that were ineligible for Better Start for Children with Disability (Better Start) assistance, including an analysis of current research.   The Department enlisted KPMG to undertake the report, which examines current evidence for the effectiveness of early <b>intervention</b> <b>for</b> children with developmental delay. KPMG was engaged by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) to review and document the evidence base on the effectiveness of early childhood <b>intervention</b> (ECI) <b>for</b> children with a developmental disability. There is a significant body of evidence on the effectiveness of ECI for children with specific types of disability or underlying condition (such as autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy), and the focus of this project has been to review the evidence from a broader perspective – that is, the effectiveness of ECI for children with a developmental disability or developmental delay regardless of underlying cause or condition. This report describes the outputs of KPMG’s work for FaHCSIA in responding to the following questions: •    Is early intervention generally associated with improved outcomes for childhood developmental disabilities? •    Does early intervention assist children with developmental disabilities in making a successful transition to school? •    Does early intervention have an association, either direct or indirect, with social and workforce participation later in life? •    What current research is available comparing the use of diagnostic or functional thresholds to determine <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> early <b>intervention,</b> and what are the design features of a tool that could determine <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> assistance? •    Based on an examination of the estimated numbers of Australian children with a developmental delay, what would be the cost implications – both short term costs and longer term benefits - of expanding current Australian Government funding <b>for</b> early <b>intervention</b> services <b>for</b> such children?

40|$|Abstract – The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) {{targeted}} substantial School Improvement Grants (SIGs) to the nation’s “persistently lowest achieving ” {{public schools}} (i. e., up to $ 2 million per school annually over 3 years) but required schools accepting these awards {{to implement a}} federally prescribed school-reform model. Schools that met the “lowestachieving” and “lack of progress ” thresholds within their state had prioritized <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> these SIG-funded <b>interventions.</b> Using data from California, this study leverages these two discontinuous eligibility rules to identify the effects of SIG-funded whole-school reforms. The results based on these “fuzzy ” regression-discontinuity designs indicate that there were significant improvements in the test-based performance of schools on the “lowest-achieving” margin but not among schools on the “lack of progress ” margin. Complementary panel-based estimates suggest that these improvements were largely concentrated among schools adopting the federal “turnaround ” model, which compels more dramatic staff turnover...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study is}} {{the first in a series}} {{investigating}} the relationship between autonomic nervous system dysfunc-tion and chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in multiple sclerosis patients. We screened patients for the combined presence of the narrowing of the internal jugular veins and symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disorders, headache, thermal intolerance, bowel/bladder dysfunction) and determined systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to balloon angioplasty. Methods: The criteria <b>for</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> balloon angioplasty <b>intervention</b> included 50 % narrowing in one or both internal jugular veins, as determined by the magnetic resonance venography, and 3 clinical symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and post-balloon angioplasty. Results: Among patients who were screened, 91 % were identified as having internal jugular veins narrowing (with obstructing lesions) combined with the presence of three or more symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Balloon angioplasty reduced the average systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, blood pressure categorization showed a biphasic response to balloon angioplasty. The procedure increased blood pressure in multiple sclerosis patients who presented with baseline blood pressure within lower limits of normal ranges (systolic 105 mmHg, diastolic 70 mmHg) but decreased blood pressure in patients with baseline blood pressure abov...|$|R

40|$|While it is {{increasingly}} possible to envision "perfect" babies, {{it is not always}} the case that reproduction actually proceeds according to individual will; for example, there has been no recent reduction in rates of childhood disability. Nevertheless, in most studies of new reproductive technologies, the birth of those children whom few would actively choose [...] "defective" or disabled infants [...] is presented only in hypothetical terms. This paper argues for expanding the domain of reproduction to include research on the parenting of children with disabilities. Based on a qualitative research project carried out at a hospital-based newborn follow-up program that serves as an evaluation site determining <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> early <b>intervention</b> services <b>for</b> infants and young children with disabilities, this paper focuses on a particular part of women's experience of acquiring new knowledge about personhood and disability, that is, on the period of time when a woman has recently had confirmed that reproduction has, in her case, gone awry. Disability in many cultures, including the United States, diminishes personhood. I suggest that American mothers' narratives, by utilizing the concept of developmental delay, can assert personhood, or rather, the potential for its future attainment; in doing so, they justify ongoing nurturance of a disabled child in spite of negative attitudes about disability. A particular case of one mother's emplotment of her child's life within a story of developmental delay, in competition with the physician's story of disability, is analyzed. The paper concludes with reflections on how stories of developmental delay told by mothers just encountering a diagnosis of disability may differ from the stories told by those who have experienced mothering a disabled child over time, and on the implications of these differences for the cultural construction of personhood in the United States.
