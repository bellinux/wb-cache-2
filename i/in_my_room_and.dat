60|$|I {{sent for}} her to see me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> showed her my letter.|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, at {{what seemed}} a very early hour, the little white table-waiter {{appeared}} suddenly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> shot a single word out of himself [...] "Breakfast!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Fan, I've {{made you}} up a bed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> {{if he comes}} bothering for you to-night, I'll soon send him about his business. Don't you fear, my girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am all right. I {{spent the}} evening <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> {{went to bed}} at eleven o'clock. Who's lunching with you? I see the table is laid for two." ...|$|R
60|$|I awoke {{the next}} morning rather late, dressed <b>and</b> shaved <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> descended to the cafe for breakfast. The waiter who usually served me came hurrying up with a {{welcoming}} smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "That doesn't worry me," [...] Francis declared. [...] "I don't {{need the}} fees, fortunately, and I can always pick up enough {{work to keep}} me going by {{attending}} Sessions. One thing I can promise you--I certainly shall not sit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> wait for things to happen. Mine is a militant spirit and it needs the outlet of action." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All very fine, Mr. Holmes," [...] said he. [...] "But {{there is}} one little flaw in your splendid theory. I was myself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> I never left it during the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think,' {{said the}} Doctor, 'you had better sleep <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> then, if you wake in the night, {{you will have}} some one to speak to. You will find that a comfort.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Sassburger said prayerfully, [...] "Say, boys, {{before you}} go, seeing {{this is the}} last chance, I've GOT IT, up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> Miriam here is the best little mixelogist in the Stati Unidos like us Italians say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{a ridiculous}} old fellow that Chapman is,' said Griff, {{coming in from}} a conference with the gaunt old man who acted as keeper to our not very {{extensive}} preserves. 'I {{told him to get}} some gins for the rats <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> he shook his absurd head like any mandarin, and said, [...] "There baint no trap as will rid you of them kind of varmint, sir."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you see it}} is the {{compound}} interest going on for seventeen years, and perhaps some rise {{in the value of}} the securities, that has doubled the original sum invested. As for the jewels, I have left them at the bank; I should not care about having 50,000 pounds worth of such things <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> I should not think that you would like to have them here, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said John Gayther, [...] "that was all. I {{have the}} ancient gold piece <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> now, <b>and</b> some day I will {{show it to}} you.|$|R
60|$|When I was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{about to}} lie down, I thought I heard a {{whispering}} at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears deceived me, I {{heard the voice}} of the Count.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Captain Dale, won't {{you please}} come quick?" [...] cried the little sneak, {{all out of}} breath with excitement. [...] "Somebody put about a million mice <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> I've got the fellow locked up in my clothes-closet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{would you}} do me the favour to beg Mrs. Jones to oblige me with her company {{for half an hour}} or so. There is an {{excellent}} fire <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps Mrs. Jones would not object to step there." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Ledbetter {{collapsed}} panting on the trunk. [...] "Last night," [...] he gasped, [...] "I {{was asleep}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> little <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> I no more dreamt--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'They may do {{what they}} like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> to-day, <b>and</b> send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I teach {{school like}} {{one in a}} dream," [...] {{continued}} Gertrude; [...] "then I come home and shut myself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> walk the floor. I am wearing a path right across Nan's carpet. We are so horribly near this war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] Hunterleys admitted. [...] "I am {{told that}} a man has {{committed}} suicide <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> I have heard no plausible explanation as to how he got there. I want to see him. It is possible that I may recognise him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} true, dear. Come with me. We {{will go up}} the private stairs, and I will put you {{straight}} to bed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> no one else shall see you, or question you, until you are quite recovered from your fatigue." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were four}} of us—George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency. We were sitting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> smoking, <b>and</b> {{talking about how}} bad we were—bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.|$|R
6000|$|I {{longed to}} exhibit that wicked {{woman in her}} true character--but what could I do? She must have been so favored by {{circumstances}} as {{to be able to}} account for her absence from home, without exciting the slightest suspicion of the journey which she had really taken, if I declared <b>in</b> <b>my</b> reply to the Minister's letter that I had received her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> if I repeated the conversation that had taken place, what would the result be? She would find an easy refuge in positive denial of the truth--and, in that case, which of us would her infatuated husband believe? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{remember}} sitting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> living <b>room</b> <b>and</b> I loved the blues. I am {{of the rock}} 'n' roll school {{where it comes from}} the rhythm and blues based music, and so there was this kind of beat that I wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My good woman, we {{are going}} to Aengusmere. Here's two pound. Don't allow any one <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> <b>And</b> I may send for my things from out of town. Be ready to pack them in my trunks and send them to me. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. She {{found it}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> {{though it was}} my {{property}} she threw {{it on the floor}} and stamped on it, because it was not according to her taste, and ground the arms and the head of one of the figures all to bits with her heel--a horrid thing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} formal, to-day," [...] she declared. [...] "You give {{too many of}} your {{thoughts}} to your little friend. I {{do not think that}} you are treating me kindly. I should like to sit with you <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> to talk to you of my books. Look, is it not pretty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Answerest thou, {{that when}} nights of December are blackest and [...] bleakest, [...] And when the fervid grate feigns me a May <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> [...] <b>And</b> by <b>my</b> {{hearthstone}} gay, as now sad <b>in</b> <b>my</b> garden, thou creakest,-- [...] Thou wilt again give me all,--dew and fragrance and bloom? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We dine at seven," [...] said Aunt Jane. [...] "I always lunch <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> you may do the same," [...] {{and with}} a wave of her thin hand she {{dismissed}} the girl, who thoughtfully followed the old housekeeper through the halls.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are my friend," [...] she said, [...] "if any one is. I {{think that}} I will tell you. The man Hill has persecuted me for months--ever since I {{have been in}} England. He claimed me for his wife, and showed to every one a {{marriage}} certificate. He shot at me at the 'Unusual,' and the magistrates bound him over to keep the peace. I found him once <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> I believe {{that he had a}} key to my front door. Last night Mr. Brendon and I returned from the 'Unusual,' and found him lying <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> shot through the lungs. In the grate were some charred fragments of a marriage certificate. We fetched the doctor and the police. From the first I could see that neither believed my story. I am suspected of having shot the man." ...|$|R
6000|$|The king {{remained}} patiently in his palace, feeling {{sure that}} this time Maria could not escape him; {{and he said to}} his pages, 'If a gentleman should come here with his daughter and ask to be allowed to speak with me, put the young lady <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> see she does not leave it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; she did {{really say}} that! Whether I was only angry, or whether I was getting hysterical, I don't know. I {{began to feel}} an oppression in my {{breathing}} that almost choked me. There are two windows <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> one of them only was open. I was obliged {{to ask her to}} open the other.|$|E
60|$|Some {{twenty minutes}} had elapsed, and having picked the honest fellow {{up outside the}} front door, I was driving in the {{two-seater}} to the picturesque town of Market Snodsbury. Since we had parted--he {{to go to his}} lair and fetch his hat, I to remain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> complete the formal costume--I had been doing some close thinking.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll sit up for master if you like, ma'am. I am {{not at all}} {{afraid of}} Fanny, if I may sit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>room</b> <b>and</b> have a candle. She was such a childlike, nesh young thing that her spirit couldn't appear to anybody if it tried, I'm quite sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never heard}} me talk of Victor Trevor?" [...] he asked. [...] "He {{was the only}} friend I made during the two years I was at college. I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson, always rather fond of moping <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> working out <b>my</b> own little methods of thought, so that I never mixed much with the men of my year. Bar fencing and boxing I had few {{athletic}} tastes, and then my line of study was quite distinct {{from that of the}} other fellows, so that we had no points of contact at all. Trevor was the only man I knew, and that only through the accident of his bull terrier freezing on to my ankle one morning as I went down to chapel.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> now, working <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> white-leading <b>and</b> turpentining, {{is another}} one of them. I have learned his name. It is Arthur Deacon. He is the pallid, furtive-eyed man whom I {{observed}} the first day when the men were routed out of the forecastle to man the windlass--the man I so instantly adjudged a drug-fiend. He certainly looks it.|$|R
