Robert Quigley King had long owned the King Building, {{and there was}} a lot between it and High Street at the corner of Fountain and High in the very heart of downtown Springfield. At the time of his death, their father had begun building a new, very modern for its time, office building. Robert Quigley King's will left Ward and Leffler the King Building and this lot, subject to a one-third <b>income</b> <b>interest</b> in the profits from these properties to their sister Almena King Warrick for the rest of her life. He also left them some bonds in trust, which he instructed them to cash in and use to fund the building. The brothers worked together to complete that building after their father's death. At the suggestion of Leffler's wife, Lola Montez King, the brothers named this building the [...] "Arcue" [...] building which was the word form of [...] "RQ" [...] or [...] "Robert Quigley".

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyse the impact of non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> on the financial performance of banking institutions in Zimbabwe. The researcher adopted both quantitative and qualitative methods of research to gather data. Likert Scale based questionnaires were distributed to a stratified sample of 26 individuals out of a total population of 35. 3 interviews were also carried out in addition to questionnaires to maximize the effectiveness of the research. More so, the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression test was carried out by use of the EVIEWS statistical package. The result of the regression test showed a positive relationship between non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> and bank profitability in Zimbabwe. The increase in a bankâ€™s non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> actually results in an increase in its profitability level ceteris paribus. It was discovered that the business of non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> maximises risk exposure for banks, however, operating costs need to be watched carefully when conducting the business of generating non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> because such activities were discovered to be the major drivers of bank operating costs. Inflation, risk policies, political stability and bank strategy were found to be other determinants of bank performance in spite of non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income.</b> The researcher recommended that banks should broaden streams from which transaction based income is earned since it is the major source of non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income.</b> Over and above, the researcher established that banks need to depend more on the business of non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> more than <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> since the research showed a positive relationship between non â€“ <b>interest</b> <b>income</b> and bank profitability...|$|R
