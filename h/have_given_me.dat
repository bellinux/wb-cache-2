500|$|It was in New Hampshire where Huntsman adopted his new [...] "Country First" [...] {{campaign}} slogan. The slogan was {{borrowed from}} John McCain's 2008 campaign, though {{the context of}} the slogan was different. Huntsman, who, as Governor of Utah at the time, endorsed McCain over Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had hoped McCain would return the favor; however, McCain endorsed Romney in a rally at Manchester's Manchester Central High School on January 4. Huntsman later characterized McCain's endorsement of his main rival as a [...] "petty betrayal". He told McCain [...] "I don't care if you support Romney, that's great – but just to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the dignity of waiting until after the New Hampshire primary." [...] McCain replied, [...] "I didn't mean to offend. I hope your family is well." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing, the {{national}} media seized upon the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100day-care centers in the United States in 7,900federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known [...] "...it might <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of collateral damage." [...] The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day-care center before the bombing.

He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't want to cut anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me." [...] On that same theme he said in another interview, [...] "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> trust and money that all of a sudden, I'd say, [...] we've done is for naught.

500|$|The Shadow of the Glen, {{based on}} a story about an unfaithful wife, was {{attacked}} in print by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as [...] "a slur on Irish womanhood". Years later Synge wrote: [...] "When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> from a chink in {{the floor of the}} old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen." [...] This encouraged more critical attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. Riders to the Sea was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Arthur Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters. However, later critics have attacked Synge for idealising the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, The Tinker's Wedding, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset [...] "a good many of our Dublin friends".|$|E
500|$|After {{successfully}} rehabilitating {{his knee}} in the offseason, Rivera announced on March9, 2013, {{that he would}} retire after the 2013 season, his 19th in the major leagues. Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball. He explained: [...] "It was {{important for me to}} meet the people who make baseball what it is, the people who work in the game every day. They <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> far more than I have given them." [...] Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city: in Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song [...] "Enter Sandman"; the Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many broken personally by Rivera's cutter, called the [...] "Chair of Broken Dreams"; the rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park. Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, the pitcher's charitable organization. Corporate sponsors of the Yankees paid tribute as well; Delta Air Lines dedicated a Boeing 757 airplane with Rivera's signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior, while Hard Rock Cafe retired [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] from its song system at all locations except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E
