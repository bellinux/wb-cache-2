Several {{inscriptions}} refer to aharas named after the governors appointed to rule them (e.g. Govardhanahara, Mamalahara, Satavanihara and Kapurahara). This suggests that the Satavahanas attempted to build a formal administrative and revenue collection structure.|$|E

Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.|$|E

5000|$|Individuals {{who study}} sociolects are called sociolinguists. Sociolinguists study {{language}} variation.

If one distinct social group used 'yous' as the plural form of the pronoun then this could indicate the existence of a sociolect. A sociolect is distinct from a dialect because social class rather than <b>geographical</b> <b>subdivision</b> substantiates the unique linguistic features.|$|E

Domestically, it borders the following districts, namely, Murzuq in west, Jufra in northwest and Al Wahat in north. Kufra {{is a part of}} Cyrenacian <b>geographical</b> <b>subdivision,</b> the largest region in Libya and which is mostly semi arid in nature. The region receives an annual rainfall of 5 in. There are no perennial rivers in the region, but the region is abundant with groundwater aquifers. All three regions of the county have mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around 423 m. Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1 % arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. It is desert climate in all other parts of the region. Dust storms lasting four to eight days is fairly common during Spring.|$|E
25|$|In 1758, Carl Linnaeus {{proposed}} what {{he considered}} to be natural taxonomic categories of the human species. He distinguished between Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens europaeus, and he later added four <b>geographical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> of humans: white Europeans, red Americans, yellow Asians and black Africans. Although Linnaeus intended them as objective classifications, his descriptions of these groups included cultural patterns and derogatory stereotypes.|$|R
30|$|The {{next stage}} of our {{approach}} is estimating which municipalities were affected by the earthquake. We refer to these municipalities as the region of interest of an earthquake. Only those municipalities deemed as being affected by the earthquake {{will be used for}} spatial Mercalli intensity estimation in the following stage. To estimate the <b>geographical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> that were affected by the seismic event, we use a supervised classification model. This model separates municipalities into two classes: unaffected by the earthquake and affected by the earthquake.|$|R
5000|$|Brinkler Classification is {{the library}} {{classification}} system of Bartol Brinkler described {{in his article}} [...] "The Geographical Approach to Materials in the Library of Congress Subject Headings".

Heading A uses a primary topical description with <b>geographical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> (e.g. Art—Paris). Type B uses a place-name for the main heading with a topical subdivision (e.g. Paris—Description). C headings use a geographical description of a phrase (e.g. Paris Literature).|$|R

25|$|The Spanish State is {{integrated}} by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative {{division in the}} country.
