40|$|The uneven {{distribution}} of species richness {{is a fundamental}} and unexplained pattern of vertebrate biodiversity. Although species richness in groups like mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a <b>diversity</b> <b>tree</b> summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 {{major changes in the}} tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies {{at the base of a}} clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for > 85 % of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced “living fossils. ” In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our <b>diversity</b> <b>tree</b> provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the ways}} to lower {{generalization}} error of decision tree ensemble is to maximize <b>tree</b> <b>diversity.</b> Building complete-random <b>trees</b> forgoes strength obtained from a test selection criterion. However, it achieves higher <b>tree</b> <b>diversity.</b> We provide a taxonomy of different randomization methods and find that complete-random test selection produces diverse trees and other randomization methods such as bootstrap sampling may impair tree growth and limit <b>tree</b> <b>diversity.</b> The well accepted practice in constructing decision trees is to apply bootstrap sampling and voting. To challenge this practice, we explore eight variants of complete-random trees using three parameters: ensemble methods, tree height restriction and sample randomization. Surprisingly, the most accurate variant is very simple and performs comparably to Bagging and Random Forests. It achieves good results by maximizing <b>tree</b> <b>diversity</b> and is called Max-diverse Ensemble. ...|$|R

Some data are from two focus group discussions with agroforestry farmers and one meeting with agroforestry experts. The farmers' discussion traced the development of farming practices from 1950 to 2010 to identify the drivers of land use change. The experts' discussion resulted in a scale to differentiate the prevailing farming systems {{in the study area}} considering five key components of agroforestry: agricultural crops, livestock, forest tree crops, fruit tree crops and vegetable crops. Data related to the system components were collected from the randomly selected households. The study reveals that land use had generally changed from very simple agriculture to agroforestry, triggered by infrastructure development, technological innovations, institutional support (subsidies and buy-back guarantees) and extension programs. A range of farming systems with varying degrees of integration was evident in the study area: simple agriculture; less integrated agroforestry; semi-integrated agroforestry and highly integrated agroforestry.

We assessed biodiversity by examining vegetation regeneration and by changes in the diversity and abundance of ground beetles after experimental manipulations including tree felling, vegetation clearing, and litter removal. Our experimental design was dictated by the need of producing only small disturbances; therefore we could not replicate plots. Instead, we used a repeated measures approach during three years to document the consistency of experimental effects. We found that the diversity of regenerating vegetation increased dramatically due to recruitment of many new species after clearing ground vegetation.

40|$|International audienceTrees {{are one of}} {{the main}} {{components}} of forest ecosystems; they modify resource levels (light, nutrients, water) that affect understory vegetation composition and <b>diversity.</b> <b>Tree</b> species diversity is used as a biodiversity indicator in various European and French monitoring schemes for sustainable forest management. Moreover, tree species basal area has been found to better indicate floristic biodiversity than tree species richness or diversity. Herein we empirically check this finding by analyzing data from mountain spruce-fir forests in France with Bayesian statistical models. We insist on the magnitude of the relationship and its variation in geographical and ecological space. Our results indicate that both tree species abundance (based on cover or basal area) and tree species richness and dominance are good indicators of some parts of understory vascular plant species richness. The effect of dendrometric indicators on floristic biodiversity varied among ecological groups and along ecological gradients such as aspect, soil acidity, region and altitude. As a result, plots with north-facing and south-facing slopes exhibited opposite relationships of species richness with tree species abundance, and so did plots located on acidic and basic sites. We discuss these results in light of other empirical results relating positive interactions between species and abiotic stress.

Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, the Nilgiri landscape, and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in the Sathyamangalam landscape, were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in the Nilgiri landscape and 44.1 yr in the Sathyamangalam landscape.

Thus, the two landscapes revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in the Nilgiri landscape. The dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations.

Species-specific variation in fungal community composition could be partially explained by <b>tree</b> <b>diversity,</b> though overall fungal diversity was not affected by <b>tree</b> <b>diversity.</b> Analysis of specific fungal taxa indicated <b>tree</b> <b>diversity</b> effects at the local neighbourhood scale, where the proportion of birch among neighbouring trees varied, but not at the plot scale. In conclusion, both methods may be used to determine <b>tree</b> <b>diversity</b> effects on the foliar fungal community. However, high-throughput sequencing provided higher resolution of the fungal community, while the visual macroscopic assessment detected functionally active fungal species...|$|R
