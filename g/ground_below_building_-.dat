40|$|Most indoor radon (Rn) surveys {{concentrated}} on residential Rn, so far. People spend, however, {{significant part of}} their lifetime at work, in places different from home. Thus, Rn exposure at work places can contribute importantly to overall Rn exposure. Consequently, new Rn regulations such as the European Basic Safety Standards, emphasize limiting Rn exposure at work alike the one at home. A particularly important workplace is school, equally for students as for teachers and other staff. Several countries, therefore, started early with surveying Rn in schools and kindergartens. In addition, sampling schools is logistically simpler than residential surveys, so that school surveys may serve as surrogates of residential Rn surveys, which are far more demanding on resources. One largely open question is, whether or to which degree there is a spatial relationship between Rn concentrations in schools and in homes. If there is one between these variables, it would allow estimating one from the other, or using both in joint spatial estimation. For physical reasons – because home and school Rn have partly the same sources, namely the <b>ground</b> <b>below</b> the <b>buildings</b> <b>–</b> {{one would expect that}} such relation or association exists. Other sources and controlling factors, specific to schools and homes and different between these types of buildings, may however obscure the relation. A further cause, which contributes to concealing that relation, is that naturally, schools and homes cannot be located at the same site, but in some distance from each other, over which the geogenic control can also vary. In fact, it is known that the geogenic radon potential is subject to high small-scale variability. The resulting problem of “non-collocated data” renders the analysis particularly complicated and affords specific statistical techniques. In this contribution, we investigate four georeferenced bivariate (home, school) datasets with this respect: one originating from a pilot study in Sokobanja district, Serbia (where statistical association of the variables has been demonstrated); a dataset from Macedonia; one from Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, and one of a regional school survey in Upper Austria together with the values of the Rn potential (standardized residential indoor concentration) in that region. As methods of spatial analysis applied to recover statistical association of spatially non-collocated variables, we apply different techniques, among them nearest-neighbour association, correlation of spatially aggregated means, cross-variography and categorical association. If successful, the result can be used for bivariate cross- and co-estimation of the variables. We demonstrate methodology and first results, which show that the statistical association is not quite easy to recover. Weak association has the consequence that estimation of one from the other implies high uncertainty. We also propose physical reasons for our findings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{the advent}} of agriculture, more than one-fourth of Earth's land surface has been {{converted}} for agricultural purposes, which conversion from natural to agricultural landscapes dramatically changes the plant communities that are integral to ecosystem processes. By developing perennial crops through breeding would help deal with the multiple issues involving environmental conservation and food security {{in a world of}} shrinking resources. It can provide multiple ecosystem services essential for sustainable production more effectively than production systems based on annual crops, such as protecting against soil erosion, conserving water and nutrients, storing more carbon <b>below</b> <b>ground,</b> and <b>building</b> better pest tolerance. This paper presents advantages of perennial crop system in ecological benefits, introduces the important role of perennial crop at the development of sustainable agriculture, and prospects the significant utilization and potential of perennial crop on sustainability of agriculture and environment...|$|R

Komín is situated {{in the eastern part}} of the given site. From a topographical point of view the area {{is located in}} the valley that descends from the east edge towards the west edge of the site. The current use of the area is mostly recreational gardening. The proposed urban design is based on the creation of two central residential areas, decomposing into two levels and representing two distinct dimensions platforms. The area is made by buildings for parking and residential houses. There are four types of buildings designed for parking - above the terrain, directly beneath apartment <b>buildings,</b> partly <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> level and totally <b>below</b> <b>ground.</b> Residential <b>buildings</b> are performed in two types - Type A and Type B. Type A has four floors and offers six residential units for twelve people. Type B has five floors and offers sixteen housing units for forty-eight people...|$|R
