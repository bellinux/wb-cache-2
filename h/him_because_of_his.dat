5|$|Persistently {{hampered}} by ankle and back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer. His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland {{and he was}} unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match. In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen. Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> action and avoid a potential run-in with umpires in England. Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959–60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

5|$|At the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart feels out {{of place}} among the other {{students}} with advanced academic skills. Meanwhile, Marge attempts to stimulate Bart with a little culture by taking the family to the opera. However, this proves disastrous as Bart and Homer are quite disruptive, much to Lisa's joy. Ostracized by his brilliant classmates, Bart visits his former school, where his old friends reject <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> perceived intelligence. On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> charisma. When they would ask {{what he did for}} a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books.

"He is more {{discreet}} {{than the}} run <b>of</b> them, sir. <b>His</b> parishioners dislike <b>him,</b> not <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> irregularities, but <b>because</b> he {{is attempting to}} obtain All Saints from his Lordship, in addition to St. Anne's.

5|$|The Second Triumvirate reacted {{by sending}} José de San Martín {{to take the}} command of the Army of the North, with Belgrano as his second in command. San Martín would {{reinforce}} the battle-weary Army of the North with his own soldiers. Hastened by Belgrano's illness, San Martín travelled to the rendezvous as quickly as possible; they met at the Yatasto relay, in Salta. Belgrano gave San Martin full freedom to implement changes, and took command of the First Regiment. The Second Triumvirate, and later the Supreme Director Gervasio Posadas, requested Belgrano to return to Buenos Aires and be judged for the defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, but San Martín refused to send <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poor health. San Martín finally agreed to send Belgrano to Córdoba by March 1814. He temporarily settled in Luján to await outcome of the trial, and during this time he wrote his autobiography. Soon afterwards, all charges against Belgrano were dismissed, as no definite accusation was formulated against him. The new government, trusting in Belgrano's diplomatic abilities, sent him {{on a mission to}} Europe to negotiate support for the independence of the United Provinces.|$|E
