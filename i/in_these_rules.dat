25|$|Rules {{three and}} five of the {{avoidance}} doctrine thus echo concerns addressed by the constitutional and prudential limitations of standing and ripeness. In some cases, the tenets of the avoidance doctrine addressed above— rules 1, 2, 3 and 5— may serve to buttress the conclusion that a case is not justiciable, or that a case is justiciable but the court will voluntarily decline to exercise its jurisdiction for prudential reasons.

25|$|In 2012, Albert Chan and Wong Yuk-man of People Power {{submitted}} {{a total of}} 1306 amendments to the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill, by which the government attempted to forbid lawmakers from participating in by-elections after their resignation. The bill {{was a response to}} the so-called 'Five Constituencies Referendum, in which 5 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp resigned and then joined the by-election, claiming that it would affirm the public's support to push forward the electoral reform. The pro-democracy camp strongly opposed the bill, saying it was seen a deprivation of the citizens' political rights. As a result of the filibuster, the LegCo carried on multiple overnight debates on the amendments. In the morning of 17 May 2012, the President of the LegCo (Jasper Tsang) terminated the debate, citing Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of LegCo: In any matter not provided for <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>Rules</b> of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures. In the end, all motions to amend the bill were defeated and the Bill was passed.|$|E
500|$|During the pre-scrutiny, the Masters of the Ceremonies prepare ballot papers {{bearing the}} words Eligo in Summum Pontificem ("I elect as Supreme Pontiff") and provide {{at least two}} to each {{cardinal}} elector. As the cardinals begin to write down their votes, the Secretary of the College of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations and the Masters of Ceremonies exit; the junior Cardinal Deacon then closes the door. The junior Cardinal Deacon then draws by lot nine names; the first three become Scrutineers, the second three Infirmarii and the last three Revisers. New Scrutineers, Infirmarii and Revisers are not selected again after the first scrutiny; the same nine cardinals perform the same task for the second scrutiny. After lunch, the election resumes with the oath to obey {{the rules of the}} conclave taken anew when the cardinals again assemble in the Sistine Chapel. Nine names are chosen for new scrutineers, infirmarii, and revisers. The third scrutiny then commences, and if necessary, a fourth immediately follows. [...] No changes <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>rules</b> were made by Benedict XVI in 2007.

5000|$|William Fife, Jr. [...] (15 June 1857 - 11 August 1944), {{also known}} as William Fife III, was the third {{generation}} {{of a family of}} Scottish yacht designers and builders. In his time, William Fife designed around 600 yachts, including two contenders for the America’s cup. The Royal Yachting Association was formed in 1875 to standardise rules, and Fife and his rival G.L. Watson, were instrumental <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>rule</b> changes.
