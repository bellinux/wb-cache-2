40|$|In this letter, a novel {{two-stage}} digital feed <b>forward</b> <b>carrier</b> recovery algorithm for 64 -ary quadrature {{amplitude modulation}} (QAM) is proposed and analyzed. Due {{to the absence}} of any feedback loop, the approach shows a high tolerance toward laser phase noise. Different steps involving partition, selection, and rotation of symbols are also discussed. For an OSNR penalty of 1 dB at bit error rate of 10 - 3, the proposed scheme can tolerate linewidth times symbol duration product equal to 3. 3 × 10 - 5 and hence can be used with the commercially available state-of-the-art tunable lasers for 64 -QAM transmission at 400 Gb/...|$|E

50|$|MMS {{messages}} are {{delivered in a}} different way from SMS. The first step is for the sending device to encode the multimedia content in a fashion similar to sending a MIME message (MIME content formats are defined in the MMS Message Encapsulation specification). The message is then <b>forwarded</b> to the <b>carrier's</b> MMS store and forward server, known as the MMSC (Multimedia Messaging Service Centre). If the receiver is on a carrier different from the sender, then the MMSC acts as a relay, and forwards the message to the MMSC of the recipient's carrier using the internet.|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{landing gear}} brakes, most large {{aircraft}} have {{other ways of}} decelerating. In aircraft, air brakes are aerodynamic surfaces that create friction, with the air flow causing the vehicle to slow. These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose air flow when extended and are flush with aircraft when retracted. Reverse thrust is also used in many aeroplane engines. Propeller aircraft achieve reverse thrust by reversing the pitch of the propellers, while jet aircraft do so by redirecting their engine exhaust <b>forwards.</b> On aircraft <b>carriers,</b> arresting gears are used to stop an aircraft. Pilots may even apply full forward throttle on touchdown, in case the arresting gear does not catch and a go around is needed.|$|R

By observing the time-resolved photoluminescence signal with a quantum-well probe inserted under the quantum structure at <b>forward</b> bias, the <b>carrier</b> transport time can be efficiently determined at room temperature. The averaged drift velocity shows linear dependence on the internal field, allowing us to estimate the quantum structure as a quasi-bulk material with low effective mobility containing the information of carrier dynamics. We show that this direct and real-time observation is more sensitive to carrier transport than other conventional techniques, providing better insights into microscopic carrier transport dynamics to overcome a device design difficulty...|$|R
