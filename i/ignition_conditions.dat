The LHD magnetic field has the excellent ability for the high energy particle confinements. This characteristic is studied by numerical computations of high energetic particles in the LHD magnetic field where the strong ICRF field is applied. It is shown by the Langevin equation analysis that the steady state distribution function of ICRF heated proton becomes to the quasilinear plateau distribution function (QPDF).

This has been one of the incentives that have led the Ignitor Project to adopt magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting cables in the machine design, a first in fusion research. Accordingly, the largest coils (about 5 m diameter) of the machine will be made entirely of MgB2 cables.|$|E

50|$|HCCI is more {{difficult}} to control than other combustion engines, such as SI and diesel. In a typical gasoline engine, a spark is used to ignite the pre-mixed fuel and air. In Diesel engines, combustion begins when the fuel is injected into pre-compressed air. In both cases, combustion timing is explicitly controlled. In an HCCI engine, however, the homogeneous mixture of fuel and air is compressed and combustion begins whenever sufficient pressure and temperature are reached. This means that no well-defined combustion initiator provides direct control. Engines must be designed so that <b>ignition</b> <b>conditions</b> occur at the desired timing. To achieve dynamic operation, the control system must manage the conditions that induce combustion. Options include the compression ratio, inducted gas temperature, inducted gas pressure, fuel-air ratio, or quantity of retained or re-inducted exhaust. Several control approaches are discussed below.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} serious and large scale attempts at an ICF driver design was the Shiva laser, a 20-beam neodymium doped glass laser system built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) that started operation in 1978. Shiva was a [...] "proof of concept" [...] design intended to demonstrate compression of fusion fuel capsules to many times the liquid density of hydrogen. In this, Shiva succeeded and compressed its pellets to 100 times the liquid density of deuterium. However, due to the laser's strong coupling with hot electrons, premature heating of the dense plasma (ions) was problematic and fusion yields were low. This failure by Shiva to efficiently heat the compressed plasma pointed {{to the use of}} optical frequency multipliers as a solution which would frequency triple the infrared light from the laser into the ultraviolet at 351 nm. Newly discovered schemes to efficiently frequency triple high intensity laser light discovered at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics in 1980 enabled this method of target irradiation to be experimented with in the 24 beam OMEGA laser and the NOVETTE laser, which was followed by the Nova laser design with 10 times the energy of Shiva, the first design with the specific goal of reaching <b>ignition</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

The propellant filling process and the purge process were confirmed, and each process was modeled. Moreover, we confirmed the processes of detonation wave generation and burned gas blowdown. In addition, we investigated the impact of shortening the passage width of a combustor and negative-time ignition (ignition time is earlier than the end-time of the propellant filling process) on the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) distance and time. The DDT distance did {{not depend on the}} passage width of a combustor and decreased under the negative-time <b>ignition</b> <b>condition.</b> With a passage width of 20 mm, the DDT distance decreased by 22 % under the negative-time <b>ignition</b> <b>condition</b> to a minimum value (76 Â± 8 mm). The DDT time from spark time reached a minimum value (69 Â± 14 Î¼s) under the condition of a passage width of 10 mm and negative-time ignition. The detonation initiation time and the DDT distance were represented by the time until the flame expanded toward the tube-axis one-dimensionally from ignition (characteristic time). We also carried out thrust measurement using a PDRE system composed of a circular cross-section combustor and the newly developed valve. We obtained a stable time-averaged thrust {{in a wide range of}} operation frequency (40 â€“ 160 Hz) and confirmed the increase of specific impulse due to a partial-fill effect.

40|$|The {{ignition}} {{of magnesium}} alloy chips {{is a problem}} during high speed dry machining in industry. It should be avoided in the practical production. Many factors including machining environment, material composition, tool geometry, cutting parameters etc. can influence the cutting processes.

However, very few reports about the <b>ignition</b> <b>conditions</b> of AM 50 A magnesium alloy are available.

One can thus envisage two extreme types of failure, ignition of the dust before cable failure and cable failure before the dust ignites due to its insulating and thermogenetic properties.
