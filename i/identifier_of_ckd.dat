40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 beta on the {{activity}} <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 alpha and other protein kinases that can bind this regulatory subunit {{is not fully}} understood. In an attempt to improve our understanding of this effect, chimeras <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 alpha and CK 1 alpha have been constructed. These chimeras contain different portions <b>of</b> the <b>CK</b> 2 alpha amino terminal region {{that are involved in}} the interaction with CK 2 beta to form CK 2 tetramers. In the case of chimeras 1 and 2, the portions <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 alpha replace the corresponding segments <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 alpha. In the case of chimera 3, the fragment <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 alpha is added to the whole CK 1 alpha molecule {{with the exception of the}} initial methionine. Chimera 3 has 8 % of {{the activity}} <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 alpha(WT), while chimeras 1 and 2 are 3 orders of magnitude less active than CK 1 alpha(WT). All three chimeras bind tightly to CK 2 beta, but only chimeras 1 and 2 are significantly stimulated in their capacity to phosphorylate casein and canonical peptide substrates by addition of the regulatory subunit. No stimulation was observed with phosvitin or non-canonical peptides derived from beta-catenin. CK 2 beta protects chimeras 1 and 2 from thermal inactivation. Chimera 2 can phosphorylate CK 2 beta and autophosphorylate; however, salt concentrations above 150 mM NaCl eliminate the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 beta but not the autophosphorylation of chimera 2.

40|$|CK 2 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} and constitutively active serine/threonine {{protein kinase}} that is implicated in many cellular functions.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{expression}} <b>of</b> creatine kinase (<b>CK)</b> and the accumulation of creatine phosphate during the differentiation of human and mouse peripheral blood monocytes. Mouse monocytes cultured for 24 h do not contain detectable levels <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> and creatine phosphate. However, resident tissue macrophages and inflammatory elicited macrophages obtained from the peritoneal cavities of mice have 70 and 300 mU per mg protein <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> activity and contain 3 and 6 mol of creatine phosphate per mol of ATP, respectively. The major isozyme <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> in these cells {{has been identified as}} the brain form. These findings suggest that the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages is associated with the expression <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> and the accumulation of creatine phosphate. We have found a similar pattern in human monocytes. Human blood monocytes, maintained in culture for 24 or 48 h, do not contain detectable levels <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> or creatine phosphate. Monocyte-derived macrophages (monocytes maintained in tissue cultures for 1 to 2 wk) have up to 100 mU per mg protein <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> activity and contain 0. 5 mol of creatine phosphate per mol of ATP. Human macrophages express multiple isozymes <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> including the brain (BB) and possibly the mitochondrial forms of this enzyme. Thus, the expression <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> and the accumulation of creatine phosphate in human monocytes is induced by their in vitro cultivation.

40|$|The {{involvement}} <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 (casein kinase 1) delta in {{the regulation}} of multiple cellular processes implies a tight regulation of its activity on many different levels. At the protein level, reversible phosphorylation {{plays an important role}} in modulating the activity <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 delta. In the present study, we show that PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), Akt (protein kinase B), CLK 2 (CDC-like kinase 2) and PKC (protein kinase C) alpha all phosphorylate CK 1 delta. PKA was identified as the major cellular CK 1 deltaCK (CK 1 delta C-terminal-targeted protein kinase) for the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 delta in vitro and in vivo. This was implied by the following evidence: PKA was detectable in the CK 1 deltaCK peak fraction of fractionated MiaPaCa- 2 cell extracts, PKA shared nearly identical kinetic properties with those <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 deltaCK, and both PKA and CK 1 deltaCK phosphorylated CK 1 delta at Ser 370 in vitro. Furthermore, phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 delta by PKA decreased substrate phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 delta in vitro. Mutation of Ser 370 to alanine increased the phosphorylation affinity <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 delta for beta-casein and the GST (gluthatione S-transferase) -p 53 1 - 64 fusion protein in vitro and enhanced the formation of an ectopic dorsal axis during Xenopus laevis development. Anchoring <b>of</b> PKA and <b>CK</b> 1 delta to centrosomes was mediated by AKAP (A-kinase-anchoring protein) 450. Interestingly, pre-incubation of MiaPaCa- 2 cells with the synthetic peptide St-Ht 31, which prevents binding between AKAP 450 and the regulatory subunit RII of PKA, resulted in a 6 -fold increase in the activity <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 delta. In summary, we conclude that PKA phosphorylates CK 1 delta, predominantly at Ser 370 in vitro and in vivo, and that site-specific phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 delta by PKA {{plays an important role in}} modulating CK 1 delta-dependent processes...|$|R

Materials The expression <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 17 and CK 13 was immu-nohistochemically examined in 105 patients with OSCC and 108 patients with leukoplakia. A correlation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> expression with clinicopathological variables was carried out. The over-expression levels <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 17 mRNA were ana-lyzed by real-time RT-PCR in 5 OSCC cell lines (HSC- 2, HSC- 3, SAS, SQUU-A, SQUU-B). Results CK 17 and CK 13 were detected in 101 (96. 2 %) and three (2. 9 %) of the 105 OSCCs, respectively. CK 17 was signiWcantly expressed in well-diVerentiated OSCC compared to moderately/poorly diVerentiated OSCC (p < 0. 01). As detected in 19 of the 34 dysplastic leukoplak-ias (55. 9 %) and 36 of the 74 hyperplastic leukoplakias (48. 6 %), CK 17 was signiWcantly expressed in dysplastic leukoplakias (p < 0. 01). As detected in 11 of the 34 dys-plastic (32. 4 %) and 52 of the 74 hyperplastic leukoplakias (70. 3 %), CK 13 was signiWcantly expressed in hyperplastic leukoplakias (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Protein kinase CK 2 is a serine/threonine kinase with a {{multitude}} of substrates and roles in many cellular processes, including mitosis. CK 2 is constitutively active, yet we hypothesize that CK 2 is indeed regulated in mitosis through subtle means, enabling CK 2 to perform its functions unique to cell division. Our aims were to examine the roles of mitotic phosphorylation, subcellular localization, and interplay with mitotic kinases in the regulation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 activity. We first examined the role of four highly conserved mitotic phosphorylation sites located in the unique C-terminus <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α. Phosphospecific antibodies generated against the sites show that CK 2 α phosphorylation is temporally regulated and occurs during prophase and metaphase during normal mitotic progression. Proper phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α is required for proper mitotic progression, as stable cell lines expressing phosphorylation site mutants <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α display severe mitotic defects. We next examined {{the impact of these}} phosphorylation events on the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2. We show that CK 2 α, but not CK 2 α’, localizes to the mitotic spindle. Localization <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α to the mitotic spindle is phosphodependent, and requires the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin 1. These results are a rare example of functional divergence between the two catalytic isoforms <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2, and suggest that the role <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α phosphorylation during mitosis is to promote localization <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 to the mitotic spindle. Finally, we examined the possibility that CK 2 activity during mitosis is regulated through hierarchal phosphorylation events, wherein CK 2 would phosphorylate proteins only after priming phosphorylation events catalyzed by other mitotic kinases, particularly Cdk 1. As this phenomenon has never been systematically investigated, we have investigated the consensus requirements for CK 2 primed phosphorylation, and in particular Cdk/CK 2 hierarchical phosphorylation. A genome-wide search for potential mitotic substrates matching the consensus sequence suggests that Cdk 1 /CK 2 hierarchical phosphorylation may indeed contribute to mitotic signaling, particularly on the mitotic spindle. Taken together, our results confirm the importance <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 in mitotic cell division, and highlight several examples of subtle regulation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2, through phosphorylation, subcellular localization, and interplay with other protein kinases. This helps explain how CK 2, a constitutively active kinase, can participate in tightly regulated cellular processes like mitosis...|$|R

40|$|Protein S-thiolation, the {{formation}} of mixed disulphides of cysteine residues in proteins with low-molecular-mass thiols, occurs under conditions associated with oxidative stress {{and can lead to}} modification of protein function. In the present study, we examined the site of S-thiolation of the enzyme creatine kinase (CK), an important source of ATP in myocytes. Inactivation of this enzyme is thought to {{play a critical role in}} cardiac injury during oxidative stress, such as during reperfusion injury. Reaction <b>of</b> rabbit <b>CK</b> M isoenzyme with GSSG, used to model protein S-thiolation, was found to result in enzyme inactivation that could be reversed by GSH or dithiothreitol. Measurement of GSH that is released during the thiolation reaction indicated that the maximum extent <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> thiolation was approx. 1 mol of GSH/mol of protein, suggesting thiolation on one reactive cysteine residue. Accordingly, matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization MS confirmed that the molecular mass <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> was increased, consistent with addition of one GSH molecule/molecule <b>of</b> <b>CK.</b> Using trypsin digestion, HPLC and MS analysis, the active-site cysteine residue (Cys(283)) was identified as the site of thiolation. Reversal of thiolation was shown to be rapid when GSH is abundant, rendering dethiolation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> thermodynamically favoured within the cell.

This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effects of food and sex on the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> and its metabolite 20 (S) -protopanaxadiol (PPD). Methods: An open-label, single-center, two-period crossover trial was performed in healthy Chinese subjects (n = 24; male = 12, female = 12), randomized to either the fasting overnight or the high-fat meal group before a single 200 mg dose <b>of</b> monomer <b>CK</b> was administered.

Results: A two-way ANOVA test combined with mean plots showed no statistically significant interaction between food and sex. High-fat meal accelerated the absorption <b>of</b> <b>CK,</b> with tmax being shortened from 3. 6 to 2. 5 h (p = 0. 015). In contrast, food significantly increased the Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf(p < 0. 001) with the 90 % confidence intervals falling outside of the conventional 0. 80 – 1. 25.

The purpose of the study was to characterise whether CK 2 contributes to the pathologic activation of fibroblasts in patients with SSc and to evaluate the antifibrotic potential <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 inhibition. METHODS Activation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2, JAK 2 and STAT 3 in human skin and in experimental fibrosis was analysed by immunohistochemistry. CK 2 signalling was inhibited by the selective CK 2 inhibitor 4, 5, 6, 7 -Tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB). The mouse models of bleomycin-induced and TGFβ receptor I (TBR) -induced dermal fibrosis were used to evaluate the antifibrotic potential <b>of</b> specific <b>CK</b> 2 inhibition in vivo. RESULT Increased expression <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 was detected in skin fibroblasts of SSc patients. Inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 by TBB abrogated the TGFβ-induced activation of JAK 2 /STAT 3 signalling and prevented the stimulatory effects of TGFβ on collagen release and myofibroblasts differentiation in cultured fibroblasts. Inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 prevented bleomycin-induced and TBR-induced skin fibrosis with decreased dermal thickening, lower myofibroblast counts and reduced accumulation of collagen. Treatment with TBB also induced regression of pre-established fibrosis. The antifibrotic effects of TBB were accompanied by reduced activation of JAK 2 /STAT 3 signalling in vivo. CONCLUSIONS We provide evidence that CK 2 is activated in SSc and contributes to fibroblast activation by regulating JAK 2 /STAT 3 signalling. Inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 reduced the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ and inhibited experimental fibrosis. Targeting <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 may thus be a novel therapeutic approach for SSc and other fibrotic diseases...|$|R

Results The immunohistochemical expression <b>of</b> nuclear <b>CK</b> 2 α was stronger in tumor tissues than in adenomas and normal colorectal tissues. Suppression <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α by small-interfering RNA or the CK 2 α activity inhibitor emodin inhibited proliferation of CRC cells, caused G 0 /G 1 phase arrest, induced cell senescence, elevated the expression of p 53 /p 21 and decreased the expression of C-myc. We also found that knockdown <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α suppressed cell motility and invasion. Significantly, CK 2 α inhibition resulted in β-catenin transactivation, decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail 1 and smad 2 / 3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that CK 2 α regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in cancer cells. Conclusions Our results indicate that CK 2 α plays an essential {{role in the development of}} CRC, and inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 α may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for human CRC. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{involvement}} <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 δ in {{the regulation}} of multiple cellular processes implies a tight regulation of its activity on different levels. At the protein level reversible phosphorylation {{plays an important role}} in modulating the activity <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 δ. In the present study, we show that PKA, Akt, CLK 2 and PKCα phosphorylate CK 1 δ. PKA was identified as the major cellular CK 1 δ C-terminal targeted protein kinase (CK 1 δCK) activity phosphorylating CK 1 δ in vitro and in vivo, since i) PKA is detectable in the CK 1 δCK kinase peak fraction of fractionated MiaPaCa- 2 cell extracts, ii) PKA shares nearly identical kinetic properties to CK 1 δCK and (iii) both, PKA and CK 1 δCK, phosphorylate CK 1 δ at Ser 370 in vitro. Furthermore, phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 δ by PKA decreases substrate phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 δ in vitro. Mutation of Ser 370 to alanine increases the affinity <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 δ to phosphorylate β-casein and the GST-p 53 1 - 64 } fusion protein in vitro and enhances the formation of an ectopic dorsal axis during Xenopus laevis development. Anchorage <b>of</b> PKA and <b>CK</b> 1 δ to centrosomes is mediated through AKAP 450. Interestingly, preincubation of MiaPaCa- 2 cells with the synthetic peptide St-Ht 31, which prevents the binding between AKAP 450 and the regulatory subunit RII of PKA, results in a 6 -fold increase of the activity <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 δ. In summary, we conclude that PKA phosphorylates CK 1 δ predominantly at Ser 370 in vitro and in vivo and that site-specific phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 δ by PKA {{plays an important role in}} modulating CK 1 δ dependent processes...|$|R

40|$|Protein kinase CK 2 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} serine/threonine kinase {{which is}} composed of two catalytic - or -subunits and two non-catalytic -subunits. CK 2 {{has been shown to}} be implicated in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and the development of certain organs but its role in basal differentiation processes is only sparsely analyzed. 3 T 3 -L 1 cells, which are murine pre-adipocytes, can be induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes within 2 weeks using a combination of insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine. We found that the activity <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 slightly increases until day 6 and subsequently, decreases in fully differentiated adipocytes. The decrease in activity goes along with a lower expression of all the three subunits <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2. After inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 with 2 -dimethylamino- 4, 5, 6, 7 - tetrabromo- 1 H-benzimidazole (DMAT) or 1, 2, 5, 8 -tetrahydroxyanthraquinone (quinalizarin), before day 6, 3 T 3 -L 1 cells did not differentiate into adipocytes; inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 after day 6 had no effect on the differentiation process. These results indicated a role <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 2 in early events of the differentiation process and that CK 2 is dispensable for late stages of differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK 1 ɛ) is {{involved}} in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, vesicle transport, {{and control of the}} circadian rhythm. Deregulation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 ɛ has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. To better understand the cell type–specific functions <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 ɛ, we determined its localization by immunhistochemistry in tissues of healthy, young adult BALB/c mice and in mammary tumors of SV 40 T-antigen–transgenic mice. CK 1 ɛ expression was found to be highly regulated in normal tissues of endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal origin and in neoplastic tissue of mammary cancer. The data presented here give an overview <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 ɛ reactivity in different organs under normal conditions and outline changes in its expression in mammary carcinomas. Our data suggest a cell/organ type–specific function <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 ɛ and indicate that tumorigenic conversion of mammary glands in SV 40 T-antigen–transgenic mice leads to downregulation <b>of</b> <b>CK</b> 1 ɛ.
