5|$|Bowerman and his athletes' {{philosophy}} and stories were documented by Kenny Moore.

5|$|During a {{match against}} Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1996, Wenger presided over Rice's {{caretaker}} duties at Arsenal, {{and ordered the}} team to switch from their preferred 3–5–2 formation to 4–4–2. The tactical change did not have its desired effect, as Arsenal lost the game having led before Wenger's half-time <b>instruction.</b> <b>For</b> much of the 1996–97 season, Arsenal continued to play 3–5–2 {{as it was the}} only formation the defenders were comfortable with, as well as injuries unsettling the side. In Wenger's second season at the club, he reinstated 4–4–2 and focused on strengthening the front six, by signing wingers Overmars and Luís Boa Morte and partnering Vieira with Petit. According to Jonathan Wilson, the system was similar to 4–3–3, as Overmars often pushed higher up the field and Parlour played alongside Vieira and Petit to solidify the midfield. Needing to compensate deficiencies in attack the following season, Wenger relied on his experienced defence to direct games, which conceded 17 goals in 38 league matches. From then on, Wenger deployed an unconventional 4–4–2 with a greater emphasis on attack and movement; his teams between 2001 and 2004 were dominant on the left flank.|$|E
