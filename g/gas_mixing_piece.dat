40|$|A novel {{experimental}} technique using a {{high speed}} Infrared (IR) camera {{combined with an}} improved Digital Image Analysis (DIA) method for non-invasive concentration measurement with high spatial and temporal resolution has recently been developed by Dang et al. (2013). This paper reports {{the extension of the}} IR technique to freely bubbling and turbulent fluidization regimes to investigate and quantify lateral <b>gas</b> <b>mixing</b> characteristics in gas–solid fluidized beds. The mechanism of lateral <b>gas</b> <b>mixing</b> in the bubbling regime studied with the novel technique is in good agreement with values reported in the literature. The experimental results, interpreted with a plug flow model with superimposed dispersion for a homogeneous flow, show that the lateral <b>gas</b> <b>mixing</b> coefficient first increases with the increase of superficial gas velocities from the bubbling to the turbulent flow regime and then decreases for even higher velocities, which is consistent with earlier literature studies. The dependency of the lateral <b>gas</b> <b>mixing</b> coefficient on the Reynolds number using Amos¿ correlation (Amos and Mineo, 1993) has shown large discrepancies at low gas velocities (where the equation was extrapolated), while a good match was obtained at higher gas velocities. The experimental findings reported in this paper indicate that the novel IR/DIA technique can successfully be applied for mass transfer and <b>gas</b> <b>mixing</b> studies in gas–solids multiphase flows...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is in two parts, the first part {{describes}} an investigation that was undertaken to determine the feasibility and hydrodynamic behaviour of a cold model circulating fluidized bed system proposed for the continuous combustion-gasification of biomass. The design {{is based on the}} principle that the char produced in the gasifier is circulated with the bed material and combusted in a separate reactor to generate the heat required for the gasification process. While high solid circulation rates are required to maintain the heat balance, product and flue <b>gas</b> <b>mixing</b> between the two units must be minimised or eliminated. The design of the circulating bed simply consists of two fluid bed units connected two together via a riser and a downcomer fitted with a non-mechanical valve. Various aspects such as solid circulation rate, <b>gas</b> <b>mixing,</b> solids mixing, and pressure component around the circulating ioop were studied. Results show that the solid circulation and <b>gas</b> <b>mixing</b> are strongly influenced by the riser gas velocity, total solids inventory, and position of the riser from the riser gas jet.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the examination of}} the evolution of biochemical, sensory and microbiological changes occurring in hake slices stored in modified atmospheres containing three <b>gas</b> <b>mixes.</b> It also shows how these changes relate to changes in the concentrations of the <b>gas</b> <b>mixes</b> in the tray packs during storage. At the outset of storage, there was a pronounced drop in the level of CO 2, associated with lowering of the pH and lower scores for texture in sensory inspection. Nevertheless, by the end of storage, CO 2 concentrations had increased. This was associated with growth of Enterobacteriaceae and with more pronounced decreases of O 2, which is consumed by these microorganisms. Weight loss was greater in the atmosphere-stored lots, possibly due to the action of CO 2. TMA-N and TVB-N began to increase on days 10 and 13 of storage and reached the permitted limits on days 17 and 20. Our analyses revealed no appreciable differences of performance between the different <b>gas</b> <b>mixes,</b> possibly because the gas levels were very similar in the various lots throughout storage. © Springer-Verlag 2003.
