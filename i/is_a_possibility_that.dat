5|$|In February 2017, James Mangold {{stated that}} with the {{introduction}} of Laura / X-23 in Logan, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the character will appear in future films. Later that month, Kinberg said that a film for Laura Kinney / X-23 is in development. By October of the same year, it was announced that script is being co-written by Craig Kyle and James Mangold; creator of the character, and director of The Wolverine and Logan, respectively.|$|E
5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, {{it is also possible that}} they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward over the Pacific Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, when it began a turn to the east. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the depression completed a small loop between the downgrade and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> {{he or she may}} be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal {{plaintiff}} in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing {{on the part of the}} individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1995, the band {{underwent}} changes on the business side. Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company. Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager, a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company, to be the band's new creative manager. As with Max Norman before him, Prager {{would go on to}} be highly influential in shaping the direction of the band. In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner, Mustaine revealed that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Megadeth are going to perform the album in its entirety in 2014, honoring the 20-year anniversary of the record's release.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} is regarded {{to have been}} the gravest threat to the Scottish kingdom since John, King of England's (d. 1216) northern campaigning and invasion in 1216. Although Óláfr's restoration on Mann was claimed as a success by the Norwegians, it was probably accepted gladly by the Scots as well; considering Óláfr's familial relationship with Alexander's protégé Ferchar and the consolidation of the Crovan dynasty after years of chaos. Óláfr consequently ruled the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully until his death, seven years later. At some point during his reign, he is known to have granted certain commercial rights and protections to the monks of the monastery of Holm Cultram. The chronicle states that he died on St Patrick's Isle on 21 May 1237 and was buried at St Mary's Abbey, Rushen. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> a coffin-lid or grave-slab found at Rushen may be associated with Óláfr, or of two of his sons who are known to have been buried there (Rögnvaldr and Magnús).|$|E

50|$|In the DLC fighter pack 1 trailer for Injustice 2. There are six sillouette {{characters}} in the background. With one that looks similar to Raiden. Meaning there might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Raiden will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> future DLC character in Injustice 2.|$|R
25|$|With music sales {{moving towards}} {{file-based}} playback and streaming {{and away from}} CDs, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the loudness war will be blunted by normalization technology such as ReplayGain and Apple's Sound Check. Most cloud-based music services perform loudness normalization by default and may reduce the market pressure to overcompress material.|$|E
25|$|First {{described}} by Eastman in 1904, this species was found localized in present-day Colorado. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> this species is similar, if not identical, to B. nitida, however because the material available regarding B. coloradensis is fragmented, {{it is impossible}} to compare the two species with any degree of certainty.|$|E
25|$|Based on this inscription, {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the temple was completed in 999 CE or 1002 CE. However, according to art historian Shobita Punja, the temple referred to in this record {{may or may not}} be the Vishvanatha temple. According to her, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Dhanga built two temples, one with a stone linga and another with an emerald linga.|$|E
50|$|Newcastle Corporation {{acquired}} Blackfriars in {{the early}} 1950s. At one time there appeared to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the Dominicans might return to occupy Blackfriars, but this did not happen. The guild of Tailors, among others, continued to meet at Blackfriars until 1974.|$|R

25|$|Double-blind {{methods can}} be applied to any {{experimental}} situation in which there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the results will be affected by conscious or unconscious bias on the part of researchers, participants, or both. For example, in animal studies, both the carer of the animals and the assessor of the results have to be blinded; otherwise the carer might treat control subjects differently and alter the results.|$|E
25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{are known}} for being {{gigantic}} Ichthyosaurs. According to the paleontologist Michael Maisch, species of Temnodontosaurus were large, exceeding 12 meters (39ft) in length. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> they reached a similar size to another giant Ichthyosaur, Shonisaurus popularis, which was previously considered the largest ichthyosaur. There {{seems to be a}} general consensus between paleontologists that they could at least have reached 9m.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{causes of}} {{congenital}} anomalies include inheritance of abnormal genes {{from the mother}} or the father, {{as well as new}} mutations in one of the germ cells that gave rise to the fetus. Male germ cells mutate at a much faster rate than female germ cells, and as the father ages, the DNA of the germ cells mutates quickly. If an egg is fertilized with sperm that has damaged DNA, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the fetus could develop abnormally.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2004, Japan and US {{extended}} {{discussions on}} potential cooperative {{efforts on the}} P-X and US Navy's Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) programmes; options ranged from terminating the P-X program {{to participate in the}} US-led MMA program to incorporating some of the MMA's technology onto the P-X to reduce costs. The Japanese Defence Ministry ultimately opted to persist with the P-X program, stating that: [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> foreign aircraft would not satisfy the required capability and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> foreign aircraft would not meet the required period of introduction...it is necessary to domestically develop the aircraft". In addition to the P-1, studies were also conducted into the use of ship-based UAVs to support maritime aviation activities.|$|R
25|$|On 11 May 2016, the U.S. Army {{disclosed}} that the JLTV {{is to be}} used as the platform for the upcoming Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV) program rather than procuring a new system. The LRV is to be an off-road platform for carrying a suite of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors; it is to be light enough to be carried by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The JLTV has been described as an interim LRV solution, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> evaluation of JLTV in the LRV role will determine if a change is necessary.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{possible}} mutations that occurs is the replacement of a single nucleotide, known as a point mutation. If a point mutation occurs within an expressed region of a gene, an exon, then this will change the codon specifying a particular amino acid in the protein produced by that gene. Despite the redundancy in the genetic code, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> this mutation will then change the amino acid that is produced during translation, {{and as a consequence}} the structure of the protein will be changed.|$|E
25|$|A seventh-generation Ford Taurus was {{unveiled}} at the 2015 Shanghai Auto Show in April 2015. It bears a closer {{resemblance to the}} current Ford Fusion/Mondeo but with an extended wheelbase and is unique to the Mainland Chinese market. Designed in conjunction with Ford Australia and currently manufactured by Changan Ford Automobile Co., Ltd. in Hangzhou, it comes in two engine variants paired with either 2.0T EcoBoost engine or twin-turbo 2.7T V6 EcoBoost engine. Although this particular model is not currently manufactured outside China, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> it will be exported to other markets in the near future.|$|E
