[...] He has a fourth pitch, a slider, that lacks consistent break and darts horizontally {{similar to the}} cutter. [...] Wacha attributed the increase in pitch velocity to gaining weight from physical exercise and increased food consumption, asserting that he [...] "felt like the velocity just kept on increasing every single year. [...] I changed my mechanics a little bit when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>college,</b> and that might have added a few ticks."

500|$|Azaria {{attended}} The Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills. He {{decided to}} become an actor after performing in a school play {{at the age of}} 16, becoming, at the expense of his academic studies, [...] "obsessed with acting." [...] Both of his parents loved all forms of show business, which further spurred him to become an actor. He studied drama at Tufts University from 1981 to 1985, where he met and befriended actor Oliver Platt and noted that [...] "Oliver was a better actor than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>college,</b> and he really inspired me." [...] Together they both starred in various college stage productions, including The Merchant of Venice, before Azaria trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Although he did not expect the endeavor to be successful, Azaria {{decided to become}} a professional actor, so that later in his life, he would not regret not having tried. Azaria's first acting job was an advertisement for Italian television when he was seventeen years old. He also worked as a busboy. Azaria originally intended to work predominantly as a theatrical actor, and he and Platt set up their own company, named Big Theatre, although Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter was the only thing they ever performed. He decided that television was a better arena and offered more opportunity so, after being offered work with talent agent Harry Gold, Azaria moved to Los Angeles.|$|E

And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
