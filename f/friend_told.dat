5|$|On October 22, Schlesselman and Cowart {{shot at a}} {{glass window}} {{on the front door}} of the Allen Baptist Church in Brownsville, Tennessee. The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell casings to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E
5|$|Nicks {{writes that}} Manning would travel back to Washington, D.C., for visits. An ex-boyfriend helped her {{find her way}} around the city's gay community, {{introducing}} her to lobbyists, activists, and White House aides. Back at Fort Drum, she continued to display emotional problems and, by August 2009, had been referred to an Army mental-health counselor. A <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Nicks that Manning could be emotionally fraught, describing an evening they had watched two movies together—The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark—after which Manning cried for hours. By September 2009 her relationship with Watkins was in trouble; they reconciled for a short time, but it was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|The raid on bin Laden's {{compound}} in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. U.S. military {{officials said that}} after the raid U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried him at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition. According to Carlotta Gall, a Pakistani official (to whom she later clarified {{that she did not}} speak, the information coming through a <b>friend),</b> <b>told</b> her that a senior U.S. official had told him that the United States had direct evidence that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, but ISI, Pasha and officials in Washington all denied this.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 Spain, a {{young girl}} named Laura is adopted. Years later, adult Laura (Belén Rueda) returns to the closed orphanage, {{accompanied}} by her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their seven-year-old son, Simón (Roger Príncep). She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. Simón claims to have befriended a boy named Tomás, and draws pictures {{of him as a}} child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) visits the house to inquire after Simón, and the audience learn that Laura and Carlos adopted Simón and that he is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. Later that night Laura finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, Simón teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to Simón's adoption file. Simón becomes angry, and says that his new <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> him that Laura is not his biological mother and {{that he is going to}} die soon.|$|E
5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} Connecticut official, State Senator George Gunther, and Andy Kosch, a {{high school}} science teacher, pilot, and Whitehead researcher, said that they heard about yet another photograph. They were told that a sea captain named Brown had made a logbook entry describing Whitehead flying over Long Island Sound and had even photographed the airplane in flight. A <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Kosch {{that he had found}} the captain's leather-bound journal containing a photo of Whitehead in flight and a description of the event. After some difficulty Kosch made contact with the owners of the journal, but they told him it was lost.|$|E
50|$|My <b>Friends</b> <b>Told</b> Me About You charts {{the journey}} of {{a man at the}} {{beginning}} of a downward spiral. Paranoia, confusion, and anger start to color all that he knows to be true and as reality blurs with his subconscious fears, an alternate world propelled by violence and mistrust begins to take over. As sonic as it is visual, Dengler also composed the original score for My <b>Friends</b> <b>Told</b> Me About You in collaboration with acclaimed English clarinetist Ian Mitchell.|$|R

500|$|Duane L. Weber was a World War II Army {{veteran who}} served time {{in at least}} six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for {{burglary}} and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, [...] "I am Dan Cooper." [...] The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, a <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found Max Gunther's book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.|$|E
500|$|James Madigan, {{the visual}} effects supervisor, {{approached}} the series as a feature film, observing that [...] "every {{aspect of the}} production took meticulous care with every detail, the costumes, the set dressing, the acting, and the attention to historical fact. As you worked on it, you really got the feeling that Rome was {{going to look like}} something we had never seen on TV before, so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that." [...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI. A <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> Madigan that after seeing the pilot, [...] "he didn’t see any vfx shots, even though there are dozens of shots throughout episode 1. That means we did our job well." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences {{in their own}} lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters. The idea of Homer annoying {{the people at the}} movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until I see you burn in hell." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think she}} has been very rude {{to a lot of}} people in the past, on her way up – very terse," [...] a <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> the Observer. [...] "She doesn't do small talk.

[...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Police {{were unable}} to recover any {{fingerprints}} from the well-oiled grip of the pistol, and a paraffin test for gunshot residue was not performed on Danna or Sharon Kinne. Multiple people, including family and neighbors, told police that James had often allowed Danna to play with his guns, and in a test by investigating officers, Danna proved able {{to pull the trigger}} on a gun matching the one that had killed her father. With no evidence to the contrary, investigators ruled the case an accidental homicide. The pistol that killed James Kinne was taken into police custody and never returned to the widow, despite her efforts to reclaim it; she later had a male friend secretly buy her a [...]22 caliber automatic pistol. When the <b>friend</b> <b>told</b> her that he had registered the gun in her name, she requested that he re-register it under a name other than hers.|$|E
2500|$|Many urban legends are {{essentially}} extended jokes, told {{as if they}} were true events.

2500|$|However, {{because of}} Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and {{his focus on}} nature and cosmology, he was not {{accepted}} or understood by most of his colleagues.

2500|$|While {{a student}} in Augsburg, he {{appeared}} in student theatrical productions as an actor and singer, and became a skilled violinist and organist. He also developed an interest, which he retained, in microscopes and telescopes.

2500|$|After {{more than}} nine hours of searching, rescue teams {{pulled out of the}} mine at about 3:40a.m. Tuesday, January 3.
