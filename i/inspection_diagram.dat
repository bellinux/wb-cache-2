40|$|Although {{security}} inspections {{have proven}} to be a very efficient means for assuring software security early in the software development lifecycle, they are not used extensively because they usually need to be performed by security experts, who are few and thus expensive. Adoption of security inspections could be facilitated if one could encapsulate the expertise and experience of security experts as guidance for security inspections performed by software developers. Our approach to addressing this challenge consists of two different kinds of reading support that provide the required guidance to software developers: Vulnerability <b>Inspection</b> <b>Diagram</b> (VID) and Security Inspection Scenario (SIS). In this article, we sketch our initial experimental evaluation of VIDs and SIS with a group of software developers of an industrial project partner. We present the setup and the experiment's results. In addition, we describe the implications of our results on future work regarding the approach and further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Software {{inspections}} {{have attracted}} much attention over the last 25 years. It is a method for static analysis of artefacts during software development. However, few studies look at <b>inspections</b> of entity-relationship <b>diagrams</b> (ER-diagrams), and in particular {{an evaluation of the}} number of defects, number of false-positives and the types of defects that are found by most reviewers. ER-diagrams are commonly used in the design of databases, which makes them an important modelling concept for many large software systems. This paper presents a large empirical study (486 subjects) where checklists were used for an inspection. The goodness in the evaluation is judged based on the type of defects the reviewers identify and the relationship between the detection of real defects and false positives. It is concluded that checklist-based <b>inspections</b> of entity-relationship <b>diagrams</b> is worthwhile. 1...|$|R
30|$|Through {{the use of}} the IMID {{technique}} in Sprints 4 and 5, we noticed that the technique achieved the goal of detecting defects in interaction models. With this technique, the interaction models are improved so that defects cannot propagate from the defects found within the model, as observed in the design phase of Sprint 3. Therefore, this technique can help practitioners, since it was useful for the <b>inspection</b> of MoLIC <b>diagrams.</b>|$|R

40|$|A crucial {{stage of}} the {{remanufacturing}} process is the inspection procedure. Surveys {{carried out in the}} automotive remanufacturing sector show that the industry is concerned about the need this causes for a large amount of specialist skills. Despite this, there has been little research into what is actually involved in the inspection process and its outcomes. This paper presents case-based research that was carried out on the inspection procedures of both electronic and mechanical product remanufacturers. It presents generic <b>inspection</b> process <b>diagrams,</b> produced using case studies in UK companies engaged in remanufacturing activities. The models provide a greater understanding of the remanufacturing inspection procedures currently used. The models were tested with additional case studies.

40|$|SUMMARY Software {{inspection}} is {{a widely}} acknowledged effective quality improvement method in software development by detecting defects involved in software artifacts and removing them. In research on software inspection, constructing computer supported inspection systems is a major topic in the field. A lot of systems have been reported. However few inspection support systems for model diagrams, especially UML diagrams, have been emerged. We identified four key requirements an inspection support system for UML diagrams should have. They are as follows: 1) direct annotations are given to model diagrams, 2) version management is provided so that evolution of artifacts can be managed, 3) the whole inspection process should be supported, 4) horizontal and vertical readings are supported. This paper describes design and implementation of our inspection support system for UML diagrams to realize the four requirements. key words: software <b>inspection,</b> UML <b>diagrams,</b> distributed software development 1...|$|R
40|$|To date, the CoRoT space {{mission has}} {{produced}} more than 124, 471 light curves. Classifying these curves in terms of unambiguous variability behavior is mandatory for obtaining an unbiased statistical view on their controlling root-causes. The present study {{provides an overview of}} semi-sinusoidal light curves observed by the CoRoT exo-field CCDs. We selected a sample of 4, 206 light curves presenting well-defined semi-sinusoidal signatures. The variability periods were computed based on Lomb-Scargle periodograms, harmonic fits, and visual <b>inspection.</b> Color-period <b>diagrams</b> for the present sample show the trend of an increase of the variability periods as long as the stars evolve. This evolutionary behavior is also noticed when comparing the period distribution in the Galactic center and anti-center directions. These aspects indicate a compatibility with stellar rotation, although more information is needed to confirm their root-causes. Considering this possibility, we identified a subset of three Sun-like candidates by their photometric period. Finally, the variability period versus color diagram behavior was found to be highly dependent on the reddening correction. Comment: 12 pages, 16 figures, A&A accepte...|$|R
40|$|Discussion {{can lead}} to learning. Through {{discussion}} people can learn about other viewpoints and arguments, or construct new ideas together. However, discussion can also be difficult, due to problems with argumentation and collaboration. This dissertation investigates how argumentative diagrams can support collaborative argumentation-based learning. Argumentative diagrams are two-dimensional diagrams in which arguments are placed in boxes, and arrows are used to relate these arguments. In four studies secondary school students collaboratively discussed a problem in dyads using chat and diagram in an electronic environment. Students' interaction processes in chat and diagram were analysed to address how they contribute to broadening and deepening the discussion. The task, the goal of discussion, {{and the type of}} tool all influence students' collaborative argumentation-based learning. A more important factor proved to be how students used the diagram in their discussion. Students used the diagram for example to copy information, to structure their argument, or to communicate new ideas. In general, students were not very apt at <b>diagram</b> construction and <b>inspection.</b> A <b>diagram's</b> affordances, such as structure and overview, were not used to their full potential. Schools should pay more attention to using diagrams. This would not only improve discussions, but also more general skills of structure and analysis...|$|R
40|$|Diagrammatic {{reasoning}} {{is a type}} of reasoning in which the primary means of inference is direct manipulation and <b>inspection</b> of a <b>diagram.</b> Diagrammatic {{reasoning is}} prevalent in human problem solving behavior, especially for problems involving spatial relations among physical objects. Our research examines the relationship between diagrammatic and symbolic reasoning in a computational framework. We have built a system, called REDRAW, that emulates the human capability for reasoning with pictures in civil engineering. The class of structural analysis problems chosen provides a realistic domain whose solution process requires domain-specific knowledge as well as pictorial reasoning skills. We hypothesize that diagrammatic representations provide an environment where inferences about the physical results of proposed structural configurations can take place in a more intuitive manner than that possible through purely symbolic representations. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the stage of {{lactation}} upon the ingestive behavior nycterohemerat patterns were evaluated with eight dairy cows eating a corn silage based diet. Spectral analysis was performed through application of the finite Fourier transformation upon hourly duration of eating or ruminating time series. Variance analysis and <b>inspection</b> of phase <b>diagrams</b> and periodograms were done upon modified data. The mean meal duration and dry matter intake were larger while the unitary ruminating time was inferior at the beginning than {{at the end of}} the lactation. Nycterohemeral patterns of time spent eating or ruminating at the beginning and at the end of lactation followed mainly periodicities of, respectively, 24, 12, 8 and 4 hours and 24, 12 and 8 hours. A significant effect of stage of lactation was observed at the rhythm component 4 for both time spent eating and ruminating. Lactation stage affected some parameters of ingestive behavior and its rhythmicity patterns...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{processing and analysis}} of semi-local OBS-data shot along a 122 km profile in the VÃ¸ring Basin, NE Atlantic margin, using both a high-frequency/short shot-spacing and a low-frequency/long shot-spacing air-gun source. Spectral {{analysis of the data}} reveals that an important difference between the two sources used, is that the low-frequency source generates significantly more energy around 6 Hz. This higher content of very low frequencies allows detection of arrivals to larger offsets for the low-frequency source. For the nearest offsets (0 â 20 km) the high-frequency source is able to resolve some more details than the low-frequency source, as far as the shallow to intermediate sedimentary levels are concerned. This is mainly caused {{by the fact that the}} high-frequency source has a much sharper primary pulse and reduced bubble pulse compared to the low-frequency source. The data quality can be significantly enhanced by use of band-pass filtering, trace mixing, FK (velocity) filtering, minimum phase predictive deconvolution, as well as Radon filtering. <b>Inspection</b> of particle <b>diagrams</b> documents S-wave splitting, interpreted as microcracks aligned vertically in the sedimentary section by the present day (slightly compressive) stress-field.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of colossal magnetoresistance in manganites is generally {{agreed to be}} a result of competition between crystal phases with different electronic, magnetic, and structural order; a competition which can be strong enough to cause phase separation between metallic ferromagnet and insulating charge modulated states. Nevertheless, closer <b>inspection</b> of phase <b>diagrams</b> in many manganites reveals complex phases where the two order parameters of magnetism and charge modulation unexpectedly coexist. Here we show that such experiments can be naturally explained within a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory. In contrast to models where phase separation originates from disorder or as a strain induced kinetic phenomenon, we argue that magnetic and charge modulation coexist in new thermodynamic phases. This leads to a rich diagram of equilibrium phases, qualitatively similar to those seen in experiment. The success of this model argues for a fundamental reinterpretation of the nature of charge modulation in these materials from a localised to a more extended "charge density wave" picture. The same symmetry considerations that favour textured coexistance of charge and magnetic order may apply to many electronic systems with competing phases. The resulting "Electronically soft" phases of matter with incommensurate, inhomogeneous and mixed order may be general phenomena in correlated systems. Comment: 13 pages 4 figure...|$|R
3000|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a PP-CA model to {{determine}} interactions between vehicle types for the given traffic flow conditions. Hence, this model was first validated using visual <b>inspection</b> and fundamental <b>diagram</b> (q-Ï [...] a [...]) and then by comparing pair-wise simulated and observed interactions between vehicles types. For estimating interactions, whenever a vehicle was found to be following or overtaking another vehicle, it was considered to be interacting with that vehicle. Therefore, a vehicle in measurement region can have 0, 1, 2 or 3 interactions based on the type of vehicles and the minimum gaps to the sides and front. If one vehicle is followed by another and at the same time overtaken by the third, it would have two interactions. Similarly, if there was only one vehicle in the frame the number of interactions would be zero. Vehicles travelling side by side (with overlap > 50 %) and having different speeds were also considered to be involved in overtaking even if the overtaking manoeuvre could not be completed in the video. These interactions were grouped by vehicle types and expressed as the ratio of the number of vehicles interacting to that observed for that vehicle type. Here, vehicles with gap more than 60 Â m were not assumed to be following. Similarly, the vehicles with longitudinal overlaps were considered as overtaking or overtaken.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} in the tuning of phase-locked loops (PLLs) for power electronic converters. PLLs are implemented inside a higher level controller to estimate the grid-voltage phase angle and then control the energy transfer between the power converter and the ac mains. The tuning of the PLL is not a trivial task, particularly when considering power-quality phenomena. In a general way, PLLs with a low bandwidth (low-gain PLLs) are required when handling distorted voltages. It is analytically demonstrated in this paper that low-gain PLLs have more tradeoffs than high-gain PLLs (e. g., PLLs for communications); {{it is not possible}} to optimize the settling time for a phase jump without making slower the PLL response to frequency variations. Existing tuning methods do not take into account low-gain features, which may result in nonoptimum designs. The proposed PLL tuning methodology is based on <b>inspection</b> of frequency-domain <b>diagrams</b> and, contrary to the other existing tuning methods, takes into account "low-gain" dynamics. It assures an optimized performance in the presence of any kind of disturbances in the grid. From a practical point of view, the proposed tuning procedure is very intuitive for controller designs. Some significant design examples and experimental results, obtained from a discrete implementation (dSpace platform), are provided in order to validate the theoretical approache...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} Fabry-PÃ©rot (FP) cavity [see Fig. 1 (a) ] is a {{generalization of}} the classic diffusive Kerr slice with a single feedback mirror [1, 2]. Such apparent simplicity is deceptive. Historically, analysis of the FP geometry {{has proved to be}} a non-trivial problem [3]: it is the epitome of a complex system capturing the interplay between diffraction (in the free-space path), counter-propagating fields, transverse diffusion of carriers (driven by local incoherent light intensity) and a host of cavity effects (periodic pumping, mirror losses, and interferomic mistuning). In addition, phenomena can be present on several distinct time-scales. We have considered an instantaneous medium response in the plane-wave limit (where transverse effects such as diffraction and diffusion have been neglected). Even with these simplifications the FP cavity routinely exhibits remarkably complicated dynamics. The behaviour has been investigated as functions of system parameters (such as slice reflectivity and mistuning) using time series to visualize phase-space attractor geometries. Careful <b>inspection</b> of bifurcation <b>diagrams</b> [see Fig. 1 (b) ] has also shown that Ikeda-type instabilities [4] can dominate the system response. These plane-wave results are expected to play a key role in the subsequent analysis of spontaneous spatial pattern-forming instabilities. References [1] G. DâAlessandro and W. J. Firth, Phys. Rev.
