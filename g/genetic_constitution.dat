Inheritance of this trait was studied using two white-flowered chickpea genotypes, P 9623 and RS 11, and one blue-flowered genotype, T 39 - 1. The <b>genetic</b> <b>constitutions</b> of the white flower colors of P 9623 and RS 11 were different, for in an earlier study their F 1 produced pink flowers. The two F 1 s of the crosses P 9623 x T 39 - 1 and RS 11 x T 39 - 1 also produced pink flowers. Each of the two F 2 populations segregated in 9 pink: 3 blue: 4 white-flowered plants.

30|$|Two shell color morphs of Corbicula clam {{have already}} been {{described}} {{from a number of}} regional populations, such as North America (Hillis and Patton [1982]; Siripattrawan et al.

It was inferred that not only environmental condition but also the different <b>genetic</b> <b>constitutions</b> resulted in {{the differences between the two}} color morphs (Qiu et al. [2001]), especially for those sympatric individuals. Most researchers have reached an agreement that the two morphotypes should be relegated to two separate species, for C. fluminea (white morph) and C. leana (purple morph) (Choe et al. [1999]; Kwon et al. [2001]; Park et al. [2002]). In Datong Lake, two sympatric shell color morphs were generally to be identified as C. fluminea on account of their similar external shell morphology (Li et al. [2011], [2013]). Similar results of C. fluminea have also been reported in Sichuan Province, China (Qiu et al. [2001]). Morphological analysis in the present study further supported that there were no significant differences between the two color morphs except for their different internal color in Datong Lake. This was inconsistent with that in Sichuan Province (Qiu et al. [2001]), in which the three ratios of SW/SL, SW/SH, and SW/(SL[*]+[*]SH[*]+[*]SW) were significantly larger in white morph than in purple morph. Therefore, these results supported the assumption that the origin of differences between two color morphs should have been derived from <b>genetic</b> <b>constitutions.</b>|$|R

Results Microspreads of fetal and neonatal ovarian cells underwent immunocytochemistry for meiosis- and apoptosis-related markers. COR- 1 (meiosis-specific) highlighted axial elements of the synaptonemal complex and allowed definitive identification of the stages of meiotic prophase I.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analize the inheritance of characters in wheat using multivariate analysis of variance. Sixteen <b>genetic</b> <b>constitutions</b> were evaluated between commercial cultivars and progenies F 1 and F 2. Treatments were arranged in completely randomized blocks, with three replicates. Five characters were evaluated. Multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate contrasts were then performed to test the hypotheses. The significant differences, obtained for comparison between parents and progenies F 1, may be evidence of heterosis occurrence. However, only comparisons between progenies P 1 _P 3 (F 1) vs. P 1 _P 3 (F 2) and P 4 _P 2 (F 1) vs. P 4 _P 2 (F 2) showed significant differences. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that inheritance of the characters studied is predominantly of the additive type. It is possible that, this occurred due to the degree of relationship between parents who reunited identical alleles at the same locus, by ancestry, as a result of inbreeding effects. The knowledge of additive inheritance may represent a faster incorporation of resistance or quality characteristics in new cultivars...|$|R
