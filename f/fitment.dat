5|$|MY09: {{models were}} {{launched}} on 15 March 2008. Six airbags were made standard across the rangeâ€”Omega and SV6 variants were previously fitted with two and four airbags respectively. Omega models also received standard <b>fitment</b> of air conditioning, 16-inch alloy wheels, body colour wing mirrors and door handles, {{and a new}} grille insert with chrome highlights. Revised alloy wheel designs were featured on the Calais (seven-spoke) and Calais V (10-spoke).|$|E
5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard <b>fitment</b> across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a crash safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
5|$|The VT heralded the <b>fitment</b> of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E

50|$|In November 2007, MK Electric, the {{manufacturer}} of consumer electrical <b>fitments</b> in the UK, adopted EnOcean technology for a wireless switches.|$|R
5000|$|Some [...] "aftermarket" [...] are/were also {{available}} {{as original equipment}} manufacturer (OEM) <b>fitments,</b> with BBS being a notable original equipment supplier to Volkswagen.|$|R
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard <b>fitment</b> as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
25|$|Requires <b>fitment</b> of {{refueling}} probes {{to receiving}} aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Bosch ESP5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), and Brake Assist (BA) was {{standard}} <b>fitment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: German Army Boxer in {{ambulance}} configuration. The German and Dutch base {{vehicles are}} virtually identical, mission modules and <b>fitments</b> {{the only significant}} difference ...|$|R
50|$|Safety {{equipment}} on the all-new WR-V include Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), Dual SRS front airbags, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), which are offered as standard <b>fitments</b> across all variants.|$|R
50|$|The Saracen was in turn {{used as an}} {{armoured}} personnel carrier, armoured {{command vehicle}} and ambulance. The FV 603 model saw many variants in detail, including radio or command <b>fitments</b> and specialist equipment for artillery or signals use.|$|R
25|$|<b>Fitment</b> of TASS Balises and Gauging/Structure works {{proposed}} by the open operator GNER (Alliance Rail) to enable tilt operation of Pendolino trains north of Darlington station, supporting its aspirations for express 3hr43min London to Edinburgh Services.|$|E
25|$|Two IL-18Ds {{modified}} as fishery {{reconnaissance aircraft}} for the Polar Institute of Oceanic Fishery and Oceanography, the modification mainly involved the <b>fitment</b> of specialised mission equipment. First flown in 1985 they were later modified back as standard Il-18Ds.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s saw the {{introduction}} of a policy to offer an engine <b>fitment</b> on a much wider range of civil aircraft types, with the company's engines now powering 17 different airliners (and their variants) compared to General Electric's 14 and Pratt & Whitney's 10.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} between the Project 15A Kolkata-class destroyer and the Project 15B Visakhapatnam-class destroyer are not much since they both share the same hull design. Its however in the internal <b>fitments</b> that separates the 2 destroyer class.|$|R
50|$|Unveiled in 2014, Z Tyre is {{the private}} tyre brand of Zenises. Designed and {{produced}} for high performance cars and SUV <b>fitments</b> Z Tyre now counts {{a range of}} over 70 dimensions and also incorporates run-flat technology tyres.|$|R
50|$|By {{providing}} interior spaces {{with different}} ambient qualities for the users open floor plans with interleaving rooms were created. For {{many of his}} buildings Lee himself {{took care of the}} interior design. Numerous designs for furniture, lighting, and other <b>fitments</b> were created.|$|R
25|$|That civil {{aircraft}} involved in low-flying activities should be painted as conspicuously {{as possible and}} fitted with high power collision warning lights preferably strobe type. Also recommended that the military consider <b>fitment</b> of strobe type high power collision warning lights to aircraft engaged in low level training.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} {{generation}} LD Astra, the Nissan Pulsar was again used as the basis, this time using the latest N13 series. Unlike before, the LD {{was the result of}} a proper joint venture development programme. That is, Nissan provided the bodywork and Holden supplied powertrains for <b>fitment</b> in both applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{wood grain}} {{interior}} trim of the Camry/Altis changed from yellow-brown to red-brown during a small update in July 2007, with VSC made standard <b>fitment</b> when the facelift version commenced sales on 13 January 2009. Toyota ceased manufacture of the Daihatsu-branded models in February 2010 due to low sales; just 447 {{units of the}} XV40 series Altis were registered in three years.|$|E
50|$|To reduce {{unnecessary}} {{cost and}} weight and increase interior space, the more luxurious dashboard and <b>fitments</b> (including leather seats) of the Crown Royal were replaced with less bulky all-plastic versions. The Comfort {{is also used}} as an instructional vehicle for people learning how to drive.|$|R
50|$|In July 2015, HSV {{launched}} the limited edition Clubsport R8 25th Anniversary {{to commemorate the}} nameplate. It did not benefit from any performance increases but only extra <b>fitments</b> that included forged alloy wheels and special badges and trims. Production totalled 108 units (eight of which for export to New Zealand).|$|R
5000|$|Several airfields {{had their}} runways widened and {{extended}} in length for emergency landing of damaged bombers after operations over Germany, these airfields, RAF Woodbridge, RAF Carnaby, and RAF Manston being designated as [...] "Emergency Landing Grounds" [...] - ELG's. These ELG airfields {{had some of}} the first <b>fitments</b> of the fog-dispersing installation, FIDO.|$|R
25|$|In 1987 <b>fitment</b> of {{anti-pollution}} systems {{allowed the}} V6 turbo {{to be distributed}} to Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. 1989 saw {{the launch of the}} limited edition GTA Mille Miles to celebrate Alpine's 35th anniversary. Production was limited to 100 cars, all fitted with ABS braking, polished wheels, special leather interior and paintwork. This version was not available in RHD.|$|E
25|$|Prejudice against {{hydraulic}} transmission {{in the higher}} echelons of BR's engineering divisions decreed in 1967 that all the WR's diesel-hydraulics were non-standard and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Added to this were practical problems modernising the D800s: because of the scaled-down bodyshell {{there was very little}} room inside for extra equipment. It was, for example, physically impossible to accommodate a compressor as well as an exhauster, so the locomotives were unable to haul newer designs of air-braked coaching stock. It also proved impractical to equip them with electric train heating (ETH) equipment, for similar reasons, so they retained unreliable steam heat boilers to the end of their lives. It was intended to equip no. D870 with ETH; to provide the necessary additional power, the engines would have been uprated by the <b>fitment</b> of charge-air coolers. No work was actually carried out, other than the <b>fitment</b> of appropriate jumper cables on the locomotive ends.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as Toyota's Camry upgrade in April 1994, Apollo {{specifications}} were also uprated slightly. SLXs now had a four- and GSs a six-speaker stereo system, up from two and four, respectively. The SLX also received a tachometer and rear mudflaps, while the GS variant gained standard <b>fitment</b> cruise control and power windows. A second update in June 1994 fitted a driver's airbag as standard on all models bar the four-cylinder SLX.|$|E
50|$|Interior and {{exterior}} {{evidence indicates that}} {{the roof of the}} chapel was once a lean-to. Interior <b>fitments</b> include an unornamented piscina and a wooden triptych (c. 1549) believed to be the work of Flemish artist Jan Sanders van Hemessen that was presented to the church by the then vicar Dr James Millard in the 1870s.|$|R
50|$|Gable top cartons {{are often}} used for liquid {{products}} such as milk, juice, etc. These use polyethylene-coated liquid packaging board and sometimes a foil laminate. Most are opened by pushing open the gables at the top back and pulling the top (spout) out. Some have <b>fitments</b> to assist in opening and eating the contents.|$|R
50|$|Many rotary {{filing systems}} can store the {{contents}} of seventeen four drawer filing cabinets in just three eight tier units, allowing multiple times the storage volume created by traditional filing cabinets. A wide range of <b>fitments</b> makes the systems suitable for storing a vast array file types and multimedia. For security, each unit can invariably be locked individually.|$|R
25|$|Photo-reconnaissance version {{based on}} B(I).8 with {{fuselage}} stretched to 68 ft (27.72 m), wingspan increased by 4 ft (1.22 m), and Avon R.A.27 (Avon 206) engines with 10,030 lbf (44.6 kN) of thrust. Had the offset canopy of the B(I).8 with a hinged nose to allow <b>fitment</b> of an ejection seat for the navigator. A total of 23 built by Short Brothers & Harland with three transferred to Chile after the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|Anti-lock {{braking system}} (ABS) and Traction control system (TCS) (referred to as TCL on FTOs) {{can also be}} found as factory-fitted options on some earlier models such as the sports GX model. An easy-visual check for <b>fitment</b> of ABS to an FTO is to look in the engine bay - an alloy block, with six brake pipes emerging, will be present behind the battery and down against the bulkhead. ABS was {{standard}} equipment on facelift models.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{released}} a coupÃ© {{version of the}} Camry in 1993, for the 1994 model year with styling {{very similar to the}} four-door version, stimulating modest sales. This vehicle would be dropped for the next generation and replaced by the Camry Solara. Also in this year, the 3VZ-FE V6 departed in favour of the new aluminium 1MZ-FE V6. This new engine coincided with the standard <b>fitment</b> of dual front air bags, whereas the 1991 to 1993 Camrys only has driver's air bag.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} feature {{some fine}} cedar joinery {{in the sanctuary}} area and liturgical <b>fitments</b> including a silky oak minister's chair. The timber pews have decorative ends bearing pew numbers. A pair of leadlight windows featuring the Welsh dragon are above the doors in the rear wall leading into the vestry/meeting room. The walls display several timber plaques and memorials.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2012 {{braking tests}} were {{undertaken}} for <b>fitments</b> of improved hydraulic brakes to 450 road-rail vehicle excavators. [...] These excavators were all falling under classification [...] "type 9b" [...] where the rubber wheel touch small flanged steel wheels, which in-turn touch the rails and {{were found to}} have significantly reduced braking performance in adverse conditions.|$|R
50|$|The LeMans {{was another}} 4 spoke, 4 lug design, cast in sizes and <b>fitments</b> for sports cars such as Alfa Romeo, MGB and Datsun 240Z. Each tapered spoke was wider at the hub {{than at the}} rim, giving a {{lightweight}} appearance similar to Ferrari wheels of the period. BRE 240Z's used these wheels in SCCA competition, and many street-driven 240Z's followed suit.|$|R
