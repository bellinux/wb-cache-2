500|$|A {{reviewer}} from 'Osoblog.tv' {{was less}} {{critical of the}} video, instead calling it an advert for the Summer. [...] "The band walked around on a beach and danced in a rock pool (with artful splashing) while dressed {{in a variety of}} beachwear. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> want to go on a holiday." [...] The reviewer from OK! magazine agreed saying [...] "quite frankly the whole thing has us aching for a summer holiday" [...] and then compared it a holiday the group might go on. [...] "All in all it's a pretty standard summer for the girls who show off super toned physiques, plenty of midriff and a collection of maxi-dresses we can't help, but covet." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Cheney has {{publicly}} criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, {{four days after}} the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: [...] " [...] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> less safe. [...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with {{what seems to be the}} goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society." [...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer." ...|$|E

500|$|Heartbreakers, Mirkin's second film as {{a feature}} director, was {{released}} in 2001. Mirkin rejected the project three times because he disliked the script. While he {{liked the idea of}} a mother and daughter con-woman team, he found the writing [...] "really broad", and [...] "it had no emotion in it." [...] Eventually, Mirkin was allowed to rewrite the script himself, which he did in a year's time. He filmed the project in Florida and Los Angeles and had a cameo appearance in the film as Jack's lawyer. Reactions to both the film and Mirkin's direction of it were more varied compared to Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. Roger Ebert said the film was not [...] "as sly and has no ambition to be [...] charming" [...] as Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, [...] "but in a season of dreary failed comedies it does what a comedy must: <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> laugh". Chris Hewitt of Empire wrote that [...] "Mirkin's direction is a little flat, but he's clearly having tremendous fun," [...] but Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today opined that Mirkin [...] "never gets the timing right and allows the story to drag with little internal logic".|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, Minaj {{posted a}} picture on Instagram of herself with Soulja Boy in a studio. Later that month, he posted a Vine of him singing the song's chorus. Originally, Joseph DaVinci & Soulja Boy created the song's beat but {{according}} to him, it lacked a hook. However, he later {{came up with the}} idea for the hook while making a Vine, and added it into the song. He then brought the unfinished version of [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] to Minaj, who was impressed by the song and recorded her vocals. After Minaj sent the track back to him, it took [...] "about a day" [...] for Soulja Boy to finish mixing the record. In May 2014, Minaj spoke of the meaning behind the word [...] "yasss": [...] "When I watch RuPaul's Drag Race,' I live for the way they speak. Females, we adopted it and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> feel like very cocky and very just like sexy and feminine. So saying 'yass' as opposed to 'yes,' it's just putting on a billion times more attitude to the word 'yes'." [...] On May 3, 2014, Minaj posted the song on her official SoundCloud shortly after midnight.|$|E
500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people... We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in shows. If you're asking how <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> feel? Pretty darn special... to know that you had that impact on someone's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope." ...|$|E

60|$|If {{an inquiry}} thus {{carefully}} conducted should fail at last of discovering the truth, it may answer an end perhaps as useful, in discovering {{to us the}} weakness of our own understanding. If <b>it</b> does not <b>make</b> <b>us</b> knowing, <b>it</b> may <b>make</b> <b>us</b> modest. If <b>it</b> does not preserve us from error, it may {{at least from the}} spirit of error; and may <b>make</b> <b>us</b> cautious of pronouncing with positiveness or with haste, when so much labor may end in so much uncertainty.|$|R
2500|$|The {{model for}} the batsman was Teddy Woolard and Roy Holloway was the {{model for the}} bowler. In 1996, after the models were identified, Woolard was asked for his opinion of Drysdale's portrayal; [...] "I just don't rate it ... <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> all look out of proportion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{incorporated}} {{environmentally responsible}} behavior into his business and believed that all businesses could be successful with the same mindset. Said Johnson of his involvement with the council, [...] "We aggressively seek out eco-efficiencies--ways of doing more with less--because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> more competitive when we reduce and eliminate waste and risk from our products and processes. And it saves us money. By developing products that are as safe as possible for people and the environment, we improve our market share." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008 in Brussels, Juncker {{suggested}} that the eurozone should be represented at the International Monetary Fund as a bloc, rather than each member state separately: [...] "It is absurd for those 15 countries not to agree to have a single representation at the IMF. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> look absolutely ridiculous. We are regarded as buffoons on the international scene." [...] However Finance Commissioner Joaquín Almunia stated that before there is common representation, a common political agenda should be agreed upon.|$|E

2500|$|When {{tradition}} {{thus becomes}} master, {{it does so}} {{in such a way}} that what it 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understand.

2500|$|It {{will be a}} great {{pleasure}} to all to hear that the HRH the Prince of Wales has expressed a wish to be given the fine old English title of Visitor of this school. HRH met so many [...] "Old Boys" [...] while [...] that when he made his visit to Canada last year he instituted special inquiries about the previous history of the College. Finding that the title existed, he has thus honored us by becoming [...] "Visitor of Upper Canada College"....

2500|$|The band {{sees the}} album as {{a return to}} the raw sound heard on L.D. 50, with guitarist Greg Tribbett saying in an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine [...] "Instead of being all slick, we're definitely going for a raw sound on this record. The last one was pretty smooth and the first record, L.D. 50, was raw, so we're kind of mixing it up a little bit." [...] Matt McDonough said he believed the music on the album would reflect a refinement of Mudvayne's complexly structured hard rock balanced against more melody than any previous album. Bassist Ryan Martinie added [...] "Our goal for the third album is to make music that pleases us because if <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> happy then the rest will take care of itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leeland's second studio album, Opposite Way, was {{recorded}} in Nashville, Tennessee. In November 2007, the band announced that the album would release on February 26, 2008. Lead singer Leeland Mooring commented, [...] " [...] is primarily a call to our generation to passionately walk the 'opposite way' from the world, that it's OK to live the Christian life and to be on fire for God, even if <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> look different." [...] In its debut week of release, Opposite Way peaked at No.72 on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart, and also reached No.1 on the iTunes Christian Albums chart. Starting in September 2007, Leeland began touring with Grammy Award-winning band Casting Crowns on their The Altar and the Door tour. The tour continued until May 1, 2008, and was named the [...] "highest-grossing Christian tour of the year" [...] touring through 83 cities.|$|E
2500|$|In Schenzinger's novel, Herbert Norkus {{is named}} Heini Völker. With a völkisch undertone, the opening {{chapters}} describe {{the hardships of}} Norkus' youth in a working class district of Berlin, characterised by the Great Depression, the unemployment {{of his father and}} the suicide of his mother. The contemporary communist youth (Rote Jungfront, [...] "Red Young Front") is portrayed as a disorderly gang devoted primarily to alcohol, tobacco and sex. In contrast, the Nazi youth (Hitlerjugend, [...] "Hitler Youth") is portrayed as an orderly organisation, superior in morals. Schenzinger lets Heini Völker's father force his son to attend a camping weekend organised by a communist youth group, North Star Moabit. Heini is disgusted and flees the camp, only to encounter a Hitler Youth group in the woods. Deeply impressed, and in an atmosphere of nationalistic pathos, Heini learns of the Nazi movement, Führerprinzip ("leader principle"), comradeship and Volksgemeinschaft ("the people's community"). On [...] "the happiest day of his life", Heini joins the Hitler Youth, and Schenzinger has the Bannführer (group leader) symbolize Nazi ideology when he handed over Heini's uniform to him: [...] " [...] is the clothing of the community, of comradeship, of our ideology, of our unified organisation! [...] <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> all equal, and gives the same to all and demands the same from all. He who wears such a uniform does not have desires of his own anymore, he has only to obey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phrases such as [...] "It is vain to do {{with more}} {{what can be done}} with fewer" [...] and [...] "A {{plurality}} is not to be posited without necessity" [...] were commonplace in 13th-century scholastic writing. Robert Grosseteste, in Commentary on [...] the Posterior Analytics Books (Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros) (c. 1217–1220), declares: [...] "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal." [...] The Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) states that [...] "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many". Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to God's existence, an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. quinque viae), and specifically, through an argument based on causality. Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also Correlation does not imply causation).|$|E
