40|$|We {{present a}} toolset to {{automatically}} optimize the cache efficiency of an arbitrary application by dynamically padding memory allocations. The toolset is also suitable to guide manual optimizations. Histograms {{are used to}} evaluate cache simulations of memory traces of the ap-plications considered. A general algorithm is presented that calculates optimized <b>pad</b> <b>sets</b> based on the informa-tion contained in the histograms. These <b>pad</b> <b>sets</b> can then be used to optimize further runs of the applications ex-amined. Experiments show that the cache hit rates of the modified applications are considerably increased...|$|R

50|$|On some {{keyboard}} layouts, {{the return}} and enter key {{are two different}} keys, an artifact of the differing handling of newlines by different operating systems. As an example, on the Macintosh, the return key is the usual key, while the enter key is positioned at the lower right of the numeric <b>key</b> <b>pad.</b> While using the type tool in Adobe Photoshop, the return key produces a new line while the enter key ends editing mode.|$|R

50|$|MDC-systems have {{an option}} for {{selective}} calling. By pressing a series of keys on the encoder-decoder, the base station operator can send a data packet that activates a lighted indicator or makes the radio beep. On some radio models with alphanumeric displays, the display may flash CALL until a reset button is pressed. On radio models with ten <b>key</b> <b>pads,</b> mobile radios may be programmed to selectively call one another in this manner. In order to call a radio, the calling party must know the four-digit MDC identity of the radio to be called.|$|R

In addition, differences from the standard Boehm system include: separate holes for the register key and for throat B flat, operated by a single left thumb key via an automatic mechanism; elimination of some redundant tone holes, with some resulting changes in fingering; and modifications of tone hole spacings, tone hole depths, and <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> heights to minimize turbulence in the bore.|$|R

50|$|The AnyKey {{keyboard}} {{is easily}} distinguished from other generic keyboards by an extra double column of F keys {{on the left}} side, a unique eight directional arrow <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> {{as opposed to the}} traditional inverted T, and a quartet of extra keys directly above the numeric pad that control the programmable aspects of the keyboard. They are labeled “Program Macro”, “Suspend Macro”, “Repeat Rate”, and “Remap”, reading left to right. All versions of the AnyKey are white or very light gray with some keys (notably the programming keys, extra function keys, and arrows) in a darker gray.|$|R
5000|$|QIKCOM-2 {{is another}} USNA built payload flying on the eXCITe mission {{scheduled}} for launch in late 2016. The payload continues the APRS missions of prior USNA space systems, but also adds a simpler touch-tone up-link capability so that users worldwide can use existing radios with <b>key</b> <b>pads</b> {{instead of the}} more expensive specialized APRS radios from past satellites. QIKCOM-2 allows position reporting and text messaging from anywhere on earth using simple $90 radios. Delivered in November 2015 to the spacecraft integrator, QIKCOM-2 is being held as a hot-backup and will be launched at the earliest opportunity. See http://aprs.org/qikcom-2.html ...|$|R

Its <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> contains nearly 5 carats of ruby bearings. Other models include Ascent (2004), Constellation Classic (2006), Constellation Ayxta (2009), among others. Ascent phones {{are designed to be}} lightweight and durable, made of aluminium or titanium with vulcanised rubber and leather. The Classics are simple and small handsets. Ayxtas are flip phones that come in numerous variants and colors. In 2006, Vertu produced and released the Aerius Bluetooh Headset designed by Timothy Jacob Jensen.|$|R

Vic Firth also produces a bass drum practice pad, which is two practice pads attached by a metal connector, which is then connected to a metal stand.

40|$|Abstract. Secure device pairing is {{especially}} difficult for spontaneous interaction in ubiquitous computing environments because of wireless communication, lack of powerful user interfaces, and scalability issues. We demonstrate {{a method to}} address this problem for small, mobile devices that does not require explicit user interfaces like displays or <b>key</b> <b>pads.</b> By shaking devices together in one hand for a few seconds, they are securely paired. Device authentication happens implicitly as part of the pairing process without the need for explicit user interaction “just for security”. Our method has been implemented in two variants: first, for high-quality data collection using wired accelerometers; second, using built-in accelerometers in standard Nokia 5500 mobile phones. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1994 at the Consumer Electronics Show, Atari {{announced}} that it partnered up with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator. The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled altogether, but not before an estimated 100 or so were made. The unit utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and {{had the ability to}} answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers. Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play. The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM game is Ultra Vortek.

50|$|New {{opportunities}} arose as banks began {{rolling out}} debit {{cards in the}} mid-1990s. Verifone was quick to launch itself into this new market, producing terminals designed with <b>key</b> <b>pads</b> for customers to punch in their PIN numbers. But as the domestic credit and debit card markets neared saturation, Verifone made ready to launch itself in new directions. While continuing its international expansion, topping four million installed systems in 1994, and maintaining its manufacturing capacity, doubling production capacity with a new plant near Shanghai in China in 1994, Verifone had already evolved its primary focus to producing software applications, offering vertically integrated systems solutions, including applications for standard computer operating systems.|$|R
5000|$|The TI-89 {{has been}} criticized for making some {{fundamental}} operations difficult for users to find. This design flaw, known as [...] "cryptic input", can be a drawback for students (particularly those who are used to the user-friendly interface of the previous TI-83 and TI-84 models). An example of this cryptic input is the base 10 logarithm function. Rather than having a key for the log function, users must navigate through a series of menus to find this operation. Alternatively, users can press the [...] "diamond" [...] shift key, followed by the number 7 on the <b>key</b> <b>pad.</b> However, there is no indication on the actual calculator to suggest this short-cut.|$|R
