40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} current {{practices}} of the green economy, and challenges and opportunities in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The paper {{is based on a}} baseline study designed to gather data from key informants in Limpopo provincial, district and local municipalities. Twenty-three key informants in the province were interviewed. Primary data collected from key informants was supplemented by secondary data from document reviews. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data on the current practices of green economy, and challenges and opportunities in the province. Findings from the study suggest that there is generally significant awareness of the green economy concept across the provincial district and local municipalities in Limpopo Province. However, there are gaps in terms of information gathering, storage and sharing on green <b>economy</b> <b>activities</b> in the district municipalities, provincial and national departments. The main barriers constraining the implementation of green economy initiatives in the municipalities include lack of information; shortage of workers with full knowledge on green economy; shortage of training programmes on green economy; and costs of implementation. The main recommendations from this research include the need to improve awareness of green <b>economy</b> <b>activities</b> across all levels in the province, especially with communities’ need for evidence-based research to demonstrate the potential of green <b>economy</b> <b>activities</b> that can contribute to job creation and poverty reduction; and training of officials on how the green economy can contribute to addressing developmental challenges such as service delivery, job creation, local economic development and poverty reduction...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{considerable}} discussion {{on the size of}} the shadow economy, comparatively little attention has been given to relationship between unemployment and participation in this sector. The objective of this paper is to examine participation in the shadow economy by those who claim to be unem ployed and in receipt of social security benefits but working surreptitiously in the shadow economy. In doing so, we provide a first attempt at gauging the contribu tions by the unemployed to shadow <b>economy</b> <b>activity.</b> It is of considerable policy interest to know how the extent and duration of shadow <b>economy</b> <b>activity</b> are influenced by changes in the unemployment rate. A significant positive relation ship between shadow <b>economy</b> <b>activity</b> and unemployment can be said to gene rate employment cycles in the shadow economy, which if supported by welfare payments, distorts the equity in the social security system. We find that changes in unemployment contribute to the employment cycles in the shadow economy, which on the whole appears to increase duration spells in unemployment.
