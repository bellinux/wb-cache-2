5|$|While {{at work on}} The Songlines between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin {{frequently}} {{came down}} with colds. He also developed skin lesions {{that may have been}} symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that John {{may have been}} influenced by the writings of other medieval mystics, though there is debate about the exact thought which may have influenced him, and about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been exposed to their ideas.|$|E
25|$|Having {{had enough}} of Caligula’s anger at her criticisms and of his behavior, she {{committed}} suicide. Suetonius’s Caligula, clause 23, mentions <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have poisoned her.When his grandmother Antonia asked for a private interview, he refused it except {{in the presence of}} the prefect Macro, and by such indignities and annoyances he caused her death; although some think that he also gave her poison. After she was dead, he paid her no honour, but viewed her burning pyre from his dining-room.|$|E

25|$|Barbara shares news of her father's plan to Val; {{to cover}} the Goldmans' {{alternate}} lifestyle, she has told her parents that Armand is straight and cultural attaché to Greece. Armand dislikes the idea of deception, but agrees to play along, hiring contractors to redecorate the family's apartment to more closely resemble a traditional household. Albert initially wants to use his skills as a drag artist to play Val's mother, but Val and Armand fear that the trick will not work, and instead convince him to pose as Val's uncle. Armand contacts Katherine and explains the situation; she agrees to the farce, promising {{to come to the}} party and pretend to be his wife. Armand then tries to coach Albert on how to be straight, but Albert's flamboyant nature makes the task difficult. When Albert overhears Val and Armand discussing <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> ruin the whole charade, he takes offense and locks himself in his room.|$|E
25|$|In the {{meantime}} Vollenhoven’s brother-in-law, chess mate, and former study chum Herman Dooyeweerd became active in philosophy. He visited Vollenhoven in Oostkapelle to discuss <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{work his way}} into philosophy more methodically. When both lived in The Hague, their discussions became more intense and searching, and an enduring partnership in philosophy developed that lasted a life-time. Yet their personalities were very different: Vollenhoven, with his analytical disposition, was the organizer, systematic thinker, and man of detailed historical overviews; Dooyeweerd, with his musical talent (he was a fine pianist), was a jurist by training, who sought the grand design. Vollenhoven had worked {{his way into the}} problems of mathematics, the natural sciences, biology, psychology, epistemology, and theology, while Dooyeweerd had a good command of sociology, economics, and jurisprudence. From the end of 1923 on, both advanced a “reformed philosophy” (what they referred to as “Calvinistic philosophy,” now usually called Reformational philosophy). They were simultaneously appointed to university chairs at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam in 1926, Dooyeweerd in the Juridical Faculty, Vollenhoven in the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy as the successor of Geesink.|$|E
25|$|About {{ten years}} after Dee's death, the {{antiquarian}} Robert Cotton purchased land around Dee's house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts. He discovered several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these manuscripts to the scholar Méric Casaubon, who published them in 1659, together with a long introduction critical of their author, as A True & Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits. As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was extremely popular and sold quickly. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is {{largely responsible for the}} image, prevalent for the following two and a half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic. Around the same time the True and Faithful Relation was published, members of the Rosicrucian movement claimed Dee as one of their number. There is doubt, however, that an organized Rosicrucian movement existed during Dee's lifetime, and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity. Dee's reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with Edward Kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists, writers of horror stories and latter-day magicians. The accretion of false and often fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they are in themselves. It also does nothing to promote his Christian leanings: Dee looked to the angels to speak to him about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> heal the very deep and serious rifts between the Roman Catholic Church, the Reformed Church of England and the Protestant movement in England. Queen Elizabeth I used him as her court astronomer {{on a number of occasions}} not solely because he practised Hermetic arts, but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted.|$|E

500|$|The French fleet sailed from Brest on 22 March. The British fleet {{was busy}} with {{preparations}} to resupply Gibraltar, and {{did not attempt to}} oppose the departure. After the French fleet sailed, the packet ship Concorde sailed for Newport, carrying the comte de Barras, Rochambeau's orders, and credits for the six million livres. In a separate dispatch sent later, Admiral de Grasse also made two important requests. [...] The first was that he be notified at Cap-Français of the situation in North America so that he could decide <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be able to assist in operations there, and the second was that he be supplied with 30 pilots familiar with North American waters.|$|E
500|$|As a youth, Strang kept {{a rather}} {{profound}} personal diary, written partly {{in a secret}} code that was not deciphered until over one hundred {{years after it was}} authored (by Strang's own grandson Mark Strang, a banker in Long Beach, California). [...] This journal contains Strang's musings on a variety of topics, including his desire to [...] "rival Caesar or Napoleon" [...] and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a general or member of the state legislature, which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his quest to be someone of importance. [...] However, Strang's diary equally reveals a heartfelt desire to be of service to his fellow man, together with agonized frustration at not knowing <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.|$|E

500|$|Schwarzkopf {{sought to}} change the {{relationship}} between journalists and the military, feeling that the news media's negative portrayal of the Vietnam War had degraded troops there. When he took command during the Gulf War, he sought an entirely different strategy which was ultimately successful, where he favored greater media coverage, albeit subject to strict controls on the battlefield. Schwarzkopf favored the intense press surrounding the Gulf War conflict, feeling that blocking the news media as had been done in Grenada would contribute to negative public perception {{of the war in}} the United States. His dealings with the press were thus frequent and very personal, and he conducted regular briefings for journalists. He would usually not attack media coverage, even negative coverage, unless he felt it was blatantly incorrect. He staged visible media appearances which played to patriotism. In fact, Schwarzkopf believed extensive press coverage would help build public support for the war and raise morale. In some press conferences, he showed and explained advanced war-fighting technology the U.S. possessed to impress the public. These also had the side effect of distracting the public from focusing on U.S. casualty counts or the destruction wrought in the war. Schwarzkopf's strategy was to control the message being sent, he therefore ordered media on the battlefield to be escorted at all times. In spite of this, several high-profile reports publicized the CENTCOM strategy. [...] After the war Schwarzkopf was very critical of military analysts who scrutinized his operation, feeling that some of them were poorly informed on the factors involved in his planning, and that others were violating operational security by revealing too much about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> plan the operation.|$|E
500|$|Waugh left Hertford in {{the summer}} of 1924 without {{completing}} his degree, and a received a brief note from Cruttwell [...] expressing disappointment with this performance. Although the pair never met again, a few years later Cruttwell spoke disparagingly of Waugh, to the latter's prospective mother-in-law, Lady Burghclere, describing him as vice-ridden and [...] "living off vodka and absinthe". Once Waugh had established himself as a writer, he resumed the vendetta against his former tutor by introducing a succession of disreputable or absurd characters called [...] "Cruttwell" [...] into his novels and stories. In Decline and Fall (1928) [...] "Toby Cruttwell" [...] is a psychopathic burglar; in Vile Bodies (1930) the name belongs to a snobbish Conservative MP. In Black Mischief (1932) [...] "Cruttwell" [...] is a social parasite, and he becomes a dubious osteopath or [...] "bone-setter" [...] in A Handful of Dust (1934). [...] In Scoop (1938), [...] "General Cruttwell" [...] is a salesman with a fake tropical tan at the Army & Navy Stores. The 1935 short story [...] "Mr Loveday's Little Outing", which recounts the grisly deeds of an escaped homicidal maniac, was originally published as [...] "Mr Cruttwell's Little Outing". The final Cruttwell reference in Waugh's fiction came in 1939, in the short story [...] "An Englishman's Home", {{in the form of an}} embezzling Wolf Cub master. In 1935, in an additional gesture of sarcastic ridicule, Waugh told a survey in which modern novelists were asked to nominate their best work [...] that he had yet to write his masterpiece: [...] "It is the memorial biography of C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, some time Dean of Hertford College, Oxford, and my old history tutor. It is a labour of love to one to whom, under God, I owe everything". As with Waugh's student taunting, Cruttwell made no public response, although according to Stannard he anticipated each new Waugh novel with much trepidation about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be portrayed.|$|E
2500|$|Wimund's bishopric of the Isles had its {{seat on the}} Isle of Skye. The {{ruins of}} Snizort Cathedral, {{dedicated}} to Columba, are still visible near Skeabost. William of Newburgh writes that Wimund, [...] "ot content with the dignity of his episcopal office, he next anticipated in his mind <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> accomplish great and wonderful things; for he possessed a haughty speaking mouth with the proudest heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Last of the Time Lords", the immortal time {{traveller}} Captain Jack Harkness expresses concern about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> look if he lives [...] "for a million years", because although he cannot die, {{he is still}} aging, albeit slowly. He tells the Doctor and Martha Jones {{that it is a}} matter of vanity, because as the first person from the Boeshane Peninsula to join the Time Agency, he was featured on posters, becoming known as [...] "the Face of Boe".|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, on the case's fourth anniversary, Bellevue's {{new police}} chief Steve Mylett appealed {{publicly}} to Biryukova {{to talk to}} them again.

While the previous year the department said it had exhausted all the leads that had been reported to it, at that time Mylett claimed Solomon had shared some unspecified new information with them that might prove useful.

2500|$|Jackson and Steinbrenner would reconcile, and Steinbrenner {{would hire}} {{him as a}} [...] "special {{assistant}} to the principal owner", making Jackson a consultant and a liaison to the team's players, particularly the minority players. By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes in race relations, have come to develop many minority players in their farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. Jackson usually appears in uniform at the Yankee's spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, and was sought out for advice by such recent stars as Derek Jeter, before his retirement, and by former Yankee star Alex Rodriguez. [...] "His experience is vast, and he's especially good with the young players in our minor league system, the 17- and 18-year old kids. They respect him and what he's accomplished in his career. When Reggie Jackson tells a young kid <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> improve his swing, he tends to listen", said Hal Steinbrenner, Yankees' managing general partner and co-chairperson.|$|E
