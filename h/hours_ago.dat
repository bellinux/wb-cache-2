25|$|The 2015–16 Big Bash League season {{marked the}} first {{year in which the}} Thunder {{finished}} in {{the top half of the}} table, finishing 4th overall. Having won the first three games of the season and boasting a squad including Michael Hussey, Shane Watson, Usman Khawaja and Jacques Kallis, The Thunder soon became the favourites to win the tournament. However, the Thunder lost their following four games and it looked as if they were set to miss out on the finals. In their final game of the 2015–16 Big Bash League season, the Thunder defeated the Sixers for only the second time in their history to book a finals berth. The Thunder faced the Adelaide Strikers at Adelaide Oval in the first semi final, winning convincingly. The Thunder then faced the Stars in the Finals the Melbourne Stars. The final was played at Melbourne Cricket Ground on 24 January 2016 and resulted in the Thunder's defeat of the Melbourne Stars. The Sydney Thunder franchise also swept the titles as the women's team won the inaugural women's title <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> on the same ground by the same margin with the same number of balls remaining (3 wickets with 3 balls remaining). The men's game also featured a battle of two captains as brothers Michael and David Hussey went against each other on their mother's birthday.|$|E
500|$|Alavés manager José Manuel Esnal praised {{his players}} despite their loss: [...] "Dortmund {{has seen a}} great final, and it was {{possibly}} the smallest team in the competition that made it great." [...] Esnal saluted his players for their character especially for equalising twice in the match: [...] "We played with pride and class to get the score back to 4–4 {{at the end of}} normal time, the result of that, however, was that we were half dead going into extra-time. But we're the same team as we were two <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> One side always has to lose a final, just as one wins." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{statistical}} guidance {{used by the}} National Hurricane Center was the Hurricane Analog Technique (HURRAN), {{which was}} available in 1969. [...] It used the newly developed North Atlantic tropical cyclone database to find storms with similar tracks. [...] It then shifted their tracks through the storm's current path, and used location, direction and speed of motion, and the date to find suitable analogs. [...] The method did well with storms south of the 25th parallel which had not yet turned northward, but poorly with systems near or after recurvature. [...] Since 1972, the Climatology and Persistence (CLIPER) statistical model {{has been used to}} help generate tropical cyclone track forecasts. [...] In the era of skillful dynamical forecasts, CLIPER is now being used as the baseline to show model and forecaster skill. [...] The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Forecast (SHIFOR) has been used since 1979 for tropical cyclone intensity forecasting. [...] It uses climatology and persistence to predict future intensity, including the current Julian day, current cyclone intensity, the cyclone's intensity 12 <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> the storm's initial latitude and longitude, as well as its zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) components of motion.|$|E

500|$|A {{straight}} {{bass player}} in an [...] "all gay band" [...] called The Jerk-Offs, Nick O'Leary (Michael Cera) is a teenager from Hoboken, New Jersey. Nick is still heartbroken after his girlfriend, Tris (Alexis Dziena), {{broke up with}} him three weeks, two days, and 23 <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> and continues to make [...] "breakup" [...] mix CDs for her. Thom (Aaron Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron), his gay bandmates who both hate Tris, convince Nick to perform at a club because his favorite band— the legendary, publicity-shy indie band Where's Fluffy? —is performing somewhere in New York City that night. Norah Silverberg (Kat Dennings) attends the same high school as Tris, Convent of the Sacred Heart, and though Norah and Tris dislike each other, they have a mutual friend named Caroline (Ari Graynor). Norah has not met Nick, but shares his taste in music based on recovering his mix CDs after Tris discards them in the trash. That night, the three girls end up at Arlene's Grocery on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where The Jerk-Offs are playing. Norah asks Nick {{to pretend to be}} her boyfriend to show up Tris. Norah kisses him, unaware that he is the ex-boyfriend of Tris. Caroline gets drunk and Norah wants to take her home, but Nick's bandmates (who see Norah as a potential new girlfriend for him) offer to take Caroline home so Norah and Nick can spend time together trying to find the show.|$|E
500|$|The game on May 1 in Philadelphia {{became a}} moment of peace in the rivalry during {{the top of the}} ninth inning. Mets' Daniel Murphy was batting as a pinch-hitter against Phillies' {{reliever}} Ryan Madson when the fans started chanting [...] "U-S-A!" [...] The Phillies didn't know the reason for the chants, but in the Mets' dugout, bench coach Ken Oberkfell told Manager Terry Collins that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, had been killed by United States special operations forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Shane Victorino later told the Phillies the news. However, when asked how they learned about it during an on-air telephone call with Mike and Mike in the Morning on ESPN Radio the next day, he said that a trainer in the dugout broke the news. Ryan Howard called the news [...] "an uplifting moment," [...] while Victorino said it was [...] "a special moment...for families...who...lost their loved ones...(on) 9/11" [...] and [...] "a big day in American history." [...] On the Mets' side, David Wright called it [...] "just an incredible moment and...you kind of come together...for a common cause", while Collins said that the Mets 21, 14-inning win behind Ronny Paulino's game-winning RBI double in his Mets debut was [...] "a good win for us, and obviously a huge win for America tonight", but felt they [...] "could have finished the game two <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> and celebrated a little bit of it." [...] Mike Lopresti of USA Today called the game between the rivals [...] "a perfect fit" [...] when the news broke, while Adam Rubin of ESPNNewYork.com called the peace in the rivalry [...] "fitting" [...] for a Mets fan, and said that it drew parallels to their 32 win over rival Atlanta Braves on September 21, 2001 in the first major sporting event in New York City since the attacks.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." [...] In contrast, Kelly West of TV Blend was critical of the premiere, writing: [...] "I don’t think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
