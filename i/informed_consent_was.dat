5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
25|$|The {{legalization of}} {{sterilization}} {{was followed by}} a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico. Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure. Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception. Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized. This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization. There is additional evidence that true <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{psychiatry}} <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>is</b> an uttermost complex topic, {{especially when}} considering the 2006 Code of Medical Ethics/Medical Ethics Code (articles 33 and 35). <b>Informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>is</b> the foundation of every possible therapeutic choice, {{although there are some}} notable exceptions, such as compulsory treatment for psychiatric reasons. Materials and methods: The current mental health law system has been evaluated. It <b>is</b> noted that <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>is</b> not the central issue in the reasons for the involuntary admission. The problem of <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>is</b> subordinated to an ill-defined medical condition such as "psychic alterations that request an urgent intervention". This ill defined condition leaves a wide array of difficulties open, when the psychiatrist has to propose the compulsory treatment. Results: We consider that the stratification of different laws about freedom/mental illness interface is not rationally harmonized with the centrality of <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> in medicine. Conclusions: It would be appropriate to develop an evaluation of compulsory admission based on the centrality of <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> (that <b>is,</b> the lack of <b>informed</b> <b>consent).</b> <b>Consent</b> can <b>be</b> viewed as an initial recovery of responsibility for the patient. © 2010 Elsevier Srl.

2500|$|The {{ethics of}} {{informed}} consent {{is relevant to}} self-experimentation. [...] Informed consent is the principle that the volunteers in the experiment should fully understand the procedure {{that is going to}} take place, be aware of all the risks involved, and give their consent to taking part in the experiment beforehand. [...] The principle of <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> first enacted in the U.S. Army's research into Yellow fever in Cuba in 1901. [...] However, there was no general or official guidance at this time. [...] That remained the case until the yellow fever program was referenced in the drafting of the Nuremberg Code. [...] This was further developed in the Declaration of Helsinki in 1964 by the World Medical Association which has since become the foundation for ethics committees' guidelines.|$|E
50|$|These {{practices}} {{are part of}} what constitutes informed consent, and their history {{is the history of}} informed consent. They combine to form the modern concept of informed consent—which rose in response to particular incidents in modern research. Whereas various cultures in various places practiced informed consent, the modern concept of <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> developed by people who drew influence from Western tradition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{media has}} {{reported}} on various pending lawsuits, including a class-action lawsuit.

5000|$|Beecher was {{instrumental}} in developing solutions to such abuses. He noted that a common element in these studies was that some experimental subjects, such as military personnel or mentally handicapped children in institutions, were {{not in a position}} to freely decline consent. [...] Beecher believed that rules requiring informed consent were not alone sufficient, as truly <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> an unattainable ideal. He worked both to define the rules and conditions for informed consent, and to establish institutional review boards as an additional layer of oversight regarding research protocols.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Yang {{claimed to}} have invented a formula of Chinese {{traditional}} medicine that is effective in treating Internet addiction. Yang applied for a patent for his formula, although the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office has not responded to his application. Yang's patent application claims that he had conducted a clinical trial with 300 patients at his treatment center, and that all 300 patients were [...] "completely cured of their addiction by the medication".

40|$|Among {{four basic}} {{principles}} (respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-malfeasance, and justice) which determine ethical behaviors in healthcare, <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>is</b> mostly related to and lsquo;respect for autonomy'. Also, it reflects patient/client's right for decision {{and the value}} given for the client and his/her autonomy. <b>Informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>is</b> an information sharing process including both rational decision-making about the most appropriate method among many different options and {{the interaction between the}} clinician and the client. This concept sheds light on criteria regarding the limits of confidentiality, competency, appropriate and sufficient information sharing and voluntariness.

50|$|The Kefauver Harris Amendment {{strengthened}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's control of experimentation on humans {{and changed the}} way new drugs are approved and regulated. Before the Thalidomide scandal in Europe, and Canada, U.S. drug companies only had to show their new products were safe. After {{the passage of the}} Amendment, an FDA New Drug Application (NDA) would have to show that a new drug was both safe and effective (previously the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was the main law that regulated drug safety). <b>Informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> required of patients participating in clinical trials, and adverse drug reactions were required to be reported to the FDA.|$|E
5000|$|In Sentencia T-551/99, {{later in}} 1999, the Court ruled {{in the case}} of NN, a two-year-old {{intersex}} child unable to consent to genital surgeries. Basing a decision on the case of XX, the Court determined that parents could give permission for the normalization of their child's genitals as long as the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> [...] "qualified and persistent." [...] However, this did not exist {{in the case of}} NN, because the [...] "parents were led to believe that genital-normalizing surgery was the only option for their daughter.

50|$|The Akron statute also {{required}} that before performing an abortion, the physician must inform the patient {{of the status}} of the pregnancy, stage of fetal development, expected date of viability, health risks of abortion, and availability of adoption agencies and childbirth resources. The Court found this provision unconstitutional, as the script, ostensibly provided to ensure <b>informed</b> <b>consent,</b> <b>was</b> found to be geared towards influencing the patient to choose not to have an abortion. The state may not attempt to influence the patient's choice between abortion and childbirth. The Ohio regulation extends the state's interest in informed consent beyond permissible limits, interfering with the discretion of the physician and placing unreasonable obstacles in his path.|$|E

5000|$|Electroconvulsive therapy at Yang's {{treatment}} center {{was performed in}} [...] "Room 13" [...] (later renamed the [...] "Behavioral Correction Therapy Room" [...] after media scrutiny). Yang claimed that electroconvulsive therapy [...] "is only painful for those with Internet addiction" [...] and that the therapeutic machines used [...] "lowered electric current".Investigative reports questioned whether Yang's use of ECT without anesthesia or muscle relaxants on minors, whose <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> not obtained, was {{in violation of the}} WHO guidelines on electroconvulsive therapy. Reports further accuse Yang of using the therapy as a means of torture. Although ECT had been regulated in some areas in China, Shandong province did not have regulations regarding the therapy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first public}} media report alleging further serious {{misconduct}} by Reeves while employed by GSAHS was on 17 February 2008, in a {{broadcast of the}} Sunday programme on the Nine Network, led by investigative journalist, Ross Coulthart. Reeves' former patient Carolyn Dewaegeneire alleged that in 2002 Reeves had conducted a clitoridectomy rather than remove a small genital lesion, and had informed {{her that he was}} going to do so seconds before anaesthesia took effect. [...] Expert witnesses in an earlier civil case surrounding this procedure noted that the procedure Reeves performed on Dewaegeneire was old-fashioned, that <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> not given and that Reeves should have sought a second opinion on her rare diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|Until the 1960s, it was {{conventional}} medical doctrine {{to withhold}} significant information from patients, particularly potentially upsetting information. [...] It was common practice {{not to tell}} a patient he was dying, and even to deny it. [...] When health care providers began {{to move away from}} that practice, many still did not fully inform patients who were about to make decisions about future health care and particularly surgery. Instead, many practitioners revealed only information that another physician might provide, following a rule known as [...] "the professional standard". Risks, in particular, were often glossed over or omitted entirely. Although the right to consent in medical situations had been recognized for decades, the notion of <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> new.|$|E

50|$|In 2015 two {{controlled}} {{studies of}} the effect of the ACGME-mandated maximum shift began, involving nearly 190 hospitals and residency training programs. The studies randomly assigned medical residents to shifts longer than specified by the ACGME regulations. A study led by the University of Pennsylvania, which will end in 2019, assigned residents in 32 medical training programs to shifts as long as 30 hours. It used 31 other programs as a control group. Despite the longer shifts, the other overall rules were still adhered to. The other study, led by Northwestern University and ending in 2015, was similar in design. Both were conducted with the approval of the ACGME. In neither study were residents and patients necessarily told {{they were part of a}} human subjects experiment and <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> not required, which caused some controversy.|$|E
