30|$|This {{series of}} {{experiments}} shows that the proposed IaaS optimization achieves distinguished outcome compared with ordinary EC 2 VMs whilst it overcomes the limitations of TARGO. It can scale the original VM up/down as the workload varies, regardless of {{it is in a}} slow or fast pace. With a user specified <b>green</b> <b>boundary,</b> it can react instantly while the current VM is about to reach the up/down limit. Consequently, the VM resource utilization efficiency can be improved significantly with OCSO IaaS optimization.|$|E
30|$|The {{regulated}} utilization {{values are}} {{calculated from the}} raw CPU usage monitor values recorded at the specified frequency for the entered period, using (1). This provides relatively stable monitor values that can reflect the overall resource utilization changes of the monitor period, compared with the raw real-time monitor data. Then, in order to mitigate the optimization delays, OCSO IaaS optimization adopts a dynamic adjusted threshold algorithm that uses variable <b>green</b> <b>boundary</b> limits and violation thresholds. Basically, the amount of dynamic scaling adjustment is controlled according to two aspects: I) whether an optimization is a continued or intermittent scaling; II) how much the regulated utilization monitor values exceed the green limits (i.e., within, by or over 10 %). In this way, whenever an optimization occurs, the successor’s <b>green</b> <b>boundary</b> limit and threshold values are evolved, using (2.1), (2.3), (3.1) and (3.3). More specifically, depending on whether its successor could {{keep up with the}} workload for the incoming period of monitor cycle, two sets of triggering parameters are used: in case of a continuous optimization, the respected up/down limit is lowered/raised for a certain amount depending on the utilization data recorded during the current monitor period (using (2.1)/(3.1)), whereas the respected threshold value is lowered (using (2.3)/(3.3)); in case of intermittent optimization or no optimization, the evolved parameters are restored to the initial user specified values. Additionally, whenever an up/down limit is changed, the other limit must be validated (using the relevant PGR). This is to ensure that the gap between the up and down limits is always appropriate for later optimizations, regardless of the volumes of workload. Without this validation and the mandatory supplement updates, as the gap becomes too large or too small, the optimizations would either miss the optimal timing or be triggered too early. The validation updates stay the same as they are in TARGO, using (2.2) and (3.2). The above complete rule evolution process creates a dynamic <b>green</b> <b>boundary</b> and respected thresholds specifically for every new VM successor considering its size as well as the current workload volume. In this way, the system would act more proactively while responding to extremely altered workloads. By doing so, OCSO IaaS optimization overcomes TARGO’s lagging limitations by upsizing VMs quicker while facing dramatically/continuously increasing workloads and downsizing VMs earlier in case of rapidly/constantly descending workloads.|$|E
30|$|Optimization Executor {{implements}} optimizations and updates {{the rules}} according {{to both the}} excessive amount of workload for the original service resource provision and the new provisioned resource capacity. For IaaS and PaaS optimizations there are different scaling control mechanisms which execute separate optimization processes (refer to the two scenarios in the next section). Optimization rules are evolved {{to make sure the}} new rule can best instruct the next optimization. Basically, if the system detects that there is excessive high/low workload incoming than the provisioned resource could possibly handle, the next up/down green limit will be adjusted to relatively a lower/higher value whilst the threshold will probably also be tuned to a smaller value (depending on whether it is a continued scaling). As a consequence, the next optimization would be triggered more easily if the workload continues to increase/decrease. Then the updated values are validated with the new provisioned VM resources as well as against appropriate <b>green</b> <b>boundary</b> regulations.|$|E

30|$|Differently {{from the}} {{majority}} of efforts which are made in achieving energy-efficient service provision from the service provider perspective, in this paper, we present a novel user-side off-the-cloud service optimization solution that facilitates efficient service (resource) utilizations, knowingly OCSO. Typical formal methods or heuristics-based resource management optimizations {{as well as the}} official service provider resource scaling options expose various limitations in satisfying native green efficiency requirements when dealing with different workload patterns/types and multiple metric monitor data. To correct these weaknesses, an intelligent resource scaling algorithm is proposed for OCSO where the <b>green</b> <b>boundary</b> limits and thresholds are adjusted dynamically according to the real-time service resource utilization statistics. With the developed OCSO tool prototype, a number of experiments are conducted over Amazon EC 2 and ElasticBeanstalk. The results prove that OCSO is uniquely able to: proactively scale the inefficiently running IaaS VMs up/down by transiting them to their successors at green optimal VM sizes and then reallocate the workloads to the successors automatically; effectively scale application environment resources in/out so that only necessary numbers of VMs are provisioned depending on the real-time workload volumes. To this extent, OCSO saves IaaS service resources by allowing users to use only necessary sized VMs and reduces overall numbers of VMs needed for applications deployed using PaaS service resources.|$|E
30|$|To {{fill the}} above {{research}} gaps, this paper proposes Off-the-Cloud Service Optimization (OCSO) - a novel user-side service consumption optimization approach towards ultimate energy-efferent resource utilizations. OCSO enables IaaS and PaaS users to manipulate service resources utilizations {{so that the}} optimized service instances can scale up/down or in/out automatically and intelligently using OCSO cloud service API. The contributions of the work are: 1) A heuristic-based off-the-cloud green cloud service optimization approach which enables customizable and intelligent scaling control by using dynamic <b>green</b> <b>boundaries</b> and thresholds according to multiple monitor categories data for the excessive high/low workload volumes encountered; 2) An IaaS-specific resource consumption optimization approach which can scale VMs up/down proactively by transiting the inefficient running VMs to their successors at appropriate VM sizes and reallocating their workloads to them; 3) A PaaS-specific resource consumption optimization approach which can scale VMs in/out effectively by calculating the optimal number of VMs needed to provision for dynamically varied workloads and then facilitating application platform environment modifications on-the-fly.|$|R
