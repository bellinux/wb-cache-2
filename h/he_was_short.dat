5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, on 27 October 1940, a Messerschmitt Me 109E {{flown by}} Fw Lothar Schieverhofer, of 3 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 52, was damaged in a dogfight with Supermarine Spitfire IIa P7494 of No. 74 Squadron RAF, flown by Plt Off Peter Chesters. The Messerschmitt made a wheels-up landing at RAF Penshurst, where Chesters also landed {{a few minutes}} later as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of fuel. Chesters dragged the German from his aircraft. Schieverhofer spat in his face, and a fist-fight {{developed}} with both combatants swearing at each other in German. The fight was broken up by the arrival of an ARP Warden, a policeman and a soldier. Chesters was forced to hand back Schieverhofer's Iron Cross, which he had snatched as a souvenir, and instead took the first aid kit from the Messerschmitt. Schieverhofer was taken away from RAF Penshurst as a prisoner of war.|$|E

25|$|Preaching, on {{the other}} hand, was by then {{problematic}} for Conyers, despite his reputation, for other clergy and the general public. He turned down an invitation from John Thomas, his bishop, to preach in another church. He did that just once, at St Mary the Virgin, Stone, Kent, by Dartford, for an archidiaconal visit, at personal cost. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of breath, and suffered from fainting.|$|E
25|$|He was {{renowned for}} his generosity, {{answering}} all pleas {{for help from}} poor Roman families with large cash gifts from his private revenues. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> on money, those who would be admitted to an audience would often be instructed by prelates not to mention their financial woes, as Benedict would inevitably feel guilty {{that he could not}} help the needy at the time. He also depleted the Vatican's official revenues with large-scale charitable expenditure during World War I. Upon his death, the Vatican Treasury had been depleted to the equivalent in Italian lire of U.S. $19,000.|$|E

25|$|Melancthon Smith {{was born}} in Mobile, Alabama on April 15, 1829, He was a soldier's son, his father an {{artillery}} Captain stationed at the Mount Vernon Arsenal. Smith received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point {{by the state of}} Alabama, and on July 1, 1845 the 16 years old Melancthon was admitted to the class of 1849. However in his second year he was found deficient in mathematics, getting the worst grades in the class, and was turned back into the class of 1850. His grades became much better, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of dismissal when he accumulated 196 demerits over the year (200 being the allowed maximum). In the next year Smith was suspended from the academy, and thus not examined.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Roach {{decided that}} his {{business}} had outgrown its original location. He was keen {{to establish a}} plant with direct water frontage, which would both save him the cost of transporting his engines to the docks, and also enable him {{to move into the}} potentially lucrative business of ship repair. The obvious target for acquisition was the Morgan Iron Works, a leading ironworks with frontage on the East River, and which like most other marine engineering plants had lain mostly idle since the Civil War. Fortuitously for Roach, the proprietor, shipping magnate Charles Morgan, had recently experienced a setback in his own business dealings, as a result of which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of capital. Morgan quickly agreed to sell the premises along with all of its equipment for the sum of $450,000.|$|E
25|$|Pressburger was a diffident {{and private}} person who, at times, {{particularly}} {{later on in}} his life, could be hypersensitive and prone to bouts of melancholia. He loved French cuisine, enjoyed music, and possessed {{a great sense of}} humour. In appearance <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short,</b> wore glasses, and had a sagacious, bird-like facial expression. He was a keen supporter of Arsenal F.C., a passion he developed soon after arriving in Britain. From 1970 he lived in Aspall, Suffolk and he died in a nursing home in nearby Saxtead on 5 February 1988, due to the complications of old age and pneumonia. He is interred in the cemetery of Our Lady of Grace Church, Aspall. His is the only grave in that Church of England graveyard with a Star of David.|$|E

25|$|Not to be outdone, Harriman now {{came up with}} a crafty plan: Buy a {{controlling}} interest in the Northern Pacific and use its power on the Burlington to place friendly directors upon its board. On May 3, 1901, Harriman began his stock raid which would become known as the Northern Pacific Corner. By {{the end of the day}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> just 40,000shares of common stock. Harriman placed an order to cover this, but was overridden by his broker, Jacob Schiff, of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Hill, on the other hand, reached the vacationing Morgan in Italy and managed to place an order for 150,000shares of common stock. Though Harriman might be able to control the preferred stock, Hill knew the company bylaws allowed for the holders of the common stock to vote to retire the preferred.|$|E
25|$|Cronje at last {{surrendered}} {{his field}} army to Roberts on 27 February. On {{the morning of}} Klip Drift French had had 5,027 horses, but by 28 February exhaustion had reduced this number to 3,553. As Roberts prepared to advance on Bloemfontein, French was now (6 March) ordered to take his division and two Mounted Infantry Brigades and swing seventeen miles around the left flank of the Boer position at Poplar Grove on the Modder River, while Roberts’ main force prepared to attack them from the front. Although French now had 5,665 horses again, many of these were of poor quality and sick, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of fodder (horses were entitled to 3lb of fodder per day, {{less than half of}} what they were getting a month earlier). On the basis of incorrect information from Colonel Richardson, Director of Supplies, who had not realised that sick horses were also entitled to fodder, Roberts gave French a dressing-down in front of his brigadiers, for consuming too many supplies. This was probably a turning point in their relationship.|$|E
500|$|He {{ended up}} hitting [...]300/.400/.480 for Frisco, in 277 at-bats. Those numbers would have placed him fourth in OBP, seventh in {{slugging}} percentage, and {{eighth in the}} league's batting race had he received enough plate appearances {{to qualify for the}} title (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> by about 60). Baseball America rated Kinsler the # 9 prospect in the Texas League.|$|E

500|$|The Continental Army {{commander}} in the South, Major General Benjamin Lincoln, based in Charleston, South Carolina, {{had been unable to}} respond adequately to the capture of Savannah. [...] With only limited resources (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of both men and funds), he was able to raise about 1,400 South Carolina militia, but did not have authorization to order them outside the state. [...] On January 30, he was further reinforced at Charleston by the arrival of 1,100 North Carolina militia under General John Ashe. [...] Then he immediately dispatched them to join Williamson on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River near Augusta.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, Australia {{was forced}} to take the second new ball, and Bedser was finally removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63 in 101 minutes, with six boundaries, having reached his first 50 in only 60 minutes. O'Reilly said [...] "There was nothing about his batting to suggest that luck was going his way or that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of batting experience." [...] Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with his {{accuracy}} and variations in pace and swing. Miller took 3/38 and a catch, while Lindwall and Toshack took one wicket each. Spin was not used in abundance, as Johnson bowled five overs and Morris three. Following England's struggles in the first innings, many pundits criticised Yardley's decision to bat first.|$|E
500|$|The cognomen Iustinianus, {{which he}} took later, is {{indicative}} of adoption by his uncle Justin. During his reign, he founded Justiniana Prima not far from his birthplace, which today is [...] in South East Serbia. His mother was Vigilantia, the sister of Justin. Justin, {{who was in the}} imperial guard (the Excubitors) before he became emperor, adopted Justinian, brought him to Constantinople, and ensured the boy's education. As a result, Justinian was well educated in jurisprudence, theology and Roman history. Justinian served for some time with the Excubitors but the details of his early career are unknown. Chronicler John Malalas, who lived during the reign of Justinian, tells of his appearance that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short,</b> fair skinned, curly haired, round faced and handsome. Another contemporary chronicler, Procopius, compares Justinian's appearance to that of tyrannical Emperor Domitian, although this is probably slander.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{was only}} 58 {{at the time of}} joining government, his health was suffering. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of energy and {{required}} a car to transport him even the several hundred metres from his Ottawa residence to the Canadian House of Commons. [...] Because of this, he was given relatively undemanding portfolios: Minister of Customs and Inland Revenue, Minister of Public Works, and Secretary of State. [...] Hall has called him among the least visible of Borden's ministers. [...] Because of his health and his short tenure in each position, he made very little impact. [...] Despite this, Sifton was highly regarded by his colleagues. [...] Borden himself later stated [...] "there was no one in whose judgment I placed firmer reliance". [...] Sifton was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style [...] "The Right Honourable".|$|E
500|$|Following a refit in Portsmouth, Tiptoe {{went to the}} Firth of Clyde {{for working}} up, {{arriving}} on 10 January 1964, when she was ordered not to enter Gareloch due to dense fog. The boat was duly turned around and ran aground on a muddy bank. As the fog cleared it was realised the boat had run aground only [...] opposite that {{of the house of}} the Royal Navy's Captain in Charge for the Clyde area, Captain G. D. Pound. Divers were sent out to assess damage, and after finding none, Tiptoe was refloated on the evening tide and pulled off the shore by two tugboats. The commanding officer at the time was LieutenantCommander David Brazier, who was in his first command. He was later ordered to be severely reprimanded for negligence at a court-martial where he pleaded guilty to the charge. His defence statement read, [...] "The ship was not worked up {{and it was a very}} green company. Unfortunately he ran into fog. He took all the precautions he considered necessary. Although he had all the theoretical knowledge, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of that tangible instinct of which we are all aware." ...|$|E
500|$|His biographer Suetonius, {{writing about}} {{a century after}} Augustus' death, {{described}} his appearance as: [...] "...unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, {{that he would have}} several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something... He had clear, bright eyes... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>short</b> of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...", adding that [...] "his shoes [...] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was" ...|$|E
