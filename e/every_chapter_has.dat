5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. <b>Every</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>has</b> a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E

5000|$|The name can {{be based}} on many {{different}} factors. For instance, {{it is common for}} new chapters to take on an element from an existent <b>chapter</b> that <b>has</b> helped them form. Theta Xi in Toronto adopted the Xi from their neighbor chapter in Michigan, and in turn <b>every</b> <b>chapter</b> in Ontario <b>has</b> a [...] "Theta" [...] as part of their name from their relationship to the Toronto chapter. Other times, a name is related to other factors like the Roman Catholic Villanova University chapter being named Alpha Omega due to the Christian significance.|$|R

Fake mustaches and rearview sunglasses are among the spy-themed items on sale alongside 826 National publications and 826 Chicago gear.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{structured}} as a storybook divided into five parts, each containing {{a large number}} of different chapters; the storybook can be paged through and read as continuous prose on screen. However, not <b>every</b> <b>chapter</b> is available {{at the start of the}} game, and those chapters which are available are not consecutive. Many <b>chapters</b> <b>have</b> a puzzle (called an enchantment) associated with them; completing such a puzzle unlocks further <b>chapter(s).</b> <b>Every</b> <b>chapter</b> is named after a tarot card in either the Major Arcana or the Minor Arcana.|$|R

50|$|After the manga {{had become}} popular among Japanese girls, an anime series was {{produced}} for NET (now known as TV Asahi) in 1976. The anime has 115 episodes which run for 25 minutes each. Although Candy Candy was an anime, it contained soap opera elements, {{and it had}} a continuous story (like many anime series), so <b>every</b> <b>chapter</b> began where the last <b>chapter</b> <b>had</b> left off.|$|R
40|$|Scenarios {{describe}} system functionalities and, when {{supplemented with}} performance an-notations, {{provide a basis}} for performance analysis. This thesis presents a Core Scenario Model (CSM), which includes common scenario information in the Use Case Maps (UCM) notation and in UML 2. 0 activity diagrams and interaction diagrams. The intent is to enable automatic transformations from a given scenario model to CSM, and then from a CSM model to performance models, hence enabling performance analysis early in the development process. CSM captures scenarios, performance, and deployment informa-tion, and is flexible enough to support multiple input scenario notations and output per-formance languages. The thesis also includes a transformation from UCM models to CSM. Such auto-matic transformation enables the quick generation of performance models, ready to be analyzed. The results from performance analysis {{can be traced back to}} improve design decisions and any changes in design can be updated in performance models quickly through re-generation. -ii-Acknowledgments First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Daniel Amyot. This thesis would never have been finished without his guidance and support.

50|$|The local White Guards' {{function}} in the following 20 years—up to the Winter War—was a mixture of Veteran Corps and Home Guards. After 1921 the White Guard organisation consisted of the General Staff, White Guard districts and local White Guard <b>chapters.</b> <b>Every</b> municipality <b>had</b> at least a single chapter, which in part acted as an NGO (non-governmental organization) but in military affairs {{was part of the}} national chain of command. In an economical sense, each chapter was responsible for its own funding, although it received a minor grant from the state budget. The White Guard was active in numerous areas of Finnish life. It organised sports activities, especially cross-country skiing, shooting, orienteering and Finnish baseball. For fundraising, the chapters organised numerous informal events and lotteries. It is estimated that about one-fifth of all get-togethers in Finland were organised by the White Guard. To this end, the White Guard <b>chapters</b> <b>had</b> several hundred choirs, orchestras and theatre groups.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{is divided}} in five worlds (listed as [...] "chapters"), each one with four levels: Bikini Bottom, an {{underwater}} volcano, the prehistoric Bikini Bottom, Rock Bottom, {{and the industrial}} district of Bikini Bottom.

5000|$|The 2005 edition is {{the longest}} ever printed, with 944 pages. This was due to a 2003 scandal (in which Catania was mainly involved) that led to 2003-04 Serie B being played with 24 teams: Panini chose to report prior {{information}} (see {{the top of the}} section) in addition to 2003-04 season information and a special based on UEFA Euro 2004. In order to make chapters easier to find, <b>every</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>has</b> a different colour.|$|E
50|$|Live A Lives {{story begins}} {{with a series of}} seven {{seemingly}} unrelated chapters that can be played in any order, based on popular genres such as Western, science fiction, and mecha. Each chapter has its own plot, setting, and characters. Although the basic gameplay is the same throughout the game, <b>every</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>has</b> its own unique gimmick, such as the stealth elements in the ninja chapter. After the first seven chapters are completed, the game's final sequence plays out, linking the previous chapters together and resolving the story.|$|E
50|$|Centennial {{celebrations}} in 1983 culminated {{with the}} dedication of a plaque at the University of Michigan School of Pharmacy, commemorating Phi Delta Chi's first 100 years of accomplishments. Today, the Alpha Chapter hosts brothers from <b>every</b> <b>chapter</b> annually on November 2, to celebrate the founding of Phi Delta Chi in 1883. Since the late 1980s, many new <b>chapters</b> <b>have</b> been founded and that number is continuing to rise due to {{the rapid expansion of}} new schools of pharmacy in the 1990s and 2000s. Phi Delta Chi also hosts an annual leadership development seminar, which members attend to gain key skills.|$|R
40|$|This text addresses the {{modeling}} of vibrating systems with {{the perspective of}} finding the model of minimum complexity which accounts for the physics of the phenomena at play. The {{first half of the}} book (Ch. 1 - 6) deals with the dynamics of discrete and continuous mechanical systems; the classical approach emphasizes the use of Lagrange's equations. The second half of the book (Ch. 7 - 12) deals with more advanced topics, rarely encountered in the existing literature: seismic excitation, random vibration (including fatigue), rotor dynamics, vibration isolation and dynamic vibration absorbers; the final chapter is an introduction to active control of vibrations. The first part of this text may be used as a one semester course for 3 rd year students in Mechanical, Aerospace or Civil Engineering. The second part of the text is intended for graduate classes. A set of problems is provided at the end of <b>every</b> <b>chapter.</b> The author <b>has</b> a 35 years experience in various aspects of Structural dynamics, both in industry (nuclear and aerospace)  and in academia; he was one of the pioneers in the field of active structures. He is the author of several books on random vibration, active structures and structural control...|$|R
5000|$|Clip {{shows have}} their origin in {{theatrical}} short films and serials. <b>Every</b> serial <b>chapter</b> always <b>had</b> a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these recap chapters (also called [...] "economy chapters"),previous chapters were summarized {{for those who}} may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the Republic Pictures serial Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island. Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and stock footage from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.|$|R

5000|$|Other critics {{praised the}} novel, however. The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction {{described}} {{the book as}} a [...] "rather good, fast-paced, often fascinating SF adventure yarn". In a 2007 Fox News interview, former U.S. presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney pointed to the book as [...] "a very fun science fiction book." [...] Fantasy author Neil Gaiman wrote: [...] "For value for money I have to recommend L. Ron Hubbard's massive Battlefield Earth — over 1000 pages of thrills, spills, vicious aliens, noble humans. Is mankind an endangered species? Will handsome and heroic Jonny Goodboy Tyler win Earth back from the nine-foot-high Psychlos? A tribute {{to the days of}} Pulp, I found it un-put-downable. And all for £2.95". Frederik Pohl said: [...] "I read Battlefield Earth straight through in one sitting although it's immense … I was fascinated by it." [...] Kevin J. Anderson says [...] "Battlefield Earth is like a 12-hour Indiana Jones marathon. Non-stop and fast-paced. <b>Every</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>has</b> a big bang-up adventure." [...] Publishers Weekly said about the novel: [...] "This has everything: suspense, pathos, politics, war, humor, diplomacy and intergalactic finance…" [...] Science fiction author A. E. van Vogt stated: [...] "Wonderful adventure … great characters … a masterpiece", but later admitted that he had not actually read it due to its size.|$|E
