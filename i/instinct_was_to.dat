5|$|McCormack {{starred in}} the science-fiction film Alien Trespass (2009), in which he played Doctor Ted Lewis, who gets possessed by an alien marshal, Urp, after he crash-lands on Earth. When asked about his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|These events led {{rapidly to}} Mary's defeat and {{imprisonment}} in Loch Leven Castle. The Scottish lords {{forced her to}} abdicate in favour of her son James, who {{had been born in}} June 1566. James was taken to Stirling Castle to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from Loch Leven in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{decided to}} develop a story with a similar {{character}} at its center, but was unsure what other elements to add. He recalled a creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who felt {{he had a good}} ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had a way with words but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.|$|E

50|$|While {{their initial}} <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> flee when disturbed, they do {{typically}} have a nasty disposition. They do not often hesitate to strike or bite if handled, and will often expel a foul-smelling musk from their cloacae.|$|R
50|$|Horses {{sleep better}} when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard {{to watch for}} predators. A horse kept entirely alone may not sleep well because its <b>instincts</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> keep a {{constant}} eye out for danger.|$|R
25|$|Lütjens' first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{attempt to}} outrun the British ships, {{scrupulously}} obeying his orders. He {{became even more}} reluctant to accept battle once the lead enemy vessel was identified as Hood. Even after Hood began to fire on the two ships and {{it became obvious that}} an engagement was inevitable, Lütjens was reluctant to return fire. He ordered his chief yeoman to signal to Prinz Eugen to open fire on the lead enemy ship, but not Bismarck, much to the exasperation of Captain Lindemann, who had the prospect of suffering another disagreement with the Admiral.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{responses to}} the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper. In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to Jytte Klausen, [...] "most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. The <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> split the blame." [...] Berlingske-Tidende criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. Politiken attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem. On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.|$|E
500|$|Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, {{describes}} the period {{immediately following the}} tour as [...] "open season on Harrison". Whereas Rolling Stone had declared in 1973 that Harrison had [...] "inherited the most precious Beatle legacy – the spiritual aura that the group accumulated", now the magazine's album reviewer attacked him for his [...] "insufferable" [...] spiritual preoccupations. Writing in the NME, Woffinden similarly dismissed Dark Horse as [...] "the product of a complete egotist ... someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru." [...] Privately, Harrison descended into a [...] "spiritual funk", Tillery writes. Another biographer, Joshua Greene, concludes of Harrison's post-tour mindset: [...] "He grappled with the depressing realization that most people simply didn't care to hear about Krishna or maya or getting liberated from birth and death ... A man whose natural <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> share his life-transforming discoveries with others had been rejected ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “A ruthlessly logical {{summing up}} of the six Spro-cas commissions… one’s {{constant}} <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> cry: ‘For God’s sake, surely government thinkers must take note of this’.” - Tony Richmond, review of A Taste of Power in The Cape Herald, Cape Town, 20 October 1973.|$|R
50|$|His first <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ignore Bennie's {{blackmail}} {{threats and}} deal with whatever consequences might arise, {{but the thought of}} the shame and embarrassment his family would suffer if he is indicted for the incident in his past, not to mention the negative impact on his own future, leads him to agree to Bennie's demands.|$|R
50|$|Such exclusionary rules {{also send}} an {{implicit}} message to DI analysts that information technology is dangerous and not essential for analysis. Analysts are, {{by the nature}} of their work, especially aware of security threats. So when they are told that a technology is potentially dangerous, their <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> avoid it unless absolutely necessary.|$|R
500|$|The {{summer of}} 1918 saw a {{dramatic}} {{decline in the}} fortunes of the government. [...] On 8 July, Clausen, in central Luxembourg City, had been bombed by the British Royal Air Force, killing ten civilians. Although this did not endear the Allies to Luxembourgers, the Grand Duchess' <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> run to the Germans, who were even less popular amongst the people. [...] On 16 August, German Chancellor Georg von Hertling paid a visit to Luxembourg; although Hertling asked only to see the Grand Duchess, Kauffmann asked that he also attend. [...] To the Luxembourgish people, {{relations between the two countries}} now seemed unambiguously cordial, and all that was left of Kauffmann's credibility disappeared. [...] This was compounded further by the news on 26 August of the engagement of the Grand Duchess' sister, Princess Antonia, to Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, who was Generalfeldmarschall in the German army. [...] Pressure mounted on Kauffmann; with his party still strong, but with his personal reputation shattered, he was left with no option but to resign, which he did on 28 September in favour of Émile Reuter, another conservative.|$|E
500|$|Other Coward works {{produced}} in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; This Was a Man (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, [...] "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, [...] "the two most beautiful {{things in the world}} are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, [...] "My first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daroff Design, Inc. was {{in charge}} of decorating the interiors. Daroff Design and Loews decided International style would not provide the {{atmosphere}} hotel guests sought and predominantly used the Art Deco style instead. Critics criticized the use of Art Deco, saying Daroff Design did not understand the International style and cheapened the original building. However, one architecture critic said [...] "Daroff's flamboyant approach allows Howe and Lescaze's contribution to have its own identity, and Daroff to have hers." [...] Karen Daroff said, [...] "Our first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stay with the minimal design of the International style but we did need to soften it. We took almost a cinematic approach, using Hollywood's view of the '20s and '30s, juxtaposed with the abstract geometry." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{person must}} be {{in contact with the}} octopus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> envenomated. Faced with danger, the octopus's first <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> flee. If the threat persists, the octopus will go into a {{defensive}} stance, and show its blue rings. Only if an octopus is cornered, and touched, will a person be in danger of being bitten and envenomated.|$|R
5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} {{does not seem}} to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Pope {{said that}} when {{individuals}} have a regular workout regiment, but sustain an injury, and can't {{wait to get back}} to working out, that it has a psychiatric protective effect for them.

50|$|She has {{published}} three monographs. Her first solo work, The Trouble with Amelia (Booth-Clibborn Editions 2004) {{focused on the}} subject of men.

6000|$|... "Yes, but he didn't {{describe}} it. All his <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> conceal it from Mona. He wasn't conscious, but he {{was already}} in love with you!" [...] Mrs. Gereth declared.|$|E

50|$|A dogs natural <b>instincts</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> {{eliminate}} {{away from}} {{the area in which}} they eat and sleep. So if a crate is small enough that they cannot possibly defecate while having enough room to sleep well away from it, a dog will 'hold it' as long as they possibly can. It's this instinct we take advantage of when using a crate as an aid for house training.|$|R
5000|$|Euphemia is now free, and Longmore's first <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> go to her. However he puts off {{leaving for}} Europe {{from day to}} day for several years, because [...] "The truth is, that {{in the midst of all}} the ardent {{tenderness}} of his memory of Madame de Mauves, he has become conscious of a singular feeling,—a feeling for which awe would be hardly too strong a name." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Shall {{you come}} in a minute?" [...] said Lottie Witham, lifting the flap of the counter. It was a rare and bold stroke on Mrs. Witham's part. Alvina's {{immediate}} <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> refuse. But she liked Arthur Witham, in his shirt sleeves.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Rice {{was quite}} young; {{he had only}} taken his degree a year before; and he was {{suddenly}} embarrassed. His <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> beg the boy's pardon, {{but he was too}} shy to do so. He made his voice gruff and loud.|$|E
60|$|But {{under the}} various {{deterrent}} influences Jude's <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> approach her timidly, {{and the next}} Sunday {{he went to the}} morning service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further view of her, for he had found that she frequently attended there.|$|E
50|$|When streetwise Molly Templar {{witnesses}} {{a brutal}} murder at the brothel she has recently <b>been</b> apprenticed <b>to,</b> her first <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{run back to}} the poorhouse where she grew up.

For Molly is special, and she is carrying a secret that marks her out for destruction by enemies of the state.|$|R
5|$|Guinea pigs are prey animals whose {{survival}} <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mask {{pain and}} signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.|$|R
50|$|Like other lizards, the Sinai agama is ectothermic. In the daytime, they {{bask in the}} sun and {{are seen}} on boulders, cliffs, or piles of stone.

When the external temperature is lower, their body metabolism is lowered and they are incapable of sudden bursts of speed. Their <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> stand their ground and attack their aggressors.|$|R
