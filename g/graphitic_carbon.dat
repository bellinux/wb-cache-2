5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbon</b> (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbon</b> in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E

25|$|In 1893 Charles Street of Le Carbone {{discovered}} {{a process for}} making artificial graphite. Another process to make synthetic graphite was invented accidentally by Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856–1931). In the mid-1890s, Acheson discovered that overheating carborundum produced almost pure graphite. While studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum, he had found that silicon vaporizes at about 4,150°C (7,500°F), leaving the carbon behind in <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbon.</b> This graphite was another major discovery for him, and it became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant.|$|E

A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal Carbon described the interesting and often-misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbon</b> to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991. He published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry of excitement and could be credited by inspiring the many scientists now studying applications of carbon nanotubes. Though Iijima has been given {{much of the credit}} for discovering carbon nanotubes, {{it turns out that the}} timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than 1991.|$|E
500|$|Boron nitride {{nanotubes}} were {{predicted in}} 1994 and experimentally discovered in 1995. They can be imagined as a rolled up sheet of h-boron nitride. Structurally, it {{is a close}} analog of the carbon nanotube, namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many micrometers, except carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology. In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbon</b> structure.CyNz Nanotubes to Pure BN Nanotubes | year = 2002 | author = Han, Wei-Qiang | journal = Applied Physics Letters | volume = 81 | page = 1110 | issue = 6 |bibcode = 2002ApPhL..81.1110H |display-authors=etal}} ...|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of nitric oxide by arc vaporized carbons (AVC) including the compound C 60, fullerene soot and carbon nanotubes, giving dinitrogen and carbon oxides has been studied. It is {{found that the}} AVC carbons are more active towards oxidation by NO than by oxygen gas at low temperatures (300 - 400 °C). In contrast, conventional carbons such as graphite and microporous carbons are more readily oxidised by oxygen than by NO. The addition of copper salts {{and to a lesser}} extent, cobalt salts, to fullerene soot substantially promote NO reduction. The high intrinsic activity for NO reduction by AVC <b>carbons</b> compared to <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbons</b> is attributed to the presence of five membered carbon rings in the AVC carbons...|$|R
40|$|The rate {{capabilities}} of LiFePO{sub 4 } composites {{are dependent on}} the structure of the carbon that coats the powders, formed during co-calcination with carbon containing precursors. The addition of readily decomposed pyromellitic acid and graphitization catalysts such as ferrocene during synthesis results in coatings with low D/G (disordered/graphene) ratios, while maintaining the carbon content of the powders below 2 wt. %. This is important to avoid adversely affecting the tap density. The good correlation between the pressed pellet conductivities of the LiFePO{sub 4 }/C composites and their rate capability in lithium cells is further confirmation {{of the importance of the}} <b>carbon</b> structure, because <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbons</b> generally have higher conductivities than disordered ones...|$|R

30|$|Above results give {{a strong}} hint towards the {{successful}} {{utilization of the}} processed kitchen waste for the synthesis of mesoporous carbons and further their utilization for electrocatalytic applications. The presence of mesopores and a higher doped N content are altogether important for catalysis-based applications. N-doping in <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbons</b> is special as it is more electronegative element than C; hence, C–N bonds are polarized. N in its vicinity makes the C atom electron deficient and promotes the O 2 adsorption on a graphitic C structure [47, 48]. The charge delocalization upon the introduction of N dopants into C structure dissociates the O–O bonds and facilitates the ORR occurring at the cathode of an FC. Therefore, {{a significant amount of}} N dopants present in the sample SKC 2 is advantageous from the applications point of view.|$|R

The organic linkers that coordinate with cobalt ions tend to yield <b>graphitic</b> <b>carbons</b> after carbonization, unlike those bridging with zinc ions, due to the controlled catalytic graphitization by the cobalt nanoparticles. In this work, we demonstrate a feasible method to achieve nanoporous carbon materials with tailored properties, including specific surface area, pore size distribution, degree of graphitization, and content of heteroatoms.
