5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> {{might be able to}} find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|Selma {{reveals that}} she is unconcerned about money, as she made a good profit in the stock market; Sideshow Bob tells her he <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> is not marrying her for her money. She also reveals that she has no sense of smell or taste and has cut back on cigarettes, now smoking only after meals and after episodes of MacGyver. Selma sends the Simpsons a tape of their honeymoon, {{including}} Sideshow Bob's tirade over {{the absence of a}} gas fireplace in their hotel room. Bart realizes that Selma has one hour to live and the Simpsons rush to the hotel room.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{sort out}} what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> understands she must go back home as there is much to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E

60|$|Young John replied, with acknowledgments, that <b>he</b> only <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> {{did what}} was right, and what showed how entirely he {{was devoted to}} Miss Dorrit. He wished to be unselfish; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was. He wished to do {{anything}} as laid {{in his power to}} serve Miss Dorrit, altogether putting himself out of sight; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> did. It was but little that he could do, but <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> did it.|$|R

5|$|In late January 1965, Buddhist {{protests against}} junta-appointed {{civilian}} Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương broke out across South Vietnam. The unrest came after Huong had unveiled {{plans to expand}} conscription and {{the war against the}} communists, and demonstrations were at their largest in I Corps, a Buddhist and anti-war escalation stronghold. In Huế, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the United States Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khánh and Thi were thought to have {{turned a blind eye to}} the rioting in order to allow the disorder to ruin the Huong government and allow them to inherit power. Khánh decided to have the armed forces replace Huong, and on the morning of 27 January, Khánh staged a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Kỳ. However, many of the officers had agreed to Khánh's plan in <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> would fail and discredit himself.|$|E
25|$|I {{take him}} as the fully {{realised}} personification of the fast bowler as every schoolboy dreams and <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> might one day be himself. Richardson was, in his heyday, a handsome, swarthy giant, lithe, muscular, broad of shoulder, and of apparently inexhaustible energy.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{hoped that}} the move to Derbyshire would improve his chance of being {{selected}} for England. Despite Clarke's high <b>hopes,</b> <b>he</b> experienced a poor run of form in the 2008 season that led to him quitting the captaincy. When he made his decision, he was averaging 21 with the bat and 38 with the ball from eight first-class matches. The only first-class half century of his tenure as captain was a score of 81 against Warwickshire in May. At one point, his form {{was so bad that}} he dropped himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> was. I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> is. But {{what should}} I {{have done if}} he had not come back? No other man would have come back after that. You never behaved unkindly to Isadore?" ...|$|R

25|$|After the Red Wings {{announced}} {{that they would not}} be re-signing Chelios, he signed a 25-game pro tryout contract with the Chicago Wolves. After a second 25-game pro tryout contract with the Wolves, Chelios signed a two-way contract with the Atlanta Thrashers. Chelios remained with the Wolves until he was recalled to the Thrashers, hoping that he could provide a spark for the team's playoff <b>hopes.</b> <b>He</b> played in seven games for the Thrashers, but failed to score any points. On April 7, 2010, Chelios was sent back to the Wolves.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, though, Sharpe {{could never}} get into form and he was dropped from the Surrey side long before the season ended. Though he was {{recalled}} in 1893 when Richardson was injured, he did nothing and Surrey released him {{at the end of}} the year. He played for Nottinghamshire a couple of times in 1894, but any <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> would strengthen their weakening bowling were destroyed very quickly: he took only ten wickets at 28.40 under conditions tremendously favourable to bowlers, and retired at the then-remarkably young age of 28.|$|E
25|$|All {{through his}} reign, Masinissa {{extended}} his territory, {{and he was}} cooperating with Rome when, {{towards the end of}} his life, he provoked Carthage to go to war against him. Any <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> may have had of extending his rule right across North Africa were dashed, however, when a Roman commission headed by the elderly Marcus Porcius Cato (Cato the Elder) came to Africa about 155 BC to decide a territorial dispute between Masinissa and Carthage. Animated probably by an irrational fear of a Carthaginian revival, but possibly by suspicion of Masinissa’s ambitions, Cato thenceforward advocated, finally with success, the destruction of Carthage. Based on descriptions from Livy, the Numidians began raiding around seventy towns in the southern and western sections of Carthage's remaining territory. Outraged with their conduct, Carthage went to war against them, in defiance of the Roman treaty forbidding them to make war on anyone, thus precipitating the Third Punic War (149–146 BC). Masinissa showed his displeasure when the Roman army arrived in Africa in 149 BC, but he died early in 148 BC without a breach in the alliance. Ancient accounts suggest Masinissa lived beyond the age of 90 and was apparently still personally leading the armies of his kingdom when he died.|$|E
60|$|I said I {{was very}} well, and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was. I was {{sufficiently}} ill at ease, Heaven knows; {{but it was}} not in my nature to complain much at that time of my life, so I said I was very well, and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was.|$|R

500|$|Cricket {{commentator}} and statistician Simon Hughes {{states that}} Boycott is fastidious in the commentary box, always immaculately dressed, and never socialises {{with the other}} commentators or production staff. Bill Sinrich, an official of Trans World International, commented that Boycott [...] "fulfilled all our <b>hopes.</b> <b>He</b> was animated, intelligent, informed, with opinions that got the attention of most people." ...|$|E
500|$|Following him {{writing his}} own verse, Tech N9ne {{decided he wanted}} another major rapper on the song after him. He stated, [...] "It was already elite, so I needed {{somebody}} who could come after me, and there aren’t too many who can do it." [...] After contemplating over which rapper would be featured on the song, even sending the song to Eminem with <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> would get on the song, Tech N9ne decided to feature American rapper Kendrick Lamar on the song. This song would be Tech N9ne and Lamar's second collaboration.|$|E
500|$|He was {{partnered with}} Jason Roberts for the 2000–01 season; the pair {{went on to}} score 40 goals between them to help secure the [...] "Baggies" [...] a {{play-off}} place. With 23 goals to his name, he again attracted interest from other clubs. He claimed two hat-tricks in seven days against Gillingham and Preston North End. Hughes converted a penalty in a 2–2 draw with Bolton Wanderers in {{the first leg of}} the play-off semi-final, before a 3–0 defeat at the Reebok Stadium ended Albion's play-off <b>hopes.</b> <b>He</b> refused to sign a new contract in July 2001, and was placed on the transfer list.|$|E

500|$|Tito {{is part of}} a Chinese Cuban {{family of}} {{freelance}} [...] "illegal facilitators", as Brown describes them – forgers, smugglers, and associated support personnel based in New York City – and is assigned by his uncles to hand over a series of iPods to a mysterious old man. Tito is adept in a form of systema that encompasses tradecraft, a variant of free running, and the Santería religion. It is alluded that the old man may have connections to American intelligence circles and Tito <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> can explain the mysterious death of his father. When the old man calls in a favour, his family dispatches Tito on a dangerous new assignment.|$|E
500|$|There were {{personal}} as well {{as professional}} {{changes taking place in}} Skelton's life at this time. [...] He divorced Georgia in 1971 and married Lothian Toland, daughter of cinematographer Gregg Toland, on October 7, 1973. While he disassociated himself from television soon after his show was cancelled, his bitterness had subsided enough for him to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on July 11, 1975; it was his first television appearance since he no longer had a television program. Johnny Carson, one of his former writers, began his rise to network television prominence by substituting for Skelton after his dress rehearsal injury in 1954. Skelton was also a guest on The Merv Griffin Show in October of the same year. Any <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> may have had to ease back into television through the talk show circuit came to an abrupt halt on May 10, 1976, when Georgia Skelton committed suicide by gunshot on the 18th anniversary of Richard Skelton's death. Georgia was 54 and had been in poor health for some time. He put all professional activities on hold for some months as he mourned his former wife's death.|$|E
500|$|Otto, Prince of Bavaria, {{was chosen}} as the first King of Greece in 1832, under the name Othon. His arrival in Nafplio, then the Greek capital, was hailed enthusiastically by Makriyannis. This {{attitude}} is exemplified in his Memoirs: [...] The <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> had for the new regime, however, were soon to be dispelled. King Otho was underage and Bavarian regents were named to rule on his behalf during the first months of his rule. During the regency, Makriyannis came into conflict with the War Minister, the Bavarian Heideck, due to the latter's attitude towards the veterans of the War of Independence. In the newly restructured Greek Army, there was little place left for the irregular bands of klephts. These guerilla-styled fighters had formed the backbone of the Greek forces during the war, and Makriyannis considered their exclusion from the newly formed army disrespectful. Furthermore, most of these men had been left with no resources after their exclusion from the military, and found themselves in a dire financial situation. Makriyannis also believed that the Prime Minister, the Bavarian von Armansperg, was personally responsible for the serious problems faced by the newly formed state. As a consequence, Makriyannis briefly retired from active politics.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{process of}} the album eventually lasted from January to August 2003, with an additional mixing and mastering period lasting until October. Previous Blink-182 sessions were recorded in three months. The band stated that being in a studio longer than three months gave them the luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing, playing, and recording. The band built each song with a minute attention to detail. Hoppus described the studio as a [...] "musical laboratory": over 70 guitars, 30 amps, [...] "30 or 40" [...] different snare drums, up to six drum kits, various keyboards, turntables, and pianos {{were used in the}} album's production, a lot of which came from Finn's personal collection. Barker was responsible for the turntables and a copy of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The group also enlisted the help of James Guthrie, an engineer behind The Wall. The trio also sent The Cure frontman Robert Smith the bed track of [...] "All of This" [...] in <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> would contribute; Smith makes a guest appearance and recorded his parts in England. The three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to the humor-oriented nature of their earlier recordings, to which Smith responded, [...] "Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. I really like the music you sent me." [...] The band also collaborated with DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator, and Barker desired to work with The Neptunes. Jerry Finn, who had produced the previous two Blink-182 albums and the Box Car Racer album, returned to produce Blink-182, which would be his final contribution with the band.|$|E
500|$|The Jets' {{success in}} signing Namath {{and the rise}} of the team in the standings {{adversely}} affected their crosstown rivals, the Giants, who had played in five NFL championship games in six years to 1963, but who thereafter declined in the standings. [...] Giants owner Wellington Mara stated, [...] "I think the Jets coming in when they did contributed to our bad years, because we tried to do everything for the short term rather than the long haul—we'd trade a draft choice for a player, figuring he'd give us one or two good years. We didn't want to accept how the public might react if we had a bad year or two or three." [...] In 1968, the Giants traded for star Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton in the vain <b>hopes</b> <b>he</b> would lead them to renewed success and rival Namath in the public eye. In August 1969, the Jets faced the Giants in a preseason game at the Yale Bowl. [...] While the Jets' Super Bowl win legitimized the AFL as a comparable league to the NFL in the eyes of many, others doubted the AFL's standard of play, and the Jets were underdogs going into the game. Giants coach Allie Sherman approached the game as if it were a regular season contest, and the Jets sent the three remaining original Titans out for the coin toss. The Jets defeated the Giants 37–14, and Sherman was fired a few weeks later. The Jets' fellow tenants, the Mets, won a championship themselves; the baseball team's accomplishments forced the Jets to play their first five games on the road. The Jets recovered from a slow start to win their second consecutive Eastern Division championship, but fell to Kansas City in the divisional round of the playoffs, 13–6.|$|E
2500|$|Bolts {{is said to}} have {{attempted}} to revive his fortunes in France, setting up an enterprise near Paris, but the outbreak of war with Austria and Britain once again destroyed his <b>hopes.</b> <b>He</b> returned to England in 1800-01, where he attempted unsuccessfully to interest the East India Company in obtaining supplies of copper from Anatolia to sell in India. [...] He then moved to Lisbon where in the 1760s, before joining the English East India Company, he had worked in the diamond trade. He made his last will in Lisbon in August 1805 and died, it is said, in a Paris poorhouse (hôpital) in 1808.|$|E
