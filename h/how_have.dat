25|$|In 1941, Charles Huggins {{reported}} that androgen ablation therapy causes regression of primary and metastatic androgen-dependent prostate cancer. He {{was awarded the}} 1966 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for this discovery. Androgen ablation therapy causes remission in 80-90% of patients undergoing therapy, resulting in a median progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months. After remission, an androgen-independent phenotype typically emerges, wherein the median overall survival is 23–37 months {{from the time of}} initiation of androgen ablation therapy. It is not clear how the prostate cancer becomes androgen-independent or how it reestablishes progression, although a few possibilities (on <b>how)</b> <b>have</b> been proposed. And the way the cancer changes, to overcome the lack of androgen, may vary between individual patients.|$|E
500|$|The Undiscovered Continent: Academic Suzanne Juhasz {{considers}} that Dickinson saw {{the mind and}} spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them. Often, this intensely private place {{is referred to as}} the [...] "undiscovered continent" [...] and the [...] "landscape of the spirit" [...] and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding—castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms—to create a dwelling place of [...] "oneself" [...] where one resides with one's other selves. An example that brings together many of these ideas is: [...] "Me from Myself– to banish–/ Had I Art–/ Impregnable my Fortress/ Unto All Heart–/ But since myself—assault Me–/ <b>How</b> <b>have</b> I peace/ Except by subjugating/ Consciousness./ And since We're mutual Monarch/ How this be/ Except by Abdication–/ Me– of Me?".|$|E

[...] The late Kuo was a vital force in the local theatre renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s. He was the artistic director of The Substation for many years. [...] Some of his plays, like The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole (1984) and Lao Jiu (1990), have been now considered classics. Stella Kon gained international fame with her now-famous play Emily of Emerald Hill. About an ageing Peranakan matriarch, it has been produced in Scotland, Malaysia and Australia. The sole character has been played by men as well as women. More recent plays have tended to revolve mostly around social issues, especially causes such as gay rights. A few plays by writers such as Tan Tarn <b>How</b> <b>have</b> ventured successfully into the realm of political satire, but their audiences and critical reception remain limited.|$|E
