Schumacher made his first pit-stop on lap 22 and Villeneuve made his first stop the following lap. Both retained their positions. During {{the first round of}} pitstops the McLarens swapped places with David Coulthard leading Mika Häkkinen and Frentzen dropped to fifth position behind both of them. The order of the leaders after the second round of pitstops on lap 43 and lap 44 remained the same but with Villeneuve closer to Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E

The film <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> critical reception in Italy and France and won France's César Award for Best Foreign Film. In the US, Miramax's lack of promotional effort was blamed for the film's underperformance in the country. It was however nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
25|$|Opposition of the Greek populace to taxing or paidomazoma {{resulted}} in grave consequences. For example, in 1705 an Ottoman official was sent from Naoussa in Macedonia to search and conscript new Janissaries and {{was killed by}} Greek rebels who resisted {{the burden of the}} devshirmeh. The rebels were subsequently beheaded and their severed heads were displayed in the city of Thessaloniki. In some cases, it was greatly feared as Greek families would often have to relinquish their own sons who would convert and return later as their oppressors. In other cases, the families bribed the officers to ensure that their children <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> life as a government officer.|$|E

A total of approximately 79,000 people attended the race. Ralf Schumacher started the race in the spare Williams monocoque because his race car developed a sensor issue with his engine the previous day. When the race started, Häkkinen <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> start than Michael Schumacher but the latter moved across the circuit to block Häkkinen. Ralf Schumacher also got a good start and passed Coulthard and Barrichello. At the exit of the first corner, Ralf Schumacher made contact with the rear of Häkkinen's car, sending him slightly sideways and both drivers were able to continue. Button also made a good start, moving from eleventh to ninth {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Irvine dropped three places over the same distance. Diniz spun off into the gravel on the first lap and retired.

500|$|In 1995, a {{deal was}} signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed {{all of the}} {{commercial}} rights to Formula One to him for 15years, {{on the condition that}} they would return to the FIA {{at the end of that}} period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said [...] "My belief is that I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long." [...] The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15years, An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission. Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams. They refused to sign the 1997 Concorde Agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under European Union competition rules. The European Commission was already investigating the FIA’s agreement with Ecclestone in what Lovell calls a [...] "highly personal and bitter battle between Max Mosley and [...] van Miert".|$|E

However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first season, 16-year-old Lucas Scott is recruited by coach Whitey Durham to play for the Ravens basketball team after most of the players are suspended for drunk-driving. He soon has troubles with his half-brother Nathan, who is also the Ravens captain, because Nathan wants to remain the star of the team and feels threatened by Lucas's arrival. Encouraged by Dan, who also wants Lucas off the team, Nathan and his teammates make life difficult for Lucas, on one occasion kidnapping him and throwing him into a ditch. Nevertheless, Lucas is determined to stay on the team (although he removes the name [...] "Scott" [...] from his jersey). He is attracted to and shares a deep emotional connection with Peyton (Nathan's girlfriend). Disgusted by Nathan's behavior towards his brother, she eventually breaks up with him. Nathan retaliates by pursuing Lucas's best friend Haley, who agrees to tutor Nathan in return for him leaving Lucas alone. Lucas and Peyton fall in love, but Peyton is initially scared of a romance with Lucas (not wanting to be [...] "serious" [...] with him). Lucas is devastated and starts seeing Peyton's best friend, Brooke, at the same moment Peyton realizes she has made a mistake in turning Lucas away. He soon cheats on Brooke with Peyton, though sex is never involved in the betrayal. On the night that Lucas and Peyton are about to tell Brooke about their affair, Lucas and Keith are involved in a car accident, and, {{for the first time in}} the series, Dan calls Lucas his son so that Lucas can get immediate treatment. Lucas wakes up from a short coma and wants to be with Peyton, but Peyton ends their affair for Brooke's sake after Brooke finds out about their tryst. Lucas's feelings towards Dan are challenged when he learns that Dan wanted joint custody of Lucas, but Karen refused. He also finds himself in Dan's position when Brooke claims to be pregnant, although this turns out to be false as Brooke was lying to seek her revenge on Lucas for breaking her heart. His friendship with Peyton is broken once she learns he had a one-night stand with new resident Nicki not long after she ended their affair. However, his relationship with Nathan improves as Lucas realizes that he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> deal than Nathan, who is damaged as a result of being raised by Dan. Wanting a fresh start, Lucas decides to leave town with Keith. Lucas and Nathan have a final conversation where Nathan calls Lucas his brother and Lucas says, [...] "I'll miss you, little brother." [...] Before leaving with Keith, he goes to say goodbye to Haley and discovers that she and Nathan have married.|$|E
