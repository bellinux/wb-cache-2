5|$|The Jayhawks' <b>ground</b> <b>game</b> {{was less}} {{effective}} than their pass offense, but still had success against a tough Virginia Tech defense. Running back Brandon McAnderson, Kansas' leading rusher, finished {{the game with}} 15carries for 75yards. Backup running back Jake Sharp rushed nine times for 33yards, including several key first-down runs.|$|E
5|$|Mann's next fight (and {{third in}} the Cage Rage organisation) was against top {{domestic}} prospect, Robbie Olivier. The fight saw both fighters neutralise the other's <b>ground</b> <b>game.</b> In the stand-up, Mann was regarded as being unusually tentative, which gave Olivier {{the opportunity to take}} him to the floor, where again, neither fighter was able to advance position or do anything of note. After three rounds, Olivier was declared the winner via unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|Wallhead competed {{just weeks}} later {{and made his}} second {{professional}} appearance against Boris Jonstomp at Cage Warriors: Strike Force. This fight was fought at the lower weight of middleweight and saw Wallhead succeed with judo throw attempts early in the fight. However, Wallhead's <b>ground</b> <b>game</b> was not to the same standard at Jonstomp's and he lost via first round submission (neck crank) after 4:20.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{performance}} was supplemented by Tech running back Branden Ore, who led all rushers with 55yards on 19rushes. Fourteenof Ore's 55yards {{came on a}} single play halfway through the fourth quarter when the Boston College's defensive line gave way, admitting Tech's runner into the defensive secondary. The run helped set up Virginia Tech's go-ahead touchdown later in the fourth quarter. Capping Tech's <b>ground</b> <b>game</b> were complimentary performances by Kenny Lewis and Sean Glennon, each of whom earned fewer than 10yards, but picked up first downs on two plays.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{took over}} at their 39-yard line, and {{immediately}} found success. Randall connected on two 10-yard passes {{to take the}} Hokies into Air Force territory. The two passes were followed by a 16-yard run by Tech fullback Doug Easlick for another first down at the Air Force 24-yard line. From there, the Tech <b>ground</b> <b>game</b> continued to eat up yards and result in first downs. Kevin Jones ran the ball twice for 11yards, then Lee Suggs ran the ball three times for 13yards, the last carry also resulting in a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave Tech its first lead of the game, 17–10, with 4:45 remaining.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies were {{slightly}} more effective rushing the ball. In the <b>ground</b> <b>game,</b> seven different players carried {{the ball at}} least once, netting 135rushing yards. Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put him just eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is even more impressive {{when one considers that}} he had been suspended for the entire first quarter of the game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E

Oklahoma won the <b>ground</b> <b>game</b> with 153 yards to Miami's 140. During the game, the Sooners leading wide receiver, Ryan Broyles, suffered a broken shoulder blade.

25|$|Aided by a 17-yard {{run from}} Woody Bennett {{on the first}} play of the game, Miami scored on their opening drive with a 51-yard field goal by Fuad Reveiz.

A 63-yard run by Fred Talley set up another Razorback touchdown, and Razorback Tom Crowder {{recovered}} the kickoff fumbled by Ole Miss in the end zone, to push the score to 41–14. Manning completed a drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass, but with just over ten minutes left, it was too little to late. Each team then added another touchdown before the Razorbacks homecoming game went final, 48–28. The Razorbacks' outstanding <b>ground</b> <b>game</b> was helped out by five Rebels turnovers, which led to 24 Razorback points.|$|E
25|$|His name became {{connected}} {{with the passing of}} the <b>Ground</b> <b>Game</b> Act 1880 and the Arms (Ireland) Act 1881. As Home Secretary {{at the time of the}} Phoenix Park murders and the subsequent London bombings he reacted rapidly, and the Explosive Substances Act 1883 was passed through all its stages in the shortest time on record. His robust stand on law and order brought him into conflict with the Irish members. In 1884 he introduced an aborted bill for unifying the municipal administration of London. and was responsible for demanding the prosecution in the survival cannibalism case of R v. Dudley and Stephens. In 1885 he was responsible for commuting John 'Babbacombe' Lee's death penalty to life imprisonment after his execution failed three times.

After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could tell he was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E

25|$|The Buccaneers' only score came on Cedric Brown's 80-yard {{return of}} a Steve DeBerg interception, which tied the score at 7–7 in the third quarter.
