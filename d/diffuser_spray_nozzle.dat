40|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{hydrogen}} no-vent fill tests were performed {{in this test}} series using various size <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> and a <b>spray</b> bar with different hole sizes in a 5 cubic foot receiver tank. Fill levels of 90 percent by volume or greater were achieved in 26 of the tests while maintaining a receiver tank pressure below 30 psia. <b>Spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> were mounted {{at the top of}} the tank, whereas, the spray bar was centered in the tank axially. The <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> no-vent fills demonstrated tank pressure and temperature responses comparable to previous test series. Receiver tank pressure responses for the spray bar configuration were similar to the <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> tests with the pressure initially rising rapidly, then leveling off as vapor condenses onto the discharging liquid streams, and finally ramping up near the end of the test due to ullage compression. Both liquid injection techniques tested were capable of filling the receiver tank to 90 percent under variable test conditions. Comparisons between the <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> and <b>spray</b> bar configurations for well matched test conditions indicate the <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> injection technique is more effective in minimizing the receiving tank pressure throughout a no-vent fill compared to the spray bar under normal gravity conditions...|$|R
40|$|Water spray characteristics, {{including}} {{droplet size}} and velocity, airborne dust capture potential, and induced airflow quantity for various <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs were evaluated to provide basic information for improving spray applications. Water droplet size and velocity characteristics were initially {{measured by a}} Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) for hollow cone, full cone, flat fan, and air atomized <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> at similar operating parameters. Airflow inducement and dust capture experiments were also conducted under the same operating parameters to examine any salient features of the <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> type, droplet characteristics, induced airflow, and airborne dust capture. Test results indicate that there are trade offs between airflow inducement and dust capture efficiency. A <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> with a wider discharge angle was observed to induce more airflow, but at reduced dust capture efficiencies. Increasing <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> fluid pressure(s) generally reduced water droplet sizes with concurrent increases in droplet velocity, airflow inducement, and airborne dust capture. Placing a three-sided barrier around the <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> normally reduced <b>spray</b> air induction and increased dust capture efficiency. A direct relationship between airborne dust capture efficiency and spray input power normalized per unit of airflow induced was ob- served. This information can be utilized to improve the performance of water sprays for reducing airborne dust levels...|$|R

40|$|Many {{processes}} use <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{to introduce}} liquid into a fluidized bed. One such {{process is the}} Fluid Coking Process {{which is used to}} upgrade bitumen. Poor liquid distribution in a Fluid Coker proves detrimental as agglomerates form which introduce mass and heat transfer limitations. The main objective of this thesis is to determine the effect of interacting spray jets on the liquid distribution in a Fluid Coker. This was accomplished by using a low temperature experimental model of Fluid Coking to estimate the liquid distribution. Preliminary screening of nozzle positions was accomplished by the use of conductance measurements. A binder solution was then utilized to further investigate the agglomerates produced for the most interesting nozzle positions. Three types of <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> interactions were investigated to determine their effect on the liquid distribution in a Fluid Coker.

50|$|The {{height of}} each <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{above the surface}} of the pond should be between 1.5 m and 2.0 m. The <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{themselves}} should be chosen so as to provide the desired spray pattern diameter at the pond surface, while yielding a maximum spray height of 2.5 m or more above the nozzle. This will provide an adequate contact time between the air and water and should be achievable with a delivery pressure of between 50 and 75 kPa across the nozzles. The performance of a spray pond depends to a large degree on the effectiveness of the <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> which are installed. Ideally, the chosen nozzles should provide a fine, evenly distributed spray in conical form, be capable of passing small particles of suspended matter without blocking and be readily dismantled for cleaning. Typical droplet sizes which are achieved by <b>spray</b> pond <b>nozzles</b> vary between 3 mm and 6 mm. While providing better cooling performance because of their increased surface-to-volume ratios, the generation of droplets of smaller size would require an excessive pressure drop across the nozzles and could lead to increased wind-drift losses from the pond.|$|R

Problems arise with lift masts which are fitted very close to the frame of the sprayer. Solutions might be technical modifications of the boom and tube.
