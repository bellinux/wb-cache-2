Lewis shows that {{apart from the}} settling to {{a lower level of}} stable population, further declines were caused by over-harvesting in two of the three English trading posts (Albany and York). The data from the third trading post are also very interesting in that the post did not come under French pressure and was therefore shielded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of over-exploitation of stocks which resulted at the other trading posts. At Fort Churchill, the stocks of beaver adjusted to the maximum sustained yield level. The data from Churchill further reinforce the case of over-exploitation of stocks caused by the French-English competition.|$|E
25|$|Violence in Portuguese schools {{became an}} {{educational}} {{issue for the}} first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, it must be said that {{this was not the first}} time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of violence we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from poverty to psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school or teachers properties are realities which become current in many schools.|$|E

500|$|His career {{boosted by}} his sudden {{international}} fame, Kurosawa, now {{reunited with his}} original film studio, Toho (which {{would go on to}} produce his next 11 films), set to work on his next project, Ikiru. The movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer-ridden Tokyo bureaucrat, Watanabe, on a final quest for meaning before his death. For the screenplay, Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni, who would go on to co-write 12 Kurosawa films. Despite the work's grim subject matter, the screenwriters took a satirical approach, which some have compared to the work of Brecht, to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan. (American pop songs figure prominently in the film.) Because of this strategy, the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses. Ikiru opened in October 1952 to rave reviews—it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo [...] "Best Film" [...] award—and enormous box office success. It remains the most acclaimed of all the artist's films set in the modern era.|$|E

He has the power of absorbing and redirecting kinetic and radiated energy. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner said Bacon was considered for Shaw for being an actor who could convey a villain [...] "with different shades, that's not always clear that he's the bad guy". Vaughn added that Bacon [...] "had that bravado that Shaw needed", while stating that the actor was his top choice along with Colin Firth. Bacon accepted the role as he was a fan of Vaughn's Kick-Ass, and liked both the character of Shaw and the script, which he described as [...] "a fresh look at the franchise, but also the comic book movies in general". The actor considered that Shaw was a sociopath to whom [...] "the morality of the world did not apply", with producer Simon Kinberg adding that Bacon portrayed him as [...] "somebody, who in his mind, is the hero of the movie". Bacon also said that, [...] "aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of evil side, I portrayed him as kind of a Hugh Hefner type". Vaughn discarded Shaw's look from the comics as he felt he would [...] "look like an Austin Powers villain".|$|E
500|$|Procter's {{popularity}} continued {{after her}} death; {{the first volume}} of Legends and Lyrics went through 19 editions by 1881, and the second through 14 editions by the same year. Many of her poems were made into hymns or otherwise set to music. [...] Among these was [...] "The Lost Chord", which Arthur Sullivan set to music in 1877; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States. Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German. By 1938, Procter's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them [...] "stupid, trivial and not worthy of the subject". Critics such as Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a [...] "model middle-class domestic angel" [...] and a [...] "fragile and modest saint" [...] rather than as an [...] "active feminist and strong poet." [...] Emma Mason argues that although Dickens's portrayal of Procter [...] "extinguished modern interest" [...] in her, it also [...] "has helped rescue Procter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like Letitia Landon." ...|$|E

Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement suggests that he may one day be a director to rank with Don Siegel." [...] Jeffrey Wells of Films In Review wrote, [...] "Skillfully paced and edited, Assault was rich with Hawksian dialogue and humor, especially in the clever caricature of the classic 'Hawks woman' by Laurie Zimmer."
