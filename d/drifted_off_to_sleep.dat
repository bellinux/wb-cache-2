2500|$|In chapter 20 verses 6 through 12 of The Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament, the {{accidental}} autodefenestration {{of a young}} man of Troas named Eutychus is recorded. [...] The Apostle Paul was travelling to Jerusalem and had stopped for 7 days in Troas. [...] While preaching in a third-story room late on a Sunday night to the local assembly of Christian believers, the young man Eutychus <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and fell out of the window in which he was sitting. [...] Interestingly, this incident is likely also the only recorded case of raising from death after fatal defenestration, as though Eutychus was taken up dead from the ground below, the Apostle Paul fell upon the body, embraced it, and then presented him alive to those present, whom the Bible indicates [...] "were not a little comforted."

2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maxwell {{spent the}} next few days in a {{hospital}} located in Norristown, Pennsylvania, where he was suffering from seven broken ribs, a punctured lung and a dislocated hip. Pneumonia developed, and delirium soon followed. On the night of June 29, Maxwell was visited by his neighbor and close friend, Charles Heeb. Emerging from his delirium he talked of packing his bags and going home. [...] "Take two hours' sleep, and I'll go with you," [...] Heeb told him. Maxwell agreed and he <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> where he later died.|$|E

25|$|Familiar {{examples}} of normal myoclonus include hiccups and hypnic jerks {{that some people}} experience while <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Severe cases of pathologic myoclonus can distort movement and severely limit a person's ability <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> eat, talk, and walk. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in individuals with epilepsy.|$|R
5000|$|Later in {{the house}} they get some sleep, putting {{mattresses}} {{in front of the}} fire. [...] "The last thing I remember was Mona's hand on the floor, between our two mattresses, and that hand, as I <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> acquired an incredible meaning." [...] Snowploughs clear the roads, and police, following up Donald's call, come to question him about Ray. When Donald later goes back to the barn he finds the cigarette butts on the ground are missing: Isabel must have cleared them away, so that the police, checking Donald's story, would not find them. [...] "She knew. Yet there was no accusation in her blue eyes, no sharpened attitude. Only a slight astonishment and curiosity." [...] Later, Ray's body is found.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{advocate}} enhancing creativity {{by taking}} advantage of hypnagogia, the transition from wakefulness <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> using techniques such as lucid dreaming. One technique used by Salvador Dalí was <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in an armchair with a set of keys in his hand; when he fell completely asleep, the keys would fall and wake him up, allowing him to recall his mind's subconscious imaginings. [...] Thomas Edison used the same technique, with ball bearings.|$|R
50|$|Audiobooks are {{considered}} a valuable tool because of their format. Unlike traditional books or a video program, one can listen to an audiobook while doing other tasks. Such tasks include doing the laundry, exercising, weeding and similar tasks. The most popular general use of audiobooks by adults is when commuting with an automobile or while traveling with public transport, {{as an alternative to}} radio. Many people listen as well just to relax or as they <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
50|$|On July 24, 2012, The Antlers {{released}} a four-song EP entitled Undersea on ANTI- in the U.S. and Transgressive Records in the UK/Europe. This 4 song EP {{has been described}} by the band as an imitation of “the serenity of <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> or sinking <b>to</b> the bottom of the ocean.” The record received widespread critical acclaim, with Pitchfork stating that the band’s “mutually reliant interplay has never been stronger than it is here.” Darby Cicci designed the artwork for the EP.|$|R

Hubbard leaves Cory in his room and proceeds to get visibly drunk among the rest of the conventioneers. Cory <b>drifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in Hubbard’s bed.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} is still suspicious of Lucas, however, and the ostracism turns to violence. Someone kills his dog, Fanny, while another assailant throws a stone through his window. When he goes grocery shopping, {{the grocery store}} employees attack him. On Christmas Eve, Lucas confronts Theo during a public church service. Later, Theo overhears Klara apologizing to Lucas as she <b>drifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> He realizes that Lucas is innocent, and he visits him on Christmas Day with food and alcohol as a peace offering.|$|R

Just then, they see the lights of a police car coming to the house. Olivia says that the police must not get in, showing that she has fallen for Dan.|$|R
50|$|Gustatory, {{olfactory}} {{and thermal}} sensations in hypnagogia {{have all been}} reported, as well as tactile sensations (including those kinds classed as paresthesia or formication). Sometimes there is synesthesia; many people report seeing {{a flash of light}} or some other visual image in response to a real sound. Proprioceptive effects may be noticed, with numbness and changes in perceived body size and proportions, feelings of floating or bobbing, and out-of-body experiences. Perhaps the most common experience of this kind is the falling sensation, and associated hypnic jerk, encountered by many people, at least occasionally, while <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Later, comedian Don Rickles guest-starred as a crusty boarder named Al Snyder, who {{rented a}} room from Archie's friend and {{neighbor}} Barney, whose wife Blanche {{had left him}} sometime earlier. Highlights of this episode are exchanges combining Rickles' insult humor and his character's curmudgeonly disposition with Archie's sincere but misguided efforts to resolve disputes between Snyder and Barney. Eventually, the Rickles character is exhausted by the constant chatter and decides to rest. The Rickles character <b>drifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and dies. The episode ends with Barney pondering whether he'll wind up like Mr. Snyder: [...] "Sore at the world, 'cause I'm all alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|They {{arrive at}} the camp late in the evening, lie {{down next to the}} fire beneath the open sky and talk about what they will wish for if a {{shooting}} star was <b>to</b> appear. They <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> content with the idea that their wishes will surely be granted. The next day dawns and they run together to a place {{at the edge of the}} mountain and the sea of clouds. There, Mace unloads herself of everything, screams all of her anger, all of her pain and of everything she has been unable say to her ex-boyfriend.|$|R
5|$|David is revived {{and walks}} to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David’s {{memories}} to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from DNA in the lock of hair. The Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she <b>drifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.|$|R
40|$|Dystonic {{movements}} after {{general anesthesia}} are very rare. The differential diagnosis includes adverse drug reaction, local anesthetic reaction, emergence delirium, hysterical response, and shivering. We present {{a case of}} a 10 -year-old, otherwise healthy girl undergoing outpatient foot surgery. Involuntary jerking movements of her arms and torso every time she would <b>drift</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> started about 2. 5 hours after emergence from general anesthesia. The patient was easily arousable and absolutely unaware of the movements. These movements lasted for several days before they resolved completely.

5000|$|A mother tucking her son {{into bed}} tells the child an {{exciting}} {{story about a}} time long ago, when a masked man dressed as a bat fought criminals, villains, and all forms of evil to defend Gotham City. As her boy <b>drifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> the woman murmurs that the mysterious Batman swore to always be Gotham's protector, and hopes that he might resurface soon. It is then revealed that the story {{takes place in a}} Orwellian dystopia, with Gotham transformed into a police state—but the final panel depicts a familiar, bat-shaped shadow descending on an officer, suggesting that Batman has not abandoned his quest to save Gotham.|$|R
5000|$|People {{who played}} Tetris for a {{prolonged}} {{amount of time}} could find themselves thinking about ways different shapes {{in the real world}} can fit together, such as the boxes on a supermarket shelf, the buildings on a street, or hallucinating pieces being generated and falling into place on an invisible layout. [...] In this sense, the Tetris effect is a form of habit. They might also dream about falling tetrominos when <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> or see images of falling tetrominos at the edges of their visual fields or when they close their eyes. [...] In this sense, the Tetris effect is a form of hypnagogic imagery.|$|R
50|$|Tom and his cat friends—Butch, Lightning, and Meathead—are singing loudly in {{the middle}} of the night. The cats drop Tom off at home; he yawns and stretches, now very tired from the night out. He climbs up onto the window ledge, {{deciding}} <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> there. However, just as he <b>drifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> Mammy Two-Shoes (portrayed by Lillian Randolph) arrives and chastises Tom. Tom enters the kitchen and nearly falls asleep, until Mammy warns him to stay awake and keep Jerry out of the refrigerator, as she will kick him out of the house if she catches him sleeping.

40|$|The {{collision}} occurred without warning. Prior to the impact, thoughts had {{revolved around}} dinner plans.
