40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for designing <b>hybrid</b> scooter <b>transmissions</b> with planetary gear trains. The basic concept is to combine two planetary gear trains into a split-power system; so, by incorporating clutches and brakes when engaged, the system becomes a <b>hybrid</b> scooter <b>transmission.</b> The transmissions combine the power from two power sources, a gasoline engine and an electric motor. The systems use four different modes {{in order to}} maximize the performance and reduce emissions: electric-motor mode; engine-mode and engine/charging mode; power-mode; and regenerative-braking mode. Kinematic and power flow analyses are performed. According to the analysis results, formulae for the speed ratio of the transmission are derived and a procedure for identifying the arrangements with no internal recirculation of the split power system is developed. Sixteen possible configurations of <b>hybrid</b> scooter <b>transmission</b> satisfying the design requirements are presented. A design example is used to illustrate the design procedure and operation principle of the <b>transmission.</b> <b>Hybrid</b> scooter <b>Transmission</b> Split-power system Planetary gear-train...|$|R

50|$|The Escape Hybrid uses {{technology}} {{similar to}} that used in the Toyota Prius. Ford engineers realized their technology may conflict with patents held by Toyota, which led to a 2004 patent-sharing accord between the companies, licensing Ford's use of some of Toyota's hybrid technology in exchange for Toyota's use of some of Ford's diesel and direct-injection engine technology. Ford maintains that Ford received no technical assistance from Toyota in developing the hybrid powertrain, but that some hybrid engine technologies developed by Ford independently were found to be similar to technologies previously patented by Toyota, so licenses were obtained. Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd., a Japanese automotive components supplier belonging to the Toyota Group, supplies the HD-10 <b>hybrid</b> continuously variable <b>transmission</b> for the Escape Hybrid. While Toyota produces its third-generation Prius transmission in-house, Aisin is the only supplier of <b>hybrid</b> <b>transmissions</b> to other manufacturers.

5000|$|A two-mode hybrid {{version was}} planned to begin {{production}} in 2010, but Chrysler decided to cancel it {{in favor of}} a smaller test fleet of 140 plug-in hybrid (PHEV) Rams developed with support from a [...] million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy financed through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Chrysler PHEV pickup project has an estimated total cost of [...] million. [...] The RAM 1500 pickup PHEV was introduced at the January 2011 Washington Auto Show. The vehicle is part of a three-year demonstration program intended to field test and evaluate battery performance across a wide range of drive cycles and temperature ambients, and also to evaluate customer acceptance. The PHEV demonstrator pick-up trucks are assembled at the Warren Truck Assembly plant in Michigan and the plug-in hybrid conversion takes place at the Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The demonstrators are being allocated for field testing among local and state governments, utility companies, and a U.S. Army base. Chrysler has no plans for a production version.The Ram 1500 PHEV demonstrator has a 345 hp 5.7L Hemi V8 gasoline engine mated to a two-mode <b>hybrid</b> <b>transmission</b> and a 12.9 kWh 355V lithium-ion battery from Electrovaya. This setup allows an all-electric range of more than 20 mi, but as a blended plug-in hybrid, the RAM PHEV does not run exclusively all-electric during EV mode. The fully charged plug-in starts off with charge depletion with limited regeneration at {{the high end of the}} state of charge (SoC). That ramps up to a full regenerative capability somewhere in the 70 to 95% range and depletes down to about 20%. Once depleted, it comes into a narrow charge-sustaining range. The plug-in pick-up meets AT-PZEV emissions standards, making it the only full-size V8 pickup with an AT-PZEV rating. Its fuel economy in charge-depleting mode is more than [...] in city driving. The Ram 1500 PHEV is capable of towing up to 6000 lb.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{increase}} of the transmission capacity and environmental limit of the power transmission passage have indispensably promoted development of the AC/DC <b>hybrid</b> <b>transmission</b> lines on the same tower, especially for UHV systems being established in China.

The system energy efficiency in the hybrid scheme is evaluated under the system spectral efficiency constraint and is {{compared with those}} of the HD and FD modes. This hybrid scheme not only utilizes the throughput advantage of FD but also weakens the negative effect of SI. The authors in [24] also studied <b>hybrid</b> HD/FD <b>transmission</b> and transmit power optimization. They considered a two-hop relay system with direct link, where the flexible switching can be done between HD and FD as well as between relaying and direct transmission. However, the switching between HD and FD is based on the end-to-end SINR, which requires global channel state information compared to the proposed hybrid scheme. Besides, they only considered maximizing the system spectral efficiency but ignored the system energy efficiency, which is very important for energy-efficient implementation of the hybrid scheme in the 5 G era.|$|R

When the clutch is not engaged, the fluid held by the centrifugal force inside of the clutch chamber, which introduces additional pressure that will affect the subsequent clutch fill and engagement processes, should be released. To realize this function, a ball capsule system is introduced and mounted on the clutch chamber. When the clutch is ready to be filled for engagement, the ball capsule needs to close quickly and remain closed until the clutch is disengaged. It’s also desirable to have appropriate closing velocity for the ball capsule to minimize noise and wear. In this paper, we will model the ball capsule dynamics and reveal its intrinsic positive feedback structure, which is considered to be the key to realize a fast response, and design the optimal shape of the capsule to achieve the desired performance.
