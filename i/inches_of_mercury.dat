25|$|Rather than use <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury,</b> the British {{measured}} {{boost pressure}} in psi. A reading of +6 meant the air/fuel mix was being compressed to 20.7 psi (6 psi {{more than one}} atmosphere) before entering the engine; +25 meant the air/fuel mix was being compressed to 39.7 psi.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{measured}} {{boost pressure}} as lbs./sq.inch (or psi) above a nominal value of atmospheric pressure at sea level. A reading of +6 {{meant that the}} air/fuel mix was being compressed by a supercharger blower to 20.7 (rounded figure) psi before entering the engine; +25 meant that the air/fuel mix was being compressed to 39.7 psi. [...] The Americans measured pressure using <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mercury</b> (" [...] Hg). Their 'boost' gauges recorded the absolute pressures being generated by the superchargers.|$|E

2500|$|Although the 1824 act {{defined the}} yard and pound by {{reference}} to the prototype standards, it also defined the values of certain physical constants, to make provision for re-creation of the standards {{if they were to}} be damaged. For the yard, the length of a pendulum beating seconds at the latitude of Greenwich at Mean Sea Level in vacuo was defined as [...] inches. For the pound, the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water at an atmospheric pressure of 30 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> and a temperature of 62° Fahrenheit was defined as 252.458 grains, with there being 7,000 grains per pound. [...] However, following the destruction of the original prototypes in the 1834 Houses of Parliament fire, it proved impossible to recreate the standards from these definitions, and a new Weights and Measures Act (18 & 19 Victoria. Cap. 72) was passed in 1855 which permitted the recreation of the prototypes from recognized secondary standards.|$|E

I now reduced them still lower, that I might rarefy further, and for this purpose in the following experiment used a measuring interval in the electrometer of only 15° (1185.). The pressure of air within the apparatus being reduced to 1.9 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury,</b> the charge was found to be 29°; then letting in air till the pressure was 30 inches, the charge was still 29°.|$|E
50|$|While {{an initial}} warm core system, {{such as an}} {{organized}} thunderstorm complex, {{is necessary for the}} formation of a tropical cyclone, a large flux of energy is needed to lower atmospheric pressure more than a few millibars (0.10 <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury).</b> Inflow <b>of</b> warmth and moisture from the underlying ocean surface is critical for tropical cyclone strengthening. A significant amount of the inflow in the cyclone is in the lowest 1 km of the atmosphere.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{no longer}} preferred, these {{manometric}} units are still encountered in many fields. Blood pressure {{is measured in}} millimetres <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> (see torr) {{in most of the}} world, and lung pressures in centimeters of water are still common, as in settings for CPAP machines. Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> water, expressed as [...] "inches W.C." [...] Scuba divers often use a manometric rule of thumb: the pressure exerted by ten meters depth of sea water ("10 msw") is approximately equal to one atmosphere. In vacuum systems, the units torr (millimeter <b>of</b> <b>mercury),</b> micron (micrometer <b>of</b> <b>mercury),</b> and <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> (inHg) are most commonly used. Torr and micron usually indicates an absolute pressure, while inHg usually indicates a gauge pressure.|$|R
5000|$|For {{increased}} power many M20s {{also have}} a ram-air induction system, called the Mooney [...] "Power Boost". For normal operations, the intake air is filtered before it enters the induction system. When ram air is selected, partially unfiltered air will enter the induction system with a higher pressure and consequently the manifold pressure will increase about a full <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> flying at 7500 feet above mean sea level, giving a greater power output. The turbocharged variants omit this feature, as the turbocharger provides a far greater increase in manifold pressure.|$|R
6000|$|... 1589. A drop of gum {{water in}} the {{exhausted}} receiver of the air-pump was not sensibly affected in its form when electrified. When air was let in, it begun to show change of shape when the pressure was ten <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> At the pressure of fourteen or fifteen inches the change was more sensible, and as the air increased in density the effects increased, until {{they were the same}} as those in the open atmosphere. The diminished effect in the rare air I refer to the relative diminished energy of its current; that diminution depending, in the first place, on the lower electric condition of the electrified ball in the rarefied medium, and in the next, on the attenuated condition of the dielectric, the cohesive force of water in relation to rarefied air being something like that of mercury to dense air (1581.), whilst that of water in dense air may be compared to that of mercury in oil of turpentine (1597.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1554. The {{phenomena}} {{relative to}} dark discharge in other gases, though differing in certain characters {{from those in}} air, confirm the conclusions drawn above. The two rounded terminations (1544.) (fig. 133.), were placed in muriatic acid gas (1445. 1463.) at the pressure of 6.5 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury,</b> and a continuous machine current of electricity sent through the apparatus: bright sparks occurred until the interval was about or above an inch, when they were replaced by squat brushy intermitting glows upon both terminations, with a dark part between. When the current at the machine was in spark, then each spark caused a discharge across the muriatic acid gas, which, with a certain interval, was bright; with a larger interval, was straight across and flamy, like a very exhausted and sudden, but not a dense sharp spark; and with a still larger interval, produced a feeble brush on the inductric positive end, and a glow on the inducteous negative end, the dark part being between (1544.); and at such times, the spark at the conductor, instead of being sudden and sonorous, was dull and quiet (334.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1529. Rarefaction {{of the air}} wonderfully favours {{the glow}} phenomena. A brass ball, {{two and a half}} inches in diameter, being made {{positively}} inductric in an air-pump receiver, became covered with glow over an area of two inches in diameter, when the pressure was reduced to 4.4 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> By a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with this light. Using a brass ball 1.25 inches in diameter, and making it inducteously positive by an inductric negative point, the phenomena, at high degrees of rarefaction, were exceedingly beautiful. The glow came over the positive ball, and gradually increased in brightness, until it was at last very luminous; and it also stood up like a low flame, half an inch or more in height. On touching the sides of the glass jar this lambent flame was affected, assumed a ring form, like a crown {{on the top of the}} ball, appeared flexible, and revolved with a comparatively slow motion, i.e. about four or five times in a second. This ring-shape and revolution are beautifully connected with the mechanical currents (1576.) taking place within the receiver. These glows in rarefied air are often highly exalted in beauty by a spark discharge at the conductor (1551. Note.).|$|E
5000|$|Some meteorologists {{prefer the}} hectopascal (hPa) for {{atmospheric}} air pressure, which {{is equivalent to}} the older unit millibar (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the hecto- prefix is rarely used. The <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in decibars (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth. The standard atmosphere (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth mean sea level and is defined as [...]|$|R
5000|$|Various {{units are}} used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre; similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi) is the {{traditional}} unit of pressure in the imperial and US customary systems. Pressure may also be {{expressed in terms of}} standard atmospheric pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as [...] of this. Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre <b>of</b> <b>mercury,</b> and <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> {{are used to}} express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.|$|R
25|$|As the air {{pressure}} decreases at altitudes {{above sea level}} (and increases below sea level) the uncorrected reading of the barometer will depend on its location. The reading is then adjusted to an equivalent sea-level pressure for purposes of reporting. For example, if a barometer located at sea level and under fair weather conditions is moved to an altitude of 1,000 feet (305m), about 1 <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> (~35 hPa) must be added on to the reading. The barometer readings at the two locations {{should be the same}} if there are negligible changes in time, horizontal distance, and temperature. If this were not done, there would be a false indication of an approaching storm at the higher elevation.|$|R

40|$|Several years ago, a {{training}} session {{was being held}} at an electric generating plant in the Midwest. One of the subjects covered in the session was steamline drain traps. One of the trainees checked several of the steam traps when he went back on shift following the training session. He found that 2 of those that he checked had the bypass valves open, directly bypassing steam from the steamline to the condenser. He closed the bypass valves to put the traps into operation, as {{they should have been}} since the traps were operable. The condenser vacuum went up by one <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> vacuum. The estimated savings {{as a result of this}} action were about $ 12, 000 per week in coal costs...|$|R

Simulated cases of stainless steel, aluminum alloy, and laminated Fiberglas varied in thickness from 1 / 50 to 1 / 8 inch.

25|$|Increases in {{barometric}} pressure increase a pendulum's period slightly {{due to the}} first two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per kilopascal (0.37 seconds per day per <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> or 0.015 seconds per day per torr). Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small aneroid barometer mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.|$|R

40|$|Diverse {{weights and}} diverse {{measures}} are an abomination unto the Lord. Way back in ancient history {{the world was}} a place of diverse weights and diverse measures, but gradually, as measurement science has progressed, the scientific community has settled upon a mutually agreed to universal set of measures, the so-called International System of Units (SI). Over my career I have measured gas pressure in pounds per square <b>inch,</b> millimeters <b>of</b> <b>mercury,</b> torr (ever so slightly different), atmosphere, bar (1. 325 % different), newtons per square meter, and pascals (thankfully, the same). Over time definitions became refined – density <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> corrected to a temperature 0 C; gravitational acceleration corrected to 9. 80665 m s- 2. Epicycles upon epicycles. How many countless hours were spent in converting from one unit to another? How many times did data tabulated in "old torr " have to be converted to "standard torr"? And how many years did it take to become internally "calibrated " with a sense of the magnitude of a familiar quantity in an unfamiliar unit? Fortunately, in science, those days are mostly over, although as an American I still have trouble, without doing some mental arithmetic, "knowing " whether a height of 185 cm is tall or short for a man. A further, tremendous, advantage of systematic units is the ability to calculate quantities of interest, for example the energy change on expansion of a gas as Δ(PV), without having to convert units along the way...|$|R
