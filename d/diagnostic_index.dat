During car operation, the EOBD system processes several diagnostic indexes expressing the efficiency level of engine components and functions monitored by the system. If a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>index</b> exceeds its fixed threshold, the EOBD system detects a fault. The diagnostic indexes exhibit a random variability, which has to be studied by means of statistical methodolo-gies.

For each experimental setting two runs are performed: an on road test and a standard cycle test (NEDC). The experi-mental results allowed formulating a probabilistic model, describing the evolution of the polluting emissions and the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>index</b> as function of the lambda sensor deterioration level.

Non-experimental validation and updating study of an existing <b>diagnostic</b> <b>index</b> in Dutch General Practice. We collected 210 adult patients with incident symptoms suggestive for acute infectious conjunctivitis. GPs completed a standardized questionnaire and a physical examination of the eye(s) and took a conjunctival sample for culture. Cultures were analysed masked for the GPs' findings. On bad performance of the existing index on the new patients, we developed a new index combining the dataset on which the original model had been developed (n = 176) and the new dataset (n = 210). Bootstrapped backward variable selection and shrinkage of regression coefficients was used to protect the new index against bad performance in future patients.

We {{aimed to develop}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>indices</b> for four prevalent vertiginous diseases: {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), Menière's disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM), and phobic postural vertigo (PPV). Methods Based on a detailed questionnaire handed out to consecutive patients presenting {{for the first time in}} our dizziness clinic we preselected a set of seven questions with desirable diagnostic properties when compared with the final diagnosis after medical workup. Using exact logistic regression analysis diagnostic scores, each comprising of four to six items that can simply be added up, were built for each of the four diagnoses. Results Of 193 patients 131 questionnaires were left after excluding those with missing consent or data. Applying the suggested cut-off points, sensitivity and specificity were 87. 5 and 93. 5 % for BPPV, 100 and 87. 4 % for MD, 92. 3 and 83. 7 % for VM, 73. 7 and 84. 1 % for PPV, respectively. By changing the cut-off points sensitivity and specificity can be adjusted to meet diagnostic needs. Conclusions The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>indices</b> showed promising <b>diagnostic</b> properties.

40|$|Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) can {{reflect the}} changes in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that are affected by apnea or hypopnea events among patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). To evaluate the possibility of using HRV to screen for OSAHS, we investigated the relationship between HRV and polysomnography (PSG) <b>diagnostic</b> <b>indices</b> using electrocardiography (ECG) and PSG data from 25 patients with OSAHS and 27 healthy participants. We evaluated the relationship between various PSG <b>diagnostic</b> <b>indices</b> (including the apnea hypopnea index [AHI], micro-arousal index [MI], oxygen desaturation index [ODI]) and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters using Spearman's correlation analysis. Moreover, we used multiple linear regression analyses to construct linear models for the AHI, MI, and ODI. In our analysis, the AHI was significantly associated with relative powers of very low frequency (VLF [%]) (r = 0. 641, P = 0. 001), relative powers of high frequency (HF [%]) (r = - 0. 586, P = 0. 002), ratio between low frequency and high frequency powers (LF/HF) (r = 0. 545, P = 0. 049), normalized powers of low frequency (LF [n. u. ]) (r = 0. 506, P = 0. 004), and normalized powers of high frequency (HF [n. u. ]) (r = - 0. 506, P = 0. 010) among patients with OSAHS. The MI was significantly related to standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) (r = 0. 550, P = 0. 031), VLF [%] (r = 0. 626, P = 0. 001), HF [%] (r = - 0. 632, P = 0. 001), LF/HF (r = 0. 591, P = 0. 011), LF [n. u. ] (r = 0. 553, P = 0. 004), HF [n. u. ] (r = - 0. 553, P = 0. 004), and absolute powers of very low frequency (VLF [abs]) (r = 0. 525, P = 0. 007) among patients with OSAHS. The ODI was significantly correlated with VLF [%] (r = 0. 617, P = 0. 001), HF [%] (r = - 0. 574, P = 0. 003), LF [n. u. ] (r = 0. 510, P = 0. 012), and HF [n. u. ] (r = - 0. 510, P = 0. 012) among patients with OSAHS.
