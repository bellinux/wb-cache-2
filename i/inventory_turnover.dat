40|$|The {{system of}} {{physical}} distribution that comprises transport and logistics, warehousing and wholesale, {{is an ideal}} indicator of structural change. Distribution and logistics have developed dynamically, with respect to new technologies, corporate restructuring, and a changing market environment. Whereas traditional logistics were characterized primarily by the demand of manufacturing customers for the shipment of bulk-commodities, modern production and service systems require frequent deliveries over great distances, with high <b>inventory</b> <b>turnovers</b> instead of storage. As a consequence, the locational profiles of distribution firms have changed as well, both at a large-scale level and within metropolitan regions. Based on recent findings of the European Warehousing Index, the paper points out how the European system of goods movement has changed in terms of regional distribution markets and warehousing location. Secondly, the consequences of locational dynamics within metropolitan regions are considered. The dominance {{of the truck and}} the suburbanisation of large distribution centres raise serious concern about logistics management, traffic reduction and locational policy. Referring to selected places such as the Ruhr Area, Hamburg or Berlin-Brandenburg, the paper demonstrates how critical the relationship between cities and goods distribution is becoming, with regard both to the regional economy and the urban environment. Is there a chance for regional, spatially oriented management of supply chains? In the case of the Ruhr Area, it is also questioned whether a certain 'knowledge milieu' (logistics research, applied sciences) may contribute to this goal. The particular benefits of investigating logistics real estate markets are fourfold: - They allow for a precise insight into regionally differentiated developments. - They connect the system of 'flows' with material 'space'. - They demonstrate that structural change is by no means neutral for the environment, regarding specific transport and land use implications of distribution. - They represent the emergence of new players in land use planning and policy (i. e. developers), thus shaping the system of political regulation. ...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringSupply chain {{planning}} is highly complex yet vital for a smooth operating supply chain. Supply chain coordination, integration, and execution are always burdened by {{internal and external}} uncertainties. To be successful, firms must accurately anticipate and satisfy demand by planning for and controlling inventory. This dissertation is a compilation of three journal papers. The first paper examined {{the difference between the}} two most commonly used univariate time-series for demand planning: customer orders and sales orders (shipments). Here the forecast from two univariate time-series were tested, and results were validated using data from a North American fastener and tools manufacturer. It was concluded that the difference between the customer orders time-series and the shipments time-series for steady, normally distributed, demanded products and their respective forecast is systemic rather than random. The second paper proposed and assessed a multi-criteria inventory control model for the effective management of inventory. The rapidly deployable model (RDM), which is an equal-weight model, was compared with models in the extant literature. The proposed model performed better than most of the models studied. In the third paper, ABC <b>inventory</b> classes for <b>turnover</b> performance were studied. Results showed that A-class <b>inventory</b> has higher <b>turnover</b> and the smallest inventory days on hand than both B-class and C-class categories, irrespective of the model used.

40|$|Abstract The {{thesis is}} {{addressing}} the inventory valuation method called moving average {{and how this}} inventory method handles exchange rate differences. Intentions {{of the study is}} also to highlight differences and similarities between the two methods standard cost and moving average. This study fills an existing gap in science regarding pros and cons with the moving average method which made the topic very interesting.   It also has strong practical contribution regarding possible benefits and problems of relevance to companies that have intentions of implementing moving average on their inventory. The relationships between foreign exchange rate risks and inventory leads to the formulated research question for this thesis: What are the effects of currency movements in the cost of goods sold from an inventory valued at moving average method? Based on the technical problem statement was a constructive approach and interpretive standpoint considered best suited for the study. The gathering of data was conducted by using a qualitative research strategy. Three different topics are used in the theoretical frame; inventory valuation, exchange rates and hedging. The theoretical frame describes the accounting standards behind inventory valuation and exchange rates, as well as the theories addressed. Third and final topic hedging is about how to manage exchange rate exposures using different hedging techniques. The in-depth investigation was made for four business units with inventories valued according to the moving average method. Sampling was divided into two parts one for the companies and another choosing respondents. Selection of companies was a convenient sample within the non-probability samples used and the respondents were selected using a snowball sample. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine respondents. Both the empirical- and analysis chapter follows the same three topics as the theory structure and the empirical answers are divided into companies to facilitate the comparison. A short summary of the analysis is that moving average is most suitable for inventories with; high <b>inventory</b> <b>turnovers,</b> sales from shelf and stable costs. There is a need to identify input costs to manage exchange rate differences correctly. The final part about hedging showed that different exposures need different hedging techniques. Forward contracts were the most common financial instrument used for hedging transaction exposures. Input risks also identified as an economic risk is one of the hardest to manage. This study has showed that effects from exchange rate fluctuations affect the moving average inventory value different than other inventory models. The input currencies need to be identified and separated from the sales currencies otherwise there is a potential risk to make wrong decisions...|$|R

Dobro upravljanje z obratnim kapitalom pomeni premišljeno odločanje o obsegu zalog, terjatvah do kupcev in dolgovih. V nalogi se prepletata teoretični in empirični del. V empiričnem delu smo prikazali podatke za Skupino Gorenje, ki je eden izmed vodilnih evropskih izdelovalcev aparatov za dom. Na začetku naloge smo opredelili osnovne pojme, ki so povezani z obratnim kapitalom, v naslednjem poglavju smo opisali komponente obratnega kapitala, na koncu pa opredelili še politiko obratnega kapitala. Komponente obratnega kapitala so zaloge, terjatve do kupcev, denar in obveznosti do dobaviteljev, katerim smo v nalogi namenili največ pozornosti. Prikazali smo gibanje zalog, terjatev do kupcev in obveznosti do dobaviteljev za Skupino Gorenje, in sicer smo izračunali povprečne vrednosti le-teh, dneve vezav ter koeficiente obračanja. Ker mora podjetje obratna sredstva tudi financirati, smo poskušali preko krogotoka obratnega kapitala ugotoviti, kako hitrost obračanja obratnih sredstev vpliva na financiranje obratnega kapitala. Prišli smo do ugotovitve, da se s hitrejšim obračanjem obratnih sredstev znižujejo potrebe po virih financiranja. Za podjetje je dobro, da ima čim krajši cikel vezav zalog in terjatev do kupcev ter čim krajše dneve vezav obveznosti. Idealno bi bilo, če bi lahko podjetje zaloge in terjatve do kupcev financiralo z obveznostmi do dobaviteljev, vendar morajo podjetja v praksi običajno uporabljati še druge vire financiranja. V zadnjem poglavju smo se osredotočili na politiko obratnega kapitala, ki govori o višini obratnega kapitala v podjetju ter virih njihovega financiranja. Z ustrezno oblikovano politiko obratnega kapitala podjetje zniža potrebni obseg financiranja in poveča donosnost kapitala. The {{following}} master 2 ̆ 7 s dissertation {{is based}} on the working capital which companies should pay more attention to. Good working capital management means a well-informed decision-making when it comes to inventories, trade accounts receivables and debts. In the dissertation theoretical and empirical parts are intertwined with each other. The empirical part includes the data for Gorenje Group, one of the leading European manufacturers of household appliances. At the beginning of the dissertation there are definitions of basic concepts connected with the working capital, whereas the next chapter deals with the components of the working capital, finally followed by the working capital policy. Components of the working capital are inventories, trade accounts receivables, cash and trade accounts payables on which we have concentrated the most. The movements of inventories, trade accounts receivables and trade accounts payables have been shown for Gorenje Group and furthermore, the average values of these, the turnover ratio in days and the turnover ratio have been calculated. Since the company needs to finance the working capital, we have tried to determine how the rate of turning affects the working capital financing by means of the working capital conversion cycle. We {{have come to the conclusion}} that the high turnover of the working capital reduces the need for financing the resources. It is better for the company to have shorter days of <b>inventories</b> <b>turnover,</b> trade accounts receivables and trade accounts payables turnover. The perfect situation would be if the company could finance its inventories and trade accounts receivables with the trade accounts payables. However, in reality companies need to search for other resources of financing. In the last chapter we are focused on the working capital policy, which talks about the amount of the working capital in the company and resources for their financing. With appropriately formed working capital policy the company reduces the necessary range of financing and increases the return of capital...|$|R
