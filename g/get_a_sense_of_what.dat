500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade wrote a {{draft of}} a remake of the 1969 British crime comedy The Italian Job which was {{rejected}} by Paramount. Screenwriting team Donna and Wayne Powers were subsequently commissioned to write a remake. The duo viewed the original film, which neither had seen before, only once [...] "because [...] wanted to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it was about" [...] in regards to its tone. Over {{the course of two}} years and through 18 drafts, they developed a screenplay which was described by director F. Gary Gray as [...] "inspired by the original." [...] Gray, Powers and Powers, and executive producer James Dyer identified the most prominent similarities as the trio of Mini Coopers used by the thieves, as well as the titular heist involving the theft of gold bullion. Some sequences of the film were storyboarded and previsualized by Gray before production began.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, after a {{four-year}} disappearance, the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams. Beginning with Batman #251's [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character {{returns to his}} roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O'Neil said his idea was [...] "simply {{to take it back}} to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Kane and Finger were after." [...] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Lehigh University in 1895, McKenzie had the {{opportunity}} during the summer to study at the University of Pennsylvania under Simon Nelson Patten, Professor of Economics at the Wharton School of Business, and Franklin Henry Giddings, a prominent sociologist and economist from nearby Bryn Mawr College. McKenzie's work with Giddings and Patten sparked his interest in sociology and economics, McKenzie calling Patten [...] "the one greatest teacher of my experience." [...] In 1903, [...] "under the special inspiration of Dr. Patten," [...] McKenzie chose the American Indian people as {{the subject of his}} doctoral dissertation and decided to live among them [...] "long enough to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Indians problem in the concrete was." [...] McKenzie applied to the Indian Service, and soon after accepted a position as principal teacher at the Wind River Reservation Boarding School at Fort Washakie, Wyoming. Here his observations and friendships helped develop his new approach toward addressing the Indian problem.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} a number of common {{obstacles}} to acoustic wayfinding techniques: noisy outdoor environments can challenge an individual's ability to identify useful sounds, while indoors, the architecture may not provide an acoustic response which is useful for orientation and destination. [...] Among the most difficult environments to navigate for individuals who rely on acoustic wayfinding are crowded places like department stores, transit stations, and hotel lobbies, or open spaces like parking lots and parks, where distinct sound cues are lacking. [...] This means that, in practice, individuals who navigate primarily by acoustic wayfinding must also rely on a number of other senses – including touch, smell, and residual sight – to supplement auditory cues. [...] These different methods can be used in tandem. [...] For example, visually impaired individuals often use a white cane, not only to physically locate obstacles in front of them, but also to acoustically <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> those obstacles may be. [...] By tapping the cane, they also create sound waves that help them to gauge the location and size of nearby objects.|$|E
2500|$|Fayette Avery McKenzie was {{the first}} American {{sociologist}} to specialize in Indian affairs. McKenzie chose the American Indian people as {{the subject of his}} doctoral dissertation at the University of Pennsylvania, and decided to live among them [...] "long enough to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Indians problem in the concrete was." [...] In September 1903, McKenzie, then 32 years old, applied to the Indian Service and accepted a position as principal teacher at the Wind River Indian Reservation Boarding School at Fort Washakie, Wyoming. In his position as Principal Teacher on the Wind River Boarding School, shared by the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes, McKenzie oversaw instruction of approximately 170 Indian children and taught the most advanced students reading, writing, and arithmetic. As was often the case at Indian boarding schools, teachers performed several functions outside the classroom, and in addition to his teaching and supervisory responsibilities, McKenzie played the organ and piano at chapel and church services, led a band, occasionally supervised the dining hall and fed the school's chickens. By all accounts, McKenzie was well liked by both students and faculty. McKenzie's observations and experience at Wind River provided important information for his dissertation and a new approach toward addressing the Indian problem. At Wind River Reservation, McKenzie began a lifelong association Rev. Sherman Coolidge, an Arapaho Episcopalian priest and missionary. McKenzie often invited Rev. Coolidge and Dr. Charles Eastman to lecture in his classes at Ohio State University and at public events. They also shared their ideas about forming the first national association run by Indians for Indians.|$|E
