Typical materials include: cement, ore, sugar, minerals, grains, plastics, dust, fly ash, <b>flour,</b> <b>gypsum,</b> lime, coffee, cereals, pharmaceuticals, etc.|$|E

He {{had worked}} on the creche for over sixty years. The scene covers around 60 m² (length 17 m, size and height 2 m). It {{contains}} 1389 figures of humans and animals, of which 133 are moveable. The material used was wood, <b>flour,</b> sawdust, <b>gypsum</b> and fish glue. The mechanical parts were originally powered manually, now single electrical motor is used.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed to}} evaluate the efficacy of various potato seed piece treatments was planted at the Powell Butte site of Central Oregon Agricultural Research Center. Seed piece treatments included an untreated check, Maxim 5 D, Maxim 4 FS, Captan 5 D, Tops 2. 5 D, fir bark, <b>gypsum</b> <b>flour,</b> and untreated suberized seed. Because of the rapid emergence and ideal soil moisture conditions, there were no statistically significant stand differences among the treatments tested. Significantly fewer stems per hill were observed for the suberized treatment than for any other treatment. The suberized treatment produced the highest yield of No. 1 grade potatoes, the largest tuber size, and the fewest number of tubers per hill among all treatments tested. The lowest yields of No. 1 grade potatoes were observed for the Maxim treatments...|$|R
5|$|The {{primitive}} jetty {{was damaged}} {{in a storm}} of 1659, so that in 1708 leading local wool merchant Sir William Wyndham built a new harbour costing £1,000, with a stronger pier. The main export at this time was kelp, made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills mainly to Newport for onward transportation to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks, paper, <b>flour</b> and <b>gypsum.</b> In 1843 the esplanade was built by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont, and in 1855 a new harbour was commissioned to cope with increased iron ore trade. The existing harbour was damaged and several vessels wrecked by the Royal Charter Storm on 26 October 1859. A new east pier and wharf was completed in 1861−62 by James Abernethy. This allowed shipping movement to reach a peak, with over 1,100 ship movements per annum. Harbour trade was aided by {{the coming of the}} railway, with two independent railways terminating at Watchet from the mid 1860s. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway came up from the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. At the peak in the trade during the late 19th century 40,000 tons of ore were exported annually.|$|R
50|$|Watchet is a harbour town, which, {{according}} to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, was plundered by Danes led by Ohtor and Rhoald in 987 and 997. It is known {{that it was in}} frequent use by small boats in 1564 possibly for the import of salt and wine from France. During the English Civil War Royalist reinforcements for the siege of Dunster Castle was sent by sea, but the tide was on the ebb and a troop of Roundheads rode into the shallows and forced the ship to surrender, so a ship at sea was taken by a troop of horse. The primitive jetty was damaged in a storm of 1659 and a larger, stronger pier was built in the early 18th century supported by local wool merchants, although by 1797 the largest export was kelp made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills, paper, <b>flour</b> and <b>gypsum.</b> Harbour trade was aided by the coming of the railway. In the mid-1860s two independent railways terminated at Watchet. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway came up from the Bristol & Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. Both lines made extensive use of the harbour at Watchet from where iron ore was shipped across the Bristol Channel for smelting at Ebbw Vale in South Wales.|$|R

In September 2012, Princess Anne unveiled a plaque to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the lighthouse. The mines and West Somerset Mineral Railway closed in 1898. The West Somerset Railway, extended from Watchet to Minehead in 1874, survived as part of British Rail until 1971. Reopened as a heritage railway, it still operates today. In 1900 and 1903 a series of gales breached the breakwater and East Pier with the loss of several vessels each time and subsequent repairs.|$|R
