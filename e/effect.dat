5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the <b>effect</b> was present but not to a significant degree. The <b>effect</b> was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter <b>effect</b> emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter <b>effect</b> is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter <b>effect</b> was still found across all languages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} housing investments and economic growth. Through a literature review five different hypotheses are analysed to examine the <b>effects</b> of housing investments on economic growth. The studied <b>effects</b> include; direct <b>effects,</b> counter-cyclical <b>effects,</b> price <b>effects</b> and productivity <b>effects</b> through reduced mismatch between housing and labour markets, and finally <b>effects</b> on the productivity of workers. The conclusion is that the direct <b>effects</b> are only short term {{and the existence of}} counter-cyclical <b>effects</b> is doubtful. For the price <b>effects</b> and the <b>effects</b> on productivity there are less empirical evidence, but the <b>effects</b> are still considered significant.

5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or initials are used, the <b>effect</b> seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the family name is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger <b>effect</b> for first name than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special <b>effect</b> for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter <b>effect.</b>|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} a halo <b>effect</b> {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters.

5|$|In {{controlled}} {{studies in}} the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects <b>effect</b> (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals <b>effect</b> (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).The researchers did discover a small but reliable <b>effect</b> of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did likeHondamore than non-matching brands).They speculated that brand names {{are more likely to}} communicate identity to others than other everyday things.Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.The <b>effect</b> mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter <b>effect</b> and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding <b>effect.</b>|$|E

5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the <b>effect.</b> Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number <b>effect</b> and name-letter <b>effect</b> disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number <b>effect</b> was correlated to his or her name-letter <b>effect,</b> no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase the <b>effect</b> of warfarin {{by reducing the}} metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the <b>effect</b> of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin <b>effect.</b> Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant <b>effect.</b> Several mechanisms have been proposed for this <b>effect,</b> including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
