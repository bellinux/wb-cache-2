5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta {{during the course of the}} day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
5|$|Hauptmann Koch divided his force {{into four}} assault groups. Group Granite, under Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig, {{composed}} of eighty-five men in eleven gliders whose task {{would be to}} assault and capture Fort Eben Emael; Group Steel, commanded by Oberleutnant Gustav Altmann, and formed of ninety-two men and nine gliders, would capture the Veldwezelt bridge; Group Concrete, commanded by Leutnant Gerhard Schacht and composed of ninety-six men in eleven gliders, would capture the Vroenhoven bridge; and Group Iron, under Leutnant Martin Schächter, composed of ninety men in ten gliders, who would capture the Kanne bridge. The crucial element for the assault force, particularly Group Granite, was time. It was believed {{that the combination of}} a noiseless approach by the gliders used by the assault force, and the lack of a declaration of war by the German government, would give the attackers the element of surprise. However, German estimates were that this would last, at the most, for sixty minutes, after which the superior numbers of the Belgian forces defending the fort and the bridges, as well as any reinforcements sent to the area, would begin to come to bear against the relatively small number of lightly armed airborne troops. The German plan, therefore, was to eliminate within those sixty minutes as many anti-aircraft positions and individual cupolas and casemates as was possible, and at all costs to put out of action the long-range artillery pieces which covered the three bridges. The destruction of these guns was expected to be completed within ten minutes; within this time the airborne troops would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> out of their gliders, cover the distance to the guns, fix the explosive charges to the barrels of the guns and detonate them, all while under enemy fire.|$|E

25|$|But the Royalist cavalry under Rupert, {{followed}} rapidly by Charles and {{the main}} body from Evesham, strained every nerve to head off Essex at Newbury. After a sharp skirmish on Aldbourne Chase on 18 September, they succeeded. On 19 September, the whole Royal army was drawn up, facing west, with its right on Newbury, and its left on Enborne Heath.

25|$|Thence, Goring himself {{retired to}} Barnstaple. His army, under the regimental officers, defended itself in Bridgwater resolutely till 23 July, when it capitulated. The fall of Bridgwater gave Fairfax {{complete}} control of Somerset and Dorset, from Lyme Regis to the Bristol channel. Even {{in the unlikely event}} of Goring's raising a fresh army, he would now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through towards Bristol by open force, and a battle between Goring and Fairfax could only have one result. Thus, Charles had perforce to give up his intention of joining Goring, and of resuming the northern enterprise, begun in the spring. His recruiting operations in south Wales had not been as successful as he had hoped, owing to the apathy of the people, and the vigour of the local Parliamentary leaders.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} and a half years of playing Daphne, Smith decided to leave Neighbours and asked to be written out. She felt that while Daphne had been [...] "a bit of a {{challenge}} at first", she felt trapped by her persona. Smith also believed that the role no longer offered her variety and she did not want to stay to be bored, but comfortable. As Daphne was one of Neighbours most popular characters, the producers chose not to kill her off. Instead Daphne's father, Allen (Neil Fitzpatrick), re-entered her life and told her he was dying. Realising that she only had a short time to make her peace with him, Daphne took Jamie and moved away to nurse Allen.

500|$|Kakashi Hatake is {{introduced}} {{as the leader}} in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character as he tends to lose track of time, and is frequently late to his appointments as a result. However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point he fights while reading [...] series of erotic novels. Kakashi is revealed to be very famous in the Naruto world, earning him the moniker [...] for possessing the Sharingan, gaining it from {{a member of the}} Uchiha clan he was friends with. It grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others. Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the Chidori and its [...] Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not turn them into his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the rules he gave them. Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha. Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various kinds of challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi's teaching of Team 7 {{to work as a}} team, even if they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the [...] "importance of benevolence and reciprocity". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that {{he is one of the}} most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical [...] "Man of Mystery" [...] seen in other shōnen manga, but praised him as being [...] "much more interesting" [...] than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply [...] "Kakashi". Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a [...] "hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft." [...] Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets [...] "a very humanizing moment", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "He's a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool." [...] Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi's fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E
