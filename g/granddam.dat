His sire, Lucky Pulpit, and his dam, Love the Chase, each had relatively undistinguished racing careers, but their ancestors were successful on the track, and some were well known for stamina over distance. Lucky Pulpit was sired by Pulpit, who is credited with 63 stakes winners and particularly known for his son Tapit. [...] 1992 Belmont Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic winner A. P. Indy is the sire of Pulpit, and in 2015, California Chrome became the all-time leading earner from the A. P. Indy sire line. The sire line of these stallions traces to Bold Ruler, considered one of the greatest North American sires of the 20th century, and ultimately to the Darley Arabian through Eclipse. [...] A. P. Indy was by 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, and is a grandson of Secretariat on his dam's side, bringing a second cross to Bold Ruler into the pedigree. Pulpit is a grandson of Mr. Prospector on his dam's side, a line believed to cross well with Seattle Slew's breeding. Pulpit's maternal <b>granddam,</b> Narrate, carries lines to Bold Ruler and to 1964 Kentucky Derby winner Northern Dancer. Lucky Pulpit's dam, Lucky Soph, is a half-sister to the dam of Unbridled's Song and also a granddaughter of Caro, who sired 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors.

40|$|Population {{dynamics}} {{predicts that}} on average parents should invest equally in {{male and female}} offspring; similarly, the physiology of mammalian sex determination is supposedly stochastic, producing equal numbers of sons and daughters. However, a high quality parent can maximize fitness by biasing their birth sex ratio (SR) to the sex with the greatest potential to disproportionately outperform peers. All SR manipulation theories share a fundamental prediction: grandparents who bias birth SR should produce more grandoffspring via the favored sex. The celebrated examples of biased birth SRs in nature consistent with SR manipulation theories provide compelling circumstantial evidence. However, this prediction has never been directly tested in mammals, primarily because the complete three-generation pedigrees needed to test whether individual favored offspring produce more grandoffspring for the biasing grandparent are essentially impossible to obtain in nature. Three-generation pedigrees were constructed using 90 years of captive breeding records from 198 mammalian species. Male and female grandparents consistently biased their birth SR toward the sex that maximized second-generation success. The most strongly male-biased <b>granddams</b> and grandsires produced respectively 29 % and 25 % more grandoffspring than non-skewing conspecifics.

Foals of cheap stallions started breeding at a later age and had a lower parity. The proportion of racing broodmares decreased in older generations. The parity of <b>granddams</b> was lower than the parity of the 1999 foals and dam. However, records seemed to become more unreliable when going back further in time. A smaller proportion expensive sired broodmares raced, indicating a stricter selection on racing performance for cheap and medium sired broodmares.

Annual trends in genetic merit of sires, dams, maternal grandsires, and maternal <b>granddams</b> were determined from estimated transmitting estimates (ETA) contained in the pedigrees. The increase {{in the rate of}} change in genetic merit of parents was associated with the introduction of more accurate procedures for estimating transmitting ability of males and females in 1967. Annual genetic change (g) in the male and female populations was estimated as the sum of annual change in average ETA of sires plus the annual change in average ETA of dams. From 1971 to 1979, g 2 ̆ 7 s for females were 120. 5 lb milk, 3. 31 lb fat, and -. 0072 milk fat percent.

Additional genetic gain in milk yield was possible but not attained due to excessive selection pressure put on other traits such as body conformation;Bulls in artificial insemination (AI) organizations were superior to bulls in non-AI use. Approximately one-third of the females in the study were sired by non-AI bulls. The number of young bulls progeny-tested in AI steadily increased across birth years. Breeder-proven bulls that entered AI were genetically equal, on the average, to AI progeny-test bulls returned to active AI service.

When ETA 2 ̆ 7 s for milk yield of sires, dams, maternal grandsires and maternal <b>granddams</b> were used individually to predict ETA for milk yield of sons, no significant differences were observed among regression coefficients within birth years. Significant differences between regression coefficients were obtained among birth years in similar prediction equations for ETA of milk fat percent of sons. ETA 2 ̆ 7 s of sire, dam and MGS were the best combination of information for son ETA prediction equations. Addition of MGD information did not appreciably increase the accuracy of prediction.

40|$|In New Zealand only {{approximately}} 30 % of ewe-lambs are bred {{each year}} despite the advantages this practice can offer. Farmers have indicated {{a reason for}} not breeding ewe-lambs is that the offspring born to ewe-lambs are typically smaller and lighter to at least weaning. However, {{there is a lack}} of information on the post-weaning performance of ewe-lamb progeny in New Zealand. The objective of this thesis was to examine the effects of maternal age (ewe-lamb dams vs. adult ewe dams) on the performance of singleton and twin progeny and also the growth of their progeny to weaning. Progeny born to these two dam age classes were monitored to approximately 3. 5 years of age. The results of this thesis have demonstrated that the growth and therefore live weight of offspring born to ewe-lamb dams was in general lower compared with those born to adult ewe dams, especially in twins. However, results also show that there is little impact of maternal age on offspring reproductive and lactational performance. Interestingly, there was a reversal of the influence on grand-offspring birthweight, whereby lambs with ewe-lamb <b>granddams</b> were actually heavier at birth. The lighter live weight of ewe-lamb progeny without negative effects on performance may even suggest these animals are more efficient; however, longer-term studies would be required to confirm this. In conclusion, these results indicate farmers can utilise progeny born to ewe-lamb dams without a negative impact on production, and in fact there may be a positive effect on production efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A three-generation {{resource}} {{family was}} created by crossing two Berkshire grandsires with nine Yorkshire <b>granddams</b> to identify QTL affecting growth, body composition, and meat quality. A total of 512 F 2 offspring were evaluated for 11 traits related to growth and body composition and 28 traits related to meat quality. All animals were initially genotyped for 125 markers across the genome. The objectives of this advanced phase of the project were to further identify and characterize QTL after genotyping for another 33 markers in special regions of interest, and to develop and apply methods for detecting QTL with parent-of-origin effects. New marker linkage maps were derived and used in QTL analysis based on line-cross least squares regression-interval mapping. A decision tree for identifying QTL with parent-of-origin effects was developed based on tests against the Mendelian mode of expression. Empirical significance thresholds were derived at chromosomewise and genomewise levels using specialized permutation strategies to create data under the null hypothesis appropriate for each test. Significance thresholds derived by the permutation tests were validated based on simulation of a pedigree and data structure similar to the Berkshire-Yorkshire population. The addition of 33 markers resulted in the discovery of 29 new QTL at the 5 % chromosomewise level using the Mendelian model of analysis. Thirteen of the original QTL were no longer significant at the 5 % chromosomewise level. A total of 33 QTL with parent-of-origin effects were identified, including QTL with paternal expression for backfat and loin muscle area on chromosome 2, near IGF 2, and QTL with maternal expression for drip loss and reflectance on chromosome 9. Tests for imprinting against Mendelian expression identified much fewer QTL with parent-of-origin effects than tests based on significance of paternal and maternal alleles, which {{have been used in}} other studies.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} and {{critical}} need for drastic conservation measures {{to be taken}} to ensure species are not lost to us forever. Captive breeding may soon be the only option for survival of critically endangered species. However, while wildlife populations are imperiled due to anthropogenic influences such as habitat loss and climate change, survival in captivity is threatened by reproductive problems and could potentially be threatened by male biased sex ratios. Using an epidemiological and comparative method approach, we investigated the life history strategies influencing reproductive success and sex ratio manipulation of 222 species from four orders of zoo-housed mammalian using 90 years of breeding at the San Diego Zoo Global. Our results show that across four orders of mammals, dams and sires actively alter their life history strategies to optimize inclusive fitness, by altering life history traits such as age at reproduction, number of offspring, sex ratio and even longevity to win at the game of inclusive fitness and they do so in spite of human attempts at management. We found for both dams and sires, biasing sex ratio towards the more competitive sex is an adaptive reproductive strategy. Individuals who bias towards males leave more grandchildren in total and specifically via the biased sons. Dams who bias towards females have daughters who produce more offspring than dams who do not bias towards females. Lastly we found that while the leading hypotheses developed to explain sex biasing are not universally predictive of which species will bias, inherently biologically characteristics such as sexual dimorphism, maternal investment and group dominance hierarchies can predict whether or not species will have high variance in biasing in a highly provisioned captive environment. These results show that evolutionary legacies of wild species remain detectable even in the captive environment, thus evolutionary theory is not constrained to wild populations and individuals show intra- and inter- species variation in their life history strategies. ^ Specifically, in our first study we found that for both dams and sires, longer lifespans are associated with more offspring and litters (F 1, 1444 = 32. 25, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001; F 1, 440 = 22. 46, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, respectively) they have. At higher numbers of litters, per parity litter size for dams is negatively correlated with lifespan (F 1, 1444 = 9. 475, p = 0. 0021) and both dams and sires who start breeding later in life, live longer (F 1, 1444 = 597. 14, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001; F 1, 440 = 228. 02, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, respectively), but have fewer offspring in total (F 1, 1447 = 13. 14, p = 0. 0003; F 1, 476 = 15. 82, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, respectively). The older a dam is when she starts having offspring, the higher her probability of biasing towards females (F 1, 1444 = 4. 661, p = 0. 0309) and dams who bias towards females live longer (F 1, 1444 = 7. 14, p = 0. 0076). Those who start a breeding career early have more total offspring but a shorter lifespan. These results demonstrate that clear fitness trade-offs exist in life history strategies, even in an environment with abundant resources and no predation pressure. Despite this, certain individuals across mammalian species are able to capitalize on select life history strategies that enable them to win the genetic lottery by disproportionately propagating the next generation with their genes. ^ We further investigated sex ratio manipulation as a life history strategy. In theory, a parent can maximize fitness by biasing its birth sex ratio in favor of offspring which will outperform those of their peers. Although biased sex ratio is often observed and explained in species-specific terms, the overarching prediction (that offspring belonging to the favored sex produce more grandchildren for their parents), has never been tested in mammals. Therefore, we established third-generation pedigrees to show that in 198 mammalian species both dams and sires consistently bias their sex ratio toward the sex that maximizes second-generation reproductive success. <b>Granddams</b> and grandsires who bias have more grandchildren in total (F 1, 1427 = 26. 45 : p 3 ̆c 0. 0001; F 1, 499 = 6. 553 : p 3 ̆c 0. 0108, respectively). Sons of <b>granddams</b> and grandsires who bias towards males have more offspring than sons of those who do not bias (F 1, 1260 = 194. 9 : p 3 ̆c 0. 0001; F 1, 468 = 27. 53 : p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Similarly, daughters of <b>granddams</b> who bias toward females, have more offspring than daughters of females who do not bias (F 1, 1390 = 4. 891 : p = 0. 0272). These data clearly demonstrate the ultimate reason why parents control their sex ratio - parents who have cues to the future success of their first generation offspring and bias their sex ratio accordingly have a clear F 2 fitness advantage over those who cannot. Therefore, manipulating sex ratio is a widespread and highly adaptive evolutionary strategy in mammals. However, in a captive population under human control, this individually adaptive strategy may be significantly impacting the long term survival of the species as a whole as winners of the genetic lottery do so at others 2 ̆ 7 expense, and a highly successful F 1 male over contributes to the next generation at the species-level cost of the loss of genetic variation from the males that fail to breed. Thus the general tendency of captive species to bias their sex ratio demonstrated here (especially in F 1 males), combined with the fact that many captive species have male biased sex ratios has the potential to accelerate the loss of genetic diversity from endangered captive-bred species. ^ Lastly we used the comparative method to test if the many hypotheses and post hoc explanations which attempt to explain when and why females might manipulate the sex ratio of their offspring were universal predictors of who would bias across 176 zoo-housed mammalian species, but our results indicate they are not. These hypotheses appear to be species or situational specific. However, we did find that three inherently biological characteristics of mammalian species can predict whether or not dams across species will have variation in their ability to bias their sex ratio. The negative correlation of both sexual dimorphism and maternal investment after weaning with dam variance in sex bias (r = - 0. 30, F 1, 162 = 16. 33, p 3 ̆c 0. 001; (r = - 0. 24, F 1, 147 = 9. 197, p = 0. 003, respectively) is likely because of provisioning. The positive correlation of dominance in the group and dam variance in sex bias (r = + 0. 24, F 1, 146 = 9. 037, p = 0. 003) is likely related to a greater benefit of sons for some individuals. These important characteristics of a species natural history all overlap as key components of the leading hypotheses in sex allocation theory. Thus, while the leading hypotheses {{may not be able to}} universally predict who will bias in a highly provisioned population of mammals, certain components of those hypotheses are key features of a species biology that will likely persist as predictors of whether or not females will vary in their ability to bias their sex ratio regardless of the environment. ...|$|R
