5000|$|Availability of {{reliable}} pumps allows lifting accumulations {{of water into}} gravity sewers from collection sumps in excavations like mines or building foundations; {{but the cost of}} pumping surface runoff discourages use of lift stations in storm drains or combined sewers. The capitalized cost of operation and maintenance of lift stations and <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> usually justifies considerable first cost for excavation or tunneling to build a gravity sewer. Sewage treatment is most efficient at centralized locations; and pumping is often required to lift sewage from lower elevations to the sewage treatment plant headworks. Structures called regulators allow overflow into gravity outfall sewers when peak flow in combined sewers exceeds pumping capacity. Sanitary sewers are preferred for cost-effective pumping of sewage when treatment is required. Gravity sewers are preferred where grades are favorable, but lift stations often move sewage to sewage treatment plants.|$|E

The {{improvement}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> availability in {{nuclear power plant}} (NPP) was studied by utilizing the stored energy in the turbogenerator system, during its run-down to supply the safety loads dur-ing the power-off period following the loss of offsite power, due to a nuclear reactor fault, which requires immediate reactor shut down and as a con-sequence turbine/generator shut down.

Local authorities classified it as a Category 5 storm, the most intense category. This afternoon the mayor of New Orleans ordered the compulsory evacuation of the city.

This is also referred to as a station blackout (SBO). Risk analyses performed for NPPs indicate that the loss of all AC power can be a significant contributor to the core damage frequency. Although NPPs are designed to cope with a LOOP event through the use of onsite power supplies, LOOP events are considered to be precursors to a SBO. An increase in the frequency or duration of LOOP events increases the risk of core damage.
