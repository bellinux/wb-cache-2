50|$|The {{technique}} {{is based on}} digital signatures and hash functions. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash {{is a sort of}} <b>digital</b> <b>fingerprint</b> of the original data: a string of bits that is practically impossible to duplicate with any other set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn digitally signed with the private key of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram).|$|E
