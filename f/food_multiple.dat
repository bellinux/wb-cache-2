The General Accounting Office (in a review of FDA procedures requested by Congress) and a working group of the Food and Agricultural and World Health organizations both said that long-term human studies {{of the effect of}} GM food are not feasible.

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the critical factors that support European food retailers’ internationalisation via {{an investigation of the}} importance of Dunning’s eclectic paradigm advantages (ownership, location and internalisation). Senior managers from seven firms that operate in the Greek <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retail sector were interviewed, and three propositions were put on test. In general, the findings indicate the critical role of the internalisation advantage during the international expansion of European <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retailers into that market. The findings also reveal that this advantage is the main superior and sustainable competitive element that European <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retailers possess when competing with local firms. The latter can be considered as an extension to the findings of previous studies that have exclusively emphasised the importance of ownership advantage factors {{in the course of the}} retail internationalisation process...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – To {{investigate}} the integration process of retailer’s information technology strategy within logistics strategy {{and to find}} out those aspects of the retailer’s distribution and operational performance that are mostly influenced via that integration. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative case study methodology is used where the managers of the major domestic and multinational firms operating in the Greek <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retail market are interviewed. The integration process of the information technology and logistics strategies of these retail firms is linked to their relevant distribution and operational functions. Secondary data for the Greek <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retail sector are also employed. Findings – The findings show that logistics and information technology strategies are developed and implemented in a parallel way by both local and multinational <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retailers in Greece. A financial ratio analysis carried out for these firms, suggests that multinational firms possess greater operational efficiency at both secondary and in-store distribution operations compared to domestic firms, something that is largely attributed to their integration of logistics and information technology operations. Multinational firms’ superior operational efficiency is also resulting in a higher profitability performance. Originality/value – The paper proposes that a successful integration process between the logistics and the information technology functions seems to confer a competitive advantage upon retailers’ distribution operations. The paper will assist retail managers and researchers responsible for the development of logistics and information technology strategies to understand that fully absorbed information technology and logistics strategies and operations will be rewarded with superior pecuniary and operational efficiency benefits...|$|E

40|$|Even when {{present at}} sub-lethal levels, toxic {{compounds}} {{have an effect}} on the dynamics of a population, expressed through altered growth and reproduction rates. We explore some of the potential effects of toxicants on populations, using a simple model that considers a generic toxicant and populations of two species, a primary producer, and a consumer living under food-limited conditions. The toxicant is assumed to affect the consumers only, and it may enter them either directly from the environment or via their food, the latter opening the possibility of biomagnification. The initial response of the consumer to introduction of a toxicant is invariably a decline in its fecundity and density. However, in the longer term, the equilibrium densities of both producer and consumer may increase or decrease, depending on parameter values and ambient toxicant levels. The surprising case of an increased equilibrium in response to the toxicant occurs if, in the absence of toxicant, the consumers held the producers at a very low level, analogous to ‘overfishing ’ in fishery studies. If the toxicant enters the consumer via <b>food,</b> <b>multiple,</b> non-trivial equilibria are possible. The complex, but interpretable, dynamics exhibited by these simple models will be used to guide studies with more realistic models, for whose development this study forms a prelude. 1...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the results of a {{comparative}} study of order lead times for firms operating in the UK and Greek food retail markets with the UK one being regarded at the forefront in terms of logistics efficiency. Design/methodology/approach – The main research instrument is a survey of managers employed by the major <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retailers operating in the UK and Greece. Statistical analysis is employed to illustrate the variances and differences between these retailers. Findings – The study illustrates that total lead-time is longer than the sum of the components. This implies that there are non-value-added time delays that are occurring between the components and there is still room for improvement. It is also shown that any differences in lead-time between Greek and UK grocery retailers have been effectively eliminated as the entrance of retail multinationals in Greece has forced domestic retailers to improve their logistics systems. Originality/value – There is a scarcity of papers in the logistics field that cross-examines the logistics performance of national grocery supply chains.

The paper will be beneficial to the strategic thinking of retail logistics managers and will support further empirical research work in that academic field of study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{life cycle}} of the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis {{primarily}} involves canids and small mammals (rodents, lagomorphs) as definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. Several surveys have identified marked temporal and geographical variations at different scales in the parasite’s prevalence in both types of hosts, suggesting variations in the biological and ecological factors that control transmission processes. The parasite transmission from intermediate to definitive hosts {{is determined by the}} predator–prey relationship, which theoretically depends on prey population dynamics and the complex dietary response of predators to varying densities of prey species and other food items. Parasite eggs are transmitted to intermediate hosts via carnivore faeces, whose distribution in the environment is driven by the defecating behaviour of final hosts. We reviewed field-based studies that address issues related to the trophic ecology and behaviour of definitive hosts, interactions between definitive and intermediate hosts, and E. multilocularis transmission both in wild and domestic animals in rural and urban environments. Two density-dependent mechanisms control the transmission dynamics in definitive hosts: one is based on the variations in the availability of intermediate hosts, and the other is based on the variations in the density of the definitive host and its faeces. Non-linearity and the direct and delayed responses of definitive host contamination in relation to intermediate host population variations were recorded. The dietary response of the red fox was shown to be complex when abundant alternative resources were available (anthropogenic <b>food,</b> <b>multiple</b> intermediate host prey species). Micro-local hotspots of parasite transmission to intermediate hosts in a landscape, as well as areas of higher risk for human contamination in village and urban settings, may be explained by the definitive hosts’ activity patterns and defecation behaviour...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} three <b>food</b> <b>multiple</b> retailers, Sainsbury plc, Tesco plc, and Safeway plc. The {{research is}} designed to explore the relationship between technology and strategy in these organisations. The currently held view among the researchers and managers of these organisations is that technology has a limited impact on the processes that formulate strategy, and as such may be regarded as having an enabling role. This thesis proposes that while this view may have been correct in the past it is so no longer, and that technology is not following strategy but leading strategy in the food retailers examined. In order to confirm this thesis the history, technical development and technical structure of the three retailers was investigated. The results {{of this research was}} subsequently analysed and the following conclusions were made: a. Technology has a much greater impact on the strategy of multiple food retailers than has been previously thought. Technology defines the boundaries of operational activities, and, through controlling a substantial proportion of the information that managers use in the strategy making process, technology de facto if not de jure greatly influences the retailers strategies, and in some cases may actually lead them. b. The food multiples, in not appreciating the extent to which their fate is tied up with the information technology they are using, are failing to educate and train the general management of the organisations technologically. c. Technological progress is widening the gap between the general management and technical management, and in the long run this will cause serious strategic problems unless this gap is closed through positive action...|$|E

40|$|When grain {{production}} {{falls short}} of consumption expectations in self-provisioning households, a range of responses is possible. How each household selects from and manages these responses provides the theoretical and empirical focus of this thesis. Several problematic issues in the 'coping strategies' literature are addressed, including questions of response sequencing and 'discrete stages', the timing of asset sales for food, {{and the relationship between}} consumption protecting and consumption modifying strategies. Among other theoretical advances, criteria for response sequencing are identified which explain decisions about which assets to sell for food, and when, in terms of each asset's expected return rather than its immediate 'entitlement' value. This thesis is grounded in fieldwork conducted in the West African semi-arid tropics, a region characterised by seasonally, agricultural risk and market imperfections. Drought and armyworms undermined crop production in the fieldwork village in 1987 / 8. The community is highly stratified economically, and striking cross-sectional contrasts in household behaviour and nutritional outcomes were observed. Food secure households practice demographic, agronomic and economic diversification, which provide access to sources of food and income that are not correlated to local economic fluctuations. Consumption insecure households have narrower options and respond to production deficits by wealth depletion (asset monetisation, debt acquisition) and severe food rationing. Responses to production deficits are not confined to strategies for acquiring <b>food.</b> <b>Multiple</b> objectives - economic, nutritional and social - are retained. Nutritional adjustments are motivated by intertemporal economic priorities. The poorest households protected their assets and rationed consumption most severely: the cost of consuming resources rises as the number and value of assets owned falls. Within households, nutritional surveillance revealed that adults rationed their food consumption earlier and more severely than their children. Adult anthropometric status may therefore be a more robust predictor of food insecurity and economic stress than child anthropometry. </p...|$|E

Background: This paper explores the nature of food and plants and their meanings in a British Bengali urban context. It focuses on the nature of plants and food in terms of their role in home making, transnational connections, generational and concepts of health. Methods: An ethnographic approach to the research was taken, specific methods included participant observation, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. Thirty women of Bengali origin were mostly composed of "mother" and "daughter" pairs. The mothers were over 45 years old and had migrated from Bangladesh as adults and their grown-up daughters grew up in the UK. Results: Food and plants play an important role in the construction of home "here" (London) while continuing to connect people to home "there" (Sylhet). This role, however, changes and is re-defined across generations. Looking at perceptions of "healthy" and "unhealthy" food, particularly in the context of Bengali <b>food,</b> <b>multiple</b> views of what constitutes "healthy" food exist. However, there appeared to be little two-way dialogue about this concept between the research participants and health professionals. This seems to be based on "cultural" and power differences that need to be addressed for a meaningful dialogue to occur. Conclusion: In summary, this paper argues that while food is critical to the familial spaces of home (both locally and globally), it is defined by a complex interplay of actors and wider meanings as illustrated by concepts of health and what constitutes Bengali food. Therefore, we call for greater dialogue between health professionals and those they interact with, to allow for an enhanced appreciation of the dynamic nature of food and plants and the diverse perceptions of the role that they play in promoting health...|$|E

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the feeding ecology of {{zooplankton}} are described for hypertrophic Hartbeespoort Dam, where the phytoplankton {{is dominated by the}} cyanophyte Microcystis. The study considers zooplankton succession, community grazing rates, and speciesspecific filtration rates on Microaystis colonies and natural bacterioplankton. Seasonal abundance of the main herbivorous zooplankton between 1981 and 1986 is described both in respect of biomass and specific densities. In situ community grazing rates were measured from January 1983 to March 1985 using 14 C-Iabelled Chlorella. Zooplankton succession and community grazing rates are examined in relation to food quantity and quality. Experiments measuring species-specific filtration rates on labelled Chlorella and Microcystis colony fractions revealed low filtration rates for small-bodied cladoceran species on cyanophyte colonies. Daphnia fed significantly on Microcystis colonies up to 60 - 100). μm but Daphnia filtration rates on Chlorella were suppressed by ~ 707. during the mid-summer increase in Microcystis abundance. Filtration rates of small cladoceran species were not suppressed by MicpocystisJ which was not an important food resource. Cladoceran filtration rate:body length models were developed for Chlorella and Microcystis colony fractions as <b>food.</b> <b>Multiple</b> regression models explained variance in filtration rates on these foods as a function of body length, food type and size, grazer species and temperature (in order of significance). Inclusion of food quality factors such as cyanophyte colony size seems justified in models of plankton feeding in eutrophic or hypertrophic lakes. Methods for in situ measurement of zooplankton filtration rates on 'H-thymidine-Iabelled natural bacteria were improved for use under hypertrophic conditions, and associated isotope-adsorption errors were measured. Community, species-specific and length-specific filtration rates on bacterioplankton were measured (late-spring to late-summer 1986 - 87). Ceriodaphnia exhibited no preference for bacteria or Chlorella. Other cladocerans preferred the algal food. Algal/bacterial selectivity coefficients of the zooplankton community revealed an increased algal preference following the mid-summer shift to phytoplankton dominance by largely inedible Microcystis. This implies that bacterioplankton is not an important food resource for the summer cladoceran community. Estimates of the contribution of bacterial carbon to the daily zooplankton carbon requirements are low. The implications of all results are discussed in relation to seasonal succession, the clear-water phase', and biomanipulation in this hypertrophic reservoir...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examined two ethnic foods, Malang meatballs and Kediri tofu {{as representative}} of ethnic foods in East Java, Indonesia. The study examined how consumers behave {{in relation to their}} own ethnic food and how food processors respond towards these foods. Consumer behaviour was viewed as the purchasing decision process: purchasing intention, purchasing action and the satisfaction towards these foods. Food processor response was explained by the processing and marketing strategies towards ethnic foods. Multistage area sampling was used to randomly select 400 households from either Malang or Kediri areas (200 urban and 200 rural) as consumer respondents. One hundred meatball processors and 86 tofu processors respondents were selected from urban areas using cluster sampling. Respondents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire by the researcher and enumerators. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse consumer behaviour towards ethnic <b>food.</b> <b>Multiple</b> and logistic regression procedures were applied to analyse the response of the home meatball industries (the HMIs) or the home tofu industries (the HTIs) towards ethnic food. The results from this study can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} consumers' preferences towards Malang meatballs (an animal protein based food) or Kediri tofu (a plant protein based food). Firstly, consumers preferred Malang meatballs compared to street foods (i. e. 'soto', 'tahu campur’, and fried noodle), and Kediri tofu than other types of tofu (i. e. fried tofu and regular tofu). Consumers who preferred unique taste and lived in urban areas would choose Kediri tofu, whereas younger consumers who concerned freshness and a 'halal food' may select Malang meatballs. Unlike Kediri tofu, the availability of Malang meatballs can increase consumers' purchasing action towards this product. However, surrounding cold air temperature influenced consumers in selecting these foods. Similar to Malang meatballs, an increase in repeat purchase towards Kediri tofu might be used {{as representative of}} consumers satisfaction towards this food. Secondly, urban and rural consumers' preference towards Malang meatballs and Kediri tofu is characterised by the type of ethnic food. Unlike Malang meatballs, rural consumers' choice towards Kediri tofu was associated with an actual purchase, however this appeared no relationship with their satisfaction towards Kediri tofu. This was related to rural consumers' choice for Kediri tofu being based more on product appearance, aroma, originality, place (i. e. a clean and a convenient place), and the offering good service. Rural consumers who perceived the importance of knowledge (i. e. food quality, nutrition, and 'halal food'), other people's influence, and surrounding air temperature may select Malang mealballs as snack due lo self-service offered by sellers. Married urban consumers tended to select Kediri tofu, whereas single consumers who had more female household members would improve the choice for Malang meatballs. Urban and rural consumers who had a high education level (≥ secondary school) might choice Kediri tofu because they preferred unique taste of this product, whereas female consumers selected Malang meatballs more. In contrast to Kediri tofu, the availability of Malang meatballs would increase consumers in purchasing this product. Consumers would repurchase towards either Malang meatballs or Kediri tofu if they were satisfied with these foods. The study offers an explanation of processing and marketing strategies used by the HMIs and the HTIs when responding towards consumers. Firstly, processing strategics focused on machine techniques (meat cutting combined with mixing meat and other ingredients) for the 'medium to large' (the 'MTL') group of the HMIs (using ≥ 5 Kg of meat per day); and on a manual techniques strategy (using a combination local and imported soybean types with manual techniques in processing Kediri tofu) for the 'MTL' group of the HTIs (using ≥ 50 Kg of soybeans per day). Secondly, the mixed marketing strategies are used by the HMIs: unique taste combined with promotional tools (general); a mixing between a clean and convenient place with good service and the time daily in selling meatballs (both groups); unique taste combining with a low price (the 'SM') group (using < 5 Kg of meat per day); and a low price strategy (the 'MTL' group) to meet consumers' needs (i. e. a 'halal food', unique taste, a low price, and a convenient purchasing place). The HTIs offered a combination of marketing strategics such as promotional tools with a convenient selling place; the time daily for selling Kediri tofu mixed with the offering of a low price and promotional tools combined with a convenient selling place strategies (the'MTL' group); offering fresh product and a low price combined with word of mouth, and applying a convenient selling place (the 'SM' group) (using < 50 Kg of soybeans per day) to fulfil consumers' demand towards low price, originality of Kediri tofu and a convenient purchasing place...|$|E
