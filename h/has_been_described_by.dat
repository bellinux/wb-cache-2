5|$|A. f. styani <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Thomas in 1902 {{based on}} one skull from a {{specimen}} collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E
5|$|Although not a {{commercial}} success, it included several short stories by authors such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick. The publication <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> critics {{as a successor}} to the tradition of Unknown, a fantasy magazine that ceased publication in 1943. It was noted for printing fantasy with a rational basis such as werewolf stories that included scientific explanations. A selection of stories from Beyond was published in paperback form in 1963, also under the title Beyond.|$|E

5|$|Keeler {{found it}} {{difficult}} to escape the negative image attached to her by press, law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair. In various, sometimes contradictory accounts, she has challenged Denning's conclusions relating to security issues.

5|$|More than 150 {{years after}} its creation, the {{original}} main line <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> an historian {{as one of the}} masterpieces of railway design. Working westwards from Paddington, the line crosses the valley of the River Brent on Wharncliffe Viaduct and the River Thames on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, which at the time of construction was the largest span achieved by a brick arch bridge. The line then continues through Sonning Cutting before reaching Reading after which it crosses the Thames twice more, on Gatehampton and Moulsford bridges. Between Chippenham and Bath is Box Tunnel, the longest railway tunnel driven by that time. Several years later, the railway opened the even longer Severn Tunnel to carry a new line between England and Wales beneath the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|Norreis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> modern historians {{as being}} unsuited for the {{religious}} positions {{to which he}} was appointed and by one of being completely unsuitable to hold any kind of spiritual role. Nevertheless, even his most severe contemporary critic, Thomas of Marlborough, one of his own monks at Evesham, conceded that Norreis was energetic, entertaining, and enterprising; during his time as abbot of Evesham Abbey he managed to complete the crossing tower of the monastic church. Roger Norreis died between 1223 and 1225.|$|E
5|$|The event <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> historians as a {{decapitation}} strike, {{which was}} intended to deprive the Armenian population of leadership and a chance for resistance. To commemorate {{the victims of the}} Armenian Genocide, 24 April is observed as Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day. First observed in 1919 on the four-year anniversary of the events in Constantinople, the date is generally considered the date on which the genocide began. The Armenian Genocide has since been commemorated annually on the same day, which has become a national holiday in Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and is observed by the Armenian diaspora around the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{real-time}} battle {{system used}} in Secret of Mana <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> its creators {{as an extension}} of the battle system used in the first three flagship Final Fantasy titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from Final Fantasy III. According to Tanaka, the game's battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for Final Fantasy IV. Similarly, unused features in Secret of Mana were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team, which like Final Fantasy IV was in production at the time.|$|E
5|$|When {{projects}} are agreed upon with an island community, local rituals often {{coincide with the}} start of the project, particularly in the Pacific Islands, where a common custom involves drinking kava, a mildly narcotic drink made from the ground-up root of a pepper plant. The ritual is hundreds of years old, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> the Seacology staff as being relaxing, especially because of the friendly environment. Seacology staff often dress in local attire. The villagers perform dances, and the staff are invited to join in, often to the amusement of the villagers.|$|E
5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} square-shaped. This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers {{at each of the}} four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E

5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the shackles worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The painting was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
5|$|Testament to {{the forces}} of globalisation, and growing {{investment}} and influence in the UK by Asians, many of the hotels and establishments on Park Lane are today owned {{by some of the}} wealthiest Middle Eastern and Asian businessmen, sheikhs and sultans. The Dorchester was purchased by the Sultan of Brunei in 1985, and since 1996 {{has been part of the}} Dorchester Collection, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance of Brunei. The Dorchester Collection connects The Dorchester on Park Lane to other luxury hotels internationally, including The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air of Los Angeles, and the HÃ´tel Meurice of Paris. In 1978, a new branch of the Allied Arab Bank opened at 131â2 Park Lane, facilitating the interests of both Arab world and western clients. Mamasino restaurant at 102 Park Lane serves African cuisine and is African-owned. Wolfgang Puck's restaurant at No.45 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> GQ Magazine as serving one of the best breakfasts in London, with a mixture of American, European and Asian food.|$|E
5|$|The menu at PÃ©trus {{is split}} into several fixed price menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite {{the influences of}} head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates {{in addition to the}} items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niÃ§oise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster veloutÃ© sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrÃ©e which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner. Sauces are generally delivered to the table in small jugs and are poured tableside.|$|E

5|$|Tumiki Fighters is a side-scrolling shooter {{in which}} the protagonist is a toy {{aeroplane}} flying through a cartoon setting. The game employs a device inspired by Katamari Damacy, allowing the player to attach debris from destroyed enemies to the aircraft, which in turn act as armour and power-ups. Praised for its addictive gameplay, Tumiki Fighters formed the base of , a game published by Majesco Entertainment in 2008 for the Wii. Developer Budcat Creations remade ABA Games' creation for the console and further added an editor function allowing extensive user-created content. Critics acclaimed Blast Works for its innovative and entertaining gameplay and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> critics variously as an upgraded version or remakeâ or simply a port or re-releaseâ of Tumiki Fighters. Blast Works featured Tumiki Fighters, as well as three other ABA Games titles, as bonus content. UGO felt that these games' minimalist graphics, while not outstanding, did retain some charm. According to Cho, he did not receive money for the port, allowing his game {{to be used for}} free.|$|E
5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and {{leathery}} peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E
