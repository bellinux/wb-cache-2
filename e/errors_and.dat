50|$|Although {{the use of}} {{oversampling}} can completely eliminate aperture <b>error</b> <b>and</b> aliasing {{by shifting}} {{them out of the}} pass band, this technique cannot be practically used above a few GHz, and may be prohibitively expensive at much lower frequencies.

40|$|Abstract. Quadrature <b>error</b> <b>and</b> Coriolis offset are main {{errors of}} micro-gyroscopes which caused by {{manufacturing}} imperfections. They deteriorate the overall performance of micro-gyroscopes. For inside sense outside drive frame micro-gyroscope, quadrature <b>error</b> <b>and</b> Coriolis offset {{have their own}} characters. Based on the mechanical analysis of inside sense outside drive frame micro-gyroscope in imperfect condition, the dynamic equations of condition with quadrature <b>error</b> <b>and</b> Coriolis offset are investigated, and an equivalent electrical model with quadrature <b>error</b> <b>and</b> Coriolis offset is presented. It is convenient to observe the effect of quadrature <b>error</b> <b>and</b> Coriolis offset by equivalent electrical model simulating. Three conditions are simulated and compared. The {{results indicate that the}} Coriolis offset reduces the amplitude of instantaneous displacement to a very small extent. Its effect can be neglected. Quadrature error causes an error displacement with the amplitude much bigger than the prefect displacement’s amplitude. It is the overwhelming error in ISOD frame micro-gyroscope...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{navigation}} performance with the pulsar direction <b>error</b> <b>and</b> the clock <b>error,</b> X-ray pulsar navigation for interplanetary missions is proposed. We analyze the clock <b>error</b> <b>and</b> the system bias {{caused by the}} pulsar direction <b>error,</b> <b>and</b> find that the system bias is large but the bias’ variation velocity and the clock frequency error {{within a short time}} can be viewed as constants. Thus, both the bias <b>and</b> clock <b>error</b> can be modeled as the constant velocity (CV) model, and the augmented state unscented Kalman filter (ASUKF) is utilized here to deal with them and estimate the spacecraft’s positions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the navigation accuracy {{in the presence of the}} clock <b>error</b> <b>and</b> the pulsar direction error...|$|R

When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
