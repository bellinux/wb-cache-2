For hemp treated with guanidine nitrate, which has higher LOI and char yield values, the oxidative decomposition stages include a decomposition stage at lower temperatures (203 - 240 °C), leading to more carbonaceous residue and small amount of flammable products to get the good <b>flame</b> <b>retardance.</b> The SEM of the chars of hemp treated with guanidine nitrate also indicate {{the structure of the}} charring layer may increase heat insulation, and protect inner matrix materials...|$|E

The main types of flame retardants are illustrated with a number of typical commercial examples. Statistical data on flame retardant market size, flame retardant growth in plastics, and price ranges of common flame retardants are presented. Flammability Process and <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardance</b> Fundamentally, four processes are involved in polymer flammability (Fig. 1) : (1) preheating, (2) decomposition, (3) ignition, and (4) combustion and propagation. Preheating involves heating of the material by means of an external source which raises the temperature of the material at a rate dependent upon the thermal intensity of the ignition source, thermal conductivity of the material, specific heat of the material, and latent healt of fusion and vaporization of the material. When sufficiently heated, the material begins to degrade, i. e., it loses its original properties as the weakest bonds begin to break. Gaseous combustion products may be formed with the rate dependent upon such factors as intensity of external heat, temperature required for decomposition, and rate of decomposition. Flammable gases increase until a concentration is reached that allows sustained oxidation {{in the presence of the}} ignition source. The ignition characteristics of the gas and the avail...|$|E

The thermal stability of the copolymers has also been assessed by conventional thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) modified with phosphorus-containing additives have also been synthesised and the <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> assessed. All of the modified PMMA samples contain 3. 5 wt. %, allowing {{a comparison of the}} relative merits of an additive and a reactive approach to <b>flame</b> <b>retardance.</b> The chemical environment of the phosphorus in terms of <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> achieved is also considered in this paper. The incorporation of 3. 5 wt. % phosphorus in both reactive and additive approaches increases the limiting oxygen index of PMMA from 17. 8 to over 21. However, cone calorimetry shows that the phosphorus-containing copolymers are inherently more flame retardant than PMMA and the PMMA modified with phosphorus-containing additives. The methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymers have significantly reduced peak rates of heat release and leave substantial char residue during combustion, as compared to PMMA. Cone calorimetry has also shown that the phosphates are more effective flame-retardants for PMMA than are the phosphonates in both additive and reactive approaches. TGA of the polymers indicates that the copolymers are more thermally stable than PMMA whilst PMMA containing the additives are less thermally stable.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Crosslinking and {{charring}} in the condensed {{phase of}} polymers during heating, processing, and/or burning are of central importance in their <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> and smoke suppression and in formulating polymeric compos-ites. Combining with thermal analysis techniques (TGA, DSC), ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers and polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE) with/without inor-ganic phosphorus-containing additives, were selected as model systems for XPS {{studies of the}} charring process. A new parameter, Tgr, the transition tempera-ture from mesophase to graphitic structure (graphite-like structure, GLS) of the char has been well-defined and determined by combination of core levels and valence bands in XPS. The reason for Tgr to be selected as a likely supplemen-tary parameter for characterizing polymer charring in condensed phase is two-fold: 1) a clear-cut phase transition; 2) at which temperature a highly cross-linked network results. A special emphasis in the paper {{has been given to}} the roles of the oxygen atoms either introduced from an adventitious atmosphere or inherent Ac group itself. Along this line some features in both thermal degradation and <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> of polymers have been rationalized in terms of transition temperature Tgr.

40|$|Styrene (ST) and methyl {{methacrylate}} (MMA) have been copolymerized {{with a variety}} of comonomers containing covalently-bound phosphorus-containing groups, including vinyl phosphonic acid, several dialkyl vinyl phosphonates, and various vinyl and allyl phosphine oxides. The <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> of these polymers has been preliminarily assessed through thermogravimetric analysis and measurements of limiting oxygen index (LOI) and char yields. All the phosphorus-containing polymers produce char on burning (and also on heating in air or nitrogen) and have LOIs higher than those of the parent homopolymers, indicating significant <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> involving condensed-phase mechanisms. However, despite there being general correlations between LOI, char yield and phosphorus-content, some copolymers have higher than expected LOI and/or char yield, whilst others have lower, indicating that phosphorus environment is important. In order to explore mechanisms of <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> in more detail, laser pyrolysis/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and mass spectrometric thermal analysis have been applied to study the decomposition behaviour of three of the MMA copolymers: those containing pyrocatecholvinylphosphonate (MMA-PCVP), diethyl-p-vinylbenzylphosphonate (MMA-DEpVBP) and di(2 -phenylethyl) vinylphosphonate (MMA-PEVP) as comonomers. The laser pyrolysis experiments provide an insight into probable polymer behaviour behind the flame front in a polymer fire and show that copolymerization of MMA with the comonomers does not greatly change the pyrolysis mechanism compared with that of poly({{methyl methacrylate}}) (PMMA). However, the amounts of MMA monomer evolved during pyrolysis are much reduced for the copolymerized samples. Since MMA is the major fuel evolved during the combustion of PMMA and its copolymers, this effect must be a major contributing factor to the reduced flammability shown by the copolymers. MMA-DEpVBP underwent the most extensive decomposition following laser pyrolysis. In particular, significant amounts of highly flammable methane and ethene were detected. Such increased amounts would occur also if the copolymer were to be exposed to high temperature conditions when burnt. Hence, its seems reasonable that the MMA-DEpVBP has a lower LOI value than expected, despite it giving a relatively high yield of char. Mass spectrometric thermal analysis studies of the MMA-PEVP provide evidence that the PEVP unit decomposes around 200 °C, eliminating styrene, with evolution of MMA reaching a maximum some 50 °C higher. Possible mechanisms for these processes are suggeste...|$|E

40|$|As a {{promising}} material to replace corrosive steel reinforcements in concrete, glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) have received enough interest {{as well as}} debates relating to their long term performance under moisture penetrating/alkali attack environment and their susceptibility to higher temperatures. The study presented in this thesis utilized vinyl ester/clay nanocomposites to alleviate the above concerns by combining unique barrier properties and thermostability of matrix nanocomposites with excellent mechanical performance of GFRPs. To verify the validity of hybridizing these two materials, GFRP composites with/without nanoclay in the matrix were fabricated and subjected to alkaline solutions for different exposure times of ageing. The effects of clay layered structure on the residual mechanical and thermomechanical properties and the barrier resistance to moisture and alkali ion were specifically studied. In addition to bundled GFRP composites, the residual strength and morphological change on the fiber surface was further investigated by ageing single glass fibers with neat polymer/nanocomposites coatings in an alkaline environment. Moreover, thermal decomposition and <b>flame</b> <b>retardance</b> of GFRP-clay nanocomposites was studied {{with the aid of}} thermogravimetric and cone calorimeter analysis. Results indicated significantly enhanced resistance to moisture/alkali after clay incorporation in the GFRP matrices. With MMT-vinylester nanocomposites as a coating, both improved residual properties and deflated eroding rate of single glass fiber were obtained.
