The difficulty was to reach it, for the treacherous ground of the fens afforded no firm footing for an army; there was not water enough for boats, no station for archers, no space for a charge of the ponderous knights, amongst the reedy pools. William decided on constructing a causeway, and employed workmen to cut trenches to drain off the water, and raise the bank of stones and turf, under the superintendence of Ivo Taillebois. However, Hereward was on the alert, harassing them perpetually, breaking on them sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, in such strange, unexpected ways, that at last the viscount {{came to the conclusion}} that he must have magic arts to aid him, and persuaded the king to let him send for a witch to work against him by counter spells.

40|$|Thermal cutting methods, are {{commonly}} used {{in the manufacture of}} metal parts. Thermal cutting processes separate materials by using heat. The process can be done with or without a stream of cutting oxygen. Common processes are Oxygen, plasma and laser cutting. It depends on the application and material which cutting method is used. Numerically-controlled thermal cutting is a cost-effective way of prefabricating components. One design aim is to minimize the number of work steps in order to increase competitiveness. This has resulted in the holes and openings in plate parts manufactured today being made using thermal cutting methods. This is a problem from the fatigue life perspective because there is local detail in the as-welded state that causes a rise in stress in a local area of the plate. In a case where the static utilization of a net section is full used, the calculated linear local stresses and stress ranges are often over 2 times the material yield strength. The shakedown criteria are exceeded. Fatigue life assessment of flame-cut details is commonly based on the nominal stress method. For welded details, design standards and instructions provide more accurate and flexible methods, e. g. a hot-spot method, but these methods are not universally applied to <b>flame</b> <b>cut</b> edges. Some of the fatigue tests of <b>flame</b> <b>cut</b> edges in the laboratory indicated that fatigue life estimations based on the standard nominal stress method can give quite a conservative fatigue life estimate in cases where a high notch factor was present. This is an undesirable phenomenon and it limits the potential for minimizing structure size and total costs. A new calculation method is introduced to improve the accuracy of the theoretical fatigue life prediction method of a <b>flame</b> <b>cut</b> edge with a high stress concentration factor. Simple equations were derived by using laboratory fatigue test results, which are published in this work. The proposed method is called the modified FAT method (FATmod).

In this present work, a report of the role of carbon on the kinetics of the process is made; effects of the activities of oxyfuel gases on the flame cutting process is also elucidated. This was done by investigation of the effects of carbon content and the cutting pressures on the cutting rates of steels by the oxyacetylene cutting process.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{probabilistic}} and defect tolerant fatigue assessment of wind turbine castings. To this end, {{two types of}} EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT ductile cast iron were investigated in this research, clean baseline material {{in the shape of}} casting blocks with different thicknesses and also defective material from a rejected wind turbine hub. To establish the required P–S–N diagrams for safe-life design of wind turbine castings, fatigue specimens with different dimensions machined from baseline casting blocks with different thicknesses. Constant amplitude axial fatigue tests were performed on these specimens at room temperature at R = 0 and R = − 1. Geometrical size effect, wall-thickness effect (technological size effect) and mean stress effect on fatigue strength of baseline EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT material were evaluated and analyzed. Statistical analysis of fatigue data was done by means of the Weibull distribution, and P–S–N diagrams were established. The established  P–S–N  diagrams showed that the Weibull distribution is well fit to the scatter of the experimentally obtained fatigue life data. Weibull’s weakest-link method was used to evaluate the size effect. It made a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength for specimens with different dimensions. To study damage tolerant design of wind turbine castings, a rejected wind turbine hub was <b>flame</b> <b>cut</b> to several blanks and several defective fatigue specimens were machined from these blanks. Constant amplitude axial fatigue tests were performed on these specimens at room temperature at R = 0 and R = − 1. Fatigue strength of baseline EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT was compared with that of defective material from the rejected wind turbine hub. The effect of graphite nodules and defects type, shape, size and position on fatigue strength of defective material was evaluated. The hypothesis that the endurance observed in an S−N test can be predicted based on the analysis of crack growth from casting defects through defect-free ‘base’ material was tested for the analyzed defective material in this research. It was shown that fatigue life of the analyzed defective cast component is controlled by fatigue crack growth and the slope of S − N curve for baseline EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT is different than the slope of S − N curve for defective EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT. To perform random defect analysis of wind turbine castings, establish the scatter of fatigue life and obtain the probability of failure of these components, 3 D X-ray computed tomography was use to detect defects in defective specimens and find the defect size distribution and density of defects (number of defects per unit volume). The obtained defect size distribution and density for the defective material was used in random defect analysis to establish the scatter of fatigue life for defective specimens. Finally both safe-life and damage-tolerant design philosophies were used to evaluate the fatigue life of an EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT ductile cast iron block, representative of heavy-section wind turbine castings. The estimated S−N curves for the analyzed component based on these two methods were compared.

40|$|The National Fire Code of Canada (NFCC) is {{one model}} code which regulates hot work in Canada. The code {{specifies}} that hot work processes need only create heat {{to be considered}} hot work processes, and requires that precautions taken adhere to those in Canadian Standards Association (CSA) W 117. 2, which is intended for welding, cutting and allied processes. CSA W 117. 2 requires a 15 m spherical radius of separation in which combustibles are ideally relocated or, at minimum, be protected with fire blankets. Openings, cracks and other locations in which sparks or hot particles must also be protected within this distance. Additionally CSA W 117. 2 requires a fire watch during, and one hour following {{the completion of the}} work. The NFCC stipulates more stringent requirements on the fire watch than CSA W 117. 2, requiring a check back 4 hours after the work. The code in its current form requires the same precautions be taken when using a soldering iron or epoxy resin as when using an oxyacetylene torch to <b>flame</b> <b>cut</b> steel. The lack of hazard characterization of hot work processes, and the umbrella prescription of required fire safety precautions can result in insufficient measures to prevent fires in some scenarios, and inordinate precautionary measures in others. While not applicable law in all jurisdictions, the NFCC is relied on in various Canadian industries for regulative purposes. Nuclear power generation in Canada is one such industry facing onerous fire protection costs resulting from following these precautions for the smallest of jobs requiring heat producing tools. The literature review highlights the dearth of scientific knowledge regarding the propensity of hot work as an ignition source and how this shortcoming manifests itself in issues across the various standards governing hot work practices. The objective of this research is to assess fire hazards resulting from various processes considered hot work under the National Fire Code of Canada (NFCC). Due to the breadth of processes covered by the NFCC, a spectrum of hot work activities was investigated from processes as innocuous as the application of heated adhesive, to well known sources of ignition such as a variety of welding processes, oxyacetylene cutting and plasma cutting. To streamline the hazard assessment, processes were categorised into three groups based upon expected hazards such that testing could focus on the most prominent ignition danger presented by each. The groups were those processes exhibiting hot surface ignition hazards, processes with hot surface ignition hazards in addition to limited potential to generate hot particles, and those processes in which the generation of significant quantities of spark and hot particles is guaranteed. For the first two process categories, experimentation focused on determining a critical process temperature with which to rank processes and also compare with ignition temperatures of combustibles commonly involved in hot work fires. The critical process temperature was determined as the highest measured temperature of the workpiece or tool during the chosen process and was typically measured with the use of thermocouples and infrared thermography. Characterization of any hot particles in the second category was performed using infrared thermography, and in some cases, thermal paper. Literature sources indicated that sparks and hot particles are the largest factor in hot work fires, so specialised methodology was developed for the third category of processes to characterise the distribution of many thousands of hot work particles generated during welding, thermal cutting and other hot particle producing work. The distributions collected were used to determine the area enveloped by the ignition hazard of hot particles as well as areas encompassing the highest threat to combustibles in relative terms. Several of the processes as studied were found not to exhibit any measurable form of ignition hazard, including forms of manual sanding and filing and rotary filing of steel. Heated adhesive, cutting steel with a reciprocating saw and drilling of steel were shown to exhibit moderate degrees of hazard with temperature rise of 195 C or less, suggesting potential hazard to a limited group of combustibles. Welding and cutting processes were shown to have a relative ignition potential across a wide area. Typical welding procedures produced hot particles which travelled a maximum of approximately 3 - 4 m while thermal cutting processes ejected sparks, slag and hot particles up to 9. 8 m from the work. Incorporated properly into updated standards and codes, the results and findings of this research could drastically improve the Canadian model codes regarding the regulation of hot work by decreasing cost and difficulty for Canadian Industry without increasing the risk of loss...|$|E

A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a flame failure device, lighting when there's no power can prove to {{be a bit of a}} challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the <b>flame</b> failure device <b>cuts</b> off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply.|$|R
