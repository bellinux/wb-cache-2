500|$|With Barnes injured, Hassett {{moved up}} from the middle order to open the innings with Morris. Using the new ball, Bedser removed Morris, who chipped {{the ball in the}} air to Cranston at mid-wicket and fell for six to leave Australia at 13/1. This brought Bradman to the crease and he was mobbed by the spectators on a ground where he had scored two triple centuries in Tests in 1930 and 1934. Many spectators surged onto the playing arena to greet Bradman, and he doffed his baggy green and raised his bat to {{acknowledge}} them. Fingleton wrote [...] "on this field he [...] has won his greatest honours; nowhere else <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> so idolatrously acclaimed".|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber of New York's Daily News {{wrote that}} in [...] "Cry", Jackson [...] "goes into his healing-the-world shtick, though rarely <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> this condescending {{about his role}} as {{universal}} savior." [...] Chicago Tribune rock music critics Greg Kot believed that R. Kelly [...] "reprises the formula of his big gospel-stoked anthem" [...] ("I Believe I Can Fly") on the track. A journalist for The Wichita Eagle wrote that Jackson [...] "shines on the sincere ballads" [...] such as [...] "Cry", [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] and [...] "Speechless". Pop music critic Thor Christensen of the Dallas Morning News described the single as being the musician's [...] "latest batch of inspirational cotton candy." [...] Francisco Cangiano of University Wire noted that the overall good songs from Invincible are [...] "Heartbreaker," [...] "Cry" [...] and [...] "Speechless." [...] Pamela Davis and Gina Vininetto of St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "hubris- filled" [...] and {{said that it was}} full of Jackson's [...] "freaky messiah-savior complex." ...|$|E
500|$|The first session, held in {{the evening}} on 25 September 1968, {{produced}} four recordings that {{made it to the}} album. Only three had initially been intended for inclusion: [...] "Cyprus Avenue", [...] "Madame George", and [...] "Beside You". [...] Although not scheduled to play, Payne still attended the first session and listened as another flautist played his parts. To this day, nobody recalls the name of this flautist, nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> identified on any of the surviving documentation; he does play flute on the released takes of [...] "Beside You" [...] and [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] but is not included in the album credits. When Morrison tried to squeeze in one last tune during the end of that first session, Payne spoke up and pleaded to Merenstein to permit him to participate. Payne was then allowed to play on what became the title track of the album – [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] – the fourth song produced from this initial session. [...] For the remainder of the sessions, John Payne played on every song.|$|E
6000|$|Where <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> in his time? he repeated, when I {{asked him}} the question. Lord, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> everywhere! And what <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been?</b> Bless you, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{everything}} you could mention a'most! ...|$|R
60|$|He {{watched her}} bending head, and his eagerness {{was changed to}} gloom. With desperate vivacity he {{sustained}} the five intolerable minutes of inquiry, where <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been,</b> what <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> doing? Then once again the maiden aunt commenced her extracts from the Morning Post.|$|R

500|$|On {{the second}} day, Bradman {{continued}} to use defensive tactics {{for most of the}} day as England continued to dominate. Australia had trouble removing night-watchman Bedser, who helped take the score to 2/423. Bradman gave his leading bowler Lindwall [...] a heavy workload as the other bowlers appeared unthreatening. O'Reilly decried the use of Lindwall as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity. The hosts were eventually out for 496, their largest score of the series, after a largely self-inflicted collapse late on the second day. Bedser removed Morris for six to leave Australia at 1/13. This brought Bradman to the crease and he was mobbed by the spectators on a ground where he had previously scored two triple centuries and another century in three Tests at the venue. He had made a Test world record of 334 in 1930, scoring 309 in one day's play. Many spectators walked onto the playing arena to greet the arrival of Bradman and he doffed his baggy green and raised his bat to greet them. Fingleton opined that [...] "on this field he [...] has won his greatest honours; nowhere else <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> so idolatrously acclaimed". Bradman got off the mark from his first ball, which Compton prevented from going for four with a diving stop near the boundary. Hassett was restrained, while Bradman attacked, taking three fours from one Edrich over. Bradman was 31 and Hassett 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 2/63. Bradman did the majority of the scoring in the late afternoon, scoring 31 in a partnership of 50.|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{credited}} Richthofen with {{shooting down}} Ball, {{but there is}} some doubt as to what happened, especially as Richthofen's claim was for a Sopwith Triplane, not an S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball's death to him. It is probable that Ball was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary vertigo that has claimed other pilots. [...] Ball's squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as [...] "missing" [...] on 18 May. There was much speculation in the press; in France, the Havas news agency reported: [...] "Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May. Is he a prisoner or <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> killed? If he is dead, he died fighting for his forty-fifth victory." [...] It was only {{at the end of the}} month that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines announcing that Ball was dead, and had been buried in Annoeullin with full military honours two days after he crashed. Over the grave of the man they dubbed [...] "the English Richthofen", the Germans erected a cross bearing the inscription In Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps ("Fallen in air combat for his fatherland English pilot Captain Albert Ball").|$|E
2500|$|Honors and {{recognition}} of Cochems' accomplishments have been slow coming. [...] Cochems was twice nominated to the College Football Hall of Fame, the last time in 1965, but was not elected. [...] Neither was Robinson. [...] In 1967, former St. Louis University publicity director Philip Dynan wrote in his article, [...] "Father of the Forward Pass", that [...] "it's about time that somebody voted Edward B. Cochems into the Football Hall of Fame." [...] But it never happened. [...] Nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
60|$|Far {{up in the}} {{mountains}} he heard a lion roar. How much safer one <b>was,</b> <b>he</b> soliloquized, in the haunts of wild beasts than in the haunts of men. Never in all his jungle life <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> more relentlessly tracked down than {{in the past few months}} of his experience among civilized men.

60|$|For {{some time}} {{he stood there}} beside me, {{scratching}} his head. Evidently it was no less {{difficult for him to}} readjust his preconceived conclusions than it is for most human beings; but finally the idea percolated--which it might never <b>have</b> done <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> a man, or I might qualify that statement by saying <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> some men. Finally he spoke.|$|R
2500|$|After the war the British rewarded {{the leaders}} {{who had helped}} them, {{including}} Tej Singh. However, the Sikh commanders were seething at {{what they saw as}} his treachery. When in August 1847 Duleep Singh refused to invest Tej Singh as Raja of Sialkot, the British Resident, Henry Lawrence, imprisoned the Maharani in the Samman Tower of the Lahore Fort and, ten days later, moved her to the fortress in Sheikhupura and reduced her pension to 48,000 rupees. The bitterest blow to the Maharani was the separation from her 9-year-old son. [...] She wrote to Lawrence imploring him to return Duleep to her. [...] "He has no sister, no brother. [...] He has no uncle, senior or junior. His father he has lost. To whose care <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> entrusted?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Curtis {{started all}} ten games at left tackle for the Michigan {{football}} team that compiled a 10–0 record, outscored opponents 567–22, {{and has been}} retrospectively declared national champions. [...] At {{the end of the}} 1904 season, Curtis was selected as a first-team All-Western tackle by the Chicago Daily News, Chicago Journal, Chicago Post and Chicago News. [...] The Chicago Tribune also selected Curtis for its 1904 All-Western team and noted: [...] "Curtis of Michigan has been the star tackle of the year. Weighing 230 pounds, strong, active, he has outplayed every opponent. Seldom <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> 'boxed in' by end of tackle plays, and in getting down the field under punts he has often preceded his ends. On the offense he has developed into one of the best ground gainers on Yost's eleven, and has been most effective in disposing of his opponents when his team has had possession of the ball." ...|$|E

And even <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> it is scarcely credible that <b>he</b> should <b>have</b> fallen completely over the rail <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>been</b> taken with an attack while leaning upon it--he would rather have fallen inside, upon the deck.
