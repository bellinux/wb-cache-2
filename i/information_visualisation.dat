40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{visualisation}} of temporal relationships between objects. A popular method employed for such <b>information</b> <b>visualisations</b> {{is the time}} line consisting of a single horizontal axis along which temporal events or objects are depicted at specific points or intervals. The orientation of the temporal progression along the axis line will generally coincide with {{the orientation of the}} literary writing progression of the culture and language. For example a time line visualised in a Western culture with English as its literary base will exhibit a temporal progression orientation of early/left, later/right whereas Arabian culture with an Arabic literary base will exhibit the reverse temporal progression orientation. In both cultures and languages temporal metaphor use spatial concepts to describe temporal relationships with no discourse to transversal orientation. This is reflected by never hearing the phrase “the months to the right” but rather “the months ahead”. In science, Einstein showed via his special and general theories of relativity that time and space are interlinked. The scientific rationalisation of time and space along with the use of spatial concepts as temporal metaphor implies that the underlying perception of time is spatial. <b>Information</b> <b>visualisations</b> are the externalisations of our perceptions. Therefore temporal <b>information</b> <b>visualisations</b> should employ spatial visualisation techniques. This study evaluated spatial visualisation techniques for temporal <b>information</b> <b>visualisations</b> via a web survey. The spatial temporal <b>information</b> <b>visualisations</b> used in the survey employed no temporal cues such as time or date stamps but conferred all temporal progression via spatial cues. The findings from the analysis of the participant responses to the survey showed that spatial cues do impart temporal cues for temporal relationships...|$|R

40|$|Background The use of {{electronic}} records in healthcare is increasing. To avoid errors, {{it is essential}} that the data displays used by these systems are usable: efficient, effective and satisfying. A wide variety of display techniques are used to present clinical data, but the best methods to assess the usability of these techniques have not been determined. This systematic review will answer the question: What methods are employed to assess the usability {{of electronic}} visualisations of patient data for clinical use? The results of this systematic review will then be used to inform best assessment and design practice. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched for original studies related to the usability of electronic <b>information</b> <b>visualisations</b> of patient data for clinical use. Reference lists of eligible studies and relevant reviews will be explored to identify further eligible studies. Discussion This systematic review will identify methods used to assess the usability of electronic <b>information</b> <b>visualisations</b> of patient data for clinical use. We will summarise the similarities and differences between the methods found. Our results will inform best practice when developing new user interfaces to display electronic patient data for clinical use...|$|R

Towards this end we have used the system to design and reconstruct Minard's Visualisation of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a distributed <b>information</b> extraction and <b>visualisation</b> service, called the mapping service, for maximising information return from large-scale wireless sensor networks. Such a service would greatly simplify {{the production of}} higher-level, information-rich, representations suitable for informing other network services and the delivery of field <b>information</b> <b>visualisations.</b> The mapping service utilises a blend of inductive and deductive models to map sense data accurately using externally available knowledge. It utilises the special characteristics of the application domain to render visualisations in a map format that are a precise reflection of the concrete reality. This service is suitable for visualising an arbitrary number of sense modalities. It is capable of visualising from multiple independent types of the sense data to overcome the limitations of generating visualisations from a single type of sense modality. Furthermore, the mapping service responds dynamically {{to changes in the}} environmental conditions, which may affect the visualisation performance by continuously updating the application domain model in a distributed manner. Finally, a distributed self-adaptation function is proposed with the goal of saving more power and generating more accurate data visualisation. We conduct comprehensive experimentation to evaluate the performance of our mapping service and show that it achieves low communication overhead, produces maps of high fidelity, and further minimises the mapping predictive error dynamically through integrating the application domain model in the mapping service...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{manually}} review {{documents in}} e-discovery imposes considerable overhead {{in terms of}} cost and time, and challenges the capacity for the legal system to perform ediscovery matters effectively. Approaches to this problem to date have principally focussed on improving search as a precursor to review. We argue that as a complement to this we should also consider issues of Human-Computer Interaction {{in relation to the}} review task itself. To develop this point we draw on data from our own case-studies of e-discovery which indicate that document reviewers would benefit from support in drawing together emergent document classes. By emergent documents classes we mean groups of related irrelevant documents and groups of related relevant documents which the reviewer becomes aware of during the review task. Many traditional review systems fail to assist the reviewer in this and so adversely affect cognitive momentum and, we predict, the efficiency and effectiveness of the task. In the light of this we discuss interface design approaches which might offer better alternatives, including a series of interactive <b>information</b> <b>visualisations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Usability and {{functionality}} {{are fundamental}} when designing human-computer interfaces. The {{graphical user interfaces}} with use of metaphorical concepts –such as use of human-interface objects – are today common in most applications. A basic idea is for instance the one of direct manipulation; often manipulations of icons with a pointer. In most systems today we have a database as foundation, not at least when creating dynamic and powerful Internet sites. A problem with {{this may be the}} usability issue of creating <b>information</b> <b>visualisations</b> and easy manipulation of the data. The aim of this thesis was to find principles of how to build a system for using direct manipulation of a database. The system is a web-interface where the metaphorical thinking of mapping between reality and the computer system is essential. The principles also address the issue of reuse. The system may be placed upon any database and can improve the usability and easiness, especially for novice users. The result is nine principles and an example of how a system built upon these may look like. There are also two instances of the system; an office map system and an Internet shop...|$|R

The display spatial layout varied in order to test the influence of visual presentation structure on the contribution of these messages to facilitating visual search on crowded displays. Finally, three levels of task difficulty were defined, based mainly on the target visual complexity and the number of distractors in the scene. The findings suggest that spatial information messages improve participants' visual search performances significantly; they are more appropriate to radial structures than to matrix, random and elleptic structures; and, they are particularly useful for performing difficult visual search tasks.
