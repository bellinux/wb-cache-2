They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil.

25|$|According to Tabata, Noctis' cool mannerisms and {{reserved}} exterior stem from his lonely childhood, {{in addition to}} a fear of losing those closest to him. His words and actions stem from a fear of disappointing those around him, causing him to work to both fulfill expectations and bring people happiness as a result. When comparing the personalities of Noctis and Lunafreya, Tabata referred to Noctis as the weaker of the two, remarking that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> needs protection instead of her.

500|$|In the Revelation route, the Avatar rejects both Hoshido and Nohr, and is {{denounced as}} a traitor by both. They flee with Azura {{and one of}} their {{retainers}} through the Bottomless Canyon to the kingdom of Valla. Azura explains that the king of Valla, the dragon Anankos, has plans for humanity's destruction; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> killed and replaced Garon, and {{he is responsible for}} Takumi's descent into madness in the Conquest route. Azura also reveals her history as the daughter of the king Anankos usurped, and that a curse placed by Anankos will kill them if they reveal Valla's existence to anyone outside its borders. The two decide to kill Anankos. Fleeing Valla with Gunter, who survived his fall into the chasm, Azura reveals that they must unite the Avatar's twin families before a natural event which will seal the passage for decades. The Avatar travels through Hoshido and Nohr, gradually gaining the trust and allegiance of their hereditary and adopted families. They also learn that their sword Yato is the [...] "Seal of Flames", which when combined with the other families' Legendary Weapons will become the Fire Emblem, capable of killing Ananakos. Once the group enter Valla, the party heads to confront Anankos. During their journey, they battle the resurrected bodies of Mikoto, Azura's mother Arete, and Sumeragi, the latter of whom is revealed to be Mikoto's assassin. During their battle with Mikoto, the Avatar learns that they and Azura are maternal cousins, making the Avatar heir to Valla's throne. The group is eventually betrayed by Gunter, who was possessed by Anankos since first coming to Valla, but the Avatar succeeds in freeing Gunter from Anankos' control. When they face Anankos, they are initially helpless, but Ryoma, Takumi, Xander, and Leo feed the power of their Legendary Weapons into Yato, transforming it into the Fire Emblem. Near death after being defeated, Anankos summons and eats the impostor Garon to regain his strength, but is finally destroyed with the Fire Emblem. In the aftermath, Valla is reestablished on the surface, Azura crowns the Avatar its new ruler, and an everlasting peace is established between the three kingdoms.|$|E
500|$|Talbot is Marlowe's {{right-hand}} {{man and the}} secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the [...] "anti-Drake", with similar looks and free running skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nate and Sully. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sully in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake {{on top of a}} collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sully who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who puts several bullets into him before he can flatten Sully's skull with a rock, and plummets to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due to his mind tricks, it is difficult to tell for sure if he can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before {{the rest of the team}} arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sully by surprise on a walkway with no place to sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sully when the whole place collapses - which is either possible thanks to his free running abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will.|$|E
