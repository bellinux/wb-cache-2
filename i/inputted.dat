5|$|The British Antarctic Survey {{deployed}} a small team of four (Dr Andrew Smith, Gabriel Chevailler, Ashly Fusiarski, Ian Hey) {{during the}} 2011-12 summer field season {{to carry out}} a series of seismic and radar surveys on PIG. They also installed a series of overwintering GPS stations. During this same field season, a separate BAS team (Dr Mark Clilverd, Tom Stroud) was <b>inputted</b> to the field parties location and they installed an overwintering autonomous VLF station. This was followed by a radar traverse upstream using skidoos. This survey linked previous radar lines.|$|E
5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous radar systems. These included the H2S radar, the first airborne ground-scanning radar, and the Green Satin radar. Radar information was <b>inputted</b> into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E

25|$|Edit mode {{allows the}} {{creation}} of tracks. Players can lay track pieces that come in an assortment of sizes and shapes. Each piece has a list of obstacles available. Track pieces are valued at varying points, for example, larger pieces are worth more points. A track may have up to 255 points. Players can participate in races on them, or setup camera angles to spectate artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled racers. Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and shared with other players via Game Link Cable. The game can also generate a track-specific password that can be <b>inputted</b> on any Climax cartridge for conversion back to the custom track.|$|E
25|$|A {{much larger}} number of firestorms, in the thousands, was the initial {{assumption}} of the computer modelers who coined the term in the 1980s. These were speculated to be a possible result of any large scale employment of counter-value airbursting nuclear weapon use during an American-Soviet total war. This {{larger number of}} firestorms, which are not in themselves modeled, are presented as causing nuclear winter conditions {{as a result of}} the smoke <b>inputted</b> into various climate models, with the depths of severe cooling lasting for as long as a decade. During this period, summer drops in average temperature could be up to 20°C (36°F) in core agricultural regions of the US, Europe, and China, and as much as 35°C (63°F) in Russia. This cooling would be produced due to a 99% reduction in the natural solar radiation reaching the surface of the planet in the first few years, gradually clearing over the course of several decades.|$|E
500|$|... "The Dreamscape", the season's ninth episode, was co-written {{by staff}} writer Zack Whedon and playwright Julia Cho. It was Whedon's first {{contribution}} to the series, and Cho's second. In an interview fifteen days before the broadcast of [...] "The Dreamscape", showrunner and executive producer Jeff Pinkner stated that it and several surrounding episodes would be [...] "stand-alone in quality, {{but at the same}} time we [...] start to peel back another layer of the onion" [...] to transition the second half of the season into a [...] "new chapter." [...] Anna Torv later commented that she wished for Olivia to [...] "lighten up" [...] during the first season, [...] "but every time she did, something would happen." [...] The writers <b>inputted</b> small scenes to shine more light on her character, which included Olivia dressing up for a night out but then [...] "the phone rings. It’s Broyles, and she wipes the lipstick off, puts on a coat, and goes out. That’s it. You’re on call. She breaks my heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Different title {{sequences}} were <b>inputted</b> to help disambiguate the two universes, {{as well as}} establish other {{versions of}} their world. Blue and red represented the prime and parallel universes, respectively while [...] "Entrada" [...] featured a mixture of blue and red in its title sequence. An episode set in 1985 began with a retro title sequence, and the finale's version of the title sequence was silver-gray and black. Each opening credit sequence contained specific words that were meant to serve as [...] "signposts" [...] for both current and future episodes, such as the finale sequences' use of [...] "thought extraction" [...] and [...] "dual maternity". Like the previous season, the third season was filmed in Vancouver. Because of its heritage buildings and antique storefronts, many of the scenes set in the alternate universe were shot in New Westminster, an area outside Vancouver. Filming of the live action parts of [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] were shot along west Hastings Street. Executive producer Joe Chappelle returned to direct five episodes, while producer Brad Anderson was responsible for directing four. Other new and returning directors included Thomas Yatsko, Jeffrey Hunt, Kenneth Fink, David Straiton, Frederick E. O. Toye, Chuck Russell, and Charles Beeson; [...] they each directed one episode. In addition, Dennis Smith and Jeannot Szwarc each directed two episodes.|$|E
500|$|At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the Lone Wanderer is {{freed from}} their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who {{requests}} a private audience with them, but Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders, takes {{command of the}} Enclave's military, and orders the Lone Wanderer to be shot on sight. Despite the setback, the Wanderer meets with Eden who is revealed to be a sentient ZAX series supercomputer that {{took control of the}} Enclave after President Dick Richardson was killed off the West Coast. Seeking to repeat Richardson's plans, Eden reveals his intentions of using Project Purity to infect the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life, thus killing off most life in the wasteland including humans. The Enclave, who would be immune to the effects because of their genetic [...] "purity" [...] {{as a result of their}} isolation, would be free to take control of the area. Forced to take a sample of the new FEV, the Wanderer leaves the base, regardless of doing so peacefully or convincing Eden to self-destruct. Returning to the Citadel, where news of the Enclave's possession of the G.E.C.K. is known to the Brotherhood, the Lone Wanderer joins them in an assault on the Jefferson Memorial, which is spearheaded through the use of a giant, military robot named Liberty Prime. Reaching the control room and dealing with Colonel Autumn, where the player has the choice to either convince Autumn to leave or they can kill him, Li informs the Wanderer that the purifier is now ready for activation, but that the code must be <b>inputted</b> manually within the control room, meaning whoever goes in would be subjected to lethal amounts of radiation. To make matters worse, the purifier has been damaged and will self-destruct if not activated.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, robertchristgau.com—an online {{archive of}} Christgau's Consumer Guide reviews and other {{writings}} from his career—was {{set up as}} a co-operative project between Christgau and longtime friend Tom Hull; the two had met in 1975 shortly after Hull queried Christgau as The Village Voices regional editor for St. Louis. The website was created after the September 11, 2001 attacks when Hull was stuck in New York while visiting from his native Wichita. While Christgau spent many nights preparing past Village Voice writings for the website, by 2002 much of the older Consumer Guide columns had been <b>inputted</b> by Hull and a small coterie of fans. According to Christgau, Hull is [...] "a computer genius {{as well as an}} excellent and very knowledgeable music critic, but he’d never done much web site work. The design of the web site, especially its high searchability and small interest in graphics, are his idea of what a useful music site should be".|$|E
2500|$|For Zero Escape, Uchikoshi {{conceived}} the storytelling as being gameplay; {{he said that}} while other games might consist of the player shooting people, with a story just there to enhance it, he thinks that the narrative of visual novels should be gameplay. As an example of this, the second game has players learn information {{and not being able}} to continue past certain points until they have <b>inputted</b> a solution; this was influenced by the 1994 video game Banshee's Last Cry, and was intended to make the story get [...] "under the skin" [...] of players, and allow the player and the player character to understand the game world in tandem, and progress together. Among other influences for the series were writers Isaac Asimov and Kurt Vonnegut; Uchikoshi felt that 90% of any creative work consists of pieces from others' works, and that the remaining 10% is creativity, with the result being worthwhile hinging on how well a writer can incorporate their influences with their own ideas.|$|E
2500|$|The battle system {{most closely}} {{associated}} with Final Fantasy is the [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] (ATB) system: while utilizing a turn-based combat system, action meters are assigned to all characters that are emptied when they act in battle. Each player character being issued a command when their action meter is filled: enemies could attack at any time despite player actions being in progress, adding an element of urgency to battles. The ATB system was designed by Hiroyuki Ito. According to Kawazu, Ito was inspired while he was watching a Formula One race and seeing racers pass each other at different speeds. This gave him the idea of different speed values for the individual characters. Ito himself described the inspiration as his wish to balance pure turn-based mechanics with real-time battle mechanics, which played into a movement in Formula One where cars were shifting towards using semi-automatic gearboxes. For Final Fantasy V, Ito evolved the system further as he felt the version in Final Fantasy IV was incomplete. A mechanic introduced in Final Fantasy VII was Limit Breaks, special cinematic moves that have become {{a staple of the}} series. The ATB system was in use until Final Fantasy X, which switched to a system called the [...] "Conditional Turn-based Battle" [...] system: while reverting to a purely turn-based model, it included additional elements such as in-battle party member switching. Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV and its sequel A Realm Reborn used real-time command-based combat systems and removed random encounters, playing in a similar fashion to other contemporary MMORPGs. Final Fantasy XII used a similar real-time command-based system to Final Fantasy XI: dubbed the [...] "Active Dimension Battle" [...] system, characters fought enemies in environments without random encounters, with players acting on commands <b>inputted</b> by the player.|$|E
