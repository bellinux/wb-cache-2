2500|$|The A Historical Society {{describes}} early stores as [...] "resplendent emporiums" [...] {{painted in}} vermilion and {{equipped with a}} large gas light T sign. Interiors included crystal chandeliers, tin ceilings, and walls with gilt-edged Chinese panels. A clerk stood behind a long counter to serve customers (self-service did not become common until the 1930s), and the cashier's station was shaped like a pagoda. When A started offering premiums, the wall opposite the counter was equipped with large shelves to display the giveaways. After John Hartford became responsible for marketing in the 1900s, A began offering S Green Stamps to free space for the expanded line of groceries available in the stores. The economy stores John Hartford developed in 1912 eliminated frills. Typically , these stores were equipped with basic shelving and a small <b>ice</b> <b>box.</b> A agreed only to short leases {{so that it could}} quickly close unprofitable stores.|$|E
2500|$|However, Tavener missed some 40 games {{during the}} 1927 season, principally {{due to an}} off-the-playing-field injury that {{eventually}} cut short his major league career. [...] Tavener slashed the index finger of his throwing hand while [...] "fumbling around in the <b>ice</b> <b>box</b> of his house one evening." [...] The wound healed, but Tavener lost feeling in {{the tip of his}} finger. [...] The condition handicapped his throwing ability and reportedly [...] "provided a mental hazard that affected his general play." [...] He finished second to Harry Heilmann in the voting for the Most Valuable Player (MVP) on the Tigers, and Sam Greene wrote that the finger injury took away any shot Tavener had for being selected MVP. [...] Greene wrote that Tavener was forced out of the infield for two months, and when he returned, [...] "he was not right." [...] According to Greene, [...] "His finger was lifeless and he could not throw accurately. [...] Many a base runner reached first base because Tavener was handicapped in his gripping the ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|Refrigeration is {{the process}} of {{removing}} heat from an enclosed space, or from a substance, and moving it to a place where it is unobjectionable. The primary purpose of refrigeration is lowering the temperature of the enclosed space or substance and then maintaining that lower temperature. The American inventor Oliver Evans, acclaimed as the [...] "father of refrigeration", invented the vapor-compression refrigeration machine in 1805. Heat would be removed from the environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant, where it would move through a compressor and condenser, where it would eventually revert to a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again. However, no such refrigeration unit was built by Evans. In 1834, Jacob Perkins modified Evans' original design, building the world's first refrigerator and filing the first legal patent for refrigeration using vapor-compression. John Gorrie, an American doctor from Florida, invented the first mechanical refrigeration unit in 1841, based on Evans' original invention to make ice in order to cool the air for yellow fever patients. Gorrie's mechanical refrigeration unit was issued a patent in 1851. American professor Alexander C. Twining of Cleveland, Ohio patented an early vapor-compression refrigerator in 1853 that was fully capable of producing a ton of ice per day. In 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by Fred W. Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana with models consisting of a unit that was mounted on top of an <b>ice</b> <b>box.</b> A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor {{on the bottom of the}} cabinet was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by William C. Durant in 1918, who started the Frigidaire Company in order to begin the first mass-production of refrigerators.|$|E

500|$|In {{order for}} a {{domestic}} or commercial customer to use ice, however, it was typically necessary {{to be able to}} store it for a period away from an ice house. As a result, <b>Ice</b> <b>boxes</b> and domestic refrigerators were a critical final stage in the storage process: without them, most households could not use and consume ice. By 1816, Tudor was selling Boston refrigerators called [...] "Little Ice Houses" [...] to households in Charleston; these were made of wood, lined with iron and designed to hold three pounds (1.4kg) of ice. Household refrigerators were manufactured in the 1840s on the east coast, most notably by Darius Eddy of Massachusetts and Winship of Boston; many of these were shipped west. The degree to which natural ice was adopted by local communities in the 19th century heavily depended on the availability and up-take of <b>ice</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
