5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color {{is used by the}} author, L.

5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

25|$|In mountainous areas (or near {{rivers in}} mountainous areas), the main {{aquifers}} are typically unconsolidated alluvium, composed of mostly horizontal layers of materials deposited by water processes (rivers and streams), which in cross-section (looking at a two-dimensional {{slice of the}} aquifer) appear to be layers of alternating coarse and fine materials. Coarse materials, {{because of the high}} energy needed to move them, tend to be found nearer the source (mountain fronts or rivers), whereas the fine-grained material will make it farther from the source (to the flatter parts of the basin or overbank areas—sometimes called the pressure area). Since there are less fine-grained deposits near the source, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> aquifers are often unconfined (sometimes called the forebay area), or in hydraulic communication with the land surface.|$|E

A rebounding advantage of 45–22 and defensive field goal percentage of 30.2% helped Gonzaga rout Santa Clara 85–42 on February 20. The Zags shot 56.2% from the field and converted on 7 of 17 three-pointers. Harris led the team with 17 points and nine rebounds, while Olynyk scored 15.

500|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the book}} {{is not limited to the}} major pages. Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots. Many significant texts, such as the Pater Noster have decorated initials. The page containing text of the Beatitudes in Matthew (...) has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter B which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain. The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke (...) contains a similar miniature in which the word qui is repeatedly linked along the left margin. Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a [...] "turn-in-the-path" [...] (that <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> a line is finished in a space above or below the original line). Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines. No two of these designs are the same. No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration.|$|E
