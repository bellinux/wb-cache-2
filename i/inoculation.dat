5|$|<b>Inoculation,</b> {{treatment}} of smallpox: Joseph Needham states that {{a case of}} <b>inoculation</b> for smallpox may have existed in the late 10th century during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), yet they rely on a book Zhongdou xinfa (種痘心法) written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang for this evidence. Wan Quan (1499–1582) wrote the first clear reference to smallpox <b>inoculation</b> in his Douzhen xinfa (痘疹心法) of 1549. The process of <b>inoculation</b> was also vividly described by Yu Chang in his Yuyi cao (寓意草), or Notes on My Judgment published in 1643, and Zhang Yan in his Zhongdou xinshu (種痘新書), or New book on smallpox <b>inoculation</b> in 1741. As written by Yu Tianchi in his Shadou jijie (痧痘集解) of 1727, {{which was based on}} Wang Zhangren's Douzhen jinjing lu (痘疹金鏡錄) of 1579, the technique of <b>inoculation</b> to avoid smallpox was not widespread in China until the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567– 1572) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was <b>inoculation</b> (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that <b>inoculation</b> originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of <b>inoculation.</b> Accounts of <b>inoculation</b> against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, <b>inoculation</b> produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of <b>inoculation</b> were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require <b>inoculation</b> of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by <b>inoculation</b> with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese {{production}} are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} several reports {{on the use of}} b-amyloid (Ab) {{vaccination}} in different mouse models of Alz-heimer’s disease (AD) and its effects on pathology and cognitive function. In this report, the histopathologic findings in the APP 1 PS 1 doubly transgenic mouse were compared after three, five, or nine Ab <b>inoculations.</b> The number of <b>inoculations</b> influenced the effects of vaccination on Congo red levels, microglia activation, and anti-Ab antibody titers. After three <b>inoculations,</b> the antibody titer of transgenic mice was substantially lower than that found in nontransgenic animals. However, after nine <b>inoculations,</b> the levels were consider-ably higher in both genotypes and no longer distinguishable statistically. The number of <b>inoculations</b> influ-enced CD 45 expression, an indicator of microglial activation. There was an initial upregulation, which was significant after five <b>inoculations,</b> but by nine <b>inoculations,</b> the extent of microglial activation was equivalent to that in mice given control vaccinations. Along with this increased CD 45 expression, there was a correla-tive reduction in staining by Congo red, which stains compact plaques. When data from the mice from all groups were combined, there was a significant correlation between activation of microglia and Congo red lev-els, suggesting that microglia {{play a role in the}} clearance of compact plaque. 73...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between root-knot (Meloidogyne incognita), reniform (Rotylenchulus renijomzis) and stunt (Tylenchorhynchus brassicae) nematodes on tomato roots was studied using varying inoculum levels and their combinations. The parameters measured were rate of population increase, sex-ratio and plant growth. In single species <b>inoculations,</b> al 1 the three nematodes multiplied but at varying rates. Their rate of population increase declined and proportion of males increased at higher inoculum levels. In concomitant <b>inoculations,</b> M. incognita and R. renijomnis suppressed {{the rate of}} population increase of each other at al 1 combinations. The decrease was greater in M. incognita than in R. reniformis. Mutual suppression in rate of population increase was noticed also when R. reniformis and T. brassicae or M. incognita and T. brassicae were present together. This was, however, not true at al 1 combinations. In al 1 concomitant <b>inoculations,</b> number of males of M. incognita and R. reniformis-increased in comparison to single species <b>inoculations</b> at the same inoculum level. Sex-ratio of T. brassicae, however, remained unaltered.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of the host to bacterial and virus infections have been {{measured in terms of}} the minimal lethal dose for different sites of <b>inoculations,</b> and they have been appraised in terms of damage to tissues and in terms of tissue specificity; but the extent of dispersion of the infective agents as affecting the results has in the past been accorded little attention. In recent work from this laboratory a chemical fraction which causes dispersion of particulate matter injected with it into the skin and extracts from testicle (1) and from invasive bacteria (2), which have the same effect, served as a tool to show that the extent of dispersion of the infectious agent importantly influences the size of the lesions due to infection. It was found that intracutaneous <b>inoculations</b> into rabbits of testicle extract together with concentrated suspensions of bacteria resulted in more widespread lesions than <b>inoculations</b> of equally concentrated suspensions of bacteria in isotonic saline (3).

5|$|Gerard van Swieten, whom Maria Theresa had {{recruited}} {{following the}} death of her sister, Archduchess Maria Anna, founded the Vienna General Hospital, revamped Austria's educational system and served as the Empress's personal physician. After calling in van Swieten, Maria Theresa asked him to study the problem of infant mortality in Austria. Following his recommendation, she made a decree that autopsies would be mandatory for all hospital deaths in the city of Graz, Austria's second largest city. This law – still in effect today – combined with the relatively stable population of Graz, resulted {{in one of the most}} important and complete autopsy records in the world. Maria Theresa banned the creation of new burial grounds without prior government permission, thus countering wasteful and unhygienic burial customs. Her decision to have her children inoculated after the smallpox epidemic of 1767 was responsible for changing Austrian physicians' negative view of <b>inoculation.</b> The empress herself inaugurated <b>inoculation</b> in Austria by hosting a dinner for the first sixty-five inoculated children in Schönbrunn Palace, waiting on the children herself.|$|E
