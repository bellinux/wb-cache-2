50|$|The {{story of}} the game follows the player, or as they are known in-game, the Great Spirit of Ooga, and your quest to help the Oogians exact revenge on the Boolis, after they tricked them into {{thinking}} their chiefs were evil, leading the Boolis to burn them. You as the Spirit can possess certain Oogians to help you on your quest to revive all the chiefs, via Bone Fires. Oogians are separated into tribes, each with different abilities, with the chief of each tribe having enhanced versions of those abilities. In addition to these special abilities, all Oogians {{have the ability to}} swallow and vomit certain objects on the ground. This can be useful as when you are holding an item, you cannot climb a ladder, and cannot hold another item, but you can <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> in your hands and in your stomach simultaneously, which is useful in certain situations. Near the end of the game, all of the tribe leaders join together to summon the Ancient One at a Bone Fire, who is actually just an average human that the Oogians worship.|$|E

50|$|The player uses simple {{commands}} {{to create a}} list of instructions to perform the given task. Such commands include picking up the first item at the inbox, placing the item the avatar is currently carrying at the outbox, copying the carried item to a marked square, performing addition or subtraction of the carried item with the item at the marked square, and making decisions based {{on the value of}} the carried item such as if it is zero or negative. As such, these mimic the elements of assembly language: the simple instructions equivalent to opcodes, the ability of the avatar to <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> mirroring a processor register, and the spaces on the office floor representing main memory. Later, the player gains the ability to use the concept of memory addresses, in which they can direct instructions to operate on a specific floor space that is labeled with the number of a different floor space. The visual approach to the language also allows the player to place simple handdrawn notes as labels in both the list of instructions or to label floor spaces for clarity. The loops and jump commands are also marked with arrows to help the player identify the logic flow. Once they have created the program, they can run it through, increasing the speed for longer programs, or pause and move step by step for debugging purposes. If the outbox received any boxes it is not expected for that program, the program will immediately terminate and the player will need {{to figure out how to}} correct it. Though the player will be only be shown their list of instructions operation on one set of input and the expected output, the game will also test the list against other randomized sets of input and output, and will alert the player if any of these also fail. The player can receive a reminder of their puzzle task and an example of what type of output it should produce from a supervisor character that watches their avatar work, and the player can also gain hints on how to solve some programs.|$|E

50|$|The Fane of Shadows is {{a temple}} that {{journeys}} the worlds on the currents {{of the secret}} Weave, in the fictional setting of the Forgotten Realms campaign in Dungeons & Dragons. The place has many names in many tongues, and {{is also known as}} the Temple of Night or the Umbral Shrine. Created by Shar, it serves as many dark gods of many worlds, and as a gift of the god of shadows to their faithful—a sanctuary that journeys through time and worlds. It also serves as a bastion/armory for the servants of the twilight. It is located within the Lightless Lake (The Moonmere) in the Gulthmere Forest, but it only materializes during a certain date at midnight, and stays only temporarily in each world for a short time. Upon its arrival onto Toril, the Fane appeared within the depths of the Lightless Lake in a diffuse, ochre light. The entirety of the temple is situated on an invisible platform encapsulated within a dome of air. The architecture includes black-veined columns, graceful arches, and thick pillars all crafted from marble, basalt, obsidian, or ebony. The Fane of Shadows is guarded by a host of shadows inside the courtyard area. They are only hostile to those not subservient to shadow. The courtyard contains a statue garden of hundreds of obsidian sculptures, all of them depicting the innumerable world's gods of shadow. Statues of Toril's deities of night and shadow, Shar and Mask, are among the collection. Beyond its doors it contains a long, wide hallway, the Grand Hall, filled with shadows and bathed in a low, green light. Painting and mosaics line the walls, while tables and pedestals are hidden inside alcoves along it. These alcoves usually <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> of great power, one of the many gifts of shadow found within. Only one gift may be taken from the Fane of Shadows. A husky, female voice tries to persuade its guests in a perceived, familiar tongue into taking an item of power. The Grand Hall also contains the caretaker of the temple, who materializes from the shadows. He is an elderly man, with solid black eyes, and his duty is to serve his calling into the shadow. The hallway ends at a pair of double doors, which leads into the inner sanctum. The inner sanctum contains a skydome ceiling of black encrusted in gems, representing the night sky {{of the world in which}} it currently exists in. The inner sanctum itself has a polished slate floor inlaid with an amethyst border, and in its center lies a black sphere bordered in purple, Shar's symbol. A horsehoe-shaped altar lies in the center of the symbol on some kind of black crystalline substance, under an area of ceiling of the blackest black, depicting Shar's moon. It is underneath this symbol where a host receives the transforming energy of the greatest gifts offered by the Shadow Weave: the transformation into a shade. Black curtains line the walls of the inner sanctum, as well as a mosaic of the Weave Tap. Entrance into the Fane of Shadows requires either being adept in the Shadow Weave, or reverence to a god or goddess of shadow.|$|E
40|$|Many factors {{influence}} visual search, {{including how}} much targets stand out (i. e., their visual salience) {{and whether they}} are currently relevant (i. e., Are they in working memory?). Although these are two known influences on search performance, {{it is unclear how}} they interact to guide attention. The present study explored this interplay by having participants <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> in memory for a subsequent test while simultaneously conducting a multiple-target visual search. Importantly, the memory item could match one or neither of two targets from the search. In Experiment 1, when the memory item did not match either target, participants found a high-salience target first, demonstrating a baseline salience effect. This effect was exaggerated when a high-salience target was in working memory and completely reversed when a low-salience target was in memory, demonstrating a powerful influence of working memory guidance. Experiment 2 amplified the salience effect by including very high-salience, “pop-out”-like targets. Yet this salience effect was still attenuated when the memory item matched a less salient target. Experiment 3 confirmed these were memory-based effects and not priming. Collectively, these findings illustrate the influential role of working memory in guiding visual attention, {{even in the face of}} competing bottom-up salience cues...|$|E

40|$|Zara {{leads the}} fast-fashion {{industry}} introducing over 12, 000 unique items per year [5], selling in over 2, 000 stores and generating rch 16091 [British pound symbol] 11. 6 Bn in yearly sales [8]. Critical to this success, Zara's Distribution Department continually focuses on improving the algorithms and programs {{which the company}} uses to move clothing through the supply chain. Demand variability and short product lifecycles make this task extremely challenging, especially when coupled with limited storage space in many Zara stores. This thesis helps stores which are challenged by low storage capacity and high consumer demand by testing three inventory management methods. The first method creates a virtual cost in the inventory redistribution algorithm, which decreases the likelihood that an over-capacity store will <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> <b>item.</b> This method decreased the amount of post transfer inventory by 15 % in capacity constrained stores while only experiencing a. 1 % loss of profits {{when compared to the}} current process. The second method opens new transfer routes for capacity constrained stores to move inventory into stores which benefit from the additional items, while reducing the non-performing stock at the capacity constrained store. These store to store routes quickly transfer items while reducing the stock of the origin store. The final method improves existing capacity returns, which automatically move inventory from capacity constrained stores back to the Distribution Center. The new method optimizes the selection of items to improve redistribution to other stores, resulting in additional full priced sales, while removing the same amount of items from the origin store. The implementation of these processes will reduce stock management problems experienced at Zara stores, while ensuring that other stores have the opportunity to sell at full price. by Michael Reed Macmillan.

30|$|Van Riel et al. [67] {{reported}} {{that the use of}} wheeled walkers usually results in severe fall injuries. Based on previous research by Lindemann et al. [42], there are various limitations {{associated with the use of}} wheeled walkers which causes serious fall incidents to older adults including walking backward, downhill and uphill, <b>holding</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> when fronting obstacle(s), encountering obstacles such as stairs in public transportation, and walking on uneven surfaces. Older adults encounter difficulties to retain their balance and control to open a door which is in reverse direction of their assistive wheeled walker. This situation becomes more challenging when <b>a</b> user <b>holds</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> while passing through a door. For this reason, older adults stated that it is easier to walk through a door or to open the door without wheeled walker. Despite there have been numerous approaches and developments to overcome the mentioned limitations of wheeled walkers, the proposed solutions were not satisfactory. For instance, walking backward through a door using a walker is still a challenge for most users. This is due to the fact that front wheels of the walker provide 360 ° rotation, whereas the rotation of back wheels is restricted. Rentschler et al. [54] recommended a walker with a rotation feature and intelligent obstacle prevention to overcome those limitations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{contents}} of working memory (WM) have been repeatedly found {{to guide the}} allocation of visual attention; in a dual-task paradigm that combines WM and visual search, ac-tively <b>holding</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> in WM biases visual attention towards memory-matching items during search (e. g., Soto et al., Jour-nal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 31 (2), 248 - 261, 2005). A key debate is whether such memory-based attentional guidance is automatic or under strategic control. Generally, two distinct task paradigms have been employed to assess memory-based guidance, one demon-strating that attention is involuntarily captured by memory-matching stimuli even {{at a cost to}} search performance (Soto et al., 2005), and one demonstrating that participants can stra-tegically avoid memory-matching distractors to facilitate searc...|$|R
