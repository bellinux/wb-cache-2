500|$|Boise National Forest {{was created}} on July 1, 1908, from part of Sawtooth National Forest, and {{originally}} covered [...] By the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the U.S. Congress granted the U.S. President {{the authority to}} establish forest reserves out of Public Domain Lands that were subject to disposal (homesteads, sales, etc.) administered by the General Land Office, which had been placed {{under the authority of}} the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1849. With the passage of the Transfer Act of 1905, forest reserves were transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the newly created U.S. Forest Service. Present-day Boise National Forest was first protected as part of two forest reserves by proclamations issued by President Theodore Roosevelt: Sawtooth Forest Reserve (created on May 29, 1905, and expanded on November 6, 1906) and Payette Forest Reserve (created on June 3, 1905). After forest reserves were renamed national forests in 1908, Boise National Forest was split from Sawtooth National Forest into an independent national forest. On April 1, 1944, the entirety of what was then Payette National Forest was transferred to Boise National Forest, and simultaneously Weiser and Idaho national forests were combined to reestablish the present-day Payette National Forest, which is to the north of Boise National Forest. In 1933 the Boise Basin Experimental Forest was created on [...] of the forest near Idaho City to study the management of ponderosa pine. The Lucky Peak Nursery was established in 1959 to produce trees for planting on burned or logged lands on the national forests of the <b>Intermountain</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} where pine nuts could be grown in California and {{if they would be}} economically feasible to grow in California. There is very limited information for growing pine nuts in a domesticated orchard. Areas where {{there was a lack of}} information were completed with assumptions using costs for walnuts. Once all costs were determined, they were entered into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. It has been concluded that pine nuts could be grown in California, mainly in the far northern <b>intermountain</b> <b>regions</b> such as Modoc County. The breakeven for the enterprise would not be until the 22 nd year, making the prospect of a pine nut farm technically feasible, but not recommended unless prices become much higher, yields can be increased, expenses turn out to be lower than the numbers used for walnuts, or a combination of these things...|$|R
40|$|Snowpack {{constitutes}} {{a large percentage}} of available water resources within the rocky <b>intermountain</b> <b>regions</b> of the west. It has been well established in the literature that dense conifer vegetation can reduce total snow depth and snow-water equivalence (SWE) by at least 60 %. Forest fires at high elevation have the potential of defoliating large swaths of land, thus reducing interception and sublimation of snow on vegetation, and potentially increasing total water yields. In the Twitchell Canyon fire in the Tushar mountains near Beaver, Utah, sites were selected across a gradient of fire severity with sites placed in intact, mid-mortality, highmortality, and open meadow sites. Snow depth and SWE were taken with a U. S. Federal snow sampler at peak snow pack at each site. A significant correlation was found between fire severity and SWE in each paired site. These findings help to confirm previous studies showing an increase of snow-water resources in a high elevation post-fire environment...|$|R
40|$|Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus and Aquila chrysaetos) are {{the largest}} bird of prey in North America. Golden eagles in North America occur in {{greatest}} numbers from Alaska southward throughout the mountain and <b>intermountain</b> <b>regions</b> of the West and into Mexico. Eagles frequent {{a wide variety of}} habitats. Although regional and seasonal differences in food habits exist, golden eagle prey consists mostly of small mammals such as jackrabbits, cottontails, prairie dogs, and ground squirrels. Eagle courtship displays consist of a series of “roller coaster” dives and other aerial maneuvers. Juvenile golden eagles leave the nesting territory as early as May in the Southwest and as late as October or November in the North. Research indicates that golden eagles are maintaining static populations in areas undisturbed by humans. Golden eagles are more likely to prey on livestock than are bald eagles. Both bald and golden eagles and their nests and nest sites are protected by the federal Bald Eagle Protection Act and state regulations...|$|R

The Northern and <b>Intermountain</b> <b>Regions</b> of the USFS partnered with six State Foresters nearly a decade ago, to implement a vision of small, distributed biomass systems in forested areas, thereby creating renewable energy, reducing open pile burning, and adding value to waste wood from fire hazard reduction and forest restoration.

We have learned a tremendous amount about what works, where and why, and developed strategies to promote success.

40|$|The 2008 Wenchuan {{earthquake}} and associated co-seismic landslide {{was the most}} recent expression of the rapid deformation and erosion occurring in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The erosion associated with co-seismic landslides balances the long-term tectonic uplift in the topographic evolution of the region; however, the quantitative relationship between earthquakes, uplift, and erosion is still unknown. In order to quantitatively distinguish the seismically-induced erosion in the total erosion, here, we quantify the Wenchuan earthquake-induced erosion using the digital elevation model (DEM) differential method and previously-reported landslide volumes. Our {{results show that the}} seismically-induced erosion is comparable with the pre-earthquake short-term erosion. The seismically-induced erosion rate contributes ~ 50 % of the total erosion rate, which suggests that the local topographic evolution of the middle Longmen Shan region may be closely related to tectonic events, such as the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. We propose that seismically-induced erosion is a very important component of the total erosion, particularly in active orogenic regions. Our results demonstrate that the remote sensing technique of differential DEM provides a powerful tool for evaluating the volume of co-seismic landslides produced in <b>intermountain</b> <b>regions</b> by strong earthquakes...|$|R
