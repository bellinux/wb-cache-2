5|$|North American birds {{most closely}} {{resemble}} those of Eurasia, which {{was connected to the}} continent as part of the supercontinent Laurasia until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and worldwide. However some groups unique to the New World have also arisen; those represented in this list are the hummingbirds, the New World vultures, the New World quail, the tyrant flycatchers, the vireos, the mimids, the New World warblers, the tanagers, the cardinals and the <b>icterids.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, <b>icterids,</b> and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
25|$|Other {{raptorial}} birds {{can become}} regular prey, such as all other hawks which are recorded especially in North America at locations such as Oregon (8.8% of prey remains) and Arizona. Owls may be hunted regularly {{across the entire}} range (maximum being 2.9% in Oregon) and, more rarely, so may the falcons. Rock pigeons may be hunted regularly {{in some parts of}} the golden eagle's range (other pigeons and doves have been recorded as prey but are typically rare in the diet). The common feral pigeon was the second most prevalent prey species in Sierra Espu√±a Regional Park in Spain, making up 18.8% of a sampling of 99 from 5 nests. The species was also prevalent in Slovakia, making up 7.4% of remains at nests there. Non-corvid passerines are usually ignored as prey but large thrushes such as song thrush (Turdus philomelos), mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus) and common blackbird (Turdus merula), are semi-regularly recorded prey in Europe. This family is most prevalent in Sicily, making up 8.1% of a sampling of 74 from 10 nests there, 7.7% in Central Spain and 7.2% in the French Alps. The smallest-bodied bird family recorded as semi-regular prey are pipits. Meadow pipits (Anthus pratensis) are the most represented species of small birds and are taken mainly in Scotland, making up to 3.5% of prey in the Inner Hebrides. Other bird families rarely recorded as golden eagle prey (making up less than 1% of prey in all studied nests) include starlings (maximum being 4.8% in the French Alps, negligible elsewhere), larks (maximum is 2.3% in the West-Central Highlands of Scotland), emberizid sparrows (up to 1.7% in central Alaska), woodpeckers (up to 1.5% in Alberta), cuckoos, bustards, <b>icterids,</b> shrikes, skuas, and finches.|$|E
500|$|The common {{starling}} is [...] long, with a wingspan of [...] and {{a weight}} of [...] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is [...] and the tarsus is [...] The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, <b>icterids</b> or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.|$|E
50|$|Prehistoric <b>icterid</b> genera {{that have}} been {{described}} from Pleistocene fossil remains are Pandanaris from Rancho La Brea and Pyelorhamphus from Shelter Cave.|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} a {{striking}} resemblance to the unrelated <b>icterid</b> meadowlarks, grassland birds of the Americas. This is presumably due to convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|The Scott's oriole (Icterus parisorum) is a {{medium-sized}} <b>icterid</b> (the same family as many blackbirds, meadowlarks, cowbirds, grackles, and others, including the New World orioles).|$|R
2500|$|These birds {{surprise}} and capture {{most of their}} prey from cover or while flying quickly through dense vegetation. They are adept at navigating dense thickets, although this hunting method is often hazardous to the hawk. The great majority of this hawk's prey are small birds, especially various songbirds such as sparrows, wood-warblers, finches, wrens, nuthatches, tits, <b>icterids</b> and thrushes. Birds caught {{range in size from}} a [...] Anna's hummingbird to a [...] ruffed grouse and virtually any bird within this size range is potential prey. Typically, males will target smaller birds, such as sparrows and wood-warblers, and females will pursue larger prey, such as American robins and flickers, leading to a lack of conflict between the sexes for prey. These hawks often exploit backyard bird feeders in order to target congregations of ideal prey. They often pluck the feathers off their prey on a post or other perch. Rarely, sharp-shinned hawks will also eat rodents, lizards, frogs, snakes, and large insects, the latter typically being dragonflies captured on the wing during the hawk's migration. Bats have occasionally been recorded as a prey of this hawk.|$|E

50|$|The chestnut-headed oropendola (Psarocolius wagleri) is a New World {{tropical}} <b>icterid</b> bird. The {{scientific name}} of the species commemorates Johann Georg Wagler, who established Psarocolius, the oropendola genus.|$|R
5000|$|The avian genus Quiscalus {{contains}} {{six of the}} ten {{species of}} grackle, gregarious passerine birds in the <b>icterid</b> family. They are native to North and South America. The six species are: ...|$|R
50|$|The orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) is the {{smallest}} species of <b>icterid.</b> The subspecies of the Caribbean coast of Mexico, I. s. fuertesi, is sometimes considered a separate species, the ochre oriole or Fuertes's oriole.|$|R
50|$|<b>Icterids</b> {{such as the}} Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris) and {{the shiny}} cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), which often parasitizes the nests of the former species, are quite common.|$|E
50|$|<b>Icterids</b> are {{variable}} in size, and often display considerable sexual dimorphism, with brighter coloration and greater size in males being typical. While such dimorphism is widely known in passerines, the sexual dimorphism by size is uniquely extreme in <b>icterids.</b> For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% {{heavier than the}} female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and 18 g in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures 52 cm and weighs about 550 g. This variation is greater {{than in any other}} passerine family (unless the kinglet calyptura belongs with the cotingas, which would then have greater variation). One unusual morphological adaptation shared by the <b>icterids</b> is gaping, where the skull is configured to allow them open their bills strongly rather than passively, allowing them to force open gaps to obtain otherwise hidden food.|$|E
50|$|Orioles are {{colourful}} Old World passerine {{birds in}} the genus Oriolus, the namesake of the corvoidean family Oriolidae. They {{are not related to}} the New World orioles, which are <b>icterids</b> (family Icteridae) and belong to the superfamily Passeroidea.|$|E
50|$|The {{eastern meadowlark}} (Sturnella magna) is a {{medium-sized}} <b>icterid</b> bird, very similar in appearance {{to the western}} meadowlark. It occurs from eastern North America to South America, where it is also most widespread in the east.|$|R
50|$|Typical of the <b>Icterid</b> family, St. Lucia orioles exhibit {{wide range}} of {{foraging}} adaptations. They feed on both fruits and insects. St. Lucia orioles have been observed stripping bark while foraging, {{in the manner of}} the Jamaican Oriole.|$|R
50|$|This <b>icterid</b> {{is found}} in the {{northern}} part of South America. Its range includes French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and northern Brazil. Its typical habitat is grassy areas with isolated trees near rivers, marshes, islands in rivers and gallery forest.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the general}} pattern {{observed}} among <b>icterids,</b> the overall plumage pattern seen in immature male Bullock's orioles closely resembles that seen in adult females. Juveniles resemble adult females but have darker wings, fresh wing coverts, and a pink or whitish bill. Sexual dimorphism is not obvious in juveniles.|$|E
50|$|The nesting {{habits of}} these birds are {{similarly}} variable, including pendulous woven nests in the oropendolas and orioles. Many <b>icterids</b> are colonial, nesting in colonies {{of up to}} 100,000 birds. Some cowbird species engage in brood parasitism: females lay their eggs in the nests of other species, {{in a similar fashion}} to some cuckoos.|$|E
50|$|These caciques forage {{through the}} canopy in small flocks. It feeds on large insects, spiders and small vertebrates, {{but will also}} take some fruit. It often forms mixed-species feeding flocks with {{similarly}} robust and rowdy songbirds, such as other <b>icterids,</b> black-faced grosbeaks (Caryothraustes poliogaster), or American jays. Such noisy flocks may also attract trogons or flycatchers.|$|E
50|$|The scarlet-throated tanager (Compsothraupis loricata) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. It {{is placed}} in the tanager family, although highly aberrant, with some even having suggested that it could be a corvid or <b>icterid.</b> It is {{the only member of the}} genus Compsothraupis.|$|R
50|$|Their <b>icterid</b> hosts breed colonially, {{and defend}} their nests vigorously, so even a large, bold and {{aggressive}} species like the giant cowbird has to cover an extensive territory to find sufficient egg-laying opportunities. Several giant cowbird eggs may be laid in one host nest.|$|R
50|$|The New World {{blackbirds}} {{consist of}} 26 species of <b>icterid</b> birds that share the name blackbird {{but do not}} correspond with a formal taxon. The distributions of all species are limited to the Americas, and this group is distinct from the Eurasian common blackbird (Turdus merula).|$|R
