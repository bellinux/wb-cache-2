40|$|Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) {{is widely}} used in peerto-peer (P 2 P) systems. Although it can support range or {{similarity}} queries, it breaks the load balance mechanism of traditional Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based system by replacing consistent hash with LSH. To solve the imbalance problem, current systems either weaken the locality preserve ability from similarity preserved to order preserved or adopt load aware peer join mechanism. The first method does not support similarity query as it loses the similarity information and the second method is greatly affected by the dynamic nature of P 2 P networks. In this paper, we propose a novel system, cuckoo ring, which can preserve similarity information while load balanced. It does not guide the newly joining peer to the <b>hot</b> <b>areas</b> but move {{the items in the}} <b>hot</b> <b>areas</b> to cold areas so that the short life time peers are distributed uniformly across the network instead of being guided to the <b>hot</b> <b>areas.</b> Compared to traditional DHT systems, cuckoo ring only maintains a little more information about the global light load peers and the moved indexed items...|$|R

50|$|Internet {{architecture}} is organized into several planes. The data plane represents how data is actually forwarded between routers. Topologies {{based on the}} data plane reflect physical nodes and connections but these topology graphs are hard to create and harder to validate for correctness or completeness. The control plane represents how ISP's create and configure organizational routing policy. While the data plane is responsible for forwarding data based on policy, the control plane is responsible for configuring policy. As far as topology is concerned, nodes in this plane are autonomous systems, (AS) and links between nodes represent some type of relationship. There {{are two types of}} relationships. Customer-Provider links involve one AS providing Internet access to a smaller AS at a monetary cost. Peering links are agreements between two AS networks to exchange certain types of traffic free of charge. These types of Internet topologies have become a <b>hot</b> <b>area</b> of research in academia. There is a third less known plane called the management plane but the topology maps it produces are incredibly inaccurate since its data can be directly modified by network operators with no effects on routing dynamics.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{object of}} the present {{invention}} {{is to provide a}} simple, reliable, and lightweight coupling that will also have an efficient thermal interface. A further {{object of the}} invention is to provide a coupling that is capable of blind mating with little or no insertion forces. Another object of the invention is to provide a coupling that acts as a thermal regulator to maintain a constant temperature {{on one side of the}} coupling. Another object of the invention is to increase the available surface area of a coupling thus providing a larger area for the conduction of heat across the thermal interface. Another object of the invention is to provide a fluidic coupling that has no fluid passing across the interface, thus reducing the likelihood of leaks and contamination. The foregoing objects are achieved by utilizing, as in the prior art, a <b>hot</b> <b>area</b> (at an elevated temperature as compared to a cold area) with a need to remove excess heat from the <b>hot</b> <b>area</b> to a cold area. In this device, the thermal interface will occur not on a planar horizontal surface, but along a non-planar vertical surface, which will reduce the reaction forces and increase the thermal conductivity of the device. One non-planar surface is a surface on a cold pin extending from the cold area and the other non-planar surface is a surface on a hot pin extending from the <b>hot</b> <b>area.</b> The cold pin is fixed and does not move while the hot pin is a flexible member and its movement towards the cold pin will bring the two non-planar surfaces together forming the thermal interface. The actuating member for the device is a shape-memory actuation wire which is attached through an aperture to the hot pin and through another aperture to an actuation wire retainer. By properly programming the actuation wire, heat from the <b>hot</b> <b>area</b> will cause the actuation wire to bend the hot wire. Heat from the <b>hot</b> <b>area</b> will cause the actuation wire to bend the hot pin towards the cold pin forming the coupling and the desired thermal interface. The shape-memory actuation wire is made of a shape-memory-effect alloy such as Nitinol...|$|E

40|$|Reflex {{sympathetic}} dystrophy (RSD) is {{a common}} rheumatic disorder manifesting painful swelling, discoloration, stiffening and atrophy of the skin. Radiographic alterations include small, spotty subperiosteal bone resorption (SBR) and diffuse porosis, and MR imaging shows bone and soft-tissue edema. The purposes of current investigation were to assess 99 m Tc HDP pinhole SPECT (pSPECT) findings of RSD, to correlate them with those of radiography and MRI and to speculate about causative mechanism of SBR which characterizes RSD. pSPECT was performed in five patients with RSD of the foot. pSPECT showed small, discrete, spotty <b>hot</b> <b>areas</b> in the subperiosteal zones of ankle bones in all five patients. Diffusely increased tracer uptake {{was seen in the}} retrocalcaneal surface where the calcaneal tendon inserts in two patients with atrophic RSD. pSPECT and radiographic correlation showed spotty <b>hot</b> <b>areas,</b> that reflect focally activated bone turnover, to closely match with SBR. Further correlation with MRI showed both spotty <b>hot</b> <b>areas</b> and SBR to coincide in location with the insertions of ligaments and tendons, onto which pulling strain is constantly exerted.
