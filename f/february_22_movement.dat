Ndalla and another high-ranking radical, Ange Diawara, were among those affected by Ngouabi's move. Diawara then led an unsuccessful left-wing coup attempt against Ngouabi on <b>22</b> <b>February</b> 1972. Ndalla and the others who supported a far-left, pro-Chinese political line were known as the <b>22</b> <b>February</b> <b>Movement</b> (M-22). Implicated in the plot, Ndalla was tried along with 177 others and {{sentenced to life in}} prison on 25 March 1972. President Ngouabi later released him as part of an amnesty, along with others from the M-22, in September 1975. Following his release, Ndalla faced difficulties and it took him some time to find work.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} {{was formed by}} followers of Ange Diawara, {{a leader of the}} left-wing faction of the Congolese Party of Labour, who had led a failed coup attempt against the government of Marien Ngouabi on <b>February</b> <b>22,</b> 1972. The <b>movement</b> gathered a grouping of former youth militias of the National Movement of the Revolution. [...] After the uprising had been quashed, Diawara and his followers regrouped and formed a guerrilla base in the Pool region. Diawara borrowed inspiration from Che Guevara and the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon. The name 'M 22' was taken from the document Autocritique du M 22 ('Self-criticism of M 22', authored by Diawara), which was circulated clandestinely in Brazzaville. Parallel to the rural guerrilla movement a clandestine urban opposition network (consisting of student activists and militaries) developed, also under the direction of Diawara.|$|R
