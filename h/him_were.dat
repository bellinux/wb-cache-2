5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many civilians who had supported <b>him</b> <b>were</b> slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off his beard and hair to disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against <b>him</b> <b>were</b> canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to <b>him</b> <b>were</b> placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E

50|$|The Mormon {{doctrine}} of the three degrees of glory {{is said to be}} consistent with a particular reading of Revelation 22:10-11, where John says:10 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand judgment.11 He that <b>is</b> unjust, let <b>him</b> <b>be</b> unjust still kingdom: and he which <b>is</b> filthy, let <b>him</b> <b>be</b> filthy still darkness: and he that <b>is</b> righteous, let <b>him</b> <b>be</b> righteous still kingdom: and he that <b>is</b> holy, let <b>him</b> <b>be</b> holy still kingdom.|$|R

5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten <b>him,</b> <b>were</b> {{not as important as}} what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E

5|$|Grace was {{seventh in}} the overall {{national}} batting averages and third among those batsmen who completed 10 innings. The two above <b>him</b> <b>were</b> John Selby (31.26) and Edward Lyttelton (29.96). In terms of runs scored, Grace {{was one of only}} two players to complete 1,000. The other was George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 was not a good season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{continued}} to travel around Tennessee, receiving a mixed reception {{from those who}} were aware of his past. Some who knew <b>him</b> <b>were</b> willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role, but he remained estranged from most of his family. His son Roscoe saw him preach in 1944. The younger Hensley was also a pastor by then, but had never seen his father conduct a service.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the off-the-field issues, Tennessee underwent a pair of coaching changes {{in the weeks before}} the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Wide receivers coach Frank Wilson and running backs coach Eddie Gran each decided in the first days of December to leave Tennessee for other SEC teams. In interviews, Kiffin said the coaching changes and stories surrounding <b>him</b> <b>were</b> not a distraction from his team's bowl preparation.|$|E

Both royal ladies were dressed in male military attire (helmet and armour), with the queen wearing the uniform of an Uparaja. Also accompanying their father on elephant mounts were two sons, the Uparaja and heir apparent, Prince Ramesuan, and his brother Prince Mahin.|$|E

5|$|Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He {{was the son}} of an Anglican clergyman, {{intended}} for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged <b>him</b> <b>were</b> the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting and vivid plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.|$|E
