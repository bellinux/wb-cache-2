25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E

2500|$|Novelists {{often will}} be {{assessed}} in contemporary criticism {{based on their}} gender or treatment of gender. Largely, {{this has to do}} with the dominance of men in the publishing situation. Literary criticism, especially since the rise of feminist theory, pays attention to how women, historically, have experienced a very different set of writing expectations based on their gender; for example, the editors of The Feminist Companion to Literature in English point out: [...] "Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men." [...] It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her gender: her position as a woman within the literary marketplace. However, [...] the publishing market's orientation to favor the primary reading audience of women may increasingly skew the market towards female novelists; for this reason, novelist Teddy Wayne argued in a 2012 Salon article titled [...] "The agony of the male novelist" [...] that midlist male novelists are less likely to find success than midlist female novelist, even though men tend to dominate [...] "literary fiction" [...] spaces.|$|E
