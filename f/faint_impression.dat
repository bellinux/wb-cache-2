I said it was delightful, and I dare say it was; but it was all Dora to me. The sun shone Dora, and the birds sang Dora. The south wind blew Dora, and the wild flowers in the hedges were all Doras, to a bud. My comfort is, Miss Mills understood me. Miss Mills alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly.|$|E
60|$|A minute later, {{the girl}} {{ran down the}} stairs. As she came forward she stopped, with sudden shyness. Absorbed in her anxiety for her father and mother, she had taken but little heed of the {{appearance}} of the officer who had saved them. That he was kind as well as brave she was sure for, although he had scarce spoken to her, the gentleness with which he had moved her father and her mother from the bloodstained room, and the promptness and decision with which he had given his orders, had inspired her with absolute confidence in him. She had a vague idea that he was young, but his face, flecked here and there with blood, had left but a <b>faint</b> <b>impression</b> upon her memory; and when she saw the young officer, in his spotless and imposing uniform, she almost felt that there must be some mistake.|$|E
60|$|I was so {{staggered}} by {{the extraordinary}} scene of married life which I had just witnessed, that the guests produced {{only a very}} <b>faint</b> <b>impression</b> upon me. My mind was absorbed in {{trying to find the}} true meaning of what I had seen and heard. Was Mrs. Farnaby a little mad? I dismissed that idea as soon as it occurred to me; nothing that I had observed in her justified it. The truer conclusion appeared to be, that she was deeply interested in some absent (and possibly lost) young creature; whose age, judging by actions and tones which had sufficiently revealed that part of the secret to me, could not be more than sixteen or seventeen years. How long had she cherished the hope of seeing the girl, or hearing of her? It must have been, anyhow, a hope very deeply rooted, for she had been perfectly incapable of controlling herself when I had accidentally roused it. As for her husband, there could be no doubt that the subject was not merely distasteful to him, but so absolutely infuriating that he could not even keep his temper, {{in the presence of a}} third person invited to his house. Had he injured the girl in any way? Was he responsible for her disappearance? Did his wife know it, or only suspect it? Who was the girl? What was the secret of Mrs. Farnaby's extraordinary interest in her--Mrs. Farnaby, whose marriage was childless; whose interest one would have thought should be naturally concentrated on her adopted daughter, her sister's orphan child? In conjectures such as these, I completely lost myself. Let me hear what your ingenuity can make of the puzzle; and let me return to Mr. Farnaby's dinner, waiting on Mr. Farnaby's table.|$|E
60|$|A scale {{might be}} formed, {{graduated}} {{according to the}} degrees of a combined ratio of intensity, duration, connexion, periods of recurrence, and utility, {{which would be the}} standard, according to which all ideas might be measured, and an uninterrupted chain of nicely shadowed distinctions would be observed, from the <b>faintest</b> <b>impression</b> on the senses, to the most distinct combination of those impressions; from the simplest of those combinations, to that mass of knowledge which, including our own nature, constitutes what we call the universe.|$|R

60|$|Something--the {{beauty of}} the night, perhaps, or some faint {{aftermath}} of sentimentality born of Sonia's emotion--tempted him during those few moments to relax. He threw aside his mask and breathed the freer for it. Once more he was a human being, treading the streets of a real city, his feet very much upon the earth, his heart full of the simplest things. All the scheming {{of the last few}} days was forgotten, the great issues, the fine yet devious way to be steered amidst the rocks which beset him; even the depression of the calamitous news from the North Sea passed away. He was a very simple human being, and he was in love. It was all so unpractical, so illusionary, and yet so real. Events, actual happenings--he thrust all thoughts of these away from his mind. What she might be thinking of him at the moment he ignored. He was content to let his thoughts rest upon her, to walk through the moonlit street, his brain and heart revelling in that subtle facility of the imagination which brought her so easily to his presence. It was such a vividly real Pamela, too, who spoke and walked and moved by his side. His memory failed him nowhere, followed faithfully the kaleidoscopic changes in her face and tone, showed him even that long, grateful, searching glance when their eyes had met in Von Teyl's sitting-room. There had been times when she had shown clearly enough that she was anxious to understand, anxious to believe in him. He clung to the memory of these; pushed into the background that <b>faint</b> <b>impression</b> he had had of her at the roof-garden, serene and proud, yet with a faint look of something like pain in her startled eyes.|$|E
60|$|For my own part, as {{the gondola}} slipped {{away from the}} blaze and bustle of the station down the gloom and silence of the broad canal, I forgot that I had been {{freezing}} two days and nights; that I {{was at that moment}} very cold and a little homesick. I could at first feel nothing but that beautiful silence, broken only by the star-silvered dip of the oars. Then on either hand I saw stately palaces rise gray and lofty from the dark waters, holding here and there a lamp against their faces, which brought balconies, and columns, and carven arches into momentary relief, and threw long streams of crimson into the canal. I could see by that uncertain glimmer how fair was all, but not how sad and old; and so, unhaunted by any pang for the decay that afterward saddened me amid the forlorn beauty of Venice, I glided on. I have no doubt it was a proper time to think all the fantastic things in the world, and I thought them; but they passed vaguely through my mind, without at all interrupting the sensations of sight and sound. Indeed, the past and present mixed there, and the moral and material were blent in the sentiment of utter novelty and surprise. The quick boat slid through old troubles of mine, and unlooked-for events gave it the impulse that carried it beyond, and safely around sharp corners of life. And all the while I knew that this was a progress through narrow and crooked canals, and past marble angles of palaces. But I did not know then that this fine confusion of sense and spirit was the first <b>faint</b> <b>impression</b> of the charm of life in Venice.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Varden {{opined that}} if he did, {{he ought to be}} ashamed of himself; such sentiments being more {{consistent}} (so she argued) with a benighted Mussulman or wild Islander than with a stanch Protestant. Arguing from this imperfect state of his morals, Mrs Varden further opined that he had never studied the Manual. Hugh admitting that he never had, and moreover that he couldn't read, Mrs Varden declared with much severity, that he ought to be even more ashamed of himself than before, and strongly recommended him to save up his pocket-money for the purchase of one, and further to teach himself the contents with all convenient diligence. She was still pursuing this train of discourse, when Hugh, somewhat unceremoniously and irreverently, followed his young master out, and left her to edify the rest of the company. This she proceeded to do, and finding that Mr Willet's eyes were fixed upon her with an appearance of deep attention, gradually addressed the whole of her discourse to him, whom she entertained with a moral and theological lecture of considerable length, in the conviction that great workings were taking place in his spirit. The simple truth was, however, that Mr Willet, although his eyes were wide open and he saw a woman before him whose head by long and steady looking at seemed to grow bigger and bigger until it filled the whole bar, was to all other intents and purposes fast asleep; and so sat leaning back in his chair with {{his hands in his pockets}} until his son's return caused him to wake up with a deep sigh, and a <b>faint</b> <b>impression</b> that he had been dreaming about pickled pork and greens--a vision of his slumbers which was no doubt referable to the circumstance of Mrs Varden's having frequently pronounced the word 'Grace' with much emphasis; which word, entering the portals of Mr Willet's brain as they stood ajar, and coupling itself with the words 'before meat,' which were there ranging about, did in time suggest a particular kind of meat together with that description of vegetable which is usually its companion.|$|E
5000|$|Hypnagogic {{hallucinations}} {{are often}} auditory or have an auditory component. Like the visuals, hypnagogic sounds vary in intensity from <b>faint</b> <b>impressions</b> to loud noises, like knocking and crash and bangs (exploding head syndrome).

While typically nonsensical and fragmented, these speech events can occasionally strike {{the individual as}} apt comments on—or summations of—their thoughts at the time. They often contain word play, neologisms and made-up names. Hypnagogic speech may manifest as the subject's own [...] "inner voice", or as the voices of others: familiar people or strangers. More rarely, poetry or music is heard.|$|R

50|$|Xu's {{interpretation}} {{was supported}} by further study of the Juravenator fossil. The first follow-up study to the initial description reported that <b>faint</b> <b>impressions</b> of filamentous structures, possibly primitive feathers, were present {{along the top of}} the tail and hips. A more in-depth study, published in 2010, included an examination of the specimen under ultra-violet light by Helmut Tischlinger. The examination under UV revealed a more extensive covering of filament-like structures, similar in anatomy to the primitive feathers of other compsognathids, including Sinosauropteryx. The investigation also discovered additional patches of soft tissue, on the snout and the lower leg, and vertical collagen fibres between the chevrons of the tail vertebrae. Achim Reisdorf and Michael Wuttke in 2012 described the taphonomical circumstances of the fossilisation of the holotype of Juravenator starki.|$|R

The attempt to make a child focus for a whole view--which is really a generalization and an adult abstraction--is simply wicked. Yet the first thing we do is to set a child making relief-maps in clay, for example: of his own district. Imbecility!

He erased it and started anew on the second flyleaf as reproduced above. However, a <b>faint</b> <b>impression</b> remains and George M.

50|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} is {{well known}} in Tambachia, given the completeness of the holotype specimen. The relatively short tail, preserved only as a <b>faint</b> <b>impression</b> in MNG 7722, is 8.5 cm long. The limbs are short, with four digits on the manus, or hand, and five digits on the pes, or foot. It is possible that the manus possessed five digits, since Acheloma, another closely related trematopid, has been described as having five distal carpals. In the pes of the holotype specimen, there are only four digits preserved. However, since the third preserved digit is the longest, it likely represents the fourth digit, with the first digit absent due to imperfect preservation. The terminal phalanges of Tambachia were narrow, and would have been the core supports of claws.|$|E
60|$|Our next day's work carried us {{as far as}} Abbeville, in Picardy. Here we had {{a capital}} supper of game, {{in a room that}} set us all {{shivering}} with good honest cold. The beds, as usual, were excellent. The country throughout all this part of France, is tame and monotonous, with wide reaches of grain-lands that are now brown and dreary, here and there a wood, and the usual villages of dirty stonehouses. We passed a few hamlets, however, that were more than commonly rustic and picturesque, and in which the dwellings seemed to be of mud, and were thatched. As they were mostly very irregular in form, the street winding through them quite prettily, they would have been good in their way, had there been any of the simple expedients of taste to relieve their poverty. But the French peasants of this province appear to think of little else but their wants. There was occasionally a venerable and generous old vine clinging about the door, however, to raise some <b>faint</b> <b>impressions</b> of happiness.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{specimen}} preserves <b>faint</b> plumage <b>impressions,</b> {{it is understandable}} why they escaped v.
