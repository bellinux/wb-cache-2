500|$|Eaton: [...] "Have you <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>{{anything}}</b> in {{the conduct}} of General Babcock, or has he ever said anything to you, which indicated to your mind that he was in any way interested in or concerned with the Whiskey Ring at St. Louis or elsewhere?" ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{difficulty}} was {{the implementation}} of texture mapping. Neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with the concept on an Apple II computer in the late 1980s, but {{he believed that the}} more powerful IBM PCs of the time might be able to process it. He contacted Lerner Research programmer Chris Green—an acquaintance from his past work with Ned Lerner—who created a working algorithm. Using the Space Rogue engine, Green's algorithm, assembly code from Lerner Research's Car and Driver and original programming, the Blue Sky team completed a prototype of Underworld after roughly a month of work. Neurath described the prototype as [...] "fast, smooth, and [...] true texture mapped walls, though the ceiling and floor were flat shaded and the corridors and rooms were all 10' [...] high—it looked a lot like Wolfenstein-3D in fact." [...] The team demonstrated it at the June 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and impressed Origin Systems. Origin producer Warren Spector later said, [...] "I remember Paul showing me that demo [...] at CES and being totally floored by it. None of us had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it." [...] The two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer, and Origin suggested that the game be reworked to fit into the Ultima universe. The team agreed, and the game was renamed Ultima Underworld. While Spector had hoped to produce the game, he was not assigned to the role; and he later said that he [...] "sort of watched [...] jealously from the sidelines." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 09:30, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton {{reported}} that there were fatalities resulting from the fire, {{but she could not}} specify how many had been killed because of the size and complexity of the building. Cotton said: [...] "This is an unprecedented incident. In my 29 years of being a firefighter, I have never <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> of this scale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How delightfully Continental!" [...] Blanche exclaimed, as the head-waiter {{showed them}} to their table. [...] "Hester, did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> more quaint?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> more {{of those}} women who used {{to come down to}} the ship after a man named Robinson?" [...] he enquired, carelessly.|$|R
6000|$|... "My, but ain't he a looker! <b>Ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> like him? Best {{piece of}} {{horseflesh}} I ever straddled, and I've seen {{a few in}} my time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wham!'s tour of China in April 1985, {{the first}} visit to China by a Western popular music act, {{generated}} worldwide media coverage, much of it centred on Michael. Before Wham!'s appearance in China, many kinds of music in the country were forbidden. The audience included members of the Chinese government, and Chinese television presenter, Kan Lijun, who was the on stage host, spoke of Wham!'s historic performance; [...] "No-one had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like that before. All the young people were amazed and everybody was tapping their feet. Of course the police weren't happy and they were scared there would be riots." [...] The tour was documented by film director Lindsay Anderson and producer Martin Lewis in their film Foreign Skies: Wham! In China.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> of {{this sort}} before?" [...] asked Baldwin, with a motion of his hand towards the diving {{apparatus}} scattered on the deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Maria! dost see them?" [...] she said, {{turning to}} her companion, {{an elderly woman}} in sober black gown and coif of tinsel lace. [...] "Hast <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so quaint?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How lucky!' cried she to the wolf. 'There {{is a huge}} cheese {{about the}} size of a mill wheel. Look! look! did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so beautiful!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. They've put young Bassett back {{instead of}} him. Sey-mour's. Buck up, Seymour's. We-ell played! There, did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> like it?" [...] {{he broke off}} disgustedly.|$|R
6000|$|The lady put out her foot; it {{was very}} small, {{and there was an}} immense rosette on her slipper. She fixed her eyes for a while on this ornament, and then she looked at the glowing bed of {{anthracite}} coal in the grate. [...] "Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so hideous as that fire?" [...] she demanded. [...] "Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so--so affreux as--as everything?" [...] She spoke English with perfect purity; but she brought out this French epithet in a manner that indicated that she was accustomed to using French epithets.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will do, I daresay, {{without your}} {{wringing}} your hands over it. When, my dear," [...] the Colonel pursued as he smoked, [...] "have you <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> of yours--anything that you've done--NOT do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I would fain hope so. If I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like deep earnest feeling I {{should be}} satisfied. Yet Percy declares, I trust {{he may be}} right, that she has the very strongest affections, and much {{tenderness}} of character. He says her nature came straight from the tropics, and must not be judged by sober English rules.' ...|$|E
60|$|Across the harbour, on a fir-fringed headland, stood Dalveigh. John Cameron, childless millionaire, {{had built}} a summer cottage on that point two years ago, and given it {{the name of the}} old ancestral estate in Scotland. To the Racicot fishing folk the house and grounds were as a dream of enchantment made real. Few of them had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> {{like that}} before?" [...] he asked. He was a shrewd man, the horse-dealer, and {{really wanted to}} know what was the matter with the negro.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I feel a richer, better {{woman for}} it, and don't believe I shall <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> more {{satisfactory}} if I stay in Italy ten years,' responded Lavinia, wrapping the red army-blanket ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look! Look! The ghost!" [...] {{suddenly}} cried Sam, {{and pointed}} into the falling water. [...] "Oh, Uncle Randolph, did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> like it?" [...] {{and he gave}} a shiver.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The poor {{boys were}} both so wretched, {{that one could}} not {{say a word to}} make it worse,' said Felix. 'This {{satisfies}} me that Fulbert is all right in that way. He would not have been so shocked if he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it before; but though he is very sorry now, I am afraid it will not cut the connection with those Collises.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no. She's quite well," [...] said Clementina; but {{she left}} {{it for him}} to break the {{constraint}} in which they set out. He tried to do so at different points, {{but it seemed to}} close upon them--the more inflexibly. At last he asked, as they were drawing near the church, [...] "Have you <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> of Mr. Belsky since you left Florence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Mexicans," [...] he said; [...] "fought {{with such}} ferocity {{that if we}} had had the {{assistance}} of ten thousand Hectors, and as many Orlandos, we should have made no impression on them. There were several of our troops who had served in the Italian wars; but neither there, nor in the battles with the Turk, have they <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like the desperation shown by these Indians." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The girl must {{understand}} what you mean; and you shouldn't laugh at her own mother to her. Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> like {{the way in which}} that horrible woman is following the young lord about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{burst into}} her little laugh. [...] "Are you afraid you'll get lost--or run over? But there's Giovanelli, leaning against that tree. He's {{staring at the}} women in the carriages: did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so cool?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just brought}} this gentleman in {{to show him}} your ceiling. Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so wonderful? How are you, Mrs. Hodgson? This is Mr. Carey, who looked after me when I was in the hospital." ...|$|R
60|$|Trot, too, {{was having}} queer {{experiences}} and enjoying them. When she ducked under water, she saw plainly {{everything about her}} as easily and distinctly as she had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> above water. And by {{looking over her shoulder}} she could watch the motion of her new tail, all covered with pretty iridescent pink scales, which gleamed like jewels. She wore her dress the same as before, and the water failed to affect it in the least.|$|E
60|$|No one in Mariposa had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> {{like the}} caff. All {{down the side}} of it were the grill fires, with great pewter dish covers that went up and down on a chain, and you could walk along the row and {{actually}} pick out your own cutlet and then see the French marquis throw it on to the broiling iron; you could watch a buckwheat pancake whirled into existence under your eyes and see fowls' legs devilled, peppered, grilled, and tormented till they lost all semblance of the original Mariposa chicken.|$|E
60|$|The {{sun rose}} {{presently}} and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land, {{and we saw}} a prodigious host moving slowly toward us, with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea. Nearer and nearer it came, {{and more and more}} sublimely imposing became its aspect; yes, all England was there, apparently. Soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering, and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash. Yes, it was a fine sight; I hadn't <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> to beat it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so, quite so! Look at us poor slaves of land-owners; if I couldn't {{abuse the}} farmers I should be wretched. Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> finer than this pasture? And {{they want me}} to lower their rents!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just look at it, sir," [...] I added, {{holding it}} lip; [...] "did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> whiter? Consider how it shines of a night, like {{a bit of}} the Milky Way. A little paint, sir, you cannot refuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aren't they terrifying? Aren't {{they really}} terrifying?' said Gudrun. 'Don't they look saurian? They {{are just like}} great lizards. Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> like Sir Joshua? But really, Ursula, he belongs to the primeval world, when great lizards crawled about.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my {{fine young}} man," [...] he said, with some impatience, [...] "you {{seem to make}} as little of our Cathedral {{as if you were}} the Angel Gabriel come {{straight}} from Paradise. I should like to know if you have ever seen finer work than our Giotto's tower, or any cupola that would not look a mere mushroom by the side of Brunelleschi's there, or any marbles finer or more cunningly wrought than these that our Signoria got from far-off quarries, at a price that would buy a dukedom. Come, now, have you <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> to equal them?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had hardly}} begun {{to get the}} Princess ready when a dwarf arrived, mounted upon an elephant. He came from the five fairies, and brought for the Princess a crown, a sceptre, and a robe of golden brocade, with a {{petticoat}} marvellously embroidered with butterflies' wings. They also sent a casket of jewels, so splendid {{that no one had}} <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it before, and the Queen was perfectly dazzled when she opened it. But the Princess scarcely gave a glance to any of these treasures, for she thought of nothing but Fanfaronade. The Dwarf was rewarded with a gold piece, and decorated with so many ribbons that it was hardly possible to see him at all. The Princess sent to each of the fairies a new spinning-wheel with a distaff of cedar wood, and the Queen said she must look through her treasures and find something very charming to send them also.|$|E
60|$|When midsummer arrives {{a curious}} change comes over Whitooweek; the slight family ties are broken, {{and the bird}} becomes a hermit indeed {{for the rest of}} the year. He lives entirely alone, and not even in the {{migrating}} season does he join with his fellows in any large numbers, as most other birds do; and no one, so far as I know, has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> that might be appropriately called a flock of woodcock. The only exception to this rule that I know is when, on rare occasions, you surprise a male woodcock strutting on a log, like a grouse, spreading wings and tail, and hissing and sputtering queerly as he moves up and down. Then, if you creep near, you will flush two or three other birds that are watching beside the log, or in the underbrush close at hand. One hunter told me recently that his setter once pointed a bird on fallen log, that ceased his strutting as soon as he was discovered and slipped down into the ferns. When the dog drew nearer, five woodcock flushed at the same moment, the greatest number that I have ever known being found together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least. The man is mad, my dear, and I {{really believe}} driven so by that absurd Illinois woman's poetry. Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so ridiculous--and shameful, too--as the 'Ulricardo' business? I don't wonder he colored so." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pioneers Mary Ann and John Jones {{traveled}} through Alamo in 1847. she provided the earliest English {{description of the}} area in her diary. Her husband stopped the wagon saying, [...] "Mary, look! Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so beautiful?" [...] She wrote later: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's why," [...] he said, explanatorily, to Madison, [...] "I don't {{allow to}} have my Safie go round with those women. Not as I <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> o' that sort goin' on, or keer to look, but on gin'ral principles. You {{understand}} what I mean." ...|$|R
