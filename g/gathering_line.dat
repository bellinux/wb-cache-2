Not one of them doubted but that his coming had brought the storm; but there was not one of them who dared to utter a word of complaint. Only they stood up in their boats, and shielding their eyes with an uplifted hand from the fierce rays of the sinking sun, gazed out seaward, searching for the boats not yet in safety.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMarcellus Shale {{development}} is occurring rapidly and relatively unconstrained across Pennsylvania (PA). Through 2013, over 7400 unconventional wells had been drilled in the Commonwealth. Well pads, access roads, and gathering lines fragment forestland resulting in irreversible alterations {{to the forest}} ecosystem. Changes in forest quantity, composition, and structural pattern can result in increased predation, brood parasitism, altered light, wind, and noise intensity, and spread of invasive species. These fragmentation effects pose a risk to PA's rich biodiversity. This study projects the structure of future alternative pathways for Marcellus shale development and quantifies the potential ecological impact of future drilling using a core forest region of Bradford County, PA. Modeling presented here suggests that future development could cause the level of fragmentation {{in the study area}} to more than double throughout the lifetime of gas development. Specifically, gathering lines are responsible for approximately 94 % of the incremental fragmentation in the core forest study region. However, by requiring gathering lines to follow pre-existing road routes in forested regions, shale resources can be exploited to their full potential, while essentially preventing any further fragmentation from occurring across the core forested landscape of Bradford County. In the study region, assuming an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 1 – 3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per well, this policy could be implemented for a minimal incremental economic investment of approximately $ 0. 005 –$ 0. 02 per Mcf of natural gas produced over the modeled traditional <b>gathering</b> <b>line</b> development...|$|E

40|$|Results of a {{laboratory}} study of internal corrosion in wet gas pipelines under conditions involving a stagnant or slowly flowing aqueous phase {{indicate that the}} corrosion rate is not affected by calcium and magnesium scale-forming tendency of the test solutions, provided that they are buffered. It {{is possible that the}} scales formed are sufficiently porous to per-mit electrolyte contact with steel. However, an increase in pH and decrease in oxygen resulted in significant corrosion rate reduction. Thermodynamic analyses indicate that the forma-tion of metastable iron sulfide (FeS) precipitates is promoted by higher pH and higher dissolved iron concentration, and hindered by the presence of carbon dioxide (CO 2). The pres-ence of oxygen on corrosion may lead to the transformation of a metastable FeS phase, mackinawite (Fe 1 +xS), to another metastable phase, greigite (Fe 3 S 4). Electrochemical polariza-tion data indicate that the steel behaves in an active manner symptomatic of a nonprotective corrosion product film. The effect of oxygen in increasing the corrosion rate may be re-lated to the increase in corrosion potential. Surface analysis by Raman spectroscopy confirmed some of the thermody-namic predictions of stable phases. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy indicated the predominance of akaganeite (β-) and repidocrocite (γ-FeOOH). Based on the results of this study, a regression equation developed from nonscale-form-ing solutions may be adopted for predicting the internal cor-rosion of gas transmission and <b>gathering</b> <b>lines</b> caused by condensed water and acid gases.

40|$|Natural gas {{hydrates}} {{are solid}} crystalline compounds which form when molecules smaller than n-butane contact molecules {{of water at}} elevated pressures and reduced temperatures, both {{above and below the}} ice point. Because these crystalline compounds plug flow channels, they are undesirable. In this project the authors proposed an alternate approach of controlling hydrate formation by preventing hydrate growth into a sizeable mass which could block a flow channel. The authors call this new technique kinetic inhibition, because while it allows the system to exist in the hydrate domain, it prevents the kinetic agglomeration of small hydrate crystals to the point of pluggage of a flow channel. In order to investigate the kinetic means of inhibiting hydrate formation, they held two consortium meetings, on June 1, 1990 and on August 31, 1990. At subsequent meetings, the authors determined the following four stages of the project, necessary to reach the goal of determining a new hydrate field inhibitor: (1) a rapid screening method was to be determined for testing the hydrate kinetic formation period of many surfactants and polymer candidates (both individually and combined), the present report presents the success of two screening apparatuses: a multi-reactor apparatus which is capable of rapid, high volume screening, and the backup screening method [...] a viscometer for testing with gas at high pressure; (2) the construction of two high, constant pressure cells were to experimentally confirm the success of the chemicals in the rapid screening apparatus; (3) in the third phase of the work, Exxon volunteered to evaluate the performance of the best chemicals from the previous two stages in their 4 inch I.

40|$|While {{exploitation}} of the Marcellus Shale constitutes a major economic opportunity for leaseholders {{and the state of}} Pennsylvania, it also has brought persistent concerns over the environmental and economic impacts this may have on air and water quality, forest health, property values, and wildlife. This project examined 3 specific aspects of natural gas related activity in 9 watersheds of various drilling intensities in north-central Pennsylvania. The impacts of gathering pipeline in particular were examined, including their role in forest fragmentation, the energy return on investment (EROI) associated with their construction, and how this energy return was distributed over the well’s lifetime to date. The results revealed that gathering pipelines likely caused minimal losses in forest cover from 2005 to 2010 in 4 of the 6 sites featuring drilling activity. Losses could be attributed to pipelines even in high intensity sites that initially had less forest cover than the low intensity sites. The EROI of pipelines included both their embodied energy and their construction costs, and was found to constitute less than 3 % of the energy return, given three different scenarios of EROI analysis in which wells of a low (1. 3 trillion Btu) or high (2. 6 trillion Btu) lifetime productivity were compared to energy costs of pipeline lengths with three different diameters (12, 20, and 24 inches). Finally, reporting data obtained from the state Department of Environmental Protection was analyzed to produce decline curves for 54 wells in Susquehanna and Bradford counties. Fifty of the wells reached their maximum production within a year of being drilled, and by the wells’ second reporting periods (an average of 546. 98 days after completion), 31 of the 46 applicable wells were producing less than half of their maximum. The study revealed that drilling activity in the area is proceeding according to the high development scenario projected by The Nature Conservancy, but that space between pads and total pipeline lengths is smaller than initially predicted. The results suggest that increasing the number of wells on a well pad is key to a number of improvements. Forest fragmentation as well as impacts on biological communities would be minimized with fewer disturbances and less pipeline. This would require drillers to consolidate leases, but would also result in a smaller investment of energy in pipelines. Municipalities should be aware that <b>gathering</b> <b>lines</b> may open up “highways” of drilling activity and should be allowed to maintain their zoning rights. Finally, multiple wells per pad would ameliorate the replication of impacts sacrificed for what could be a lifetime far less than the 40 - 50 years suggested by drilling advocates...|$|R
