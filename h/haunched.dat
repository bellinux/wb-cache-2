60|$|It {{was shaped}} {{something}} like a lengthened egg, but flattened more; and, at the ends, pointed more; and yet not pointed, but irregularly wedge-shaped. Somewhere near the middle of its under side, there was a lateral ridge; and an obscure point of this ridge rested on a second lengthwise-sharpened rock, slightly protruding from the ground. Beside that one obscure and minute point of contact, the whole enormous and most ponderous mass touched not another object in the wide terraqueous world. It was a breathless thing to see. One broad <b>haunched</b> end hovered {{within an inch of}} the soil, all along to the point of teetering contact; but yet touched not the soil. Many feet from that--beneath one part of the opposite end, which was all seamed and half-riven--the vacancy was considerably larger, so as to make it not only possible, but convenient to admit a crawling man; yet no mortal being had ever been known to have the intrepid heart to crawl there.|$|E
60|$|The consulting-room has two windows {{looking on}} Queen Anne Street. Between {{the two is}} a marble-topped console, with <b>haunched</b> gilt legs ending in sphinx claws. The huge pier-glass which surmounts it is mostly {{disabled}} from reflection by elaborate painting on its surface of palms, ferns, lilies, tulips, and sunflowers. The adjoining wall contains the fireplace, with two arm-chairs before it. As we happen to face the corner we see nothing {{of the other two}} walls. On the right of the fireplace, or rather on the right of any person facing the fireplace, is the door. On its left is the writing-table at which Redpenny sits. It is an untidy table with a microscope, several test tubes, and a spirit lamp standing up through its litter of papers. There is a couch {{in the middle of the}} room, at right angles to the console, and parallel to the fireplace. A chair stands between the couch and the windowed wall. The windows have green Venetian blinds and rep curtains; and there is a gasalier; but it is a convert to electric lighting. The wall paper and carpets are mostly green, coeval with the gasalier and the Venetian blinds. The house, in fact, was so well furnished in the middle of the XIXth century that it stands unaltered to this day and is still quite presentable.|$|E
60|$|Trafford's trail led Marjorie {{through the}} thicket of dwarf willows {{and down to}} the gully of the rivulet which they had called Marjorie Trickle; it had long since become a trough of snow-covered rotten ice; the trail crossed this and, turning sharply uphill, went on until it was clear of shrubs and trees, and in the windy open of the upper slopes it crossed a ridge and came over the lip of a large desolate valley with slopes of ice and icy snow. Here she spent some time in {{following}} his loops back on the homeward trail before she saw what was manifestly the final trail running far away out across the snow, with the spoor of the lynx, a lightly-dotted line, to the right of it. She followed this suggestion of the trail, put on her snowshoes, and shuffled her way across this valley, which opened as she proceeded. She hoped that over the ridge she would find Trafford, and scanned the sky for the faintest discolouration of a fire, but there was none. That seemed odd to her, but the wind was in her face, and perhaps it beat the smoke down. Then as her eyes scanned the hummocky ridge ahead, she saw something, something very intent and still, that brought her heart into her mouth. It was a big, grey wolf, standing with back <b>haunched</b> and head down, watching and winding something beyond there, out of sight.|$|E

30|$|Figure  5 {{shows the}} details of {{specimen}} J-H, which was strengthened with <b>haunch</b> elements made by steel plates (SS 400) having a thickness of 16  mm and specified yield strength of 400  MPa. In the figure, the plastic hinge regions of the beam and column below the beam, which were adjacent to the joint panel zone, were three-sided (or U-shaped), strengthened with steel gutters, and connected together by a diagonal steel plate to form a <b>haunch.</b> In addition, {{two sides of the}} steel gutters were installed with anchor bolts HILTI HSL- 3 M 12 / 20 (the diameter of 12  mm and the length of 120  mm). It is noted that <b>haunches</b> are expected to change the failure mode from J failure to BJ or B failure. The evaluation of the strength of the steel <b>haunch</b> elements is presented in Appendix 3. In this study, the β (and β′) factor (which was used to determine the redistribution of the shear between the beam, column, and <b>haunch</b> elements in the joint) is equal to 2.69, indicating that the bending moments and the shear forces in the beams and columns could be reduced by up to 30 %. <b>Haunches</b> were not installed in the upper story of the joint to avoid architectural inconvenience after the retrofit because the <b>haunches</b> could occupy the space in the upper story.|$|R

50|$|When {{the estate}} was {{acquired}} by John Naylor in 1863, he used the firm of architects Poundley and Walker, who worked from offices at Brynllywarch, Kerry, to design a new Model Farm and Farmhouse, a gatehouse on the B 4388 Montgomery to Forden Road and worker’s housing on the A490, Forden to Churchstoke Road. The single-story gatehouse is in a whitish brick often used by the architect, David Walker, while the other buildings are in a reddish brick, some with stone rustication and Cefn stone facings which are typical of Poundley and Walker. The model farm is {{laid out on the}} typical grid plan adopted by Poundley, and an axial row of buildings, which would have contained a drive shaft to provide a power source to adjacent yards. The layout is basically symmetrical, with a 2-storey central spine range running NE - SW, of approximately 12m span, containing the main straw barn, having 2-storey cross ranges of 6.5m span, 14 roof bays each side, set 2/3rds of the length to the SW, from which 2 single storey ranges spring at right angles, each with 7 open arches, and terminating in pens each with a small yard. The single storey ranges form 2 stock yards each side of the SW end of the barn range, designed for beef cattle. The spine barn range has 14 tensioned queen post-and-collar trusses NE of the cross range junction, and the cross ranges have <b>haunched</b> king posts and angled strut trusses. The large stockyard in the northern angle is paved with large stone sets, and is defined by a 7-bay carthouse on cast iron columns on its NE side, with a wide 6-roof-bay granary over. At right angles to the NW cross range, the large stock yard is enclosed by a further range, with stables for brood mares on the inner (yard) side, and for stallions on the outer face. The corresponding E angle contains the rick yard. Tall round-arched openings give access to the enclosed paved N yard, with similar arches forming a cross space in the great barn range. Access doors to the feeding walks are framed and battened, with some recessed ironmongery, and windows are of part louvred. The cattle yards between the SW wings are enclosed by stone coped brick walls. A stone shield with initials and date on the SW gable of the barn, and some bricks are impressed JN1874 for John Naylor. The lack of farm buildings on the NE sector, suggests that the layout was not completed. The effluent flow away to a very large holding tank beyond the SE end of the cross range, with distribution pipes leading to the fields, similar to the system used at Leighton. The buildings are in the course of conversion into a housing scheme of 26 residential dwellings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyse seismic {{behaviors}} of the <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer floor, carried out the pseudo static testing, which were subjected to vertical loads and horizontal cyclic loads, respectively on two specimens, including the framed short-leg shear wall <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer plane framework and the same dimension unhaunched beam-shaped transfer frame. The test shows that: 1) <b>Haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer structure can apparently improve the shear-bearing-capacity of the abutment section and reduce the beam dimension effectively, and {{it is easier to}} implement the aseismatic design principles, including “strong column and weak beam, strong shearing and weak bend”; 2) if the design is reasonable, <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer structure can get better seismic behavior...|$|E

Experiments are carried out to study the moment-rotation characteristics of the connections and ultimate moment capacity of the composite sections. Design implications related to composite <b>haunched</b> beams are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of the joint model experiment, the {{non-linear}} performance of joints is analysed by using finite element program. The concrete stress distribution, stirrups stress and dangerous area of joints with spread-ended beams are discussed. Finite element analysis shows that effective prestressing tendons through the joint core region play a beneficial role in concrete and can improve the compressive strengths of concrete, and help to improve the shear strength of joints. Finally, according to experiments and theoretical analysis, the beginning of the <b>haunched</b> region is the dangerous area of joint. In order to avoid concrete tension failure when exerting prestress, the beginning of the <b>haunched</b> region must have enough transverse U-shaped bars to resist the prestressing tension...|$|E

Analytical solutions for the boundary stresses are made: using the distance between column center lines as the effective span; using the clear span between columns as the effective span. A comparison is made between the analytical solutions and the photoelastic evaluation. The use of center line distance between columns as the effective span is found to be safe in all frames tested. However, the use of clear span as effective span provides an unconservative estimate in the case of deep, wide haunches...|$|E
