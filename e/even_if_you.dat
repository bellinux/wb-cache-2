5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit where you are sitting and, when you are gone, attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
25|$|Don't {{be tempted}} to omit {{subtracting}} the RJepoch just because it is offset by adding +1. As written, this expression is robust <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> assign a value other than one to the epoch.|$|E
6000|$|... "A quiet talk, Percival, {{with all}} my heart, but not now, and not over the wine. Later in the <b>evening,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please--later in the evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect you'll find me {{here this}} <b>evening</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> care to come. You'll find {{this about the}} best place for getting {{dyspepsia}} at the lowest cost in the Quarter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's got a tea on this <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{knew him}} well enough, you might borrow {{something}} from him. I met Herbert in the dinner-hour carrying {{in all sorts}} of things to his study. Still, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't know him--" ...|$|R
25|$|This book is {{just fun}} to read, {{alone or with}} your spouse or friends. And it {{broadens}} your horizon. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't plan on attending a trivia-gameshow anytime soon, your newly acquired knowledge will be beneficial when the need for smalltalk arises.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} online bra size {{calculator}} tools, mostly {{you will find}} on lingerie website. But one major bra size {{problem is that it}} varies according to brand. So <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know the bra size of some particular brand, you should get yourself measured if you're buying bra from some other brand.|$|E
25|$|You are {{catching}} the fish {{one by one}} with a fishing rod. You have decided to catch n fish. You are determined to catch exactly n fish regardless of how long time it may take. You are stopping after you have caught n fish <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can see more fish that are tempting you.|$|E
6000|$|... "At four o'clock, then," [...] she said, [...] "you {{will come}} here and sit {{with me for a}} little time. Perhaps this <b>evening,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have nothing to do--" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you are rather {{disappointed}} in your <b>evening</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> expected to obtain {{some insight into}} our ideas," [...] said Mrs. Tarrant, {{with an air of}} impotent sympathy, to Mr. Gracie.|$|R
60|$|Sir LUCIUS Now, I'll {{leave you}} to fix your own time.--Take my advice, and you'll decide it this <b>evening</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can; {{then let the}} worst come of it, 'twill be off your mind to-morrow.|$|R
25|$|Other body systems {{affected}} by Lyme-like Disease. More common than EM are symptoms due to invasion by the spirochaete {{of the nervous}} system, heart, muscles and joints. These may start weeks or months after the tickbite. Initially, they may include flu-like illness, fever, headache, sore throat, fatigue, aching muscles and joints. More serious are meningitis, Bell's palsy (weakness of the face muscles), swelling of joints, and heart problems with palpitations and breathlessness. Lyme disease is difficult to distinguish from many other illnesses like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) because the symptoms may be similar. If you have symptoms that could be Lyme disease, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not remember a tickbite, see your doctor. Diagnosis is helped by a blood test called a Western Blot test, but your doctor will consider whether any other illness could be causing your symptoms and may do some other tests.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E
25|$|Along with Bob Simpson, {{he formed}} an opening {{partnership}} that {{was regarded as}} one of the finest in Test history. Lawry was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Lawry was known for his peculiar stance. He had little bend in his knees, and as a result batted with a stoop over his bat. He used his long reach to blunt spin bowling. He played with a very straight bat, combining well-organised defence with a somewhat limited range of strokes, marked by an efficiency of placement and an unusually heavy reliance on the hook shot. His strengths were regarded as his composure and intense concentration which powered a relentless single-mindedness. His defiant style was accentuated by his habit of tugging on his cap after every ball, as though starting afresh. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Lawry was also a left-hander during his winter baseball recreation, which equipped him with a powerful throwing arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] agreed Mr. Letts. [...] "Much more healthy than staying indoors all the <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{just wait}} while I have a wash {{and a bit}} o' {{something}} to eat I'll come with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Pamela {{answered}} quickly, [...] "I am Mr. Lutchester's guest this <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{are still}} here, I shall love {{to come and}} speak to aunt for a moment later on. If not, I will ring up to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame," [...] said I, {{with all}} the dignity and {{assurance}} I could command, [...] "the Emperor is defeating the English, and the French army will be here before <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have used me well you will be rewarded, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have denounced me you will be punished and your house will certainly be burned by the provost-martial." ...|$|R
500|$|On {{the first}} night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson {{introduced}} his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. Obama said she and her husband believe [...] "that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't know them, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't agree with them." [...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E
500|$|What Separates Me from You {{received}} generally favorable reviews. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic said, [...] " [...] is whiney, petulant, immature, hopeless, {{and thoroughly}} addicting, as the ten songs {{contained within the}} gatefold packaging [...] are as immaculately crafted and engaging as they are blindingly self-absorbed." [...] Brendan Manley from Alternative Press wrote, [...] "The vitriolic delivery seems sincere, but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don’t buy into all of the personal/emotional factors underpinning Separates (smack-talking the smack-talkers/a recent, devastating breakup/assorted perils of touring), the album simply kills." ...|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{has been}} quoted: [...] "Politics is like {{football}} for me. Labour is my team and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't like a striker you don't give up supporting the whole team. Labour is {{the lesser of}} two evils. What else should we have? Anarchy? Someone has to be responsible." [...] Prior to the 2005 general election, Gallagher stated that he was still supporting the Labour government partly because of his concern that [...] "Phil Collins is threatening to come back and live here. And let's face it, none of us want that".|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder, now, Mr. St. Clare, {{what the}} impudence of you men will come to!" [...] said Jane, tossing her pretty head 'til the ear-drops twinkled again. [...] "I shan't dance {{with you for}} a whole <b>evening,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go to asking me any more questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you is kin to de sister," [...] {{said the}} woman,--"an' I reckon you is, for I see de {{likeness}} powerful strong,--she'll be mighty {{glad to see}} ye, sah. Want me ter tell her ye'll come back this <b>evening,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> doan' fin' her before dat?" ...|$|R
50|$|In the <b>evening</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{want to go}} for a walk {{then you}} can walk up to a temple named roat Perumal koil as is near to the road. It is just 20 minutes by walk for the village. While walking you will find lot of {{tamarind}} trees.|$|R
500|$|In {{defending}} himself {{from what he}} believed was the elitism of his online critics, Idol admitted {{that he was still}} learning about computers, but compared it to the early punk ethic of simply trying your best as a musician, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had difficulty. He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer. [...] "I don't know much about computers, but I have the desire to learn and I have a computer and a modem, so I go for it. Banging my head sometimes, but continuing on." ...|$|E
500|$|Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters, gave a {{positive}} review, noting the various new storylines {{and how the}} characters, especially Veronica, handled this new set of events. [...] "Like most adolescents, Veronica understands and anticipates this mix, even if she doesn't always deal {{with it in the}} most effective way. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't want to pick sides, you're bound to be assessed as having done so. And once you're labeled—09er or not—you can either spend your time fighting rumors or finding alternative measures. Veronica, so precociously and brilliantly aware of alternatives, makes this familiar process seem worth pondering one more time." ...|$|E
500|$|Nintendo of America first {{documented}} {{the events that}} cause MissingNo. {{to appear in the}} May 1999 issue of Nintendo Power, with a warning that [...] "any contact with it (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't catch it) could easily erase your game file or disrupt your graphics". The glitch {{is the result of a}} succession of events: first, players watch an in-game tutorial for Pokémon capture. The player then uses a Pokémon with the Fly ability to reach the game's Cinnabar Island location, and then uses a Pokémon with the Surf ability to travel up and down the eastern [...] "shore" [...] of the island until a MissingNo. appears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meet me {{at eight}} o'clock this <b>evening,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, at the Ring on the Budmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The news upsets me almost. The girl {{seems to be in}} ignorance. Keep her so till I have seen you. M. H." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh, pooh, Fergus!" [...] he said, as {{the latter}} rose, [...] "there is no {{occasion}} for saluting in a bedroom. I am {{glad to see you}} looking so much better. You could not have looked more ghastly, when you came in yesterday <b>evening,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had been your own wraith.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Even</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> knew How this {{darkness}} soaks {{me through}} and through, [...] and infuses Unholy fear in my vapour, you would pause to dis- [...] tinguish What hurts, from what amuses.|$|R
500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E
500|$|Blake {{comments}} that Disraeli [...] "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further {{he wrote a}} discourse on political theory and a political biography, the Life of Lord George Bentinck, which is excellent... remarkably fair and accurate." [...] But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that {{there have always been}} two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, [...] "It is after all, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, {{no matter how much you}} deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one." ...|$|E
500|$|Schwarzman {{received}} a severe backlash from both {{critics of the}} private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity. [...] The lavish event which reminded many of the excesses of notorious executives including Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco International). [...] David Bonderman, the founder of TPG Capital remarked, [...] "We have all wanted to be private – at least until now. [...] When Steve Schwarzman's biography with all the dollar signs is posted {{on the web site}} none of us will like the furor that results – and that's <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like Rod Stewart." [...] As the IPO drew closer, there were moves by a number of congressman and senators to block the stock offering and to raise taxes on private equity firms and/or their partners—proposals many attributed in part to the extravagance of the party.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yours is a {{good rule}} and force is useful now and then," [...] Bernard observed. [...] "However, we came {{to take you to}} Dryholm. I was feeling dull, and the others have promised to help me through the <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can come, we will go on to Langrigg for Mrs. Winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{marked a}} fitting place even as I rode here this <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> cross {{the river and}} take the {{bridle-path}} through the fields which leads to Josselin you come midway upon a mighty oak standing {{at the corner of}} a fair and level meadow. There let us meet at midday to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the word}} [...] "officer" [...] the clerk had assumed a more respectful attitude. [...] "The collector-sahib went away {{yesterday}} {{to see what}} could be done and what supplies are needed; he will be back this <b>evening.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will follow me I will take you to the memsahib, who will see after you." ...|$|R
