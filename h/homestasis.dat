30|$|Autophagy is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved intracellular {{process which}} {{plays an important}} role in eliminating damaged organelles and long-live proteins for maintenance of cellular <b>homestasis</b> (Mizushima, 2009). During autophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes that are destined for fusion with lysosomes for content degradation. Under stress conditions such as starvation, autophagic acitivity is greatly augmented from its basal levels, providing recyclable resources that help maintain metabolism and ATP levels for cell survival (Rabinowitz and White, 2010). Recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in various physiologic and pathologic processes including cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolism, viral infections and immune response, etc. (Deretic, 2012; Levine and Deretic, 2007; Mihaylova and Shaw, 2011; Shintani and Klionsky, 2004; Yang et al., 2011).|$|E

RGMB was knocked down in breast cancer cells by way of an anti-RGMB ribozyme transgene. Knockdown of RGMB resulted in enhanced capacities of proliferation, adhesion, and migration in breast cancer cells. Further investigations demonstrated RGMB knockdown resulted in a reduced expression and activity of Caspase- 3, accompanied with better survival in RGMB knockdown cells under serum starvation, which might be induced by its repression on MAPK JNK pathway. Up-regulations of Snai 1, Twist, FAK, and Paxillin via enhanced Smad dependent sigaling led to increased capacities of adhesion and migration. Our current data firstly revealed that RGMB may act as a negative regulator in breast cancer through BMP signaling...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{function of}} autophagy conserved from yeast to mammals is mobilization of macromolecules {{during times of}} limited nutrient availability, permitting organisms to survive under starvation conditions. In yeast, autophagy is initiated following nitrogen or carbon deprivation, and autophagy mutants die rapidly under these conditions. Similarly, in mammals, autophagy is upregulated in most organs following initiation of starvation, and is critical for survival in the perinatal period following abrupt termination of the placental nutrient supply. The nutrient-sensing kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, coordinates cellular proliferation and growth with nutrient availability, {{at least in part}} by regulating protein synthesis and autophagy-mediated degradation. This review focusses on the regulation of autophagy by Tor, a mammalian target of rapamycin, and Ulk 1, a mammalian homolog of Atg 1, in response to changes in nutrient availability. Given the importance of mitochondria in maintaining bioenergetic <b>homestasis,</b> and potentially as a source of membrane for autophagosomes during starvation, possible roles for mitochondria in this process are also discussed.

40|$|Adipose {{tissue is}} a key {{regulator}} of energy <b>homestasis.</b> The amount of adipose tissue is largely determined by adipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis), {{a process that is}} regulated by the concerted actions of multiple transcription factors and cofactors. Based on in vitro studies in murine 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes and human primary preadipocytes, the transcriptional cofactor and acetyltransferase Tip 60 was recently identified as an essential adipogenic factor. We therefore investigated the role of Tip 60 on adipocyte differentiation and function, and possible consequences on energy homeostasis, in vivo. Because homozygous inactivation results in early embryonic lethality, Tip 60 +/ 2 mice were used. Heterozygous inactivation of Tip 60 had no effect on body weight, despite slightly higher food intake by Tip 60 +/ 2 mice. No major effects of heterozygous inactivation of Tip 60 were observed on adipose tissue and liver, and Tip 60 +/ 2 displayed normal glucose tolerance, both on a low fat and a high fat diet. While Tip 60 mRNA was reduced to 50 % in adipose tissue, the protein levels were unaltered, suggesting compensation by the intact allele. These findings indicate that the in vivo role of Tip 60 in adipocyte differentiation and function cannot be properly addressed in Tip 60 +/ 2 mice, but requires the generation of adipose tissue-specific knock out animals or specific knock-in mice...|$|E

Herein, we utilise ratiometric fluorescent pH-sensitive nanosensors with an extended dynamic pH range to measure the intracellular pH of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) during glucose metabolism in real-time. Ratiometric fluorescent pH-sensitive nanosensors consisting of a polyacrylamide nanoparticle matrix covalently linked to two pH-sensitive fluorophores, Oregon green (OG) and 5 (6) carboxyfluorescein (FAM), and a reference pH-insensitive fluorophore, 5 (6) carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), were synthesised. Nanosensors were functionalised with acrylamidopropyltrimethyl ammonium hydrochloride (ACTA) to confer a positive charge to the nanoparticle surfaces that facilitated nanosensor delivery to yeast cells, negating the need to use stress inducing techniques. The results showed that under glucose-starved conditions the intracellular pH of yeast population (n ≈ 200) was 4. 67 ± 0. 15. Upon addition of D-(+) -glucose (10 mM), this pH value decreased to pH 3. 86 ± 0. 13 over a period of 10 minutes followed by a gradual rise to a maximal pH of 5. 21 ± 0. 26, 25 minutes after glucose addition. 45 minutes after the addition of glucose, the intracellular pH of yeast cells returned to that of the glucose starved conditions. This study advances our understanding of the interplay between glucose metabolism and pH regulation in yeast cells, and indicates that the intracellular pH <b>homestasis</b> in yeast is highly regulated and demonstrates the utility of nanosensors for real-time intracellular pH measurements...|$|E

40|$|Protein ubiquitination is an {{evolutionary}} conserved mechanism that controls {{a wide variety}} of cellular functions. Polyubiquitinated proteins are generally degraded in the proteasome, whereas monoubiquitination controls various other cellular processes, including endocytosis and endosomal sorting. Termination of signaling by activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) largely occurs via their endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation, processes accompanied by receptor ubiquitination. Cbl family proteins are major ubiquitin ligases that promote RTK ubiquitination and downregulation. We showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors are monoubiquitinated at multiple sites following their ligand-induced activation and that a single ubiquitin is sufficient for both receptor internalization and degradation. Cbl also controls EGF receptor (EGFR) downregulation by binding to CIN 85, which recruits endophilins to EGFR/Cbl complexes. In the complex with activated EGFRs, Cbl directs monoubiquitination of CIN 85, and the entire complex is targeted for degradation in the lysosome. We propose that multiple monoubiquitination of activated receptors and associated protein complexes ensures proper receptor sorting towards the lysosome. Importantly, the functions of Cbl are also negatively controlled in order to maintain cellular <b>homestasis.</b> Sprouty 2 blocks EGFR downregulation by sequestering Cbl from activated EGFRs. We showed that Sprouty 2 also associates with CIN 85 and that this binding is required for efficient inhibition of EGFR ubiquitination and endocytosis. Cbl is also implicated in other aspects of RTK signaling, including organization of the actin cytoskeleton. We found that growth factor receptor signals promote lamellipodia formation in neuronal cells via a complex containing Cbl, the adaptor protein ArgBP 2 and Pyk 2. The lamellipodia formation required intact lipid rafts and the recruitment of Crk and PI(3) K to tyrosine phosphorylated Cbl. In conclusion, our findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} monoubiquitin signals in downregulation of RTKs and point at a role of Cbl in the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics...|$|E

By this mean, cellular Ca 21 <b>homestasis</b> is maintained so that minimal changes in total cell calcium and cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration occur during sustained Ca 2 +-mediated responses. Rather than a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, it is the localized cycling of Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane that is the critically important Ca 2 + messenger during the sustained phase of cellular responses mediated via surface receptors linked to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2). PIP 2 hydrolysis gives rise to inositol(1, 4, 5) trisphosphate (IP) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The IP 3 acts to release Ca 2 + from an intracellular pool, thereby causing a transient rise in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. This transient Ca 2 + signal activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinases transiently, and hence, causes the transient phosphorylation of a subset of cellular proteins that mediate the initial phase of the response. The DAG brings about the association of protein kinase C (PKC) with the plasma membrane where a receptor-mediated increase in Ca 2 + cycling across the membrane regulates PKC activity.

During WSSV infection, multiple cell signaling cascades are activated, leading to the generation of antiviral molecules and initiation of programmed cell death of the virus infected cells. To gain novel insight into cell signaling mechanisms employed in WSSV infection, we have used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to elucidate the cellular response to WSSV challenge at the gene level in red claw crayfish haematopoietic tissue (Hpt) stem cell cultures. Red claw crayfish Hpt cells were infected with WSSV for 1 h (L 1 library) and 12 h (L 12 library), respectively, after which the cell RNA was prepared for SSH using uninfected cells as drivers. By screening the L 1 and L 12 forward libraries, we have isolated the differentially expressed genes of crayfish Hpt cells upon WSSV infection. Among these genes, the level of many key molecules showed clearly up-regulated expression, including the genes involved in immune responses, cytoskeletal system, signal transduction molecules, stress, metabolism and <b>homestasis</b> related genes, and unknown genes in both L 1 and L 12 libraries. Importantly, of the 2123 clones screened, 176 novel genes were found the first time to be up-regulated in WSSV infection in crustaceans. To further confirm the up-regulation of differentially expressed genes, the semi-quantitative RT-PCR were performed to test twenty randomly selected genes, in which eight of the selected genes exhibited clear up-regulation upon WSSV infection in red claw crayfish Hpt cells, including DNA helicase B-like, multiprotein bridging factor 1, apoptosis-linked gene 2 and an unknown gene-L 1635 from L 1 library: coatomer gamma subunit, gabarap protein gene, tripartite motif-containing 32 and an unknown gene-L 12 - 254 from L 2 library, respectively.

40|$|Proinsulin C-peptide is {{depleted}} {{together with}} insulin in type I diabetic patients. The supplement of insulin to these patients {{is necessary for}} their survival, {{but it is also}} likely that the loss of C-peptide may contribute to both short- and long-term complications. In this thesis, molecular effects of C-peptide have been investigated. In particular, nuclear effects of C-peptide and C-peptide involved in oligomerization have been studied, as well as method development to facilitate further protein interaction analysis. C-peptide is a small peptide hormone with known membrane-binding properties that is thought to stimulate G-protein coupled receptor associated pathways. In this thesis we report that C-peptide not only acts extracellularly, but that it is internalized via specific mechanims and interacts with cytoskeletal proteins. We show that C-peptide is transferred to the nucleus, and specifically to the rRNA-synthesizing organelle nucleolus where it stimulates transcription of rDNA. Transcription of rDNA is related to a complex of proteins at the promoter region including histone 4 that gets acetylated upon interaction with C-peptide. We further link this transcriptional activity of C-peptide to proliferation in a model system relevant to the bone growth retardation observed in type I diabetic patients suffering from fractures. To understand more of C-peptide’s effects {{on the basis of the}} transcriptional activity observed, a genome analysis of proximal tubular cells isolated from type I diabetic rats was performed. It revealed that C-peptide within 2 hrs exerts tight effects on transcription with ~ 500 genes affected and the majority of them being repressed. This observation suggests that C-peptide treatment corrects malfunctioning pathways, especially pathways of circulatory and inflammatory diseases. We have also studied oligomerization of C-peptide, and find that C-peptide oligomers are disrupted by insulin in addition to a previous study reporting that C-peptide disrupts insulin hexamers. The C-peptide oligomers are formed via electrostatic interactions, and can further lead to aggregates with a high content of ß-sheets. In summary, this thesis provides data on C-peptide being an intracrine hormone with intracellular effects in addition to having extracellular activity via classical endocrinological pathways. We also discuss the implications of the C-peptide oligomers we observe, which provide evidence that C-peptide may act as an insulin chaperone. It is evident that a fine-balanced <b>homestasis</b> of C-peptide is necessary for optimal health in both type I and II diabetic patients...|$|E

The electrophysiologic observation helped to clarify the regulationmechanisms of the cell- cell channel (gap junctions) connected guinea pig hensencells, which are assumed to {{play a central role}} in inner ear ionic <b>homestasis.</b> The presented observations are performed by using the double whole - cell patch-clamp technique at fresh preperated guinea pig hensencells, since so far only dye coupling experiments are described. This electrophysiologic method is the gold standard looking at direct cell- cell coupling. Additional observed changes of the intracellular potassium concentration were recorded by FURA- 2 -fluoreszenzmicroscopy. For the first time it was possible to estimate the electrical conductance of cochlear gap junction in vitro. Channel abilities are shown to be variable and are therefore a indirect sign of the assumed heterogenic connexin architecture of cell- cell channels in the organ of corti and underline the limits of functional models (Xenopus laevis-oozyte, HeLa-cells) for the clarification of intercellular communication under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Free radicals play important role in important pathophysiologic conditions of the inner ear (e. g. noise induced hearing loss, aminoglycosid ototoxicity, presbyacusis [...] ). We looked at its influence on intercellular conductance. We observed a hydrogen peroxide concentration dependent decrease of intercellular coupling without any effect on the vitality of the hensencells. This effect modulates the intracellular calcium concentration. The pathophysiologic importance of hensencells for the cellular of presentation of aminoglycosid ototoxicity was shown. Perfusing of paired hensencells with pathophysiologic relevant concentrations of gentamicin showed a concentration dependend decrease of intercellular conductance. The addition of catalase, a specific radical scavenger, inhibits this effect. The underlying reaction of gentamycin ototoxicity is called fentons reaction. Formating a complex of gentamycin and iron generates free radicals. In a series of observations with deferoxamine, we were able to show that the gentamicin effect bases on a hydrogenperoxide generating reaction Since so far only the outer hair cells were proposed to be the main targets of gentamicin otototoxicity the present observations show an effect on non-sensory, glial cells, too. The clinical importance of this study for the ENT science bases on the fact that 50 % of all non-syndromal hearing losses are caused by connexin 26 (Cx 26) mutations. Cx 26 is the most important connexin which contributes to the formation of inner ear cell- cell channels. Disturbance of the physiologic intercellular conductance of the hensencells (e. g. potassium homoestasis, ep-generation [...] ) has a direct effect on hearing a can end in a irreversible hearing loss. Since the clinical pattern of hearing loss can be variable in the same form of mutation, the clarification of regulation mechanisms are of special pathophysiologic interest. Additional a second mutation is discussed, which was shown in different cases. In the present study this mutation (GJB 6 -D 13 S 1830) was shown in one out of 350 cases and is assumed to be epidemiologically irrelevant. The specific analysis of mutations showed in our population in contrast to all so far published mideuropean studies the M 34 T mutation as the most common. Usually the c 35 delG mutation is found to be the most frequent. We assume the highly preselection of our study population to be the cause of this finding. A specific analysis of connexin mutations showed a increased frequency in the subgroups of patients with otosclerosis and acoustic neuroma. Additional studies with larger subgroups should elucidate the correlation between this groups and specific moleculargenetic findings...|$|E
40|$|Clearly, the {{neurotoxic}} potential of NDL-PCBs {{has been associated}} with neurobehavioral effects, including changes in motor activity, learning, memory and attention, which have been associated with neurotransmitter systems. So far, much research has been focused on presynaptic mechanisms, such as neurotransmitter levels and calcium <b>homestasis.</b> However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on mechanistic information regarding postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. Endocrine toxicity of NDL-PCBs involves among others androgenic and estrogenic interactions, which have been related to sex-dependent behavior and morphological changes in gonads, adrenal glands and brain. However, there is a signifcant lack of information on how individual congeners interact with steroidogenic enzymes and endocrine receptors and their mechanism of action. Therefore, the main purpose of this thesis is to gain further insight in the neurotoxic and endocrine disruptive potential of these NDL-PCBs. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the potential neurotoxicity of NDL-PCBs and their effects on the postsynaptic human GABAA receptor. In 2005 the EFSA has identified six common NDL-PCBs which alone represent approximately 50 % of all NDL-PCBs present in food. However, due to the limited number of in vivo and in vitro studies performed with NDL-PCBs, risk characterization and assessment is hampered. Further, direct and acute effects of NDL-PCBs on specific neurotransmitter receptors had not been described uptil the beginning of this thesis. Therefore, in chapter 2 the effects of six common NDL-congeners on the GABAA receptor were investigated. Further, because human exposure is not restricted to single congeners, the effects of binary mixtures of NDL-PCBs on the GABAA receptor were also studied. The limited number of congeners studied in chapter 2 impaired the identification of a SAR of NDL-PCBs on the GABAA receptor. Therefore, the set of NDL-PCBs used in chapter 3 was enlarged, including an extra DL-congener as well. The choice of the used congeners was based on their chemical and physical properties, environmental abundance and toxicological activities. Further, the binary mixtures used in this chapter aimed at assessing the effects not only on potentiation, but also on activation of the receptor. Experimental in vivo results have described sex dependent endocrine disruptive potential of NDL-PCBs. Further, the effects were apparently dependent on the time of exposure. However, many of these studies were performed with (reconstituted) mixtures and the purity of the used NDL-congeners was not always assured. Taken together, the endocrine disruptive effects seen could partially be attributed to the presence of DL-PCBs, known to interfere with the steroidogenic pathway and showing endocrine and reproductive disruptive potential. The brain, adrenals and gonads constitute an important axis in maintaining sex steroid homeostasis and regulating steroidogenesis during perinatal development and adult life. In chapter 4 the effects of perinatal exposure to two commonly found NDL-PCBs on aromatase activity on gonadal and adrenal microsomes at various life-stages were investigated. Moreover, gene expression of aromatase and sex steroid receptor expression in adult rat brain were also assessed. Traditional risk assessment of potential endocrine-disruptive pollutants, including PCBs, focus mainly on the effects of parent compounds. Still, biotransformation results in systemic exposure to PCBs and their bioactive metabolites. In chapter 5, a more mechanistic approach of the effects of twenty NDLPCBs was taken by studying aromatase activity in human placental microsomes and in the H 295 R cell line. In addition, the interaction of twenty NDL-PCBs with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was studied in a recently developed yeast-based glucocorticoid receptor assay. Because high levels of OH-PCBs and MeSO 2 -PCBs can also be found in human samples, these were studied in these assays as well. Taken together, the data described in this thesis show the potential neuroendocrine effects of NDL-PCBs and their metabolites. Further, perinatal PCB exposure appears to cause persistent neuroendocrine developmental effects that can be detected in adults.

40|$|Amino acids have central {{roles in}} every living {{organism}} as structural units for proteins, metabolic precursors, osmolytes and signaling molecules. In some heterotrophic organisms, such as humans and mice, some amino acids cannot be synthesized de novo through other metabolic pathways {{and need to}} be constantly provided from the diet. This important evolutionary constraint led to the important classification of the 20 known proteinogenic amino acids into nutritionally essential and non-essential ones. In order to achieve all their biological functions, amino acids need to cross cell membranes and because of their chemical partial charges they cannot freely diffuse across the lipid bilayer. To overcome this hurdle, cell membranes are endowed with transmembrane carrier proteins called amino acid transporters. In (re) absorptive epithelia, cells are in a differentiated state with an apical membrane, which is facing an organ-specific lumen, and a basolateral membrane, which is in contact with the extracellular matrix and the blood vessels. In contrast to the apical transport, the mechanism of amino acid transport across the basolateral membrane still remains elusive. The best characterized basolateral amino acid transporters in the small intestine and kidney, i. e. y+LAT 1 - 4 F 2 hc (Slc 7 a 7 -Slc 3 a 2) and LAT 2 - 4 F 2 hc (Slc 7 a 8 -Slc 3 a 2), are obligatory antiporters and therefore cannot mediate alone the net vectorial amino acid efflux. In order to achieve this task, additional amino acid transporters capable of transporting amino acids unidirectionally, such as the uniporters TAT 1 (Slc 16 a 10) and/or LAT 4 (Slc 43 a 2), need to be present. TAT 1 transports aromatic amino acids and has been recently shown to be important in the regulation of amino acid <b>homestasis</b> in vivo. On the other hand, LAT 4 has been shown to transport branched-chain amino acids, phenylalanine and methionine, but information about its potential role in vivo is still missing. Therefore, with the present work we aimed at providing new information about the physiological role of this transporter by characterizing a newly established constitutive Slc 43 a 2 -/- knock-out mouse. The Slc 43 a 2 -/- mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and without any phenotypic difference compared with wild type littermates but showed an early severe phenotype with malnutrition, altered glucose homeostasis, altered hepatic gene expression and premature death. Moreover, by using these Lat 4 -deficient mice as negative control, we gathered new information about the localization of Lat 4 in kidney, small intestine, liver and skeletal muscle. Specifically, we observed a major expression of Lat 4 in the basolateral membrane of kidney proximal tubule, thick ascending limb and a minor expression in the distal convoluted tubule. In the small intestine, Lat 4 expression was confined to the basolateral membrane of enterocytes with no expression in the intestinal crypts. On the other hand, skeletal muscle and liver did not show any Lat 4 expression. In addition to the aforementioned work in vivo, we aimed at deepening the understanding of LAT 4 regulation and cooperation in the MDCK cell model. We therefore reconstituted the essential machinery for neutral amino acid transport and validated its function with uptake of radiolabeled amino acids. Moreover, using the Xenopus laevis oocytes expression system we addressed the effect of a predicted serine phosphorylation site on LAT 4 function. In both in vitro systems, we provided preliminary information indicating that this phosphorylation downregulates LAT 4 function by cellular mechanisms that still need to be investigated in more details. In conclusions, the major achievements of the present thesis consist in the first characterization of a newly generated constitutive Slc 43 a 2 -/-knock-out mouse with which we demonstrated that Lat 4 is essential for early postnatal development. Moreover, findings obtained using the MDCK cell model and the Xenopus laevis oocytes expression system provided new preliminary information about a potential functional regulation of LAT 4 by phosphorylation...|$|E
