Performing such functions by the metropolis requires highly qualified staff and causes that concentration of human capital (measured by the share of employees with higher educational level) in the metropolis should be higher than {{in other areas of the}} region. Such thesis was proposed with reference to the Lodz metropolis. Its positive verification enables a statement that human capital concentration is in Lodz definitely higher than throughout the whole region (more than 50 %). The article also attempts to point out certain consequences of this fact: the main conclusion is that productivity of human capital is lower in Lodz metropolis than in the whole region (also in case of particular sectors of its economy) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{mathematical}} model to associate key operational, managerial and design characteristics of a system with the system's susceptibility towards common cause failure (CCF) events. The model, {{referred to as the}} geometric scaling (GS) model, is a mathematical form that allows us to investigate the effect of possible system modifications on risk. As such, the presented methodology results in a CCF model with a strong <b>decision-making</b> <b>character.</b> Based on a Bayesian framework, the GS model allows for the representation of epistemic uncertainty, the update of prior uncertainty in the light of operational data and the coherent use of observations coming from different systems. From a CCF perspective these are particularly useful model features, because CCF events are rare; hence, the operational data available is sparse and is characterised by considerable uncertainty, with databases typically containing events from nominally identical systems from different plants. The GS model also possesses an attractive modelling feature because it significantly decreases the amount of information elicited from experts required for quantification...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Sportsmanship and the {{development}} of positive character have long been explicit goals of school sports. A strong belief exists that sport programs have the power to promote {{the development}} of sportsmanlike behaviors, ethical decision-making skills, and a total curriculum for moral character development " (Stoll, 1995, p. 335) and provide a social environment to acquire personal and social values and behaviors contributing to good character and good citizenship (Arnold, 1984; Sage, 1998). The arena of sport can provide one of "the greatest opportunities for a student to learn honesty, integrity [...] . and ethical behavior " or it can provide "one of the greatest opportunities in school for a youngster to learn how to be dishonest [...] . or how to be hypocritical" (Sabock, 1985, p. 271). Little empirical research exists supporting that mere participation in and of itself leads to the development of moral character. In fact, the opposite appears true, that sport participation {{may be more likely to}} negatively affect moral character (Bredemeier, 1984; Priest, Krause, & Beach, 1999; Stoll & Beller, 2000). Whether positive or negative, "[s]ports have immense power to shape consciousness, values, and beliefs of athletes and to pass on selected aspects of the dominant culture " (Sage, 1998, p. 264). This digest discusses the formal and informal processes of moral character development, in light of the types of programs that have shown to improve moral character, sportsmanship, and fair play.

40|$|Successful {{behavior}} requires actively acquiring and representing {{information about}} the environment and people, and manipulating and using those acquired representations flexibly to optimally act in and on the world. The frontal lobes have figured prominently in most accounts of flexible or goal-directed behavior, as evidenced by often-reported behavioral inflexibility in individuals with frontal lobe dysfunction. Here, we propose that the hippocampus also plays a critical role by forming and reconstructing relational memory representations that underlie flexible cognition and social behavior. There is mounting evidence that damage to the hippocampus can produce inflexible and maladaptive behavior when such behavior places high demands on the generation, recombination, and flexible use of information. This is seen in abilities as diverse as memory, navigation, exploration, imagination, creativity, <b>decision-making,</b> <b>character</b> judgments, establishing and maintaining social bonds, empathy, social discourse, and language use. Thus, the hippocampus, together with its extensive interconnections with other neural systems, supports the flexible use of information in general. Further, we suggest that this understanding has important clinical implications. Hippocampal abnormalities can produce profound deficits in real-world situations, which typically place high demands on the flexible use of information, but are not always obvious on diagnostic tools tuned to frontal lobe function. This review documents {{the role of the}} hippocampus in supporting flexible representations and aims to expand our understanding of the dynamic networks that operate as we move through and create meaning of our world...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} claims of {{cultural}} theory using the formation of climate change policies in Sweden, the United States and Japan as case studies. Cultural theory is frequently employed by social scientists to explain various aspects of human behavior. The theory posits that any social group consists of three main cultural types: the egalitarian, the market-oriented, and the hierarchical. Though all groups contain elements of each, one cultural type usually predominates, giving the group its unique <b>decision-making</b> <b>character.</b> In the egalitarian group, for example, decision-making is based on broad consensus of the group, and decisions are aimed at providing equal benefits to all members. In a market culture, by contrast, the primary focus is on maximizing benefits to the individual. Decisions are often made based on market principles (i. e., relative prices). In a hierarchy-dominant society, decision-making is highly centralized, with a few powerful bodies making decisions for the entire society. This type of group tends to be very bureaucratic, {{with a great deal}} of emphasis on administrative procedure. This paper applies cultural theory at the national level and tests to what extent the theory is able to project how countries will respond in addressing the issue of global warming. For the purposes of this study, Sweden best represents the egalitarian-dominant culture; the United States best exemplifies market-dominant culture, and Japan is the most appropriate example of a culture dominated by hierarchical elements. To test the theory, the following five questions are asked: (1) What does the theory predict about how countries will view their role in a global commons problem? (2) What does the theory predict about the nature of the policy-making process within each society? (3) What does the theory predict about each country's likely choice of policy instruments? (4) What does the theory predict about the speed of policy-making and implementation? (5) What does the theory predict about how countries will view the role of technology in solving environmental problems? And if there is a role, where does the drive to innovate originate? The paper then describes the development of global climate change policies in each of the three countries, including a discussion of the motivations that led each country to act on the issue. Finally, it analyzes to what extent actual events in the three countries corresponded to the theory's predictions. The theory was strongest in predicting the nature of the policy-making process and weakest in predicting the choice of policy instruments. In spite of its limitations, cultural theory suggests the importance of cultural influences in the policy-making process. Because it helps us to understand how different types of societies arrive at decisions regarding matters of international concern, moreover, the theory could prove extremely useful to those involved in developing international agreements, enabling them to formulate an agreement which is compatible with various types of societies...|$|E
40|$|It is the {{objective}} of this study to analyze the methodologies used for the evaluation of alternative projects in the environmental planning procedure. There are many methodologies used for evaluation of a project or alternative actions such as financial analysis, cost effectiveness analysis, cost benefit analysis and multicriteria analysis. The main methodologies that are being considered in this study are cost benefit analysis and multicriteria analysis. They are two basic methodologies which facilitate the decision-making procedure especially in cases where many criteria should be taken into account in the <b>decision-making</b> model. The <b>character</b> of data being worked out by each methodology differs. Cost benefit analysis is a monetary based technique and all variables should have a monetary value while multicriteria analysis is a non-monetary technique and it can incorporate qualitative variables. The advantages and disadvantages of each methodology are being discussed in the study in order to find a methodology suitable for evaluating alternative actions under the sustainability concept. © 2007 WIT Press...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Appraisal of administrators' {{management}} culture {{influence on their}} relationship with subordinates. Methods Questionnaire of administrators and lecturers in 4 higher educational institutions of Novosibirsk city. Results In the course of questionnaire, administrators and lecturers {{were found to have}} a combined set of managerial and academic values. Diagnosing by self-appraisal shows that the majority of administrators possess average level of professional and managerial competencies. Ascending democratic management model is not characteristic of modern Russian higher educational institutions. The combined cooperation system which unites ascending and descending managerial communications is welcomed by administrators. The construction of this system is hindered by authoritarian senior management, low collective nature of <b>decision-making</b> and specific <b>character</b> of teaching as a job. High level of uncertainty in the future of their institutions as well in the possibility of their progressive development in the current educational system is characteristic of both the lecturers and administrators.

The character is turning around {{to walk in}} the user-requested travel direction, depicted by the red arrow on the ground. In this paper, we present an example-based motion synthesis technique that generates continuous streams of high-fidelity, controllable motion for interactive applications, such as video games. Our method uses a new data structure called a parametric motion graph to describe valid ways of generating linear blend transitions between motion clips dynamically generated through parametric synthesis in realtime. Our system specifically uses blending-based parametric synthesis to accurately generate any motion clip from an entire space of motions by blending together examples from that space. The key to our technique is using sampling methods to identify and represent good transitions between these spaces of motion parameterized by a continuously valued parameter. This approach allows parametric motion graphs to be constructed with little user effort. Because parametric motion graphs organize all motions of a particular type, such as reaching to different locations on a shelf, using a single, parameterized graph node, they are highly structured, facilitating fast <b>decision-making</b> for interactive <b>character</b> control. We have successfully created interactive characters that perform sequences of requested actions, such as cartwheeling or punching...|$|R
40|$|The Proprioceptive Diagnosis of Temperament and Character (DP-TC) test (Tous, 2008), which assesses {{fine motor}} {{performance}} without vision of one's own body, was used {{together with a}} verbal personality test (Durán, García, García, & Martínez, 2001) to examine personality differences between a group of gun licence (GL) applicants and a group {{from the general population}} (GP). MANOVA results showed significant differences between the groups on the DP-TC test, with the GL group scoring higher on Emotionality (Temperament) and Impulsivity (Temperament and Character) and lower on <b>Decision-Making</b> (Temperament and <b>Character)</b> and Mood (Temperament). In the GL group, fine motor performance on the DP-TC test was compared with the verbal test results by means of a principal components analysis with varimax rotation. The results corresponding to the Temperament dimensions of the DP-TC test showed only one association with the verbal test variables, thus corroborating the notion that Temperament has little social influence. Comparison of the proprioceptive and verbal tests showed that the results on the Emotionality scale of the DP-TC were consistent with those on the Ego-strength scale of the verbal personality test, but not with Neuroticism; this suggests that these subjects might fake their replies in order to obtain the gun licence...|$|R
40|$|At {{performing}} high-quality {{nursing care}} for {{clients in the}} urgent reception ward, the nurse must have sufficient expert knowledge and experience. Nurses of the urgent reception ward meet clients whose health condition has abruptly changed. The health condition of such clients develops sometimes very dramatically and not only the nurses expert knowledge and skills but also the communication and organizational capabilities matter. Communication in nursing process is perceived {{not only as a}} means to create interpersonal relations but it constitutes also an important element improving the quality of nursing care. That is why the treatment of the client and the clients family members must be adapted so that efficient and effective cooperation is achieved. When providing nursing care to such clients, high psychical and physical demands are put on the nurse and they can even lead to the burnout syndrome. The goal of this Thesis was to process the issue and particularities of work of the nurses working in the urgent reception ward. Before starting the study, we set the following research question: "What particularities does the work of general nurses in urgent reception wards have? The question was answered in the research part of the Bachelor Thesis, with the help of qualitative form of research investigation by the method of semi-standardized interview. The interview consists of 31 questions. The interviews were anonymous and they were conducted in the urgent reception ward in the Teaching Hospitals of Motol and Plzeň with eight nurses who work there. Case studies were processed on the base of the collected data and subsequently, categorization charts with the most important data obtained by the research were created on the base of the case studies. We confirmed, by our research investigation and by meeting the goal of our research, that the work of nurses in the urgent reception ward is highly demanding both professionally and psychically. The nurse of the urgent reception ward is required to assess and evaluate quickly the clients condition and to respond to it adequately within a very short time. It was found out by the research that the nurses working in the urgent reception ward perceive particularly the overcoming of communication barriers in communication with the client and with the client's family and the reduced prestige of nursing profession as negative aspects with impact on their work. The basic particularities of the work of nurses in the urgent reception ward include quick <b>decision-making,</b> demanding <b>character</b> of urgent situations, psychical and physical burden and communication with the client and the clients family...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{significance}} of the changing nature of the good character requirement for law society admission in Canada. It posits that good character has shifted from a philosophical concept into a psychological concept, with evidence of past bad acts claimed to be relevant for whether an applicant represents a future risk to the public. This shifting conception of character has, however, been only partial, and the decision-making processes of Canadian law societies have not kept pace with it. Instead, the <b>decision-making</b> process defines <b>character</b> generally and generically, with only occasional emphasis on character as a relevant predictor of future behaviour. In addition, law societies only rarely employ psychological evidence in their decision-making processes, and when they do employ such evidence seem uncertain as to its relevance and utility. The paper examines whether law societies should embrace a more overt recognition of character as a psychological concept. It reviews how psychological evidence is used in the context of determinations of custody and dangerousness, and the success (or, as it turns out, the failure) of psychological evidence as an aid to fair and accurate decision-making in those circumstances. In the end, the paper concludes that while treating good character as a psychological standard {{is the only way to}} make the requirement logical and justifiable in light of the purposes it is said to fulfill, the employment of a psychological standard is fraught with difficulty. There is, in the end, no reason to believe that a psychology based approach will lead to more coherent and fair decision-making. Given that, and given the significant issues with a non-psychological concept of character, the case for retaining a good character requirement for bar admission is weak...|$|R
40|$|The {{special concern}} {{of this paper}} is to recalibrate the {{benefits}} and burdens of public-private partnerships as they remake inner city neighborhoods, by braking the rate at which urban land is being reclaimed from low-wealth residents by local government practices to disperse occupants, sweeping aside their tangible and intangible capital. Public oversight requirements have not kept pace with the dispossession, yet the costs that these development decisions impose on the social fabric of communities rend the shared networks necessary to residents’ abilities to meet basic social needs. This destruction of low-wealth communities is a form of equity-stripping, produced by local government policies to deploy land use powers and sink public subsidy into for-profit redevelopments that cater to wealthier in-movers. This paper explores community-based equity shareholding in public/private redevelopment projects. Community Equity Shares (CES) embody three principles. First, community equity shareholding recognizes limited rights in an existing community, akin to land ownership, as the basis for both participation in the <b>decision-making</b> about the <b>character</b> of the redevelopment, and profit participation in the redevelopment projects that displace long-term residents. Second, by instantiating social and geographic community as ownership in the calculus of land-use, it is possible for residents in the district of a proposed redevelopment to parlay those shares for two purposes: for participation in the decision-making about proposed redevelopment, and for participation in the profits from the displacing redevelopment project. The third principle is the addition of a player, the special-purpose Community Equity Corporation, comprised of all the community equity shareholders and wielding their limited powers in common, as participants in the redevelopment deal-making that, otherwise unchecked, would impose undue burdens including displacement upon the long-term residents of the targeted district. Community Equity Shareholding can be effectuated through changes in local governments’ redevelopment and procurement procedures, to more equitably adjust the calculus when government uses or threatens to use its land use powers to displace low-income communities as it re-engineers urban environs in concert with private developers...|$|R
