40|$|Background: The spleen is {{important}} for many hematopoietic and immunological functions, namely hemodynamic compensation during hemorrhagic shock, with {{a crucial role in}} the compensation of hypovolaemia, on restoring blood volume in situations of acute haemorrhage. Also, the administration of physiological solutions is of great importance for the correction of circulating volume, avoiding the complications of hypovolaemia. Objectives: To evaluate spleen’s histopathological changes in pigs associated with volume replacement using two different physiologic solutions, after acute bleeding. Methods: 31 Large White pigs under general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. A total of 25 ml/kg of blood was passively removed during 20 minutes. Intravascular volume was replaced using Ringer Lactate 25 ml/kg (Group 1 - thirteen pigs) and HES 130 / 0. 4 20 ml/kg (Group 2 - eleven pigs). Spleen samples were processed for routine hystologic evaluation. Congestion, inflammatory infiltrate, ellipsoids enlargement and <b>follicular</b> lymphoid <b>hyperplasia</b> were evaluated in a semi-quantitative score. Results: <b>Follicular</b> lymphoid <b>hyperplasia</b> was exacerbated in group 1 (84. 6 %; grade III), when comparing with group 2 (36. 4 %; grade III).

40|$|A {{comparison}} between neoplastic and nonneoplastic lymphoid cell nuclei within germinal centers of nodular lymphomas and of reactive <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> {{has been carried}} out {{with the help of a}} semiautomated image analyzer by measuring nuclear area, by assessing the presence or absence of invaginations, and by defining the form of the invagination. Nuclear areas are larger in lymphomas, where the invagination, if present, decreases in depth and increases in angle as the value of nuclear area becomes greater. Nuclei with such a large area and shallow invaginations are not present within the nonneoplastic germinal centers. Moreover, no correspondence has been found between neoplastic and nonneoplastic nuclei with regard to the form of the invagination, that is, its symmetry and angle. Therefore, it is possible to argue that the neoplastic nuclei in nodular lymphomas are different from the nuclei found in the sequential pathway of reactive germinal centers...|$|R

RESULTS: In all cases, the pattern of LC 3 A reactivity was uniformly diffuse cytoplasmic, but expressed more frequently in FLs (68. 8 %) than in DLBCLs (41 %) (p= 0. 02), and much more commonly in DLBCLs than in reactive lymph nodes (24. 3 %) (p 10 % of lymphoid cells (high reactivity) {{were associated with the}} hypoxia-related protein HIF 1 α and the enzyme of anaerobic metabolism lactate dehydrogenase LDH 5 (p= 0. 004 and p= 0. 003, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: LC 3 A expression in FLs is hypoxia-induced, whereas its expression in DLBCLs may be regulated by other molecular mechanisms.

40|$|Background: Galectin- 3 (Gal- 3) is an {{anti-apoptotic}} molecule {{involved in}} thyroid cells transformation. It is specifically overexpressed in thyroid tumour cells {{and is currently}} used as a preoperative diagnostic marker of thyroid malignancy. Gal- 3 expression is downregulated by wt-p 53 at the transcriptional level. In well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTCs) there is an unexplained paradoxical concomitant expression of Gal- 3 and wt-p 53. HIPK 2 is a co-regulator of different transcription factors, and modulates basic cellular processes mainly through the activation of wt-p 53. Since we demonstrated that HIPK 2 is involved in p 53 -mediated Gal- 3 downregulation, we asked whether HIPK 2 deficiency might be responsible for such paradoxical Gal- 3 overexpression in WDTC. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed HIPK 2 protein and mRNA levels, as well as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the HIPK 2 locus (7 q 32 - 34), in thyroid tissue samples. HIPK 2 protein levels were high in all <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (FHs) analyzed. Conversely, HIPK 2 was undetectable in 91. 7 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and in 60. 0 % of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs).

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} receptor- 2 (FGFR- 2) plays an {{important}} role in tumorigenesis. In thyroid cancer it has been observed a FGFR- 2 down-modulation, but the role of this receptor has not been yet clarified. Therefore, we decided to examine the expression of both FGFR- 2 isoform, FGFR- 2 -IIIb and FGFR- 2 -IIIc, in different histological thyroid variants such as <b>hyperplasia,</b> <b>follicular</b> adenoma and papillary carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative Real-Time PCR analyses were performed on samples of <b>hyperplasia,</b> <b>follicular</b> adenoma and papillary carcinoma, compared with normal thyroid tissue. Thyroid hyperplasia did not show statistically significant reduction in FGFR- 2 protein and mRNA levels. Interestingly, in both follicular adenoma and papillary carcinoma samples we observed a strongly reduced expression of both FGFR- 2 isoforms. We speculate that FGFR- 2 down-modulation might be an early event in thyroid carcinogenesis.

Previously, we detected LOH at 7 q 21 in all FTCs examined, indicating that loss of genetic material in that region is a common trait in these lesions. To analyse the effects of LOH on gene expression, we performed {{an analysis of the}} mRNA expression levels of six different genes, located at 7 q 21. 1 - 7 q 21. 3. A total of 23 lesions, including eight <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (FHs), eight <b>follicular</b> adenomas (FAs), two FTCs and five papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) were analysed. The Frizzled- 1 (FZD- 1) gene, located at 7 q 21. 13, showed the lowest levels of mRNA expression. Down-regulation of FZD- 1 expression was also confirmed in an independent series of 69 follicular neoplastic lesions compared to 25 PTCs, analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. In vitro studies showed that FZD- 1 expression was also markedly reduced at both protein and mRNA levels in three FTC-derived cell lines (FRO, WRO and FTC- 133), while it was normal in the three PTC-derived cell lines (Ca 300, Ca 301 and K 1) examined. We demonstrated that over-expression of FZD- 1 in 3 FTC-derived cells decreased invasiveness and proliferation rate, indicating a possible pathogenetic role. In addition, FZD- 1 RNA interference in the PTC-derived cell line K 1 increased invasiveness. Our data indicated that FZD- 1 is involved in growth of follicular tumours and may be considered as a novel marker of this type of tumour.

The percentage of parenchyma was measured morphometrically. The degree of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> was classified into 5 grades. The densities of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes were classified into 5 grades. The remission of myasthenia gravis after thymectomy was examined with those variables in each part of the thymus. ResultsThe middle part had the highest percentage of parenchyma, the highest grade of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> and the highest density of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes among the 3 parts (P <. 001 -. 05). The grades of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> in the middle and lower parts were significantly higher in patients with improvement of myasthenia gravis than in those without (P <. 05).

Histologic skin lesions in the seals were similar and consisted of epidermal and <b>follicular</b> epithelial <b>hyperplasia,</b> hyperkeratosis, degeneration, and ne-crosis. The most distinctive finding was extensive syncytial zones bounded superficially by hyperkeratosis and deeply by hyperplastic basal cells. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were present in epithelial cells. Morbilliviral antigen was demonstrated in the skin lesions by immunohistochemistry.
