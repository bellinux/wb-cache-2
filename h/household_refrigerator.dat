40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, the refrigeration industry {{is facing the}} challenge of developing more efficient and environmental friendly refrigerators. Environmentally harmful refrigerants, CFC’s and HCFC’s, have already been shifted toward environmental friendly refrigerants such as HFC’s and hydro carbons. However HFC’s have a significant global warming potential. Accordingly, new policies have taken effect which are forcing the refrigerator industry to develop refrigerators that will reduce energy consumption and refrigerant emissions to reduce energy bills and the global warming effects of refrigerators. This study presents the research conducted on the condenser improvement {{of one of the}} commercially available <b>household</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and designing and applying a so-called Alternating evaporator duty cycle (AED) with a two step capacity modulated compressor.

50|$|Secop GmbH (formerly {{known as}} Danfoss Compressors GmbH) is a {{manufacturer}} of hermetic compressors for cooling circuits. Secop designs, develops, manufactures and distributes compressors for three application ranges: <b>household</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and freezers, small commercial refrigeration systems and cooling solutions for the mobile area (12/24/48 volt DC compressors).According to the manufacturer, the compressors are characterized by low energy consumption, low noise emission and environmental friendliness due {{to the use of}} CFC-free refrigerants.|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{standard}} style of compressor refrigeration used in normal <b>household</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and freezers, there are {{technologies such as}} absorption refrigeration and magnetic refrigeration.

50|$|A {{military}} coup in 1930 {{resulted in the}} contract's rescission, prompting di Tella to convert his new factory south of Buenos Aires into the manufacture of industrial machinery and home appliances (particularly refrigerators), becoming the largest, domestically-based industrial conglomerate in Latin America. The firm established a facility making commercial freezers under license from Westinghouse in 1935, and their trademark <b>household</b> <b>refrigerator</b> unit in 1948. Advertised as la reina del frío ("The Queen of Cold"), these became popular among Argentine consumers and their production expanded from 11,000 units annually in 1948 to 70,000 by 1958.

50|$|The 3600 {{was roughly}} the size of a <b>household</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> This was partly due {{to the size of the}} {{processor}} — the cards were widely spaced to allow wire-wrap prototype cards to fit without interference — and partly due to the limitations of the disk drive technology in the early 1980s. At the 3600's introduction, the smallest disk that could support the ZetaLisp software was 14 inches (356 mm) across (most 3600s shipped with the 10½-inch Fujitsu Eagle). The 3670 and 3675 were slightly shorter in height, but were essentially the same machine packed a little tighter. The advent of 8 in, and later 5+1/4 in, disk drives that could hold hundreds of megabytes led to the introduction of the 3640 and 3645, which were {{roughly the size}} of a two-drawer file cabinet.|$|E
