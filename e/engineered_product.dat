5000|$|He {{strongly}} champions {{high quality}} peer reviewed journal publications (as {{his time as}} Associate Dean demonstrated), but he also champions generating impact from research. Leighton strongly believes that if a technology is to help many people, {{it has to be}} deployed in sufficient numbers, and be sufficiently easy to use (no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science). That cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers, or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit R&D funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse <b>engineered</b> <b>product</b> that was not priced to recoup R&D investment. Therefore, whilst he places high value on quality journal publications, these must form part of a publication strategy. With the exception of NAMRIP (see below), Leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changers, because he believes that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is, in much of research, a route to only incremental advances: ...We need to work with rigour, imagination, and wonder, unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names, or the history of projects in which we have previously worked, or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners, or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem. Then, when we eventually do find a solution, we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others, and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us.|$|E

The first prototypes have used the Hatley & Pirbhai Transformation Schema, and have been built using Ada. A case study is described. The research shows that a prototype based on Hatley & Pirbhai's requirementModel would require a significant structural overhead, mainly because of the model 'execution' assumptions. Also Ada is an appropriate language to use, mainly because the tasking overhead is too great, but also because the communications model differs from Hatley & Pirbhai's model.
