On July 8 833, Gregory wrote to the bishops of “Gaul, Europe and Germany” declaring that Aldric <b>had</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> appeal to the pope, and that until the pope had issued a judgement {{one way or the}} other, no-one could pass a sentence against him. Further, that this mandate had to be obeyed in order to remain in communion with the Roman church. The letter together with the restoration of Louis allowed Aldric to remain in his see for some time.|$|E

500|$|In his 1978 {{biography}} of Victor Trumper, Fingleton accused Bradman of relating Woodfull's {{words to the}} press. Fingleton claimed that Claude Corbett revealed the information to him. In Fingleton's version of events, Bradman telephoned Corbett during the night to arrange a meeting. Bradman wrote for Corbett's paper, Sydney's Sun. Sitting in Corbett's car, Bradman told the journalist about the Warner–Woodfull incident. Corbett considered the story too important to keep to himself, so shared it with other journalists. Fingleton later added that [...] "Bradman would have saved {{me a lot of}} backlash... had he admitted that he had given the leak.

500|$|In 1844, Karl Ernst Claus, a Russian {{scientist}} of Baltic German descent, {{showed that}} the compounds prepared by Gottfried Osann contained small amounts of ruthenium, which Claus had discovered the same year. Claus isolated ruthenium from the platinum residues of rouble production while he was working in Kazan University, Kazan, the same way its heavier congener osmium had been discovered four decades earlier. Claus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained 6grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in aqua regia. Choosing the name for the new element, Claus stated: [...] "I named the new body, in honour of my Motherland, ruthenium.

500|$|An {{indefinite}} postponement {{of action}} over Berlin was unacceptable to Khrushchev {{if for no}} other reason than that East Germany was suffering a continuous [...] "brain drain" [...] as highly educated East Germans fled west through Berlin. While the boundary between the two German states had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen and United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman J. William Fulbright that East Germany <b>had</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> close its borders, which were not disavowed by the Kennedy Administration, Khrushchev authorized East German leader Walter Ulbricht to begin construction of what became known as the Berlin Wall, which would surround West Berlin. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states. That treaty would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to German reunification.|$|E

500|$|A major legal {{debate that}} {{was at the center of}} the Iran–Contra affair {{concerned}} the question of whether the NSC was one of the [...] "any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities" [...] covered by the Boland amendment with the Reagan administration arguing it was not, and many in Congress arguing it was. The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland amendment, through the amendment did not mention the NSC by name. More broadly was the constitutional question at stake, namely the power of Congress vs. the power of the presidency. The Reagan administration argued that because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive arm that its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland amendments. By contrast congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget, and Congress <b>had</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> use that power not to fund projects like attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua that they disapproved of. As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment, the NSC established [...] "the Enterprise", an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer Richard Secord that supplied arms to the Contras that was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC. To fund [...] "the Enterprise", the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government as not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment, though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment. [...] Ironically, military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.|$|E

2500|$|Christine Ladd, {{sometimes}} {{known by}} her nickname [...] "Kitty," [...] {{was born on}} December 1, 1847 in Windsor, Connecticut to Eliphalet Ladd, a merchant, and Augusta Niles Ladd.

In 1853 the family moved back to Windsor, Connecticut where her sister Jane Augusta Ladd McCordia was born the following year. Throughout her childhood, Ladd's mother and aunt, Juliet Niles, often chose to bring the young Christine with them to numerous women's rights lectures and suffrage meetings because both were incredibly passionate supporters of women's rights. Augusta Ladd believed that women <b>had</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be in the same positions that were held by men and [...] "belonged every place where a man should be."

2500|$|Napster {{also argued}} that the record {{companies}} waived their rights to copyright protection because they [...] "hastened" [...] the spread of MP3s on the web and had their own plans {{to get into the}} digital market. Rejecting this argument, Judge Patel wrote, [...] "This limited evidence fails to convince the court that the record companies created the monster that is now devouring their intellectual property rights." [...] The Ninth Circuit agreed, and also rejected Napster's claim that, by creating and providing digital files via the Internet, the plaintiffs had granted Napster an [...] "implied license". Finally, Napster argued that the plaintiffs were using copyright to control online distribution, which Napster considered beyond the scope of the limited monopoly provided by the Copyright Office. The court rejected this as well, finding that MP3s were the same works as those that appeared on CDs, just in a different format, thus the plaintiffs <b>had</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> control their distribution of digital music files because they are the plaintiffs' copyrighted works.|$|E
2500|$|The appeal {{trial was}} held on 13 January 1931 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, in London, and, it was hoped at the time, would settle the status of Lundy once and for all.

In his defence, Mr Harman said he <b>had</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was [...] "a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion," [...] {{out of the realm}} for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port. The Attorney General, who was prosecuting Mr Harman, said that Lundy was surely a Utopia but that its inhabitants would be just as happy if the face of King George V, rather than of Mr Harman, were depicted on the place's currency. (Mr Harman's face was {{on the front of the}} coins, and that of a puffin on the back.

2500|$|The Indian {{historian}} Inder Malhotra {{wrote about}} Nehru's role that: [...] "So the Suez War ended in Britain's humiliation. Eden lost his job. Nehru achieved his objective of protecting Egypt's sovereignty and Nasser's honour". Britain and France agreed {{to withdraw from}} Egypt within a week; Israel did not. A rare example {{of support for the}} Anglo-French actions against Egypt came from West Germany; though the Cabinet was divided, the Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was furious with the United States for its [...] "chumminess with the Russians" [...] as Adenauer called the U.S. refusal to intervene in Hungary and voting with the Soviet Union at the UN Security Council, and the traditionally Francophile Adenauer drew closer to Paris as a result. Adenauer told his Cabinet on 7 November that Nasser was a pro-Soviet force that needed to cut down to size, and in his view the attack on Egypt was completely justified. Adenauer maintained to his Cabinet that the French <b>had</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> invade Egypt because of Nasser's support for the FLN in Algeria, but the British were partly to blame because they [...] "inexplicably" [...] shut down their Suez Canal base in 1954. What appalled Adenauer about the crisis was that the United States had come against the attack on Egypt and voted with the Soviet Union at Security Council against Britain and France, which lead Adenauer to fear that the United States and Soviet Union would [...] "carve up the world" [...] according to their own interests with no thought for the interests of European states. Adenauer refused to cancel a planned visit to Paris on 5–6 November 1956 and his summit with Mollet was clearly meant {{to be seen as a}} gesture of moral support. Adenauer was especially worried by the fact that the American embassy in Bonn would not provide a clear answer as to what was the American policy in response to the Bulganin letters. One of Adenauer's aides Fritz von Eckardt commented about the opening ceremony in Paris where Mollet and Adenauer stood side by side while the national anthems were played that [...] "In the most serious hour France had experienced since the end of the war, the two governments were standing shoulder by shoulder". During the summit in Paris, Mollet commented to Adenauer that a Soviet nuclear strike could destroy Paris at any moment, which added considerably to the tension and helped to draw the French and Germans closer.|$|E
