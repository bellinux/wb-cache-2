5|$|In 1941, a {{landmine}} exploded {{near the}} south {{aisle of the}} cathedral, resulting in {{the roof of the}} nave collapsing and the shattering of the windows. Sir Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild the roof, and made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti had added to the north aisle. In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the <b>dean</b> <b>at</b> the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.|$|E

The depression moved briskly westward, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm <b>Dean</b> <b>at</b> 1500UTC on August 14. The storm's intensity continued to build although dry air and cooler air inflow from the north were slowing structural development. Ragged bands formed on August 15 and the formation of a partial eyewall was observed later that day.|$|E

5|$|Robert of Ghent or Robert de Gant (c. 1085–after 1154) was Lord Chancellor of England and Dean of York in the 12th century. The {{younger son}} of a nobleman, Robert was {{probably}} {{a member of the}} cathedral chapter of York before his selection as chancellor by King Stephen of England in the mid-1140s. He is not mentioned often in documents from his time as chancellor, but why this is so is unknown. He became <b>dean</b> <b>at</b> York Minster around 1147. Robert was slightly involved in the disputes over who would be Archbishop of York in the late 1140s and 1150s, but it is likely that his chancellorship prevented his deeper involvement in diocesan affairs. He was no longer chancellor after the death of Stephen, but probably continued to hold the office of dean until his death around 1157 or 1158.|$|E

Her memories of James <b>Dean</b> <b>at</b> the Actors Studio and later in Giant were recalled on BBC Radio 2 in 1982, when she guested on You're Tearing Me Apart, Terence Pettigrew's documentary which commemorated the 25th anniversary of Dean's death {{in a car accident}} in 1955.

Seton Hall is one of three law schools in the state of New Jersey. Seton Hall Law was founded by a woman, Miriam T. Rooney, who served as dean from 1951 to 1961. She was not only Seton Hall’s first female dean, but was the first woman <b>dean</b> <b>at</b> an ABA-accredited law school in the United States. Dean Kathleen M.

5|$|The couple {{moved to}} London in 1933 {{but the city}} {{at the time was}} sooty and foggy.

After recovering, she moved to Southampton to stay with her parents for two years, with Denning visiting every weekend. By 1935 she had fully recovered, and the couple bought a house in Tylers Green, Cuckfield, called Fair Close. Their son, Robert, was born on 3 August 1938; he later became a <b>Dean</b> <b>at</b> Magdalen College, Oxford, teaching inorganic chemistry.

5|$|The {{depression}} was already exhibiting persistent deep convection {{in the western}} portion of its circulation. It moved quickly westward, south of a deep layered ridge, escaping the easterly wind shear that had been slowing its development and moving over warmer waters. At 1500UTC on August14, the {{depression was}} upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean while still 1450mi (2300km) east of Barbados. Even as its convection waned slightly that afternoon, its intensity grew, and convection flared in the center that night. Dry air and cooler air inflow from the north slowed structural development; nevertheless, ragged bands began to form on August15. By mid-morning, a rough banding eye had formed, and {{by the next morning}} a full eye developed. The storm was upgraded to Hurricane <b>Dean</b> <b>at</b> 0900UTC August16, 550mi (890km) east of Barbados.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Dean,</b> <b>at</b> {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall trigged a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla killed five people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm swept over the state, a man sheltering under a tree was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, {{but most of them}} caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland as Mexico City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E

5|$|Miles {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} Empress Matilda, on {{her return to}} England in 1139. According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, {{and the necessity of}} joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs. Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian R.H.C. Davis, possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford. He also received St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of <b>Dean.</b> <b>At</b> the time Matilda was the de facto ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at Bristol following his capture the previous February after the Battle of Lincoln. Sibyl was styled Countess of Hereford, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from Brien FitzCount, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of Wallingford during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer.|$|E
