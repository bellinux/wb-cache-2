5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, Letters proved equally popular. Dutch and German translations were rapidly produced, {{and prompted}} by constant demand, editions appeared {{in such places}} as Dublin, Paris and Maastricht. In lieu of a second volume of letters, Crèvecœur produced an expanded <b>French</b> <b>version</b> (Lettres d'un cultivateur américain) that was published in 1784. The <b>French</b> <b>version,</b> which removed the fictional persona of James, {{is presented as a}} series of documents that have been neutrally edited, providing greater documentary detail but at the expense of artistry.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{publication date}} for the book was October 14, 2008. After the Canadian federal election was called and set for that day the book's release was rescheduled to October 6, eight {{days before the election}} in which Bernier was seeking re-election. The English version was published as a hard cover by McClelland & Stewart while the <b>French</b> <b>version</b> was released by Montreal publishers, Les Editions de l'Homme, as a trade paperback. According to La Presse, 17,000 copies were printed; 5,000 sold in the first two weeks. In the Montreal market, the book was listed on the bestseller list at No. 6 for two weeks while the <b>French</b> <b>version</b> spent one week at No. 5.|$|E

5|$|Although only {{moderately}} {{successful in}} America, Letters was immediately popular in Europe upon its publication in 1782. Prompted by high demand, Crèvecœur produced an expanded <b>French</b> <b>version</b> {{that was published}} two years later.

5|$|During {{the early}} years of sound films before dubbing and subtitling, one way to present a film to a foreign {{audience}} was to record the film with a translated screenplay with foreign-language cast. As this was a time consuming and expensive procedure, most filmmakers who did this tended to only make one alternative language feature. Producer Seymour Nebenzal felt that creating this alternative version would enhance international sales for The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. The French-language screenplay was adapted by René Sti. Lang was fluent in French and directed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse in both French and German. Actor Karl Meixner played Hofmeister in both versions of the film as he was bilingual. Rudolf Klein-Rogge also features as Mabuse in the <b>French</b> <b>version</b> with his lines being dubbed. The <b>French</b> <b>version,</b> titled Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse, was edited by Lothar Wolff in France while the film was still in production.|$|E
5|$|For the 1774 <b>French</b> <b>version,</b> Orphée et Eurydice, tragédie opéra {{in three}} acts, the {{libretto}} {{was published by}} Delormel (Paris, 1774) and the full score by Lemarchand (Paris, 1774). A critical edition, edited by Ludwig Finscher, was published in 1967 as part of Bärenreiter's Sämtliche Werke.

5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Bianca Casfafiore in the story– a famous opera singer, {{pursued by the}} press, and changing her outfit for every occasion– {{was influenced by the}} life of the opera singer Maria Callas. One of the new characters that Hergé introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original <b>French</b> <b>version),</b> whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Hergé. Hergé's {{depiction of}} the paparazzi within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career. The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original <b>French</b> <b>version)</b> of the Paris Flash, are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of The Black Island (1938) by Bob de Moor, also making a reappearance in Tintin and the Picaros (1976). The idea of having a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.|$|E

The Latin name Caesarea was also applied to the colony of New Jersey as Nova Caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the <b>French</b> <b>version</b> of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E

5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 <b>French</b> <b>version</b> which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E
5|$|Gluck made {{a number}} of changes to the {{orchestration}} of Orfeo when adapting it from the original Italian version to the <b>French</b> <b>version</b> of 1774. Cornetts and chalumeaux are replaced by more common and modern oboes and clarinets, while the part played by trombones considerably decreases, possibly {{due to a lack of}} technical ability on the part of the French trombonists. Cornetts were instruments that were typically used for church music, and chalumeaux were predominant only in chamber music: both cornetts and chalumeaux were unpopular in France in 1774. In many ways the change from chalumeau to oboe corresponds to that from castrato to high tenor. Neither castrato nor chalumeau were to survive.|$|E
5|$|The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure {{were the}} first two Adventures of Tintin to be {{published}} in English-language translations for the British market.
