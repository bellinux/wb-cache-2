Therefore, <b>fiscal</b> <b>law</b> can constrain a Federal agency from the quickest, easiest, or cheapest way to accomplish its mission. This Constitutionally mandated {{oversight of the}} use of public funds is associated with the principle of checks and balances. A good working relationship and robust communication between the Executive and Legislative branches is the key to avoiding problems in this area.|$|R

40|$|<b>Fiscal</b> {{responsibility}} <b>laws</b> are {{institutions with}} which multiple {{governments in the}} same economy [...] national and subnational [...] can commit to help avoid irresponsible fiscal behavior that could have short-term advantages {{to one of them}} but that would be collectively damaging. Coordination failures with subnational governments in the 1990 s contributed to macroeconomic instability and led several countries to adopt <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> as part of the remedy. The paper analyzes the characteristics and effects of <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> in seven countries [...] Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, and Peru. <b>Fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> are designed to address the short time horizons of policymakers, free riders among government units, and principal agent problems between the national and subnational governments. The paper describes how the laws differ in the specificity of quantitative targets, the strength of sanctions, the methods for increasing transparency, and the level of government passing the law. Evidence shows that <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> can help coordinate and sustain commitments to fiscal prudence, but they are not a substitute for commitment and should not be viewed as ends in themselves. They can make a positive contribution by adding to the collection of other measures to shore up a coalition of states with the central government in support of fiscal prudence. Policymakers contemplating <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> may benefit from the systematic review of international practice. One common trait of successful <b>fiscal</b> responsibility <b>laws</b> for subnational governments is the commitment of the central government to its own fiscal prudence, which is usually reinforced by the application of the law at the national as well as the subnational level.
