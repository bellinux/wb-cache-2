5|$|All of this cosmic {{evolution}} {{after the}} inflationary epoch can be rigorously <b>described</b> <b>and</b> modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks {{of quantum mechanics}} and Einstein's General Relativity.

Understanding this earliest of eras {{in the history of}} the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.|$|E

5|$|Mahakala is {{both the}} most {{primitive}} dromaeosaurid ever <b>described</b> <b>and</b> the smallest. This evidence, combined with {{the small size of}} other primitive relatives such as Microraptor and the troodontid Anchiornis, indicates that the common ancestor of dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and birds (which is called the ancestral paravian) may have been very small, at around 65cm in length and 600 to 700grams of mass.|$|E
