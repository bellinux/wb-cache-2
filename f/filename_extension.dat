25|$|Many file systems, {{including}} FAT, NTFS, and VMS systems, allow a <b>filename</b> <b>extension</b> {{that consists}} {{of one or more}} characters following the last period in the filename, dividing the filename into two parts: a base name or stem and an extension or suffix used by some applications to indicate the file type. Multiple output files created by an application use the same basename and various extensions. For example, a compiler might use the extension FOR for source input file (for Fortran code), OBJ for the object output and LST for the listing. Although there are some common extensions, they are arbitrary and a different application might use REL and RPT. On filesystems that do not segregate the extension, files will often have a longer extension such as html.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF {{can be used}} {{to define}} a {{container}} for annotations that are separate from the PDF document they apply to. FDF typically encapsulates information such as X.509 certificates, requests for certificates, directory settings, timestamp server settings, and embedded PDF files for network transmission. The FDF uses the MIME content type application/vnd.fdf, <b>filename</b> <b>extension</b> [...]fdf and on Mac OS it uses file type 'FDF'.|$|E

2500|$|Before 2007, the [...]ogg <b>filename</b> <b>extension</b> {{was used}} for all files whose content used the Ogg {{container}} format. Since 2007, the Xiph.Org Foundation recommends that [...]ogg only be used for Ogg Vorbis audio files. The Xiph.Org Foundation decided {{to create a new}} set of file extensions and media types to describe different types of content such as [...]oga for audio only files, [...]ogv for video with or without sound (including Theora), and [...]ogx for multiplexed Ogg.|$|E
2500|$|SVG images, being XML, contain many {{repeated}} {{fragments of}} text, {{so they are}} well suited for lossless data compression algorithms. When an SVG image has been compressed with the industry standard gzip algorithm, it {{is referred to as}} an [...] "SVGZ" [...] image and uses the corresponding [...]svgz <b>filename</b> <b>extension.</b> Conforming SVG 1.1 viewers will display compressed images. An SVGZ file is typically 20 to 50 percent of the original size. W3C provides SVGZ files to test for conformance.|$|E

The 32-bit VxD message server (msgsrv32) {{is a program}} that is able to load virtual device drivers (VxDs) at startup and then handle communication with the drivers. Additionally, the message server performs several background functions, including loading the Windows shell (such as Explorer.exe or Progman.exe).|$|E
2500|$|On 7 July 1994, the Fraunhofer Society {{released}} the first software MP3 encoder called l3enc. The <b>filename</b> <b>extension</b> [...]mp3 {{was chosen by}} the Fraunhofer team on 14 July 1995 (previously, the files had been named [...]bit). With the first real-time software MP3 player WinPlay3 (released 9 September 1995) many people were able to encode and play back MP3 files on their PCs. Because of the relatively small hard drives back in that time (~ 500â€“1000 MB) lossy compression was essential to store non-instrument based (see tracker and MIDI) music for playback on computer. As sound scholar Jonathan Sterne notes, [...] "An Australian hacker acquired l3enc using a stolen credit card. The hacker then reverse-engineered the software, wrote a new user interface, and redistributed it for free, naming it [...] "thank you Fraunhofer"".|$|E
