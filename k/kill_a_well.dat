5000|$|During {{drilling}} operations, kicks {{are usually}} killed using the Driller’s, Engineer’s {{or a combination}} of both called Concurrent Method while forward circulating. The selection of which to use will depend upon the amount and type of kick fluids that have entered the well, the rig's equipment capabilities, the minimum fracture pressure in the open hole, and the drilling and operating companies well control policies.For workover or completion operations, other methods are often used[...] Bullheading is a common way to <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> during workovers and completions operations but is not often used for drilling operations. Reverse circulation is another kill method used for workovers that is not used for drilling.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the most}} common method of a {{contingency}} well kill. If there is a sudden need to <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> quickly, without the time for rigging up for circulation, the more blunt instrument of bullheading may be used. This involves simply pumping the kill fluid directly down the well bore, forcing the well bore fluids back into the reservoir. This can be effective at achieving the central aim of a well kill; building up a sufficient hydrostatic head in the well bore. However, it can be limited by the burst-pressure capabilities of the tubing or casing, and can risk damaging the reservoir by forcing undesired materials into it. The principal advantage is that it can be done with little advanced planning.|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian {{petroleum}} authority {{initiated a}} new regulation in 2012. All new wells on the Norwegian shelf {{originally designed to}} be killed by two relief wells, {{in case of a}} worst case scenario, are rejected. The reason is the lack of experience on killing a well by two relief wells. Internal research on dual relief well drilling has been initiated by some operating companies, but none of the reports are public. This thesis will use experience from established well killers and simulations done on single relief wells to evaluate the procedure of a dual relief well operation. Calculations are performed on sections evaluated as critical in a dual relief well drilling operation and the results have been discussed with experienced well killers from Norway and USA. The thesis will also do sensitivities on single relief well operations to evaluate the possibility of killing a high magnitude blowout with one relief well. The main conclusions drawn from the results of this thesis are that the capacity of a single relief well cannot be enhanced to <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> that normally require the rates of two relief wells. The dual relief well option focused on in this thesis is considered safer than the other comparing method. The background of this conclusion is primarily literature from single relief wells and through interviews with experienced well killers. The hydraulic differences between the two options are concluded to be fairly equal in this study. Future experiments on the commingling section of the dual relief well method are recommended by the author. By using research on multilateral production wells, great similarities in experiments can be drawn when evaluating the flow regime. Additionally, improved blowout simulation software must be evolved, to handle inflow from two relief wells. &# 8195...|$|E
50|$|A {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} Saturday, September 30, 2006 when the dam collapsed after heavy flooding. 40 {{people were killed}} and approximately 500 homes were destroyed, displacing 1,000 people. It occurred after the heaviest downpour ever recorded in the area, which had fallen for the previous two days. In addition to lost and damaged houses, large amounts of farmland that was almost due to be harvested was devastated and hundreds of livestock were <b>killed.</b> <b>As</b> <b>well</b> as the dam, a bridge linking the city to the northern part of Zamfara State was destroyed. Around 700 people were temporarily sheltered in a nearby secondary school in the village of Birnin Ruwa, where assistance was provided by the Red Cross. Drinking water wells were polluted by the floodwater. The accident occurred after sluice gates failed to function, causing the water to overwhelm the dam, says the operator, the Zamfara Water Board.|$|R

40|$|The {{world is}} {{dependent}} on the production of oil and gas, and every day the demand increases. Technologies have {{to keep up with the}} demand of this resource to keep the world running. Since hydrocarbons are finite and will eventually run out, the increasing demand of oil and gas is the impetus to search for oil in more difficult and challenging areas. One challenging area is offshore in ultradeep water, with water depths greater than 5000 ft. This is the new arena for drilling technology. Unfortunately with greater challenges there are greater risks of losing control and blowing out <b>a</b> <b>well.</b> <b>A</b> dynamic <b>kill</b> simulator was developed in late 2004 to model initial conditions of a blowout in ultradeep water and to calculate the minimum kill rate required to <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> blowing <b>well</b> using the dynamic kill method. The simulator was simple and efficient, but had limitations; only vertical wells could be simulated. To keep up with technology, modifications were made to the simulator to model directional wells. COMASim (Cherokee, Offshore Technology Research Center, Minerals Management Service, Texas A&M Simulator) is the name of the dynamic kill simulator. The new version, COMASim 1. 0, has the ability to model almost any type of wellbore geometry when provided the measured and vertical depths of the well. Eighteen models with varying wellbore geometry were simulated to examine the effects of wellbore geometry on the minimum kill rate requirement. The main observation was that lower kill rate requirement was needed in wells with larger measured depth. COMASim 1. 0 cannot determine whether the inputs provided by the user are practical; COMASim 1. 0 can only determine if the inputs are incorrect, inconsistent or cannot be computed. If unreasonable drilling scenarios are input, unreasonable outputs will result. COMASim 1. 0 adds greater functionality to the previous version while maintaining the original framework and simplicity of calculations and usage...|$|R

40|$|There {{are plenty}} of {{uncertainties}} and enormous challenges in deep water drilling due to complicated shallow flow and deep strata of high temperature and pressure. This paper investigates density of dynamic kill fluid and optimum density during the kill operation process in which dynamic kill process {{can be divided into}} two stages, that is, dynamic stable stage and static stable stage. The dynamic kill fluid consists of a single liquid phase and different solid phases. In addition, liquid phase is a mixture of water and oil. Therefore, a new method in calculating the temperature and pressure field of deep water wellbore is proposed. The paper calculates the changing trend of kill fluid density under different temperature and pressure by means of superposition method, nonlinear regression, and segment processing technique. By employing the improved model of kill fluid density, deep water <b>kill</b> operation in <b>a</b> <b>well</b> is investigated. By comparison, the calculated density results are in line with the field data. The model proposed in this paper proves to be satisfactory in optimizing dynamic kill operations to ensure the safety in deep water...|$|R
