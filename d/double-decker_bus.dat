5|$|In the 20th century, {{the greater}} {{volume of traffic}} using the humpbacked bridge, which had poor {{visibility}} and narrow approach roads, led to a rise in accidents {{and an increase in}} bypass proposals. Many similar bridge towers were completely demolished starting as early as the 18th century due to the desire of local authorities to clear carriageways of all obstructions to improve traffic flow. The bridge and gate were formally protected as an Ancient Monument in 1923, and proposals for a new road bridge began to be made about the same time. The new A40, built in 1965–6, relieved the town of much through traffic, and a town centre plan, prepared by the District Council in 1981, again proposed a new bridge. Repairs had to be undertaken in 1982 following a collision on 18 May in which a <b>double-decker</b> <b>bus</b> struck the bridge, resulting in its closure for a month. Damage to the bridge and gate through accidents continued, and in the early 1990s, two drivers were prosecuted after crossing the bridge with vehicles significantly exceeding the weight and height limits.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong.

A <b>double-decker</b> <b>bus</b> drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye.
