[...] "I'd find a <b>screw</b> here, a <b>crank</b> there, etc. I used a combat camera and adapted it. I pulled together pieces of wood, aluminum, whatever I could find." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{a square}} tapered spindle. The taper is 2 degrees {{with respect to}} the centerline. There are at least two non-interchangeable {{dimensions}} (e.g. Shimano and Campagnolo use competing standards in square taper, viz. JIS and ISO respectively, where the ISO spindle is longer and its taper end is slightly smaller. [...] Most parts made by European manufacturers are to the ISO standard, and most Asian manufacturers use the JIS (Shimano) standard), and two orientations: diamond and square. The hole in the crank in which one <b>screws</b> a <b>crank</b> puller almost always has a diameter of 22 mm, though some old French cranks (Stonglight and T.A.) require a different puller.|$|R
50|$|An {{attachment}} {{to a regular}} bicycle can be built to allow the bike {{to be used as}} the seat, pedals, chain and sprocket of the thresher. The bicycle must be on a stand so that the back wheel is raised off the ground. Plans have been developed to build the attachment and the wheel-stand out of pieces of metal, including a large wheel that can be <b>screwed</b> to the <b>crank</b> section of the thresher (see External links). A drill will be required to make this as well.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dyna Drive" [...] - A pedal {{system with}} no pedal axle {{and with the}} {{bearings}} located {{in the part of}} the pedal which <b>screws</b> into the <b>crank.</b> This required an oversized hole in the crank 25mm (1" [...] diameter) to accept the Dyna Drive pedals. The theory behind this was to allow the foot to be lower than the pedal axle for better biomechanics. This system was relatively short lived, one reason being that the pedal bearings wore out quickly. However, they were used by Alexi Grewal (USA) in his gold medal winning ride in the 1984 Olympic cycling road race in Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|In French service, this {{weapon is}} {{normally}} towed by the VTM 120 (Véhicule Tracteur Mortier de 120 mm), a wheeled armored vehicle {{that is a}} derivative of the VAB 4x4 series of armored personnel carrier. Towing is accomplished by a towing <b>hitch</b> that is <b>screwed</b> onto the muzzle of the weapon. The VTM 120 also carries 70 rounds for the mortar and offers basic ballistic protection from small arms fire and shrapnel for the crew. The RT-61 can also be towed by the AMX-10 TM (Tracteur de Mortier), which is {{a version of the}} AMX-10P tracked APC. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force have a self-propelled version of the RT-61 with 50 rounds, the Type 96.|$|R
50|$|If the hub has no {{freewheel}} mechanism {{built into}} it, then a front freewheel is required, which <b>screws</b> onto the <b>crank.</b> These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes {{and use the}} same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX freewheels weren't strong enough for trials use {{and for this reason}} trials specific freewheels were designed. Trials freewheels are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the freewheel must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the freewheel will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a ratchet with 120 teeth and small ratchet pawls to engage them, the ratchet ring has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 ratchet pawls at a time, with 9 in total in the freewheel. Each set of 3 pawls is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical pawls with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the pawls or by having the pawls in each set of 3 pawls shorter or longer than the other sets of 3.|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} {{awareness of the environment}} and the growing energy needs of countries like China and India have accelerated the search for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel energy sources. Generating electricity from ocean waves is a viable alternative. This is because energy densities are sufficient to supplement the grid and thus make it economically viable. The seasonal supply profile also matches the demand profile. There are currently many different devices operating on different principles, the most promising of these is the oscillating body device using a linear generator. Linear generators are able to convert linear motion into electrical energy without the need for intermediate gears, <b>screws</b> or <b>crank</b> shafts. This increases the overall efficiency and makes the device more reliable. Static force simulations were done on a novel linear generator design. The generator combines the duel air-gap of a double sided topology with the encapsulation of the magnetic field in a tubular topology. This results in an increased force density, but also large cogging forces. The cogging forces consist of end-effects cogging forces that are caused by the interaction of the Permanent Magnets (PMs) with the stator ends, as well as cogging forces which are due to the interaction of the PMs and stator slots. The topic of this thesis is to find suitable methods of reducing the cogging forces. The end-effect forces were reduced by changing the stator length and altering the stator ends shape. Creating a quadratic b’ezier curve end shape and optimising the stator length reduced the end-effect cogging force from 630 N to 7 N. The slot cogging forces were reduced by dividing the PMs into two sections and to shift the outer PMs by one slot pitch relative to the inner PMs. This resulted in a decrease from 663 N to 25 N. However, a compromise needs to be made between reducing the cogging forces and not reducing the machine performance. Increasing the stator length increases the machine volume and dividing the magnets reduces the thrust force. This needs {{to be taken into account}} when designing a new machine...|$|R
