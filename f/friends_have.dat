40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine whether adolescents 2 ̆ 7 conceptions of the influences of romantic relationships on the features of same-sex friendships varied with age and sex, and to examine how adolescents 2 ̆ 7 adjustment is related to their conceptions of friendships when one member of the friendship has a romantic relationship. Ninth (n = 198) and eleventh graders (n = 152) completed a questionnaire about their conceptions of friendship features both when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship and when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Students also reported on the features of their best friendship and on their social, psychological, and academic adjustment. The results showed that conceptions of the impact of romantic relationships on friendship varied with age and sex. Ninth and eleventh graders viewed a friendship in which one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship as having less frequent interactions and less self-esteem support and intimacy, but more conflict, rivalry, and disloyalty than a friendship in which neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Moreover, the effect of a romantic relationship on frequency of interaction was greater in the eleventh than the ninth grade. Eleventh graders also viewed friends as engaging in less co-rumination when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic partner than when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic partner, while ninth graders did not. Compared to boys, girls viewed friendships as lower in intimacy and co-rumination and higher in conflict and rivalry when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship than when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Adolescents who were better adjusted academically viewed friendships in which one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship as more supportive. Students who perceived themselves as more accepted by their peers had conceptions of such friendships as higher in intimacy. These results imply that with increasing age, romantic relationships have an increasingly negative impact on the closeness of friendships, compared to boys, girls 2 ̆ 7 friendships are more adversely influenced by a <b>friend</b> <b>having</b> a romantic relationship, and adolescents who expect friendships with a <b>friend</b> who <b>has</b> a romantic relationship to be characterized by greater support and intimacy and less conflict and rivalry show better adjustment. ...|$|R

5|$|Eeyore's Birthday Party {{began in}} 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English {{students}} at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell, Jr. and other UT students. It was named for Eeyore, a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories who, in one story, believes his <b>friends</b> <b>have</b> forgotten his birthday only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him. Despite its name, the event does not fall on the official birthday of the fictional character. The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade, beer, honey sandwiches, a live, flower-draped donkey, and a may pole (in keeping with the event's proximity to May Day). For many years the party was a UT tradition, but subsequently the annual Birthday Party became a tradition in Austin's hippie subculture.|$|E
