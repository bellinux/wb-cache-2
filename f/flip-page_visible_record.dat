However, {{the availability of a}} devaluation option provides a policy tool for handling large shocks.

25|$|Volcano Island sank {{from three}} to ten feet {{as a result of}} the eruption. It was also found that the {{southern}} shore of Lake Taal sank in elevation from the eruption. No evidences of lava could be discovered anywhere, nor have geologists been able to trace any <b>visible</b> <b>records</b> of a lava flow having occurred at any time on the volcano back then. Another peculiarity of the geologic aspects of Taal is the fact that no sulphur has been found on the volcano. The yellow deposits and encrustations noticeable in the crater and its vicinity are iron salts, according to chemical analysis. Slight smell of sulfur was perceptible at the volcano, which came from the gases that escape from the crater.|$|R

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{episodes of}} impacting are recorded on the Moon's surface. An early episode marked by an intense barrage that included basin-forming projectiles ended about 3. 8 aeons {{ago when the}} Orientale basin was created. The second episode, after 3. 2 or 3. 3 aeons ago, was marked by a much lower impact rate. These very different rates are separated by a short transition period during the Late Imbrian Epoch. It is found that a constant preImbrian impact rate is consistent with all the relevant observations and with the following lunar historical scenario: (1) crustal solidification between about 4. 3 and 4. 25 aeons ago; (2) formation of Procellarum, South Pole-Aitken, about 22 now-obliterated basins, and about 2, 850 now-obliterated 30 to 300 km craters between 4. 25 and 4. 1 aeons ago; and (3) formation of 39 still-preserved basins, 1, 200 still-perserved craters, and 2, 200 now-obliterated craters between 4. 1 and 3. 85 aeons ago. At the constant rate, the amount of mass that impacted the Moon since crustal solidification would not greatly exceed the amount that has left a permanent <b>visible</b> <b>record...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Intercepting Tunny {{transmissions}} presented substantial problems. As the transmitters were directional, most of {{the signals}} were quite weak at receivers in Britain. Furthermore, there were some 25 different frequencies used for these transmissions, and the frequency would sometimes be changed part way through. After the initial discovery of the non-Morse signals in 1940, a Y-station was set up on a hill at the Ivy Farm Communications Centre at Knockholt in Kent, specifically to intercept this traffic. The centre was headed by Harold Kenworthy, had 30 receiving sets and employed some 600 staff. It became fully operational early in 1943.Because a single missed or corrupted character could make decryption impossible, the greatest accuracy was required. The undulator technology used to record the impulses had originally been developed for high-speed Morse. It produced a <b>visible</b> <b>record</b> of the impulses on narrow paper tape. This was then read by people employed as [...] "slip readers" [...] who interpreted the peaks and troughs as the marks and spaces of ITA2 characters. Perforated paper tape was then produced for telegraphic transmission to Bletchley Park where it was punched out.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} {{centered}} on the active initiatives from the ICT (information and communication technology) field using analysis and comparison of adopted solutions in ICT products {{for the support of}} competitive advantages. Confrontation of existing options is demonstrated on a security layer of selected products. This wider analysis brings an overview via operating and database systems, BI, and CRM products. A good starting point is an analysis of selected products by Petri Nets with simulation using a multidimensional and object approach. The realized analysis shows ways of security resolution in selected products and a mutual comparison of these solutions leads to an improved design of solutions in individual implementations. For example, Sugar CRM offers an optimal way of restricting access by date for access control to tabs and <b>visible</b> <b>records</b> for the user. Other positive options are advanced security (validation of IP address, maximum upload file size) or logging slow queries. Improvement requires restricted access for the system administrator (inspired by the Oracle database system) or transparent user identification (as in operating systems). Another benefit would be to simplify the overall concept of the accepted security layer from five components to four by merging the user account and system administrator area or audit and logging with an advanced security area...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of organized copwatching—groups of local residents who wear uniforms, carry <b>visible</b> <b>recording</b> devices, patrol neighborhoods, and film police- citizen interactions {{in an effort to}} hold police departments accountable to the populations they police. The Article argues that the practice of copwatching illustrates both the promise of adversarialism as a form of civic engagement and the potential of traditionally powerless populations to contribute to constitutional norms governing police conduct. Organized copwatching serves a unique function in the world of police accountability by giving these populations a vehicle through which to have direct, real-time input into policing decisions that affect their neighborhoods. Many scholars recognize that a lack of public participation is a barrier to true police accountability. When searching for solutions these same scholars often focus on studying and perfecting consensus-based methods of participation such as community policing, and neglect the study of more adversarial, confrontational forms of local participation in policing. By analyzing copwatching as a form of public participation, this Article challenges the scholarly focus on consensus-based strategies of police accountability. The Article urges scholars and reformers to take adversarial, bottom-up mechanisms of police accountability seriously—not just as protest, but as true participation. Doing so requires respecting observation and contestation as legitimate civic gestures worthy of protection...|$|R

50|$|The Kingstree Historic District {{contains}} forty-eight properties situated along Main Street, Academy Street, and Hampton Street in {{the commercial}} area of downtown Kingstree, South Carolina. The district includes the courthouse, public library, railroad station, and numerous commercial buildings. The district is a fine collection of nineteenth-century vernacular commercial architecture. Details such as arched doorways and windows, cast-iron columns and pilasters, decorative or corbelled brickwork and pressed tin interior ceilings are present {{on most of the}} district’s buildings. The Williamsburg County Courthouse, built ca. 1823, and designed by Robert Mills, is a fine example of Roman neoclassical design with its raised first floor, pediment with lunette, and Doric columns. In 1953-54 the courthouse underwent substantial remodeling on the exterior and interior, though it still reflects much of Mill’s original design. With the exception of the courthouse, most of the buildings in the district were built between 1900 and 1920 when Kingstree enjoyed prosperity as a retail and tobacco marketing center of Williamsburg County. The majority of the buildings in the district are a <b>visible</b> <b>record</b> of this twenty-year growth and the historic fabric of the area remains substantially intact. The Kingstree Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places June 28, 1982.|$|R
