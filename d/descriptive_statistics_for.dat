50|$|Nigrini advocates two {{approaches}} to continuous transactions monitoring {{in his book}} on forensic analytics. The first approach is called the parallel scan where descriptive statistics related to the transactions {{in the current period}} are compared to the <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>for</b> the prior periods. Large differences signal that something has changed. Had Knight Capital used such a metric on August 1, 2012 they would have seen, {{in a matter of minutes}} that their trading system was out of control. Nigrini also advocates risk scoring as a continuous monitoring methodology. Here forensic units (e.g., bank account customers, franchisees, travel agents, coupon redemptions, and locations) are scored on various predictors. The scores for the predictors are averaged and each unit ends up with a single risk score. High scores suggest a high risk of the behavior of interest and low scores are associated with a low risk. Audit activity would be directed towards those forensic units with high scores. The risk scoring approach can be programmed.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{variables}} under examination, analysts typically obtain <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>for</b> them, {{such as the}} mean (average), median, and standard deviation. They may also analyze {{the distribution of the}} key variables to see how the individual values cluster around the mean. The consultants at McKinsey and Company named a technique for breaking a quantitative problem down into its component parts called the MECE principle. Each layer can be broken down into its components; each of the sub-components must be mutually exclusive of each other and collectively add up to the layer above them. The relationship is referred to as [...] "Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive" [...] or MECE. For example, profit by definition can be broken down into total revenue and total cost. In turn, total revenue can be analyzed by its components, such as revenue of divisions A, B, and C (which are mutually exclusive of each other) and should add to the total revenue (collectively exhaustive).|$|E
