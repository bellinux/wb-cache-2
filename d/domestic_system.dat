5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was {{originally}} known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Chadderton's {{early history}} {{is marked by}} {{its status as a}} manorial township, with its own line of lords and overlords, who {{included}} the Asshetons, Chethams, Radclyffes and Traffords. Chadderton in the Middle Ages was chiefly distinguished by its two mansions, Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall, and by the prestigious families who occupied them. Farming was the main industry of the area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Provence {{experienced}} {{a boom in}} sericulture that would last until the first world war, {{with much of the}} silk shipped north to Lyon. Viens and La Bastide-des-Jourdans are two of the communes of Luberon that profited the most from mulberry plantations that have since disappeared. However, silk centers still operate today.Working at home under the <b>domestic</b> <b>system,</b> silk spinning and silk treatment employed many people and increased the income of the working class.|$|E

Moreover, to explain the concept in depth, the features of the Integration concept and the policy transfer systems in the European Union are assessed. It is shown that the European Integration has a great effect over the <b>domestic</b> <b>systems</b> in both forming and implementing policies.

5|$|Power looms {{introduced}} in the early 19th century {{put an end to}} the last remnants of the <b>domestic</b> <b>system</b> in Crompton, but not without resistance. Weavers and spinners were paid according to the amount of cloth they produced; independent hand loom weavers saw a drop in their income, and could not compete with the mechanised mass production that was gathering pace in the township. Luddites rioted in the township in 1826, smashing 24power looms at Clegg's mill at High Crompton in protest against their worsening standard of living.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} their income, {{the inhabitants of}} Milnrow entered the <b>domestic</b> <b>system,</b> producing flannel and woollen cloth in purpose-built weavers' cottages, some of which from the Early Modern period have survived as listed buildings. Coalmining and metalworking also flourished in this period, but the Industrial Revolution supplanted the domestic industries and converted Milnrow into an urban mill town that mass-produced textile goods in cotton mills, such as Ellenroad Ring Mill (now a museum). The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 18th century, the {{inhabitants}} of Chadderton raised domestic farm animals, supplementing their incomes by the spinning and weaving wool in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system.</b> Primitive coal mining was established by the 17th century, and the factory system adopted in the late-18th century. During the Victorian era, Chadderton's economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industries, especially the spinning of cotton, but also the weaving of silk and production of hats. By the 20th century the landscape was covered with over 50 cotton mills. Industries ancillary to these sectors, including coal mining, brick making, mechanical engineering, and bleaching and dyeing were present. Chadderton developed an extensive coal mining sector auxiliary to Chadderton's cotton industry and workforce. Coal was transported out of the township via the Rochdale Canal. The amount of coal was overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry; Chadderton's last coal mine closed in 1920.|$|E

25|$|Before the First {{industrial}} revolution work was mainly done through two systems: <b>domestic</b> <b>system</b> and craft guilds. In the <b>domestic</b> <b>system</b> merchants took materials to homes where artisans performed the necessary work, craft guilds {{on the other}} hand were associations of artisans which passed work from one shop to another, for example: leather was tanned by a tanner, passed to curriers, and finally arrived at shoemakers and saddlers.|$|E

50|$|The Type 052B (Guangzhou class) multirole missile {{destroyer}} was {{the first}} Chinese-built warship capable of area air defence. When <b>domestic</b> <b>systems</b> could not be ready in time for Type 051B destroyer, China was forced to purchase two pairs of Sovremennyy-class destroyer {{to fill the gap}} left behind in the fleet area air defense. By the time of Type 052B, China had already gained tremendous experience from Russian <b>systems</b> and Chinese <b>domestic</b> <b>systems</b> were also ready. As a result, Type 052B is built with considerable Russian technology including the Russian-made 9M38 Buk-M1-2 (NATO codename: SA-N-12 Grizzly) air defence missile system, an extremely effective air defence system with a range of 38 km. Most military analysts expect the Guangzhou class to be similar to the Russian Sovremenny class destroyer in terms of general performance.|$|R

25|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Whitefield {{has been}} {{suggested}} as lying {{on the path of}} an ancient Roman road leading from Mamucium (Manchester) in the south to Bremetennacum (Ribchester) in the north. Throughout the Middle Ages, Whitefield was a division of the township of Pilkington, itself a part of the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham and hundred of Salford. Pilkington and Whitefield have historic associations with the Earls of Derby. Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was {{reluctant}} {{support for the}} Convention back in the UK where Attlee's Labour government were in power. The Lord Chancellor Jowitt, the Colonial Secretary Griffiths and the Chancellor Sir Stafford Cripps disapproved of ratification {{on the basis of}} the loss of sovereignty that would result. Jowitt also saw a threat to the <b>domestic</b> <b>system</b> of common law and the risk in allowing judgments to be made by an unknown foreign court. He nevertheless believed that ratification was necessary from a political point of view as a refusal would be, in his view, difficult to justify at home and abroad. Political pressure aside, the overall government view was that the Convention was only aimed at preventing a totalitarian takeover and not human rights issues within a functioning democracy. In essence, it was thought that Britain had little to lose from ratification but rejection could risk some loss of face in Europe. The Convention had more support among Conservative party politicians, in particular Winston Churchill who believed that it could help unify Europe {{on the basis of the}} rule of law.|$|E

25|$|During the Middle Ages {{the area}} was thinly {{populated}} and consisted of several hamlets. Apart from the Heywoods of Heywood Hall, the sparse population of Heywood comprised a small community of farmers, {{most of whom were}} involved with pasture but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens and fustians in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system.</b> During the Early Modern period, the weavers of Heywood had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages, but as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the early 18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger and more efficient equipment became apparent. Industrial textile manufacture was introduced in the town in the late 18th century and the first spinning mill – Makin Mill – was built at Wrigley Brook (later known as Queens Park Road). By 1780 there remained less than 100 hand-loom fustian weavers out of a population of 2,000 and industrialist Sir Robert Peel (father of Prime Minister Robert Peel) converted Makin Mill for cotton production. This initiated a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the area and the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The cotton trade in Heywood grew, and by 1833 there were 27cotton mills.|$|E
500|$|The {{manufacture}} of textiles in Crompton {{can be traced back}} to 1474, when a lease dated from that year outlines that the occupant of Crompton Park had spinning wheels, cards and looms, all of which suggest that cloth was being produced in large quantities. The upland geography of the area constrained the output of crop growing, and so prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. Wills and inventories from the 15th and 16th centuries suggest most families were involved with small scale pasture, but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system,</b> [...] and selling cloth, linen and fustians to travelling chapmen for the markets in Manchester and Rochdale. Despite its remoteness by the Pennines, by the Early Modern period the <b>domestic</b> <b>system</b> in Crompton had produced relatively wealthy inhabitants. The most affluent were those involved in cloth and linen, and their wealth was comparable to that of the merchants of Manchester and Salford.|$|E
500|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Royton and its {{surroundings}} have provided evidence of ancient British, Roman and Viking activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Royton formed a small township centred on Royton Hall, a manor house owned by a long succession of dignitaries which included the Byrons and Radcliffes. A settlement expanded outwards from the hall which, by as late as 1780, [...] "contained only a few straggling and mean-built cottages". Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

500|$|Legal {{documents}} dated 1624 {{state that}} Milnrow consisted of six cottages; {{there were a}} further nine at Butterworth Hall, and three at Ogden. Milnrow did not expand until {{the introduction of a}} woollen weaving trade which began in the Late Middle Ages and continued until the 19th century. During this time nearby Rochdale—the local market town—was used as a central marketing, finishing and fellmongering hub. The handloom weaving of woollen cloth and flannels in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system</b> became the staple industry of Milnrow, facilitating the community's growth and prosperity. Between 40,000 and 50,000 sheep skins were needed every week to provide for Milnrow's industries, and as early as the 16th century, the demand for wool was so great it had outstripped the local supply of the region and had to be imported from Ireland and the English Midlands. As a consequence of the woollen trade, rows of [...] "fine stone domestic workshops" [...] or weavers' cottages were constructed beyond Milnrow's original core, with dwelling quarters on the lower floors and loom-shops on the top floor.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Royton Hall, the {{population}} of Royton during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers and farmers, {{most of whom were}} involved with pasture, but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens in the <b>domestic</b> <b>system.</b> The area was thinly populated and consisted of several hamlets, including Thorp, Heyside and Royton village itself as the nucleus. During the Early Modern period, the weavers of Royton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages, but as both the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the early-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better and more efficient equipment became apparent. [...] The construction of a water powered cotton mill by Ralph Taylor at Thorp Clough in 1764, {{is said to be the}} first structure of its kind. The construction of more mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The introduction of the factory system led to a tenfold increase of Royton's population in less than a century; from 260 in 1714 to 2,719 in 1810. Despite its growth as a centre for cotton-cloth production, and the construction of a chapel of ease in 1754, in 1780 Royton was said to have [...] "contained only a few straggling and mean-built cottages". The people of Royton continued to produce cotton goods (mainly cloth) and sell them at the market in Manchester.|$|E

40|$|National sovereignties {{have been}} eroded {{in the last}} decades. <b>Domestic</b> <b>systems</b> of {{conflict}} of laws are no exceptions. While contributing with some remarks on certain evolving processes that are affecting the private international law systems, this paper notes that within the EU – however fragmentary its legislation {{in the field of}} civil justice may be – the erosion of national competences follows as a matter of course. It then argues that the EU points to setting up a common space in which inter alia fundamental rights and mutual recognition play a major role. Thus, a supranational system of private international law is gradually being forged with the aim to ensure the continuity of legal relationships duly created in a Member State. As a result, <b>domestic</b> <b>systems</b> of private international law are deemed to become complementary in character. Their conceptualization as a kind of inter-local rules, the application of which cannot raise obstacles to the continuity principle, appears logically conceivable...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of equality of arms is firmly entrenched in the jurisprudence of international tribunals, but hardly at all in <b>domestic</b> <b>systems.</b> This article argues for the principle to be applied in Botswana's adversarial system, {{as a way of}} ensuring procedural equality and enhancing fair trials. After examining the normative value of the principle, the article refers to a number of domestic jurisdictions that have applied the principle. It also examines the general acceptability of equality and fairness in Botswana case law. This represents a foundation for applying the principle in Botswana. The principle was developed by the European Court of Human Rights, creating its own concept of fairness in trials, irrespective of the position in <b>domestic</b> <b>systems.</b> Since the principle is of international origin, it is necessary to note that "judicial territoriality" and Botswana's dualist system do not pose obstacles to the application of the principle. © 2011 School of Oriental and African Studies...|$|R
