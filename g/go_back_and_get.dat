25|$|In the episode, Gloria {{invites the}} whole family on a getaway to Hawaii for Jay's {{birthday}} much to Jay's chagrin. While waiting for their flight, Mitchell realizes {{that he does not}} have his wallet - that includes his ID - with him and he has to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it. Phil offers to drive him back home, something that upsets Claire because Phil leaves her alone while he knows how much nervous she is when they are about to fly. Manny is kept for questioning after his name matches a name on a no-fly list and Haley flirts with a boy while Dylan is trapped inside the Dunphy's house.|$|E
2500|$|Roy Wilkins {{announced}} that W. E. B. Du Bois {{had died in}} Ghana the previous night; the crowd observed {{a moment of silence}} in his memory. Wilkins had initially refused to announce the news because he despised Du Bois as a Communist—but then insisted on making the announcement when he realized that Randolph would make it if he didn't. Wilkins said: [...] "Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that {{at the dawn of the}} twentieth century his was the voice that was calling you to gather here today in this cause. If you want to read something that applies to 1963 <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a volume of The Souls of Black Folk by Du Bois, published in 1903." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Ryan set {{his first}} major record when he struck out 383 batters in one season, beating Sandy Koufax's old mark by one. Remarking on this feat, Koufax joked, [...] "Yeah, and he also surpassed my total for bases on balls in a single season by 91. I suspect half of those guys he struck out swung rather than get hit." [...] Ryan threw two no-hitters in 1973. In the second one, on July 15 against the Detroit Tigers, he struck out 17 batters – most in a {{recorded}} no-hitter. (This record would later be tied by Max Scherzer on October 3, 2015.) Ryan was so dominant in this game, it led to one of baseball's best-remembered pranks. Tigers first baseman and cleanup hitter Norm Cash came to the plate with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, having already struck out twice, and was carrying a clubhouse table leg instead of a bat. [...] Plate umpire Ron Luciano ordered Cash to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a regulation bat, to which Cash replied, [...] "Why, I won't hit him anyway!" [...] With a regulation bat in hand, Cash did finally make contact, but popped out to end the game.|$|E
60|$|Most of the people, {{both male}} and female, are in walking costume, and carry alpenstocks. Evidently, it is not {{considered}} safe to go about in Switzerland, even in town, without an alpenstock. If the tourist forgets and comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> it, <b>and</b> stands {{it up in the}} corner. When his touring in Switzerland is finished, he does not throw that broomstick away, but lugs it home with him, to the far corners of the earth, although this costs him more trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could. You see, the alpenstock is his trophy; his name is burned upon it; and if he has climbed a hill, or jumped a brook, or traversed a brickyard with it, he has the names of those places burned upon it, too.|$|R
5000|$|For {{opening day}} on April 3, 2017, the Mets and Braves played against one-another at Citi Fied. Prior to that, the Braves had won six {{straight}} games at Citi Field. On April 5, 2017, Mets veteran RHP Bartolo Colon made his Braves appearance at Citi Field, stating he was [...] "very happy <b>and</b> excited to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> there <b>and</b> <b>get</b> {{the opportunity to}} play against my ex-teammates." ...|$|R

60|$|Here {{followed}} a long discussion {{as to what}} it was best to do. Marco thought that, if there was any probability that the horse would have stopped at the tree, {{it would be better for}} him to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> him; but that, if he had got by the tree, and had gone home, it would be better for Isaiah to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> him, while they went forward to the end of the day's journey.

5000|$|Since Lilly wants {{nothing to}} do with him, Darrin decides to quit and returns to New York, where he has been offered his job back. However, when Darrin <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> a new condo and a promotion, he comes to realize that none of these things mean {{anything}} without Lilly and the choir. Darrin quits his job and returns to Monte Carlo to reconcile with Lilly. The two then recruit Lucious and the Reverend and all of them rush down to the Gospel Explosion to join the choir for the performance. [...] When Darrin and Lilly arrive, Paulina tries to keep them out, citing that Darrin forfeited his inheritance when he left Monte Carlo. However, Reverend Lewis finally stands up to Paulina and calls her out for being a selfish, conniving, hypocritical individual. He then reveals to the choir that her husband, whom she previously had claimed was deceased, is alive and remarried to a better woman. Lilly scolds Paulina for insulting Sally's will and wishes, which gave Darrin the choir. They manage to convince the others to vote Paulina out of the choir, giving Darrin his position as director back. Before their performance begins, Darrin tells Lilly that she inspired him to name the choir The Fighting Temptations.|$|R
