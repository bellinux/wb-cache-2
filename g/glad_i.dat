25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

500|$|... "Can't B Good" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by D. DoRohn Gough and Ne-Yo. It was recorded between 2007 and 2008 at SouthSide Studios, in Atlanta, Georgia. Although Jackson didn't write the song, Jackson described [...] "Can't B Good" [...] as a song reflecting her seven-year relationship with songwriter/producer Jermaine Dupri, saying, [...] "I'd been hurt before, and I {{was trying to}} protect myself.

We cannot be burdened with all of the responsibilities of the record label. But I'm <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> did it, for having tried to." ...|$|E

The book was praised by academics such as Vladimir Ćorović, and Dangić received a literary award from the Serbian Royal Academy. In 1940, he published a novel called Hunger and the Dungeon (<b>Glad</b> <b>i</b> tamnica), for which he received another accolade from the Serbian Royal Academy.

I take full responsibility for that, but I'm <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> did it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than play it safe and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E

500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was writing that book." ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, Motley {{went back}} to Canton and began working at a steel mill, {{planning}} to return to Reno in 1946 to finish his degree. That summer, however, Paul Brown was coaching a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) called the Cleveland Browns. Motley wrote to Brown asking for a tryout, but Brown declined, saying he already had all the fullbacks he needed. At the beginning of August, however, Brown invited Bill Willis, another African-American star, {{to try out for}} the team at its training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. Ten days later, Brown invited Motley to come, too. [...] "I think they felt [...] needed a roommate," [...] Motley later said. [...] "I don't think they felt I'd make the team.

[...] Wee and Morse have performed during half-time shows at NBA, CBA and NCAA sporting events.

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|Some {{disappointed}} Indiana Jones fans {{used the}} term [...] "nuking the fridge", based on a scene where Jones survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, to denote the point when a franchise passes its peak and crossed into the absurd, similar to [...] "jumping the shark". This phrase has appeared across the internet, and was chosen as #5 on Time magazine's list of [...] "top ten buzzwords" [...] of 2008. Asked about the scene and phrase, Spielberg said: [...] "Blame me. Don't blame George. That was my silly idea ... I'm proud of that. I'm <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{was able to bring}} that into popular culture." [...] Lucas denied this, saying Spielberg was [...] "protecting him".

500|$|... "Sibling Rivalry" [...] was {{watched by}} 7.95 million viewers, {{making it the}} 77th most-watched program of the week.

This leads to a hysterical, yet truly gross, scene where Peter knocks over an entire shelf of sperm samples, and has to refill them, um, himself." [...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews {{reviewed}} the episode negatively, writing [...] "many viewers will probably be disappointed with an episode about sibling rivalry between Stewie and newfound half-brother Bertram. Both share the same goal– to rule the Universe. With Bertram nothing more than a whinier version of his half-brother, it turns out one Stewie Griffin is more than enough." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{is one of}} the longest-serving in British soap, coming third behind Ken Barlow and [...] Emily Bishop in a 1998 survey assessing character episode appearances in Coronation Street's history. In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Shaw despaired of the British government's coercive {{policies}} towards Ireland, and joined his fellow-writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton in publicly condemning these actions. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 {{led to the}} partition of Ireland between north and south, a provision that dismayed Shaw. In 1922 civil war {{broke out in the}} south between its pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions, the former of whom had established the Irish Free State. Shaw visited Dublin in August, and met Michael Collins, then head of the Free State's Provisional Government. Shaw was much impressed by Collins, and was saddened when, three days later, the Irish leader was ambushed and killed by anti-treaty forces. In a letter to Collins's sister, Shaw wrote: [...] "I met Michael for the first and last time on Saturday last, and am very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> did. I rejoice in his memory, and will not be so disloyal to it as to snivel over his valiant death". Shaw remained a British subject all his life, but took dual British-Irish nationality in 1934.|$|E
500|$|Through a Glass Darkly is a long, complex {{narrative}} that {{features more than}} 60 characters and at least 15 subplots. The title of the novel comes from the Bible verse 1 Corinthians 13. Before she began writing it, Koen envisioned creating {{a story about the}} relationship between a young woman and an older man, a plot element riddled with emotional tension that required much planning and foresight. Koen also sought to create a story that featured issues relevant to contemporary women, such as the non-existence of [...] "legal rights. If a husband wanted to beat his wife to death he could do it, and if her parents didn't care... No birth control. If you had any normal sexual urges you were pregnant all the time, and half the women died in childbirth. Life was very violent and short and I just wanted to show how it was without getting up on a soapbox, so someone reading it would say, 'I'm <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> live now.'" [...] According to Koen, another consistent theme throughout Through a Glass Darkly is how vital family is to our well-being, family in this case being a loose term that does not necessarily equate to being biologically-related. She was also interested in writing how people are connected to each other.|$|E

500|$|Lane {{was born}} near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on July 15, 1864, {{the first of}} four {{children}} of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns. [...] Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown; when his voice began to fail, he became a dentist. The elder Lane, disliking the island colony's cold climate, moved with his family to Napa, California in 1871, and to Oakland in 1876, where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School. [...] Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the Oakland Times, then worked as a reporter, and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party. From 1884 to 1886, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, though he did not graduate. [...] Lane later wrote, [...] "I put myself through college by working on vacation and after hours, and I am very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> did it." [...] He later received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of California, from New York University, Brown University, and the University of North Carolina. [...] After leaving college, he worked as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1889, he was admitted to the California Bar, having attended Hastings Law School.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian {{reflected}} on his song's popularity, [...] "I guess its success {{is due to}} it being a well-written pop ballad, coupled {{with the fact that}} it's perfectly suited to my voice, and also my back-story...

In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something of the joy of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards to people like Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, {{has much to do with}} Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E

[...] The casting director had Durand read a page of dialogue for the new character Keamy; Durand was offered the role in early October and he traveled to Honolulu in Hawaii—where Lost is filmed on location—by October 17, 2007. [...] A former stand-up comic and rapper from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, with the stage name [...] "Kevy D", Durand had seen only around six episodes of Lost by the time that he won the part.
