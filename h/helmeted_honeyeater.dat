2500|$|Victoria {{contains}} many topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas, {{ranging from the}} wet, temperate climate of Gippsland in the southeast to the snow-covered Victorian alpine areas which rise to almost , with Mount Bogong the highest peak at [...] There are extensive semi-arid plains {{to the west and}} northwest. There is an extensive series of river systems in Victoria. Most notable is the Murray River system. Other rivers include: Ovens River, Goulburn River, Patterson River, King River, Campaspe River, Loddon River, Wimmera River, Elgin River, Barwon River, Thomson River, Snowy River, Latrobe River, Yarra River, Maribyrnong River, Mitta River, Hopkins River, Merri River and Kiewa River. The state symbols include the pink heath (state flower), Leadbeater's possum (state animal) and the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (state bird).|$|E
50|$|When the {{population}} of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> reached a critically low level of 50 birds in May 1989, there was public interest in saving the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and the Friends of the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Honeyeater</b> Inc was formed. The Friends main aims are to protect existing habitat and plant future habitat for the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater,</b> to raise awareness about the plight of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and to enlist broad community support for the recovery project. The Friends are active in the recovery effort, providing voluntary support and labour and restoration of habitat. The group has been instrumental in attracting political support.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{establishment}} of Yellingo Nature Conservation Reserve, {{there have been a}} number of management plans in place to manage the nature reserve, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater,</b> and the lowland Leadbeater’s possum including: Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve Management Plan (2004), <b>Helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> recovery plan : 1989-1993, National Recovery Plan for the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Honeyeater</b> (2008).|$|E
50|$|<b>Helmeted</b> <b>honeyeaters</b> are sedentary, {{territorial}} {{and aggressive}} towards other bird species. In areas of suitable habitat their territories are clumped into colonies {{with some degree}} of communal defence of the colony area. Pairs rarely leave their territories, though some birds wander during the non-breeding period in search of food.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeaters</b> were patchily {{distributed}} in the mid-Yarra and Western Port catchments of central southern Victoria, in the South Eastern Highlands IBRA bioregion. Their range and population declined steadily through the 20th century, with the population reaching a low of 15 breeding pairs and about 50 individuals in late 1989, the year a recovery program began. Former colonies at Cockatoo and Upper Beaconsfield had become extinct not long before {{as a consequence of}} the Ash Wednesday bushfires of February 1983. Following the implementation of the recovery program the population increased to a peak of about 120 individuals in 1996, but has since declined to about 20 wild breeding pairs.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, the {{greatest}} {{benefit of the}} management of Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve has been saving the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and the lowland Leadbeater’s possum populations from extinction. Over the last 40 years, volunteer labour has positively contributed to weed and pest control, revegetation, fencing and other targeted conservation actions. After decades of effort to save the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and Leadbeater’s possum, many are concerned {{with a lack of}} progress. However, it is evident that without this effort the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> species, and possibly others species, would have become extinct.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} {{progress}} in phasing out stream-side cattle grazing licences in the Yellingbo Conservation Area {{to improve the}} habitat for the Leadbeater’s possum, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater,</b> and other threatened species. This will continue to improve the biodiversity values of the area’s waterways through better water quality and increased protection of native vegetation. Improvements to the condition of these riparian strips supports the required habitat for both the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and the Leadbeater’s possum. Partners continue {{to raise funds for}} purchase of adjacent land, a purchase of additional 3 hectares announced on 12 May 2016 by Trust for Nature. Both the Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum Inc and the Friends of the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Honeyeater</b> Inc regularly undertake revegetation works.|$|E
50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1867, and its range has greatly diminished since that date. Clearing {{of land in}} the Yarra Valley for agriculture and the draining of the Koo Wee Rup Swamp from the 1880s destroyed most of the habitat of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater.</b> Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve provides habitat for the last wild population of Victoria’s only endemic bird and its avifaunal emblem. The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is critically endangered (IUCN 2001 criterion B2abii,iii,v), is listed as Threatened in Schedule 2 of Victoria’s Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and classified as Critically Endangered on the Advisory List of Threatened Vertebrate Fauna in Victoria - 2013. It is listed as Endangered under the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
5000|$|On the 2007 {{advisory}} list {{of threatened}} vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> {{is listed as}} critically endangered.|$|E
50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is {{vulnerable}} to catastrophes such as fire, as fire will most likely cause severe damage to breeding territories. Availability of suitable breeding habitat limits the helmeted honeyeater’s reproduction ability. Expansion of habitat and limiting the further loss and degradation of present habitat, and supplementary feeding are key actions for effective management of the species. The current <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> population is recognised to have low genetic diversity which makes it vulnerable to inbreeding depression, and this lowers its ability to evolve to changing environments.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{general public}} access to the reserve, though birdwalks and {{counting}} tours are organised by the Friends of the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Honeyeater</b> and through Birdlife Australia.|$|E
50|$|Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve is {{the only}} place where all Victoria’s state {{terrestrial}} emblems, <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater,</b> Leadbeater’s possum and pink heath, {{can be found in the}} one place.|$|E
50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> {{subspecies}} {{is largely}} restricted to dense vegetation along riverbanks, {{dominated by the}} mountain swamp gum (Eucalyptus camphora) with a dense understorey of sedges and tussock grasses.|$|E
50|$|Back in Melbourne {{after the}} war, Johnson {{returned}} to his job. In 1948 he married Kathleen Hooppell. He was {{an active member of}} the Bird Observers Club (BOC). With other club members he worked hard towards protecting the critically endangered <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater,</b> found only in one small locality 50 km east of Melbourne. This involved both lobbying the state government to halt private land clearing on public land, and the physical labour of habitat rehabilitation work. His efforts led to the establishment of the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve in 1965 and the designation of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> as the state’s bird emblem.|$|E
50|$|As at May 2016, {{the wild}} {{population}} of <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is about 200, {{and is on}} an upwards trend. This has been due {{to a number of}} changes in the recovery program over the last few years. These changes have included predator training for the captive-bred birds before release, and releasing at an older age (now released at 12-months of age) in four-year old revegetation. A greater understanding of the health of the ecology of the area, including soil testing, has had a positive impact on the habitat. The main issue affecting the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> continues to be lack of habitat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> {{is one of}} four {{subspecies}} of the yellow-tufted honeyeater. The taxonomic {{history of}} L. m. cassidix is complicated. Schodde and Mason affirm its subspecific status but suggest that there is intergradation across eastern Victoria and south-eastern New South Wales between it and the nominate subspecies L. m. melanops. This conclusion disallows L. m. gippslandicus as a taxon, and suggests that cassidix occurs more widely through West Gippsland than is currently recognised. However genetic research, conducted on behalf of Victoria's <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> recovery team by Hayes, does not support Schodde and Mason’s subspecific arrangement, but confirms the distinctiveness of cassidix both as a taxon and the limits of its current geographic range to the Yellingbo area.|$|E
5000|$|Yellow-tufted honeyeaters, as a species, are {{not listed}} as {{threatened}} on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 or on any state-based legislation. However, at the subspecies level, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (L. m. cassidix) {{is considered to}} be a threatened species: ...|$|E
50|$|As {{part of its}} ‘Fighting Extinction’ program, Zoos Victoria manage captive-bred {{programs}} for the genetically-distinct lowland population of Leadbeater’s possum, and the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater.</b> The Leadbeater’s possum captive breeding program at Healesville Sanctuary commenced in May 2012, to prevent extinction of this population. As at October 2015, 16 individuals were held {{as part of the}} breeding program. This captive population aims to provide insurance against the extinction of the last lowland populations at Yellingbo. Since 1989, Zoos Victoria has been involved in the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> recovery program. Their work has included supplementing wild populations through captive breeding, and providing opportunities for visitors to connect with this iconic bird. Zoos Victoria {{play an important role in}} conducting research to improve captive breeding success and help monitor the survival of helmeted honeyeaters after release.|$|E
50|$|Nearby is the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, which {{contains}} {{three of the}} state of Victoria's emblems: The last remaining wild population of the state bird, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (Lichenostomus melanops cassidix). The geographically isolated state animal, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri). Finally, common-pink heath (Epacris impressa) is the state floral emblem.|$|E
50|$|Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve protects a {{diversity}} of flora and fauna including approximately 285 native flora species and 230 native vertebrate species. Significant species include the Leadbeater’s possum, <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater,</b> Epacris impressa (heath), Eastern Mourning Skink Lissolepsis coventryi, Green Scentbark Eucalyptus fulgens, Powerful Owl Ninox strenua, Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis.|$|E
50|$|As of November 6, 2014 The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> {{is listed}} as {{critically}} endangered on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria it {{is listed as}} critically endangered.|$|E
50|$|Harassment by bell miners {{is known}} to reduce {{breeding}} success in helmeted honeyeaters where their territories abut bell miner colonies, and several former <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> colony sites, {{as well as other}} patches of suitable habitat, are currently occupied by bell miners, a situation managed in the Yellingbo Reserve by the selective removal of bell miner colonies.|$|E
50|$|In 1965 the {{management}} of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> commenced at Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. The population was 200 at that time and declined to a critical level in the 1980s. In 1989 the Victorian Government commenced a recovery program, a recovery team was established and the program was reviewed and updated in 2008 supported by the Victorian and Commonwealth governments.|$|E
50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (Lichenostomus melanops cassidix) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} honeyeater family. It is {{a distinctive}} and critically endangered subspecies of the yellow-tufted honeyeater, {{that exists in the}} wild only as a tiny relict population in the Australian state of Victoria, in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. It is Victoria’s only endemic bird, and was adopted as one.|$|E
50|$|Healesville Sanctuary, {{formally}} {{known as}} the Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary, is a zoo specialising in native Australian animals. It is located at Healesville in rural Victoria, Australia, and {{has a history of}} breeding native animals. It is one of only two places to have successfully bred a platypus, the other being Sydney's Taronga Zoo. It also assists with a breeding population of the endangered <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater.</b>|$|E
5000|$|L. m. cassidix, <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater,</b> {{restricted}} to a five km length of remnant bushland along two streams in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, 50 km east of Melbourne in Victoria. It is the brightest and largest (weight 28 - 32 g) subspecies. In 2003 there were 103 {{individuals in the}} wild with 20 breeding pairs known {{as well as a}} further 34 birds in captivity at the Healesville Sanctuary.|$|E
5000|$|Published in 2013, the Yellingbo Investigation Final Report {{prepared}} by the Victorian Environmental Assessment Council (VEAC) [...] outlined a number of recommendations for {{the response of the}} Victorian Government. The report states that the ‘goal of saving the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and the lowland Leadbeater’s possum can be achieved in the long-term through integrated management process. Traditional conservation approaches are not relevant to Yellingbo as a large amount of remnant vegetation is on private land. A collaborative approach to managing the reserve and surrounding area is vital for the success of these species’. The report included a range of recommendations aimed at improving management arrangements including establishing a consolidated Yellingbo Conservation Area, appointing a co-ordinating committee to promote cooperation and to phase out grazing from the area’s stream frontages. The Victorian government supported all of VEAC’s recommendations in full or in principle, and the government and other lead agencies are implementing the accepted recommendations. Goals for implementation are improving the conservation of the biodiversity and ecological values, including the endangered <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and the lowland Leadbeater’s possum.|$|E
50|$|The wild {{population}} of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is now restricted to a five km length of remnant bushland along two streams in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve near Yellingbo, about 50 km east of central Melbourne, with a small colony of birds bred in captivity established near Tonimbuk in the Bunyip State Park within the historic range of the subspecies. Captive breeding colonies are held at Taronga Zoo in Sydney and at Healesville Sanctuary, 18 km north of Yellingbo.|$|E
50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is {{the largest}} and most brightly {{coloured}} of the yellow-tufted honeyeater subspecies. It has a distinctive black mask between the yellow throat, pointed yellow ear-tufts and the fixed “helmet” of golden plushlike feathers on the forehead hello, with a dull golden crown and nape demarcated from the dark olive-brown back and wings. The underparts are mainly olive-yellow. It is 17 - 23 cm long, weighing 30 - 40 g, with males larger than the females.|$|E
50|$|Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve {{is under}} {{considerable}} threat from such events as altered hydrology, declining native vegetation, pest animals and plant, and inappropriate fire regimes. Conservation {{management of the}} reserve is complex, {{with half of the}} original vegetation in patchy distribution. Invasive weeds include blackberry, gorse, Spanish heath, ragwort and St John’s wort, and introduced predators such as foxes, Fallow and Samba deer. A major threat to the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> comes from another native bird, the bell miner (Manorina melanophrys).|$|E
50|$|In 2015 Greening Australia {{commenced}} {{a three-year}} project to increase habitat and improve vegetation condition to support wild {{populations of the}} <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> and Leadbeater's possum. Greening Australia will work with six partner agencies and two friends groups to deliver: improved habitat quality for these species and enhanced connectivity between existing populations; increased duration and availability of food resources and availability of nesting sites for helmeted honeyeaters through additional 650,000 trees and shrubs; and increased spatial extent of Eucalyptus camphora woodland and associated riparian vegetation by 100 hectares.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, with {{increasing}} community concern about declining <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> numbers, and following recommendations from the Victorian Ornithological Research Group and the Bird Observers Club (now Birdlife Australia) some areas, including sections of public land along the Woori Yallock, Cockatoo and Sheep Station Creeks, were reserved as the Yellingbo State Wildlife Reserve by the Victorian Government for wildlife conservation. Subsequently, several adjoining areas were acquired by Government by purchase or donation, increasing the protected area. In 1994 the Victorian Land Conservation Council recommended {{that most of}} these, {{as well as some}} other areas, should be consolidated as the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Since then, further small parcels of land {{have been added to the}} reserve.|$|E
5000|$|Conservation {{management}} of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is directed at both the honeyeater population and its habitat. Population management involves routine monitoring of all breeding attempts, the protection of nests from predators, the establishment of new wild populations through the release of captive-bred birds, the supplementation of wild populations with captive-reared birds by the release of immature birds {{and the addition of}} eggs or nestlings to wild nests, and by minimising the risk of inbreeding depression by swapping eggs and nestlings between populations. [...] Habitat management focuses on the control of erosion and siltation in order to help reestablish a natural flood regime within the Yellingbo reserve, as well as to control weeds and pest animals, to revegetate degraded areas, and to rehabilitate habitat on private land adjacent to the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Victoria's {{northern}} border follows {{a straight line}} from Cape Howe {{to the start of the}} Murray River and then follows the Murray River as the remainder of the {{northern border}}. On the Murray River, the border is the southern bank of the river. This precise definition was not established until 1980, when a ruling by Justice Ninian Stephen of the High Court of Australia settled the question as to which state had jurisdiction in the unlawful death of a man on an island in the middle of the river. The ruling clarified that no part of the watercourse is in Victoria. The border also rests at the southern end of the Great Dividing Range, which stretches along the east coast and terminates west of Ballarat. It is bordered by South Australia to the west and shares Australia's shortest land border with Tasmania. The official border between Victoria and Tasmania is at 39°12' S, which passes through Boundary Islet in the Bass Strait for 85 metres.Victoria contains many topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas, ranging from the wet, temperate climate of Gippsland in the southeast to the snow-covered Victorian alpine areas which rise to almost 2000 m, with Mount Bogong the highest peak at 1,986 m. There are extensive semi-arid plains to the west and northwest. There is an extensive series of river systems in Victoria. Most notable is the Murray River system. Other rivers include: Ovens River, Goulburn River, Patterson River, King River, Campaspe River, Loddon River, Wimmera River, Elgin River, Barwon River, Thomson River, Snowy River, Latrobe River, Yarra River, Maribyrnong River, Mitta River, Hopkins River, Merri River and Kiewa River. The state symbols include the pink heath (state flower), Leadbeater's possum (state animal) and the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (state bird).|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{sensitivity}} and elasticity analyses of matrix population {{models have been}} used to inform management decisions, but they ignore the economic costs of manipulating vital rates. For example, the growth rate of a population is often most sensitive to changes in adult survival rate, but {{this does not mean that}} increasing that rate is the best option for managing the population because it may be much more expensive than other options. To explore how managers should optimize their manipulation of vital rates, we incorporated the cost of changing those rates into matrix population models. We derived analytic expressions for locations in parameter space where managers should shift between management of fecundity and survival, for the balance between fecundity and survival management at those boundaries, and for the allocation of management resources to sustain that optimal balance. For simple matrices, the optimal budget allocation can often be expressed as simple functions of vital rates and the relative costs of changing them. We applied our method to management of the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Honeyeater</b> (Lichenostomus melanops cassidix; an endangered Australian bird) and the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) as examples. Our method showed that cost-efficient management of the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Honeyeater</b> should focus on increasing fecundity via nest protection, whereas optimal koala management should focus on manipulating both fecundity and survival simultaneously. These findings are contrary to the cost-negligent recommendations of elasticity analysis, which would suggest focusing on managing survival in both cases. A further investigation of <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Honeyeater</b> management options, based on an individual-based model incorporating density dependence, spatial structure, and environmental stochasticity, confirmed that fecundity management was the most cost-effective strategy. Our results demonstrate that decisions that ignore economic factors will reduce management efficiency. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology...|$|E
40|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is a {{striking}} yellow, green and black, medium-sized honeyeater with distinctive yellow crown and ear tufts that contrast boldly with black sides of the head. The upperparts are greenish olive, and underparts yellow to greyish yellow. The forehead carries the distinctive short crest, or helmet, of upstanding yellow feathers which can be pushed forward when the bird is aroused. The <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> is confined to dense riparian forest in the mid-Yarra and Western Port drainages of southern Victoria. All of the current wild population is dependant on remnant patches of Eucalyptus camphora swamp woodland and adjacent Leptospermum lanigerum or Melaleuca squarrosa shrubland. The population of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>honeyeater</b> declined steadily throughout the 1900 s until the present recovery effort commenced in 1989. Former colonies at Cockatoo and Upper Beaconsfield died out as recently as 1983 following severe wildfires in February of that year (Menkhorst & Middleton 1991). The last naturally-occurring population comprised 15 breeding pairs and about 50 individuals in late 1989. Through implementation of the first recovery plan, the wild population peaked at about 110 wild individuals, including 27 breeding pairs in March 1996. It has since declined to 12 breeding pairs in the 2007 / 08 breeding season, confined to a five kilometre length of streamside remnant vegetation along two streams within the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve (Yellingbo NCR), 50 km east of Melbourne. A second wild population is being established in Bunyip State Park, 70 km east-south-east of Melbourne, through release of captive-bred birds. In January 2008, 34 individuals including nine breeding pairs, had been identified.
