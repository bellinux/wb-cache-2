The story, ostensibly set during the years 1111-27 (during the Northern Song Dynasty), centers on Ximen Qing (西門慶), a corrupt social climber and lustful merchant who is wealthy enough to marry six wives and concubines. After Pan Jinlian secretly murders her husband, Ximen Qing takes her as one of his wives. The story follows the domestic sexual struggles of the women within his household as they clamor for prestige and influence amidst the gradual decline of the Ximen clan. In Water Margin, Ximen Qing was brutally killed in broad daylight by Wu Song; in Jin Ping Mei, Ximen Qing in the end dies from an overdose of aphrodisiacs administered by Jinlian in order to keep him aroused.

The paper is organized as follows: section two defines undernutrition and discusses the magnitude of the problem, implications for long-term human capital development, and how and when to <b>intervene.</b> <b>Section</b> three describes CCT programs, including conceptual foundations for applying conditionality's, the position of CCTs in the current development paradigm, and reasons for their widespread popularity.

This study {{provides information on}} the HPV types detected in cervical cancers of Alaska Native (AN) women. Methods. Cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in AN women aged 18 and above between 1980 and 2007 were identified from the Alaska Native Tumor Registry. A representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived pathology block was retrieved and serially sectioned to allow histologic confirmation of lesion (first and last sections) and PCR testing of <b>intervening</b> <b>sections.</b> Extracted DNA was tested for HPV using Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Diagnostics) with additional INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Assay (Innogenetics) testing on negative or inadequate specimens. All specimens were tested for a minimum 37 HPV types. Results. Of 62 cervical cancer specimens evaluated, 57 (91. 9 %) contained one or more HPV types. Thirty-eight (61. 2 %) cancers contained HPV types 16 or 18, and 18 (29 %) contained an oncogenic type other than type 16 or 18. Conclusions. Overall, almost two-thirds (61. 2 %) of the archived cervical cancers had detectible HPV types 16 or 18, a finding similar to studies of US women.

40|$|The {{inhibitor}} cystine knot (ICK) is {{an unusual}} three-disulfide architecture in {{which one of the}} disulfide bonds bisects a loop formed by the two other disulfide bridges and the <b>intervening</b> <b>sections</b> of the protein backbone. Peptides containing an ICK motif are frequently considered to have high levels of thermal, chemical and enzymatic stability due to cross-bracing provided by the disulfide bonds. Experimental studies supporting this contention are rare, in particular for spider-venom toxins, which represent the largest diversity of ICK peptides. We used ω-hexatoxin-Hv 1 a (Hv 1 a), an insecticidal toxin from the deadly Australian funnel-web spider, as a model system to examine the contribution of the cystine knot to the stability of ICK peptides. We show that Hv 1 a is highly stable when subjected to temperatures up to 75 °C, pH values as low as 1, and various organic solvents. Moreover, Hv 1 a was highly resistant to digestion by proteinase K and when incubated in insect hemolymph and human plasma. We demonstrate that the ICK motif is essential for the remarkable stability of Hv 1 a, with the peptide’s stability being dramatically reduced when the disulfide bonds are eliminated. Thus, this study demonstrates that the ICK motif significantly enhances the chemical and thermal stability of spider-venom peptides and provides them {{with a high level of}} protease resistance. This study also provides guidance to the conditions under which Hv 1 a could be stored and deployed as a bioinsecticide...|$|E

Those {{studies showed that}} hormone binding and disposal in brain are saturable processes. To describe the processes quantitatively, regional distribution, binding and metabolism of T 3 in rat brain were measured and a mathematical model developed. ^ Methods. Forty-five adult rats were studied in the awake state: twenty-five received HSA (125 I) -labeled T 3 (T 3) (trace group), the remainder received unlabeled T 3 plus {{the same amount of}} T 3 (load group). Timed arterial blood samples were taken before and at frequent intervals during the 5 hour post injection period; T 3 in the plasma was identified and quantified by paper chromatography. Brains were obtained at 5, 20, 60, 180 and 300 minutes after i. v. T 3 administration, and were sectioned for thaw-mount ARG, using simultaneously-exposed (125 I) labeled tissue standards. Concentrations of (125 I) in ARGs of cerebellum, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus and amygdala were measured by densitometry; <b>intervening</b> <b>sections</b> were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography to determine the nature and proportions of labeled tissue iodothyronines. ^ Results. A four compartment metabolic model representing the conversion of T 3 to diiodothyronine (T 2) and iodide describes regional T 3 deiodinative metabolism in the trace group. The dynamics of the first (intravascular) compartment were described by the T 3 plasma curve; the second compartment represented T 3 binding within the brain; the third and fourth compartments represented the metabolites generated from monodeiodinase activity, namely T 2 and iodide. In the load group, an additional compartment representing all other T 3 -related processes was necessary to model central T 3 kinetics. Rate constants between compartments were determined by solving the associated differential equations. ^ Conclusions. Quantitative information about in vivo T 3 metabolism in the adult rat brain has been obtained using the method of compartmental modeling. This model provides a tool for evaluating normal and abnormal T 3 processing in the brain. ...|$|E
