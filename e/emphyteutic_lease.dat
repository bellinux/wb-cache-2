50|$|The network {{makes use}} of towpaths on river banks and disused railway or vicinal tramway lines. Old railway lines have been leased by the Walloon Government for 99 years using <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>lease</b> contracts.

5000|$|The Locorotondo {{countryside}} is {{an example}} of an area of dispersed settlements (jazzelere) and has an abundance of trulli dwellings which were built around a communal area called [...] "jazzile". This settlement pattern is {{due in large part to}} <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>leases,</b> particularly in the 19th century for the development of vineyards.|$|R
50|$|Anthony Galt {{has written}} an {{extensive}} {{study of the}} dispersed settlement pattern around Locorotondo in the Province of Bari in southern Italy. In this case, the settlement pattern developed because of movement from the town to the countryside in the 19th century. <b>Emphyteutic</b> <b>leases</b> were used by landowners seeking to increase their income from land that was only marginally attractive for agriculture by encouraging the creation of vineyards.|$|R
50|$|Adding to the {{development}} of the underground city was the Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission's policy of offering the aerial rights above Metro station entrances for construction through <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>leases,</b> an advantageous way to acquire prime real estate. When the Metro began running in 1966, ten buildings were already connected directly to Metro stations; development would continue until only three free-standing station entrances (Square-Victoria-OACI, St-Laurent and Place-des-Arts) remained in the central segment.|$|R

50|$|In Belgium RAVeL, French for réseau {{autonome}} de voies lentes (autonomous {{network of}} slow ways), is a Walloon initiative aimed at creating {{a network of}} itineraries reserved for pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders and people with reduced mobility. The network makes use of towpaths on river banks and disused railway or vicinal tramway lines.

5000|$|As {{a member}} of the [...] "Vassouras branch" [...] of the Brazilian Imperial Family, he did not share in the income which still flows from all land {{transactions}} in Petrópolis under the nineteenth century <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>lease</b> (in contrast to the rival [...] "Petrópolis branch") and was thus able to live comfortably, but [...] "without great luxury". He had no car. He traveled around Rio de Janeiro on foot or by bus. With regard to his lifestyle, he once stated in an interview: [...] "We lead a normal life; we are citizens like everyone else and work to live".|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} thorough description {{of physical and}} codicological characteristics and information on the contents of 17 codes preserved by the clergy of the Senigallia’s Diocese, {{in order to produce}} a kind of inventory. Manuscripts contain some of the documents produced between XIV and XV centuries by the bishops of Senigallia, who played the parts of both the community’s spiritual leaders that of country lords. Therefore, these codes present a wide variety of documents, in particular <b>emphyteutic</b> agreements, <b>leases,</b> purchases of animals and lands, castles’ councils, elections of notaries alongside pastoral visits, inquisitional proceedings, excommunications, synods and tax collections. Some manuscripts are included in the category of notarial registers or “bastardelli”, others have an unambiguous content (e. g. the Codex Gladii is a liber inquisitionum whereas the Miscellaneorum «M» Codex III is also called “code of tithes”), while still others have a miscellaneous content...|$|R

50|$|Philippe Méaille, who {{has lived}} for 15 years in Anjou, works in {{parallel}} with Christian Gillet, {{the president of the}} department of Maine-et-Loire, to study the possibility of creating a museum of contemporary art in Anjou, and to install his collection in the château de Montsoreau, a then departmental property. After six months of studies of the alternative offers, leaks in the press install a polemic. Frédéric Béatse, then head of the left wing list in the regional elections, regrets that the right-wing majority of the department of Maine-et-Loire is « throwing away the family jewels. » «This is all the more shocking, Jacques Auxiette (then president of the Region Pays de la Loire) had proposed to the Department council a partnership between the Abbey of Fontevraud and Montsoreau to make this Saumur area even more attractive. » Christian Gillet, president of the department of Maine-et-Loire made his decision on Friday, June 19, 2015 and gave the keys of the Château de Montsoreau to Philippe Méaille through an <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>lease</b> of 25 years. At the same time he engaged a reflection on contemporary art as a cultural and touristic priority for the development of Maine-et-Loire.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is to complexly discuss the rights to use the land. The purpose of this thesis is particulary to analyse the valid legal {{regulation}} {{of the right to}} use the land after the Civil Code recodification, but for better ceherence we must also discuss the history and development of the rights to use the land that the actual legislation comes from. Pivotal part of the thesis presents the institute of lease the land and <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>lease,</b> while it is just <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>lease,</b> which plays significant role in presented issue. The thesis also informs about another land-use institutes such as commodatum, precarium and fructus a ususfructus of the land. Last part of the thesis is focused on the special legal regulation which is contained out of the Civil Code. The thesis discusses the managment of the state property and restrictions which are contained in several special acts such as Forestry Act or Act on the Protection of Nature and the Landscape...|$|E
40|$|The French public {{procurement}} contracts at large, including the public markets - public Works or services contracts – the delegation public service, public-private partnership contract or even the administrative <b>emphyteutic</b> <b>lease</b> are close as these contracts aims to procure a good or service to a public entity. But these contracts are classified and specialized, as France does not know a single and generic type of contract for its relation between {{the administration and the}} private sector. This categorization is rigid and complex. It is thus extremely difficult in France to create new forms of contract, {{due to the fact that}} each contract must enter into a predefined and pre-existing category. If the strict supervision of contracts of public seems dictated by a desire to secure the relationship between the administration and its contractors, it may nevertheless be asked whether this principle of categorization does not be an additional cost to the contractors and the same administration...|$|E
