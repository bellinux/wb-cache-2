40|$|The {{osteology}} of I Ichthyotringa africana {{from the}} marine Upper Cretaceous of the Eurafrican Mesogeais studied and the systematic position of Ichthyotringa discussed. Four apomorphies prove that this genusbelongs to the Aulopiformes: {{the presence of}} postero-medial processes on the pelvic bones, the epipleural seriesbeginning from the first vertebra, the first <b>epipleurals</b> located {{at the level of}} the horizontal septum, and the preuralneural spine 1 reduced and spatulate. The lengthening of the snout, the very large buccal cavity, the development ofthe palatine and pterygoid dentition, and the premaxilla and maxilla bordering the gape are four characters whichrefer Ichthyotringa to the Enchodontoidei. The numerous plesiomorphies kept by this fish and its rare apomorphies show that it is one of the most primitive genera within the suborder...|$|E
40|$|The {{transient}} larval {{structures of}} vertebrae, {{blood vessels and}} the digestive tract were carefully examined during growth. Constrictions appear in the notochords of larvae prior to formation of the vertebral column. Larvae develop the dorso-lateral condyles between the first vertebra and the exoccipitals, differentiated neural and hemal spines, pleural ribs and <b>epipleurals.</b> The digestive organs exhibit sequential development but structures are not lost or degenerated with growth. The ventral vein beneath the cardinal aorta fragments and degenerates during the transition of larvae to juveniles, and is replaced by the dorsal vein. The formation of the dorsal vein completes beneath the cardinal aorta in larvae about 7. 0 mm TL. This apparent shift of the ventral to the dorsal vein in the tail differs from the subsequent shift in the trunk where the ventral vein does not degenerate. The dorsal vein completes from the trunk to the tail until 14 mm TL...|$|E
40|$|The {{osteology}} of Protobrama avus, of a {{new species}} of this genus, P. woodwardi, and of two new monospecific genera of protobramid fishes, Eusebichthys byblosi and Abisaadichthys libanicus, is studied. Protobramidae are small deep-bodied marine teleosts from the Lower Cenomanian of Lebanon. They are characterised by the gomphosis of the neural and haemal arches on the centra all along the axial skeleton, the loss of segmentation on the dorsal and anal fin rays, the small cycloid scales covering {{the basis of the}} unpaired fins, the ribs fused with the haemapophyses, the loss of epicentrals and <b>epipleurals,</b> the loss of epurals, the reduced number (4 or 5) of hypurals and the fusion of hypurals 3 and 4 into a dorsal hypural plate. The skull is medio-parietal. The temporal fossa is dorsally bordered by the parietal. The jaws are feebly toothed or toothless. The maxillary, which is bordering the mouth, is always toothless. The supramaxillaries are lost. The possible synonymy of the Protobramidae and Plethodidae (or Tselfatiidae) as well as the integration of the Protobramidae, the Araripichthyidae and the Ferrifronsidae into a suborder of the Protobramoidei are discussed and rejected. The analysis of the protobramid characters leads to range them as a valid family in the clupeocephalan order Tselfatiiformes near the Plethodidae...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological Sciences. Researching cryptic {{biodiversity}} is an integrative {{process that}} uses a “total evidence” approach to identify population-level evolutionary lineages (species). Cryptic species of aroids have been discovered but the existence of cryptic pollinator species has not been addressed. The highly polymorphic scarab beetle, Cyclocephala sexpunctata, is a hypothesized pollinator of two cryptic aroid species. This research integrates detailed morphological data, spatial and distribution data, mitochondrial CO 1 sequence data and host plant associations {{to test the hypothesis}} that cryptic species of Cyclocephala are visiting aroid flowers. Nine morphologically similar Cyclocephala species were included to address identification problems among similar species. A new country record was found for C. pan (Honduras). A female paratype specimen of C. letiranti was determined to be a female C. sexpunctata raising the possibility that there are no female type specimens of C. letiranti. Four unique male paramere forms (morphotypes) were found in C. sexpunctata and the allied species C. brevis. These paramere forms were associated with four female morphotypes that have a diagnostic form of the ventral surface of the <b>epipleural</b> pillow. The ventral form of the female <b>epipleural</b> pillow is described {{here for the first time}} and is a new character for the genus Cyclocephala. Detailed elevational and distribution data indicate that the morphotypes of C. sexpunctata and C. brevis are rarely collected together at specific localities. A checklist of cyclocephaline floral associations was compiled. Examination of voucher specimens and published floral associations indicate that the morphotypes described here visit different species of flowers within their hypothesized elevational range. Mitochondrial CO 1 data demonstrate that C. sexpunctata is polyphyletic but the monophyly of C. brevis could not be addressed. The combination of these datasets indicates that the morphotypes described here are cryptic species though their taxonomy remains unresolved due to large numbers of synonyms...|$|R

40|$|The genus Hydrodessus {{is readily}} distinguished, {{from the other}} small water beetles related to the Old World Bidessus, {{by the lack of}} pronotal or elytral plicae, by the {{structure}} of the hind coxal processes, and by the simple, unjointed parameres of the male genitalia (Balfour-Browne, 1953). The species are very rare in collections, and several are still known from only the unique types. The genus Brinkius (Guignot, 1957) differs from Hydrodessus only in that a fine lateral humeral carina is present on the elytron above the <b>epipleural</b> margin. In all other characters, including the unique parameres of the male genitalia, the two genera seem to be identical, and I therefore apply the older name to both groups. The two new species described below from Suriname extend the range of this genus north of the Amazon basin. All the previously described species are from Brasil or the Amazonas region of Perú. The species from Perú were described by Spangler (1966). Of these, Hydrodessus nanayensis is exceedingly similar to the genotype H. siolii Balfour-Browne described from the state of Pará, Brasil.

40|$|Ramnogaster arcuata (Jenyns, 1842) and Platanichthys platana (Regan, 1917), {{found at}} the estuary of Lagoa dos Patos and coastal lagoon (Lagoa Mirim) at the South of Brazil, are two {{sympatric}} clupeid fishes with very similar features. In order to clarify their taxonomic and geographical situation, delimiting its occurrence in fresh waters, a comparative study of the bony structures of the head, anal and dorsal fins and ventral scutes of these two sardines was developed. The osteological study with clear and stain technique included {{more information about the}} differentiation of the groups from the bones of the supramaxilla, dentary, pterygiophore and <b>epipleural</b> ribs. Variations on the body shape of those species were analyzed through the multivariate morphometry, in order to obtain differentiation patterns between the groups. Thirty specimens were selected from each species. The measurements were obtained by truss network, by using 10 homologous anatomical landmarks. The analysis of the principal components, adjusted by Burnaby's orthogonal projection, indicated two main groups, separated along the PC 1. which explained 63. 2 % of the variation between groups. The diagnostic characters that differentiate R. arcuata from P. platana, were related to segments of distance of the head, longitudinal growth, body height and caudal peduncle. Furthermore, two groups of P. platana were found. In spite of their morphological similarities, they presented a differentiation gradient between the estuary population of the Patos Lagoon and the Mirim Lagoon, possibly resulting from two ecologically different environments...|$|R
40|$|The body {{curvature}} {{displayed by}} fishes differs remarkably between species. Some nonmuscular features (e. g., number of vertebrae) {{are known to}} influence axial flexibility, but we have poor knowledge {{of the influence of}} the musculotendinous system (myosepta and muscles). Whereas this system has been described in stiff-bodied fishes, we have little data on flexible fishes. In this study, we present new data on the musculotendinous system of a highly flexible fish and compare them to existing data on rigid fishes. We use microdissections with polarized light microscopy to study the three-dimensional anatomy of myoseptal tendons, histology and immunohistology to study the insertion of muscle fiber types into tendons, and µ-CT scans to study skeletal anatomy. Results are compared with published data from stiff-bodied fishes. We identify four important morphological differences between stiff-bodied fishes and Carapus acus : (1) Carapus bears short tendons in the horizontal septum, whereas rigid fishes have elongated tendons. (2) Carapus bears short lateral tendons in its myosepta, whereas stiff-bodied fishes bear elongated tendons. Because of its short myoseptal tendons, Carapus retains high axial flexibility. In contrast, elongated tendons restrict axial flexibility in rigid fishes but are able to transmit anteriorly generated muscle forces through long tendons down to the tail. (3) Carapus bears distinct epineural and <b>epipleural</b> tendons in its myosepta, whereas these tendons are weak or absent in rigid fishes. As these tendons firmly connect vertebral axis and skin in Carapus, we consider them to constrain lateral displacement of the vertebral axis during extreme body flexures. (4) Ossifications of myoseptal tendons are only present in C. acus and other more flexible fishes but are absent in rigid fishes. The functional reasons for this remain unexplained...|$|R
