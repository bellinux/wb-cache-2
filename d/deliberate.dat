Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory air strikes against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation <b>Deliberate</b> Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation <b>Deliberate</b> Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia.|$|E

Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). <b>Deliberate</b> non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or <b>deliberate</b> oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E

40|$|Background: Traumatic experiences, such {{as natural}} disasters, produce {{multiple}} and serious impacts on people. Despite the traditional focus on negative consequences, {{in many cases}} there are also positive consequences, such as posttraumatic growth. Tedeschi and Calhoun proposed a model of posttraumatic growth that emphasizes the role of rumination after the basic beliefs breakdown due to the occurrence of a traumatic experience. Method: A total of 238 volunteers affected by two major earthquakes and tsunami alerts in northern Chile on April 1 and 2, 2014, responded to an online survey measuring subjective severity, basic beliefs change, social share of emotion, rumination, posttraumatic stress, and posttraumatic growth. Results: Path analyses reveal that posttraumatic stress goes through a negative change in basic beliefs, intrusive rumination, and <b>deliberated</b> rumination, meanwhile posttraumatic growth is only achieved directly from a positive change in basic beliefs and <b>deliberated</b> rumination. Discussion: The model {{is consistent with the}} empirical model obtained in Chilean people affected by the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on 27 February, 2010, but it is slightly different and in a form that is more consistent with Tedeschi and Calhoun’s theoretical model. Both models remark on the role of <b>deliberated</b> rumination in posttraumatic growth and failure to progress from intrusive to <b>deliberated</b> rumination in posttraumatic stress, but the proposed one is more parsimonious and assumes subjective severity as an antecedent to basic belief changes. These conclusions must be considered in light of limitations that a cross-sectional design and the correlational nature of the statistical analysis carried out impose. Highlights of the article: Role of subjective severity, change of basic beliefs, social sharing of emotion, and rumination on posttraumatic stress and growth were modeled from responses of people affected by the April 1 – 2, 2014, northern Chilean earthquakes. Posttraumatic stress goes through negative changes in basic beliefs, intrusive rumination, and <b>deliberated</b> rumination. Posttraumatic growth is achieved from positive changes in basic beliefs and <b>deliberated</b> rumination. <b>Deliberated</b> rumination and moving from intrusive to <b>deliberated</b> rumination appear as cornerstones in posttraumatic processing...|$|R

5|$|Only {{recently}} have attempts to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. <b>Deliberate</b> self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for <b>deliberate</b> self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E
