40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) {{belongs to}} the family of Hepeviridae and to the genus Hepevirus. It is a small non-enveloped, positive-sense, {{single-stranded}} RNA virus of approximately 7. 2 kb and have 3 open reading frames (ORF's) in its genome. HEV are grouped into four genotypes; genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to humans and genotypes 3 and 4 infecting humans, pigs, rabbits and other animals. Genotype 1 and 2 are the most important causes of acute hepatitis in developing countries and is often a hygiene problem, while in developed countries the genotypes 3 and 4 seems to be of zoonotic nature i. e. originating from animals. The most common transmission is the faecal-oral route by drinking contaminated water or eating raw or poorly cooked meat of infected wild animals. The other routes, parentally and perinatal, occur sporadically. Rabbits may be a reservoir for HEV that cause infection in humans and therefore rabbit HEV may be of zoonotic risk. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the prevalence of rabbit HEV among rabbits from petting farms, production farms and wild rabbit populations in the Netherlands. HEV were tested with RT-PCR in faecal samples of petting farm rabbits and faecal and liver samples of farmed and wild rabbits. The primers and probe targeted the ORF 3 region of the genome and were amplify a 70 base pair fragment. HEV RNA was detected in 23 % (8 / 35) of faecal samples from petting farm rabbits and in 16 % (5 / 32) of faecal and 60 % (18 / 30) of liver samples from wild rabbits. In Beijing, China they have found in <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits</b> a prevalence of 7 % in faecal samples and 60 % in serum samples. In Virginia, USA they have found in <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits</b> a prevalence of 15 % in faecal samples and 16 % in serum samples and in France they have found in <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits</b> a prevalence of 7 % in bile samples and in wild rabbits a prevalence of 23 % in liver samples. Previous research has shown that in infected swine the amount of HEV in liver and bile were similar and higher than in faecal samples. The expectation was that liver samples had a higher prevalence because of the replication of HEV in the liver. No HEV RNA was detected in <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The results of this study indicate that petting farm and wild rabbits can be infected with rabbit HEV and that the <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits</b> were not infected. Therefore rabbit HEV can be a zoonotic risk to humans in the Netherlands via consumption of infected wild rabbits or direct contact with the HEV infected petting farm rabbits. Further studies are needed to investigate whether HEV strains in Dutch rabbits are closely related to human HEV strains...|$|E

40|$|Within the Welfare Quality® project {{protocols}} {{have been}} developed to assess animal welfare on-farm in an objective, science based and practically applicable way. For various species like broilers and laying hens, sows and growing pigs, dairy cattle and veal calves, welfare assessment protocols {{have been developed}}, but not for commercially housed rabbits. In the current project we made a first step for the development of protocols to assess the welfare of <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits,</b> based on the Welfare Quality® framework. We did a literature study, describing possible parameters for the different criteria and principles as used in Welfare Quality®. In this first phase we focused on reproductive does (including non-lactating does) and meat rabbits, because it is the majority of the <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The protocol can easily be extended to rearing does and bucks. Where no scientific literature was available, expert opinion was used to find possible parameters. A workshop was set-up for this purpose with experts in the field of welfare of rabbits from The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Italy and Spain. The information of the literature study and expert opinion was brought together in a proposed set of protocols and techniques to measure the parameters on-farm in commercially housed rabbits. For most of the parameters animals based measures can be used, except for absence of prolonged thirst. Examples of animal-based measures are body condition for absence of hunger, lying in fully stretched position and simultaneously resting for comfort and resting, respiration rate and red ears for thermal comfort, skin damages/wounds for absence of injuries, condition of eyes, ears, skin and nose for absence of diseases, a human approach test for good human-animal behaviour. However, for some parameters scoring methods need to be developed before they can be included in a definitive set of measures (e. g. body condition score, emaciated rabbits at the slaughter plant). For some criteria such as appropriate behavior {{further research is needed to}} develop tests that also need to be validated before they can be used in a definite assessment protocol. In conclusion, the proposed set of animal-based and resource-based measures for rabbit welfare is the basis for further development of a welfare assessment protocol for <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits.</b> After development of techniques and validation of tests, measures should be tested in practice at commercial rabbit farms. Subsequently, these data will be used to adapt the protocols and define a first version of the welfare assessment protocol for commercially housed rabbits...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to being an important human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus is able to cause a variety of infections in numerous other host species. While the S. aureus strains causing infection in several of these hosts have been well characterised, {{this is not the}} case for companion rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), where little data are available on S. aureus strains from this host. To address this deficiency we have performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing and genome sequencing on a collection of S. aureus isolates from companion rabbits. The findings show a diverse S. aureus population is able to cause infection in this host, and while antimicrobial resistance was uncommon, the isolates possess a range of known and putative virulence factors consistent with a diverse clinical presentation in companion rabbits including severe abscesses. We additionally show that companion rabbit isolates carry polymorphisms within dltB as described as underlying host-adaption of S. aureus to <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The availability of S. aureus genome sequences from companion rabbits provides an important aid to understanding the pathogenesis of disease in this host and in the clinical management and surveillance of these infections...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive {{bacterium}} that colonizes {{a variety of}} animal species [1]. S. aureus infections in animals are most commonly reported {{as a cause of}} mastitis in dairy-producing animals (including cattle and goats) and “bumblefoot ” in chickens [2], as well as being identified as a pathogen of <b>farmed</b> <b>rabbits</b> [3]. Most reports characterizing animal-associated S. aureus have demonstrated that strains affecting animals are distinct from those in-fecting humans, suggesting that there are host-specific lineages which only rarely cross species boundaries [4]. Livestock-associated strains may evolve on farms because of the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. These may be used as feed additives for growth promotion in industrial livestock and poultry [5], for prevention of disease within a herd, or for treatment of an existing disease outbreak. Agricultural-use antibiotics include many classes that are relevant for human health, including tetracyclines, macrolides, penicillins, and sulfonamides, among others.

To investigate this possibility, 19 rabbits of different sizes and breeds were housed in small pens equivalent to floor areas of hutches (0. 88 m 2), medium pens approximately twice the floor area of conventional hutches (1. 68 m 2), and large pens approximately 4 times the floor area of conventional hutches (3. 35 m 2). Through scan sampling, 24 -hour time budgets of the rabbits were determined and their response to a change in enclosure size was assessed by continuously sampling their behavior for 2 hours after their transfer into different-sized pens. Mixed model analysis using rabbit as the repeated measure found that rabbits were generally more active and interacted more with environmental resources in larger pens compared with smaller pens (P < 0. 05). Also, rabbits exhibited a rebound effect in activity and rearing when moved from a smaller sized pen to a larger sized pen (P < 0. 05). These findings show that larger pens provide behavioral opportunities that are restricted in smaller pens, and suggest that smaller hutches can jeopardize rabbit welfare. Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
