25|$|On April 11, 1970, Flight <b>Director</b> <b>Gene</b> Kranz {{gives the}} go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for the Apollo 13 launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After {{the third stage}} fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert {{performs}} the maneuver to connect the Command/Service Module Odyssey to the Lunar Module Aquarius and pull {{it away from the}} spent rocket.|$|E
25|$|Aaron was {{off duty}} when the Apollo 13 {{explosion}} occurred, but was quickly called to Mission Control {{to assist in}} the rescue and recovery effort. Flight <b>Director</b> <b>Gene</b> Kranz put Aaron in charge of the Lunar Module's power supply. He was allowed to veto the ideas of other engineers, particularly when they affected the power usage of the modules. He was in charge of rationing the spacecraft's power during the return flight and devised an innovative power up sequence that allowed the Command Module to re-enter safely while operating on limited battery power.|$|E
25|$|Following {{their victory}} over Oregon for the {{national}} championship, the team returned to Columbus on January 13, where they were greeted by fans upon their arrival at Port Columbus International Airport, as well as {{when they returned to}} the campus. On January 18, the official championship celebration was held at Ohio Stadium, which was attended by an estimated 45,000 fans. The event included a performance by the Ohio State University Marching Band, as well as speeches from athletic <b>director</b> <b>Gene</b> Smith, head coach Urban Meyer, Braxton Miller, and Ezekiel Elliott.|$|E

5000|$|Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden. <b>Directors</b> <b>Gene</b> Kelly and Stanley Donen {{insisted that}} Reynolds was always first {{in their minds}} for the role. Although the film {{revolves}} around the idea that Kathy has to dub over for Lina's voice, in the scene where Kathy is dubbing a line of Lina's dialogue ("Our love will last 'til the stars turn cold"), Jean Hagen's normal voice is used.|$|R
50|$|The two {{attempted}} to shop the script around Hollywood film agencies {{for about three}} years without luck. They were surprised when one of their agents had shown the script to the founders of a new production company, Cinecorp, who were interested in the script and had given it to <b>directors</b> <b>Gene</b> Kirkwood and John W. Hyde; Kirkwood stated he has previously seen Yankovic's videos and wanted to make a movie with him. Kirkwood and Hyde had connections with Orion Pictures, who offered to fund the production as long as they could keep it under $5 million.|$|R
25|$|The Diamond Ohio logo, {{which is}} created by {{superimposing}} the I over {{the center of the}} H, and making the O's into pointed triangles, was first created by the OSUMB in the late 1930s. The band continues to use this formation today every home football game as the team entrance tunnel. The Ohio University Marching 110 has also used the Diamond Ohio logo since 1966 when <b>director</b> <b>Gene</b> Thrailkill designed a pregame set modeled after the Ohio State University Marching Band to give the newly reformed Marching 110 a symbol. Photographs show OSUMB director Manley Whitcomb (1939-1942, 1946-1951) charting this formation on a table lined with field markings, and other photographs depict the band in performance of the Diamond Ohio as far back as 1939.|$|E
25|$|President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush met {{the singer}} and actor Sting at Old Ebbitt Grill in September 1989 after his Washington {{debut in the}} title role in Three Penny Opera. The Rolling Stones dined at the {{restaurant}} a few weeks later after a concert in the city. In 1991, playwright Neil Simon, <b>director</b> <b>Gene</b> Saks and the cast of the play Lost in Yonkers held the opening night after-party on January 17 at Old Ebbitt Grill. Just minutes before the curtain rose on the Washington debut of the play, the cast learned that the United States had declared war on Iraq and begun the Gulf War. After the world premier of the motion picture The River Wild in August 1994 in Washington, D.C., a reception for the stars was held at Old Ebbitt.|$|E
500|$|Ruck and Broderick had {{previously}} acted {{together in the}} Broadway production of Biloxi Blues. Cameron's Mr. Peterson voice was an in-joke imitation of their former <b>director</b> <b>Gene</b> Saks. Ruck felt at ease working with Broderick, often crashing in his trailer. [...] "We didn't have to invent an instant friendship like you often {{have to do in}} a movie", said Ruck. [...] "We were friends." ...|$|E
5000|$|Frakes went {{to seven}} auditions over {{six weeks before}} being cast as Riker.

50|$|After Gene Roddenberry's death, Barrett took {{material}} from his archives to bring {{two of his}} ideas into production. She was executive producer of Earth: Final Conflict (in which she also played the character Dr. Julianne Belman), and Andromeda.

500|$|As he perfected his {{animation}} style, {{he began}} to take on more jobs, including creating design tests for the studio's head <b>director,</b> <b>Gene</b> Deitch. Deitch was not convinced that Bakshi had a modern design sensibility. In response to the period's political climate and {{as a form of}} therapy, Bakshi drew the comic strips Bonefoot and Fudge, which satirized [...] "idiots with an agenda", and Junktown, which focused on [...] "misfit technology and discarded ideals".|$|E
500|$|In {{the movie}} Apollo 13, Glynn Lunney was portrayed by Marc McClure. However, McClure had a {{relatively}} minor role. Writer Charles Murray lamented the fact that Lunney was [...] "barely visible in the movie", being overshadowed by the focus on Lunney's fellow flight <b>director</b> <b>Gene</b> Kranz. [...] "Without slighting Kranz's role", Murray commented, [...] "the world should remember that it was Glynn Lunney ... who orchestrated a masterpiece of improvisation that moved the astronauts safely to the lunar module while sidestepping a dozen potential catastrophes that could have doomed them." ...|$|E
500|$|He choreographed the 1969 film {{adaptation}} of the hit Broadway play Hello, Dolly! The film was beset by tension on the unhappy set, with Barbra Streisand clashing with her costar Walter Matthau and <b>director</b> <b>Gene</b> Kelly; Kidd also had conflicts with costume designer Irene Sharaff and Kelly, {{to the point that}} he and Kelly were no longer on speaking terms. The film was not a success as a musical, with Kelly and Kidd making little use of the widescreen format of the film. Critic Tom Santopietro described their approach as [...] "shoveling more and more bodies on screen with no apparent purpose".|$|E

40|$|Inflammatory {{processes}} are recognized in many chronic conditions that alter outcomes of health during aging, including atherosclerosis; dementias of the Alzheimer type; cancer; diabetes; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; obesity; autoimmune disorders; and chronic viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases. Environmental factors include infectious agents and inflammogens from air and diet. Conversely, clinical, experimental, and epidemiological lines of evidence {{have shown that}} anti-inflammatory drugs attenuate some of these conditions. In part, these synergies have been recognized in the National Institutes of Health <b>directorâ€™s</b> <b>Gene,</b> Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI) and in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Human Genome Research Institute programs in environmental genomics. It seems timely and appropriate {{in the context of}} this conference to have a session on inflammation and aging. The scope should include human genomics and population diversity, multigenerational effects, and changing ecological factors. As urban populations continue to grow and as water and air quality deteriorate globally, we may anticipate increasing global exposure to infection and inflammation.

In an unusual move, Boston College athletic <b>director</b> <b>Gene</b> DeFillippo announced that if Jagodzinski went ahead with an interview, he would be fired as {{head coach of the}} Boston College football team. DeFillippo previously stated that a five-year contract with Jagodzinski, signed in 2007, was contingent on the coach staying [...] "for the long term". Jagodzinski proceeded with the interview and was fired by DeFillippo on January 7.|$|E

Apollo 13 would be Harris' second space travel-themed movie; he had starred as pioneering astronaut John Glenn in 1983's The Right Stuff.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, Penn's {{career began}} to lose its {{momentum}} with critics and audiences: Four Friends (1981) was a traumatic {{look back at the}} 1960s, returning to the old themes of Vietnam, civil rights, sexual politics, and drugs. Next came Target (1985), a mainstream thriller reuniting the <b>director</b> with <b>Gene</b> Hackman, and Dead of Winter (1987) was a horror/thriller in the style of Alfred Hitchcock, which he took over directing during production.|$|R

50|$|Although Archainbaud {{directed}} {{films of}} all genres, he is nowadays mainly linked with westerns. In fact, {{it was not}} until the last decade of his directorial career until he specialized in them. With the producer Harry Sherman he made several Hopalong Cassidy oaters. Later he was also one of the principal <b>directors</b> of <b>Gene</b> Autry's Flying A Productions, at which he made several episodes for such weekly television series as Buffalo Bill Jr., Annie Oakley and The Adventures of Champion (TV series).|$|R
2500|$|In 1969, Greene {{was chosen}} to work the descent shift for Apollo 11, the first lunar landing.

James Lovell, Eugene Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted {{the events of the}} mission with reasonable accuracy, given that some dramatic license was taken. For example, the film changes the tense of Lovell's famous follow-up to Swigert's original words from, [...] "Houston, we've had a problem", to [...] "Houston, we have a problem". The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Harris) and Best Supporting Actress (Quinlan).|$|E

2500|$|The {{damage to}} the Service Module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible, so Lead Flight <b>Director</b> <b>Gene</b> Kranz ordered an abort of the mission. The {{existing}} abort plans, first drawn up in 1966, were evaluated; the quickest was a Direct Abort trajectory, which required using the Service Module Propulsion System (SPS) engine to achieve a [...] delta-v.p.III-14 Although a successful SPS firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time (GET) would land the crew one day earlier (at 118 hours GET, or 58 hours later), the large delta-v was possible only if the LM were jettisoned first,p.II-1 and since crew survival depended on the LM's presence during the coast back to Earth, that option was [...] "out of the question."p.III-17 An alternative {{would have been to}} burn the SPS fuel to depletion, then jettison the Service Module and make a second burn with the LM Descent Propulsion System (DPS) engine. It was desired to keep the Service Module attached {{for as long as possible}} because of the thermal protection it afforded the Command Module's heat shield. Apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar sphere of gravitational influence (at 61 hours GET), which was the break-even point between direct and circumlunar aborts, and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn.p.
