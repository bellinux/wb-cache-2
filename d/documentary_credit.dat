40|$|The {{main subject}} of this thesis is the {{exceptions}} in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> in English law. The exceptions were established during {{the development of the}} <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> system to solve drawbacks of the payment means caused by its distinctive feature of autonomy. A rationale of the research is the current decline of the market share of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> as a recognized means of settlement in international trade. This thesis aims to explore an appropriate and efficient way to apply certain necessary exceptions in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> system. And hopefully, the current high rate of the rejection of the documents by banks by relying on the strict compliance principle can be decreased by the improving of the application of exceptions in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits.</b> The research centres primary the application of the exceptions in English law. An early study of the original development of the fraud exception will cover both English and American authorities. Because there is no statute law in English law to regulate the exceptions in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits,</b> the thesis will analyse the exceptions mostly through the case law. The main exceptions analysed in the thesis are the fraud rule, the illegality exception and the nullity exception. The application pattern for the three exceptions will be worked out respectively; the specific application of the injunction rules in applying the fraud rule will be concluded during the analysis of the fraud rule; some common features in the application among the exceptions will also be summarized in the thesis. An effort is made to suggest a prospective development of exceptions, which is in consistent with the autonomy principle. And as the necessary exceptions are applied efficiently, the disputes existing in <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> system currently may be settled without the appliance of any explanatory rules.

50|$|In modern {{business}} practice, {{a letter}} of credit (LC) {{also known as a}} <b>Documentary</b> <b>Credit,</b> is a written commitment by a bank issued after a request by an importer (foreign buyer) that payment will be made to the beneficiary (exporter) provided that the terms and conditions stated in the LC been met, as evidenced by the presentation of specified documents.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the primary}} peculiarities of the <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> is that the payment {{obligation}} is independent from the underlying contract of sale or any other contract in the transaction. The bank’s obligation {{is defined by the}} terms of the LC alone, and the contract of sale is not considered. The defenses available to the buyer arising out of the sale contract do not concern the bank and in no way affect its liability. Article 4(a) of the UCP600 states this principle clearly.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{and seeks}} to validate a conceptual model {{for the evaluation of}} the transnational effectiveness of terms regulating <b>documentary</b> <b>credits.</b> The standpoint of that evaluation is the commonly accepted median compromise of the contested needs of the parties who typically transact <b>documentary</b> <b>credits.</b> The model is formulated and validated by both a doctrinal study of the Uniform Customs and Practice for <b>Documentary</b> <b>Credits</b> (UCP) 600, and its previous iterations, and a functional comparative doctrinal study between English and Jordanian laws supplemented by an empirical study of Jordanian commercial practices. It is postulated that the functional elements of the substance of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> are the embedded usages of irrevocability, conformity and autonomy, and that it is only by the optimal application of these usages that the sociological value of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> can be achieved and the objective median compromise of the contested needs of the transacting parties arrived at are rationally deducted. It is contended, by adapting social systems theory, that what is termed in this thesis as embedded trade usages of transnational commercial transactions constitute socially diffuse law having a normative force to the extent of displacing even some categories of mandatory law arising under autopoietic Municipal legal orders. The socio-legal nature of the embedded usages of both conformity and autonomy is critically analysed in the conceptual model in order to evaluate the legal positions, and the legal communication, of UCP 600 terms under the English and Jordanian legal orders and Jordanian commercial practices...|$|R

A transfer trick—I'd been doing that since the late seventies, so that I could, in turn, do things like that a trick.

40|$|When a {{contract}} of international {{sale of goods}} is mediated by a form of payment as the <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> exporters that initially lack financial resources to produce or obtain merchandise that then will be delivered to the importer, look as first natural possibility of financing the transfer for the <b>documentary</b> <b>credit.</b> Now not always the credit can be transferable {{in accordance with the}} Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP) – because, for example, the importer or the financial entity do not want it in that way. Given the above scenario, this article aims to provide solutions, explaining legal alternatives for the exporter that is not in the UCP-, to use the money that might correspond {{as a result of the}} <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> to finance the production or acquisition of goods against other traders, and then reselling them to the importer. It concludes that the exporter can achieve such immediate funding - similar to what encourage the transfer of <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> - using to their relations with the supplier, figures as the assignment of a future credit, banker’s acceptance and contract terms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the demand for}} import <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> in Lebanon. Five explanatory variables are selected that stand respectively for risk, price, size, conjecture, and availability of credit. As expected, the long run elasticities are {{significantly higher than the}} short run ones. Risk has an adverse impact. Interest rate elasticities, or price elasticities, are all negative and statistically significant except for bills for collection which are paid in cash at presentation of the shipping documents, and that do not depend on the interest rate. Size and conjectural elasticities are all positive and statistically significantly different from zero. As expected, the availability of credit is only important for opened and utilized letters of credit and not for outstanding <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> and bills for collection. In the long run risk, price, and conjectural elasticities are all statistically insignificantly different from one in absolute values, but, surprisingly, long run size elasticities are statistically significantly less than + 1. The paper concludes that the determinants of the demand for import <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> in Lebanon {{are similar to those of}} the demand for any other good or asset...|$|E

40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) Applications for prohibitory {{injunctions}} or interdicts {{against payment}} under <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> are seldom awarded. However, both English and South African law provide {{alternative forms of}} relief. These alternative orders focus on how the beneficiary deals with the proceeds of the credit rather than the prevention of payment thereof. One such alternative is the Mareva injunction of English law which, through freezing the beneficiary’s assets, prevents the removal thereof from {{the area of the}} court’s jurisdiction once judgment is given. The South African equivalent of the Mareva injunction is known as the anti-dissipation interdict and has yet to be applied to the law of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits</b> by the South African courts. However the South African attachment application has been so applied. Therefore this dissertation seeks to conduct a comparative analysis between South African and English law Marevatype injunctions on the proceeds of <b>documentary</b> <b>credits,</b> focusing especially on the judgments handed down in Intraco Ltd v Notis Shipping Corporation of Liberia and Ex Parte Sapan Trading (Pty) Ltd. Chapters Two, Three and Four will explore the nature, development, requirements and effects of the injunctions and interdicts through local and international case law as well as the prospects of a successful application under each.

40|$|The <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> has for a {{long time}} served as a very {{reliable}} form of financial instrument in the trading of international goods. The certainty of payment guaranteed under the documentary system is attributed to the autonomous nature of the credit contract, which is that it is independent of and unaffected by the contract of sale which it supports. So long as the documents which are presented strictly comply with the terms of the credit, the paying bank will be under an obligation to pay. However, documents which are non-compliant are also frequently presented in practice. The autonomous characteristic of the instrument also gives rise to problems because there are circumstances where, even though compliant documents are tendered, payment made under the credit would be unfair. This thesis attempts to investigate the various grounds which could provide a basis for withholding payment under a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit.</b> From the perspective of all the main parties involved in a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit</b> transaction, issues relating to payment are of utmost importance. Discrepant documents and fraud, which are well established as valid grounds, will be examined. The thesis will also explore other possible grounds to withhold payment such as illegality, nullity, unconscionability and breach of negative stipulations which exist in the underlying contract connected to the credit. The parameters of these grounds will be identified and where appropriate, recommendations will be made. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|For an {{international}} seller {{to be able}} to obtain clean shipping documents is a matter of considerable importance to him. Absent fraud on his part, a cif seller can demand payment of the price against tender of such documents, leaving any dispute about the goods themselves to be resolved later. If he is a beneficiary under a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> he can use clean shipping documents to obtain payment under a <b>documentary</b> <b>credit,</b> whatever disputes there may be on the underlying transaction. The position may be different where {{one or more of the}} shipping documents is so defective that it can be described as a nullity. Even if it is not a nullity, it may perhaps be rejected if it can be described as non-genuine. If so, the international seller/beneficiary may be deprived of his assurance of payment, even in the absence of any fraud or other moral culpability on his part. Though the Court of Appeal has considered the application of a nullity concept to documentary credits, it has not provided a definitive solution. The courts have been silent on whether a nullity concept should apply to international sale contracts, and on whether non-genuine documents can be rejected, under such contracts. This article examines whether the concepts of non-genuine shipping documents, and nullities, are meaningful and, if so, what is meant by a nullity and a non-genuine shipping document...|$|E
