40|$|We {{studied the}} shape of the most regular-shaped stratovolcanoes of the world to mathematically define the form of the ideal stratovolcano. Based on the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission data we {{selected}} 19 of the most circular and symmetrical volcanoes, which incidentally all belong to subduction-related arcs surrounding the Pacific. The selection of volcanoes benefitted from the introduction of a new definition of circularity which is more robust than previous definitions, being independent of the erosional dissection of the cone. Our study on {{the shape of}} stratovolcanoes was based on the analysis of the radial elevation profiles of each volcano. The lower half section of the volcanoes is always well fitted by a logarithmic curve, while the upper half section is not, and falls into two groups: it is fitted either by a line (“C-type”, conical upper part) or by a parabolic arc (“P-type”, parabolic/concave upper part). A quantitative discrimination between these groups is obtained by fitting their upper slope with a linear function: C-type volcanoes show small, whereas P-type volcanoes show significant negative angular coefficient. The proposed threshold between the two groups is − 50 × 10 − 4 °/m. Chemical composition of eruptive products indicates higher SiO 2 and/or higher H 2 O content for C-type volcanoes, which could imply a higher incidence of mildly <b>explosive</b> (<b>e.</b> g. strombolian) eruptions. We propose that this higher explosivity is responsible for forming the constant uppermost slopes by the deposition of ballistic tephra and its subsequent stabilisation at a constant angle. By contrast, P-type volcanoes are characterized by a smaller SiO 2 and H 2 O content, which can be responsible for a higher incidence of effusive events and/or a lower incidence of upper flank-forming (i. e. mild) explosive eruptions. Therefore, the concave upper flanks of these volcanoes may be shaped typically by lava flows. Based on this hypothesis, we propose that the morphometric analysis of the elevation profile of stratovolcanoes can provide insights into their dominant eruptive style...|$|E

The study uses only cut hair, which {{is exposed to}} explosive vapor. The vapor transfer studies reported herein indicated that hair did not reach saturation even after 2. 5 years of exposure to TNT. While previous studies showed black hair sorbed more explosive than blond or brown, this study reports that red hair sorption is similar to black, while grey hairs, exposed along with black hair from the same individual, sorbed significantly less explosive than the same individual’s black hairs. In a study using only black hair, a slight racial bias was observed with sorption greater for Mongoloid hair as compared to Caucasian or Negroid. Only for Mongoloid hairs were enough samples studied to examine for a gender bias, but one was not observed. There was much variability in results in all categories (hair color, race, and gender) that trends were established only in general terms. Hair at different ages was tested for a few individuals. Detailed studies focused on the sorption of TATP and TNT since these appear to be sorbed most differently—TATP mainly on the hair surface and TNT both {{on the surface and}} in the cortex.

40|$|ABSTRACT Architectural and {{physical}} performance measurements are commonly implemented to identify various physical capacities in many populations. However, {{previous research has}} suggested architectural measures, notably in the leg extensors, are ineffective predictors of vertical jumping (VJ) performance. Given the functional relevance of rapid strength development on explosive dynamic tasks, further research is warranted examining, a) the presence of associations of maximal (e. g., peak torque; PT) and, in particular, <b>explosive</b> (<b>e.</b> g., rate of torque development; RTD) strength-related characteristics with jumping performance in the leg extensors, and b) {{the extent to which}} PT and RTD either uniquely, or synergistically contribute to VJ performance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationships between isometric maximal and explosive strength measures of the leg extensors and VJ peak power (PP) output in female youth volleyball athletes. Thirty (mean ±SD, range: age= 13. 73 ± 1. 11, 12 - 17 years, height= 162. 53 ± 6. 39 cm, body mass= 57. 84 ± 12. 05 kg) female youth competitive volleyball players reported to the laboratory on two occasions, with the first visit being a familiarization session. The second visit involved experimental testing, in which participants performed two isometric maximal voluntary contractions of the leg extensors on a dynamometer at a leg angle of 60 º, followed by three countermovement VJ trials. Subjects performed countermovement jumps, starting in a standing position and feet firmly on the ground. Following the descent to the midpoint position and without pause, the subjects exploded upward as hard and fast as possible. PT and RTD were calculated as the highest 500 ms epoch and the slope of the rise in torque in the first 200 ms from onset, respectively. Lower-body PP was assessed using a linear velocity transducer, which was attached to the posterior side of a belt that was securely fastened to the subjects’ waistline. Pearson correlation (r) and stepwise linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships. Results indicated that both PT (r= 0. 7) and late RTD (r= 0. 62) were significantly correlated to PP (p≤ 0. 01). However, linear regression analysis revealed that PT was the only variable entered into the stepwise regression model (R= 0. 71; R²= 0. 50). These findings showed that while both maximal and explosive strength variables correlated with VJ performance, only PT was necessary to effectively predict PP output with no additional explained variance from RTD. Thus, training regimens aimed at development of high force production of the leg extensors may enhance PP production during explosive vertical jump tasks more so than enhancing early rapid force production...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate and model the viscosity of multicomponent natural silicate melts and constrain the compositional effects which affect such a parameter. The results of this study, relevant to all petrological and volcanological processes which involve some transport mechanism, will be applied to volcanic setting. An extensive experimental study was performed, which constituted the basis for the general modelling of Newtonian viscosity in terms of composition and temperature. Composition, viscosity and density of selected samples were investigated at different water contents. The experimental method involved measuring the viscosity of dry and hydrated melts under superliquidus and supercooled conditions. In the high temperature range (1050 – 1600 °C) viscosities from 10 - 0. 5 to 105 Pa·s were obtained using a concentric cylinder apparatus. Measurements of both dry and hydrated samples in the low temperature (616 - 860 °C) - high viscosity (108. 5 – 1012 Pa·s) interval, from glassy samples quenched after high temperature viscometry, were performed using the dilatometric method of micropenetration. Hydrated samples measured in the supercooled state were synthesized, using a piston cylinder apparatus, between 1100 ° and 1600 ° C at 10 kbar. Water contents were measured using the Karl Fischer Titration (KFT) method. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used before and after the experiments in order to check that the water content was homogeneously distributed in the samples and that water had not been lost. Major element compositions of the dry remelted samples were determined using an electron microprobe. Newtonian viscosities of silicate liquids were investigated in a range between 10 - 1 to 1011. 6 Pa s and parameterised using the non-linear 3 parameter (ATVF, BTVF and T 0) TVF equation. The data provided in this work are combined also with previous data from Whittington et al. (2000, 2001); Dingwell et al. (1996); Neuville et al. (1993). There are strong numerical correlations between parameters (ATVF, BTVF and T 0) that mask the effect of composition. Wide ranges of ATVF, BTVF and T 0 values can be used to describe individual datasets. This is true even when the data are numerous, well-measured and span a wide range of experimental conditions. In particular, “strong” liquids (liquids that are Arrhenian or slightly deviate from Arrhenian behaviour) place only minor restrictions on the absolute ranges of ATVF, BTVF and T 0. Therefore, strategies for modelling the effects on compositions should be built around high-quality datasets collected on non-Arrhenian liquids. x The relationships between important quantities such as the fragility F, characterizing the deviation from Arrhenian rheological behaviour, are quantified in terms of the chemical, structure-related parameter NBO/T. Initial addition of network modifying elements to a fully polymerised liquid (i. e. NBO/T= 0) results in a rapid increase in F. However, at NBO/T values above 0. 4 - 0. 5 further addition of a network modifier has little effect on fragility. This parameterisation indicates that this sharp change in the variation of fragility with NBO/T is due to a sudden change in the configurational properties and rheological regimes, owing to the addition of network modifying elements. The resulting TVF parameterisation has been also used to build up a predictive model for Arrhenian to non-Arrhenian melt viscosity. The model accommodates the effect of composition via an empirical parameter called here the “structure modifier” (SM). SM is the summation of molar oxides of Ca, Mg, Mn, half of the total iron Fetot, Na and K. This approach is validated by the highly predictive capability of the viscosity model. The model reproduces all the original data set with about 10 %, of the measured values of logη over the entire range of composition in the temperature interval 700 - 1600 °C. The combination of calorimetric and viscosimetric data has enabled a simple expression to be used to predict shear viscosity at the glass transition, that is the temperature which defines the transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like rheological behaviour. The basis for this stems from the equivalence of the relaxation times for both enthalpy and shear stress relaxation in a wide range of silicate melt compositions (Gottsmann et al., 2002). A shift factor that relates cooling rate data with viscosity at the glass transition appears to be slightly dependent on the melt composition. Finally, the effect of water content on decreasing the viscosity of silicate melts has also been parameterised using a modified TVF expression (Giordano et al., 2000). This leads to an improvement in our knowledge of the non-Arrhenian behaviour of silicate melts over a wide compositional range from basaltic to rhyolitic and from trachytic to peralkaline phonolite compositions in the temperature interval pertaining to volcanic and subvolcanic processes. The viscosities of natural hydrous basaltic liquids are shown to be lower than those of hydrous phonolites, whereas thachytes show viscosity that are higher than those of phonolites and lower that those of rhyolites. This is consistent with the style of eruption associated with these compositions, with trachytes generating eruptions that are dominantly <b>explosive</b> (<b>e.</b> g. xi Phlegrean Fields volcano), compared to the highly explosive style of rhyolitic volcanoes, the mixed explosive-effusive style of phonolitic volcanoes (e. g. Vesuvius) and the dominantly effusive style of basalts. Variations in composition between the trachytes translate into differences in liquid viscosity of nearly two orders of magnitude in dry conditions, and less than one order of magnitude in hydrous conditions. These differences increase significantly when the estimated eruptive temperatures of different eruptions at Phlegrean Fields are taken into account. At temperatures close to those of natural magmas and in the case of low viscosity hydrous liquids the uncertainty of the calculations is large, although it cannot be quantified, due to a lack of measurements under these conditions. Gegenstand dieser Arbeit ist die Bestimmung und Modellierung der Viskositäten silikatischer Schmelzen mit unterschiedlichen, in der Natur auftretenden Zusammensetzungen. Chemische Zusammensetzung, Temperatur, Druck, der Gehalt an Kristallen und Xenolithen, der Grad der Aufschäumung und der Gehalt an gelösten volatilen Stoffen sind alles Faktoren, die die Viskosität einer silikatischen Schmelze in unterschiedlichem Maße beeinflußen. Drücke bis 20 kbar und Festpartikelgehalte unter 30 Volumenprozent haben einen geringeren Effekt als Temperatur, Zusammensetzung oder Wassergehalt (Marsh, 1981, Pinkerton and Stevenson, 1992, Dingwell et al., 1993, Lejeune and Richet, 1995). Bei Eruptionstemperatur führen z. B. das Hinzufügen von 30 Volumenprozent Kristallen, die Verringerung des Wassergehaltes um 0, 1 Gewichtsprozent oder die Erniedrigung der Temperatur um 30 K zu einer identischen Erhöhung der Viskosität (Pinkerton and Stevenson, 1992). Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde die Viskosität verschiedener vulkanischer Produkte von wichtigen, potenziell gefährlichen Vulkangebieten (Vesuv, Flegräische Felder, Etna – Italien; Teide – Teneriffa; Povocao – Azoren; Eifel – Deutschland; Unzen – Japan) untersucht. Bimsablagerungen, pyroklastische Ströme und Lavaströme von jedem dieser Vulkangebiete wurden beprobt. Diese Proben decken einen kompositionellen Bereich von Basanit bis Phonolit, und von Dazit bis Trachyt ab. Um eine Grundlage für die Modellierung der Newtonschen Viskosität in Abhänigkeit von chemischer Zusammensetzung und Temperatur zu schaffen, wurden ausführliche Experimente durchgeführt. Chemische Zusammensetzung, Viskosität und Dichte ausgewählter Proben wurden bei unterschiedlichen Wassergehalten bestimmt. Die experimentelle Vorgehensweise beinhaltete die Bestimmung der Viskosität trockener und wasserhaltiger Schmelzen unter Superliquidus und unterkühlten Bedingungen. Im Hochtemperaturbereich (1050 - 1600 °C) wurden Viskositäten zwischen 10 - 0. 5 und 105 Pas mit einer Konzentrischer-Zylinder Apparatur gemessen. Messungen an trockenen und wasserhaltigen Proben im Bereich tiefer Temperatur (616 - 860 °C) und hoher Viskosität (108. 5 v – 1012 Pa·s) wurden an abgeschreckten Hochtemperaturviskosimetrie Proben mit einem Mikropenetrationsdilatometer durchgeführt. Die verwendeten Apparaturen wurden an Hand von Standards kalibriert. Hierfür wurden NBS 711 vom National Bureau of Standards und DGG 1 (Natrium-Calcium-Silizium Glas) der Deutschen Glastechnischen Gesellschaft verwendet. Wasserhaltige Proben für die Messung im unterkühlten Zustand wurden bei 1100 - 1600 °C und 10 kbar in einer Kolbenzylinder Apparatur synthetisiert. Die absoluten Wassergehalte wurden mittels Karl Fischer Titrationsmethode (KFT) am Institut für Mineralogie der Universität Hannover bestimmt, und lagen zwischen 0 und 3, 78 Gewichtsprozent. Durch Fourier-Transformation Infrarot Spektroskopie (FTIR) wurde jeweils vor und nach den Experimenten überprüft, ob die Wasserverteilung in den Proben homogen ist und dass kein Wasser verloren wurde. Die Hauptelementzusammensetzung der trockenen, wiederaufgeschmolzenen Proben wurde an einer Elektronenstrahl Mikrosonde des Bayerischen Geoinstituts der Universität Bayreuth bestimmt. Von einigen natürlichen Proben wurde nur die glasige Matrix experimentell untersucht. An diesen Proben wurden vor und nach den Experimenten Vergleichsmessungen mit der Mikrosonde durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse dieser Messungen belegen dass beim Aufschmelzen auch sehr alkalireicher Proben keine Alkalimetalle verloren gehen. Kalorimetrische Glasübergangstemperaturen wurden mit einem Dynamischen Differenz-Kalorimeter (DSC) bestimmt. Die Kalorimetrische Glasübergangstemperatur ist definiert als die Temperatur bei der eine Probe die höchste spezifische Wärmekapazität bei konstantem Umgebungsdruck besitzt. Die Newtonsche Viskosität silikatischer Schmelzen wurde im Bereich zwischen 10 - 1 und 1011. 6 Pas untersucht und mit einer nicht linearen TVF Gleichung mit drei Parametern (ATVF, BTVF and T 0) modelliert. Um eine breite Anwendbarkeit des Modells zu gewährleisten, wurden die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit gewonnenen Daten auch mit älteren Daten von Whittington et al. (2000, 2001); Dingwell et al. (1996); Neuville et al. (1993) kombiniert. Es zeigen sich starke numerische Korrelationen zwischen den Parametern ATVF, BTVF und T 0, die den Zusammensetzungseffekt maskieren. Viele verschiedene Werte für ATVF, BTVF vi und T 0 können eingesetzt werden, um individuelle Datensätze zu beschreiben. Dies trifft auch für Datensätze zu, die umfangreich sind, sorgfältig gemessen wurden und einen großen Bereich experimenteller Bedingungen abdecken. Sogenannte "strong liquids" (Flüssigkeiten die nicht oder nur leicht von einem idealen Arrhenius Verhalten abweichen) lassen einen großen Bereich von Absolutwerten für ATVF, BTVF und T 0 zu, wohingegen sogenannte "fragile liquids" (Flüssigkeiten die eine starke Abweichung von einem idealen Arrhenius Verhalten zeigen) die möglichen Werte für ATVF, BTVF und T 0 stark einschränken. Deshalb sollten Strategien zur Modellierung von kompositionellen Effekten auf die Untersuchung von "fragile liquids" ausgelegt werden. Die Beziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Parametern, die die Abweichung von einem Arrhenius Verhalten charakterisieren (z. B. die Fragilität F), wurden mittels des strukturbezogenen Parameters NBO/T beschrieben. NBO/T ist ein Maß für den Grad der Polymerisierung einer silikatischen Schmelze, das heißt das Verhältnis zwischen sogenannten Trennstellensauerstoffen (non-bridging oxygens, NBO) und tetraedrisch koordinierten Kationen (T) (Mysen, 1988). Das Hinzufügen von netzwerkmodifzierenden Elementen zu einer vollkommen polymerisierten Flüssigkeit (NBO/T = 0) führt zu einem drastischen Anstieg der Fragilität. Bei NBO/T Werten über 0, 4 - 0, 5 haben zusätzliche Netzwerkmodifizierer nur einen geringen Einfluß auf die Fragilität. Dies lässt den Schluß zu, dass die starke Veränderung der Beziehung von NBO/T und Fragilität auf einer plötzlichen Veränderung der konfigurationellen Eigenschaften und rheologischen Regime durch die Zugabe von netzwerkmodifizierenden Elementen beruht. Die TVF Parametrisierung wurde auch dazu benutzt, ein vorhersagendes Modell für die Viskosität von Arrhenius- und nicht-Arrhenius Flüssigkeiten zu erstellen. Dieses Modell berücksichtigt den Einfluß der chemischen Zusammensetzung durch einen sogenannten "structure modifier" (SM) Parameter. SM ist die Summe der Molprozente der Oxide von Ca, Mg, Mn, Na, K, und der Hälfte von Fetot. Diese Elemente wurden gewählt, da sie in einer silikatischen Schmelze als Netzwerkmodifizierer wirken (Mysen, 1988). Dieser Ansatz wird vii durch die hohe Erfolgsquote des Modells gerechtfertigt, das sämtliche im Bereich von 700 - 1600 °C gemessenen Werte von logη auf 10 Prozent genau reproduziert. Im Zusammenhang mit dem SM-Parameter konnte eine weitere wichtige Beobachtung gemacht werden. Trägt man Viskosität (bestimmt bei konstanter Temperatur) und SMParameter verschiedener Proben mit unterschiedlichen chemischen Zusammensetzungen in einem Diagramm gegeneinander auf, zeigt sich ein nicht linearer Trend. Dieser Trend bezeichnet einen systematischen Zusammenhang zwischen der Viskosität einer Schmelze und deren Gehalt an netzwerkmodifizierenden Elementen. Dieser Kurvenverlauf zeigt zudem eine annähernd parallele Verschiebung mit steigender Temperatur (zwischen 700 und 1600 °C) hin zu niedrigeren Viskositäten. Diese Parallelität deutet daraufhin, dass die Temperatur keinen großen Einfluß auf den kummulativen Effekt der netzwerkmodifizierenden Elemente hat. Eine Kombination kalorimetrischer und viskosimetrischer Daten ermöglicht eine Vorhersage der Viskosität bei der Glasübergangstemperatur, d. h. bei der Temperatur bei der sich das rheologische Verhalten von flüssigkeitsähnlich zu feststoffähnlich ändert. Dies beruht auf der Gleichheit der Relaxationszeiten von Enthalpierelaxation und Scherspannungsrelaxation für eine Vielzahl verschiedener Schmelzzusammensetzungen (Gottsmann et al., 2002). Der Verschiebungsfaktor, der Abkühlraten mit der Viskosität bei der Glasübergangstemperatur in Beziehung setzt, scheint eine geringe Abhängigkeit von der Schmelzzusammensetzung zu besitzen. Schließlich wurde auch der Einfluß des Wassergehaltes auf die Viskosität wasserhaltiger silikatischer Schmelzen mittels einer modifierten TVF Gleichung parametrisiert (Giordano et al., 2000). Es zeigte sich, dass die Viskosität wasserhaltiger basaltischer Schmelzen niedriger ist als die wasserhaltiger phonolitischer Schmelzen, wogegen wasserhaltige trachytische Schmelzen eine Viskosität zwischen wasserhaltigen Phonoliten und hochviskosen wasserhaltigen Rhyoliten besitzen. Diese Feststellungen decken sich mit den beobachtbaren Eruptionsmechanismen. Eruptionen basaltischer Vulkane sind überwiegend effusiv, diejenigen phonolitischer Vulkane sind gemischt effusiv-explosiv, trachytische Vulkane (z. B. Flegräische Felder) sind überwiegend explosiv, und rhyolitische Vulkane sind hochexplosiv. viii Die Viskosität trockener trachytischer Schmelzen mit unterschiedlichen Zusammensetzungen variiert um bis zu zwei Größenordnungen, die Viskosität wasserhaltiger Schmelzen um weniger als eine Größenordnung. Diese Unterschiede werden deutlich größer, wenn man die geschätzten Temperaturen verschiedener Eruptionen der Flegräischen Felder berücksichtigt. Im Falle niedrigviskoser wasserhaltiger Schmelzen mit Temperaturen ähnlich denen natürlicher Magmen ist die Ungenauigkeit der Berechnungen groß. Diese Ungenauigkeit kann jedoch nicht genau quantifiziert werden, da es keine Messungen unter diesen Bedingungen gibt...|$|E

The organic composite used was a combination of P 3 HT (poly 3 -hexylthiophene), CuTPP (Cu(II) tetraphenylporphyrin) and ADB (copolymer of diethynyl-pentiptycene and dibenzyl-ProDOT). The incorporation of ADB into P 3 HT/CuTPP composite makes the film porous and thereby increases the sensitivity of the sensors by increasing the permeability of the analyte into the sensing polymeric matrix. Secondly, it increases the surface roughness which eventually increases the surface area resulting in an increased sensitivity. Along with an improved sensitivity (enhances the response by around 30 % to nitro based explosive compounds), the sensors exhibit an excellent selectivity for nitro based explosive analytes like TNT, RDX, DNB as compared to the vapors of non-explosive oxidizing agents such as nitrobenzene (NB), benzoquinone (BQ) and benzophenone (BP).

Most of the systems now under development target a specific characteristic of military or commercial <b>explosives</b> (<b>e.</b> g. mass density, nitrogen density).

40|$|The {{quadrupole}} resonance (QR) {{technology can}} be used as a confirming sensor for buried plastic landmine detection by detecting the <b>explosives</b> (<b>e.</b> g., TNT and RDX) within the mine. We focus herein on the detection of TNT via the QR sensor. Since the frequency of the QR signal is located within the AM radio frequency band, the QR signal can be corrupted by strong radio frequency interferences (RFIs). Hence to detect the very weak QR signal, RFI mitigation is essential. Reference antennas, which receive RFIs only, can be used together with the main antenna, which receives both the QR signal and the RFIs, for RFI mitigation. By taking advantage of the spatial correlation of the RFIs received by the antenna array, the RFIs can be reduced significantly. However, the RFIs are usually colored both spatially and temporally and hence exploiting only the spatial diversity of the antenna array may not give the best performance. We exploit herein both the spatial and temporal correlation of the RFIs to improve the TNT detection performance. First, we consider exploiting the spatial correlation of the RFIs only and propose a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for parameter estimation and a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector for TNT detection. Second, we adopt a multi-channel autoregressive model to take into account the temporal correlation of the RFIs and devise a detector based on the model. Third, we take advantage of the temporal correlation by using a two-dimensional robust Capon beamformer (RCB) with the ML estimator for improved RFI mitigation. Finally, we combine the merits of all of the three aforementioned approaches for TNT detection.

40|$|At many waste sites, {{transuranic}} (TRU), low-level, {{and mixed}} wastes {{are stored in}} 55 -gallon drums. Many of these drums contain hazardous, organic wastes as well. Radiolysis or other physical or chemical processes may result in gaseous emissions inside these drums. When this happens the pressure within the drum will increase, sometimes to unacceptable levels. In more drastic cases, these emissions may produce flammable or <b>explosive</b> atmospheres (<b>e.</b> g., hydrogen from radiolysis). Currently regulatory procedures require that each drum be individually opened and inspected {{for the presence of}} hazardous organic waste. This situation will be dangerous for workers if either of the conditions described above exist (high pressure or flammable atmosphere). A non-intrusive technique that would detect any increase in pressure over ambient would alert workers of potential danger and greatly increase safety. Conversely, it would allow the segregation of suspect drums, and more rapid treatment of safe drums...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a luminescent probe for the selective and sensitive detection of an <b>explosive,</b> i. <b>e.,</b> picric acid (PA), {{based on the}} luminescence quenching of CeIII and TbIII co-doped Sr 2 GdF 7 nanocrystals. A new colloidal synthesis route at low temperature (80 [*]°C) was developed to synthesize the luminescent nanocrystals host matrix Sr 2 GdF 7. The nanocrystals showed strong green emission under UV excitation (290  nm) by efficient energy transfer from CeIII to TbIII ions. The functionalization of the nanocrystals with l-cysteine (Cys) rendered the luminescent probe water dispersible. The presence of the −NH 2 groups of Cys allowed the selective interaction of the probe with PA among other nitro explosives. This caused a 92 [*]% reduction of the photoluminescence intensity of TbIII in the Sr 2 GdF 7 nanocrystals, {{and led to the}} selective detection of PA with an unprecedented limit of detection (LOD) of approx. 4  nm...|$|R

The PBX 9501 binder system is composed of nitroplasticized Estane 5703, TM a polyester polyurethane copolymer. The molecular weight of polyester urethanes can degrade with time {{as a function of}} hydrolysis, affecting the mechanical behavior of the polymer or a polymer composite material of high <b>explosives,</b> i. <b>e.</b> PBXs.

Ballistic discs were selected since they can be designed to contain relatively small amounts of <b>explosive</b> (i. <b>e.</b> less than 100 g) and low density case materials to minimise overpressure, fragmentation and site damage. Two EOD methods were investigated. One method was aimed at neutralising the munition fuze while leaving the body and filling intact. The other method was aimed at opening the munition case and producing a slow burn of the filling in a single operation. Our methodology involved evaluating ballistic disc designs using numerical modelling and instrumented firings. Short listed candidates were field tested against 105 mm HE shell and 81 mm mortars (representing thick and thin cased munitions). A ballistic disc design was produced that had 100 % success in neutralising the fuze and ejecting it from the munition case providing the aim position was away from the booster. Flash radiography showed that the fuze train was disrupted in less then 50 µs and the projectil...|$|R

Plant biologists are currently developing genetically engineered plants that de-green in the presence of <b>explosives</b> (i. <b>e.</b> TNT) in their environment. The objectives of this thesis are to study the spectral reflectance phenomenology of the plant sensors and to propose requirements for an operational monitoring system using spectral imaging technology. Hyperspectral data were collected under laboratory conditions to determine the key spectral regions in the reflectance spectra associated with the de-greening phenomenon. The collected reflectance spectra were then entered into simulated imagery created using the Rochester Institute of Technology 2 ̆ 7 s Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) model. System performance was studied as a function of pixel size, radiometric noise, spectral waveband dependence and spectral resolution. It was found that a framing array sensor with 40 nm wide bands centered at 645 nm, 690 nm, 875 nm, a ground sample distance of 11 cm or smaller, and an signal to noise ratio of 250 or better would be sufficient for monitoring bio-sensors deployed under conditions similar to those simulated for this work...|$|R

40|$|Many {{constraint}} satisfaction problems are combinatorically <b>explosive,</b> i. <b>e.</b> have {{far too many}} solutions. Optimization techniques may help in selecting solutions for consideration, but a reasonable measure of optimality is not always at hand. The branch & sample algorithm is presented {{as an alternative to}} optimization. If the constraints themselves limit the solution set sufficiently, the algorithm finds all solutions, but otherwise a suitable number of solutions (determined by the user) is generated, such that each new solution has a maximal distance to those already generated. The distance measure used is a so called ultrametric distance expressible in terms of the search tree: solutions are viewed as m-tuples of fixed length, each of whose m decision variables corresponds to a level in the search tree. The distance between two solutions is the number of edges from their leaf nodes to the closest common predecessor node in the tree. For problems whose decision variables depend on each other (as is often the case) the set of solutions generated in this way corresponds well to the intuitive notion of a'representative sample.

However, past HE-waste disposal practices at manufacturing and fabrication facilities in the U.

Using TNT, RDX, and HMX as examples, this paper describes how risk-based standards for HEs can be derived that account for potential multimedia exposures (associated with contaminated air, water, food, and soil) by individuals near a contaminated site, and used to (1) protect public health and safety; (2) prevent limited resources from being dedicated to unnecessary cleanup activities; and (3) identify the most cost-effective, practical, and environmentally benign technologies suitable for integrating with the handling of the large quantity of high explosives scheduled for demilitarization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: When a {{structure}} is irradiated by a pulsed cold X-ray with high energy density, the instantaneous deposition of energy will induce melting, vaporization, and sublimation {{of the outer}} layer of material(s). As a result, the material(s) will blow off and hence lead to a so-called blow-off impulse. This kind of impulsive load will cause high-level structural responses. In order to investigate the effects, various test simulation techniques, such as the light-initiated high explosive (LIHE) technique, the spray lead at target (SPLAT) technique and the sheet-explosive technique, were developed {{due to the lack}} of proper X-ray sources. This paper presents a rod-explosive technique developed from the sheet-explosive technique. In this technique, the main property of the <b>explosive,</b> i. <b>e.</b> the specific impulse, is determined by using a pendulum test facility. The simulation load (equivalent to the cosine-distributed specific impulse on a conical shell induced by X-ray) is designed by load discretization and impulse equivalence. Numerical simulations of structural responses to both X-ray loads and rod-explosive loads were performed for validating the test simulation technique. An application example of testing a complex structure is briefly given in the end. The rod-explosive technique has the features of low costs and rather high fidelities. It provides a new approach for testing the structural responses induced by X-ray blow-off impulses...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the RAIL {{feasibility}} study, Operation Dorothe (March 1961) {{was conducted}} to determine if a liquid explosive could survive the acceleration of launch from a 155 mm howitzer. This operation was successful, although some structural difficulty was experienced with the test round (C- 90). Upon completion of that exercise, it was decided to design a test round that could be used with the more viscous slurry-type explosives, and to fire several of these new rounds with inert filler prior to their use with slurry High <b>Explosives</b> (H. <b>E.),</b> precluding the difficulty previously experienced.

The rotating band has been altered to eliminate rotation. Internally, a plastic plug is used to control column height. A piston-type `O` ring seal prevents gun gas from reaching the interior to the projectile. Four of these projectiles were fired from a 155 mm howitzer at 15, 500 g`s, plus.

The remainder of this part further describes the work published in three publications. The first paper included here outlines the work on derivatives of 2, 2 -dinitropropane- 1, 3 -diol. The second paper contains information on synthesis attempts of other gem-dinitrodiols and the successful synthesis and characterisation of derivatives of 4, 4 -dinitroheptane- 1, 7 -diol, e. g. 1, 7 -diazido- 4, 4 -dinitroheptane. The third paper focuses on a new class of energetic plasticisers, namely derivatives of 3 (5), 4 -dinitropyrazole. Two of the obtained compounds had satisfactory thermal properties to enable their use as energetic plasticisers. These two are the aforementioned 1, 7 -diazido- 4, 4 -dinitroheptane and 1 -allyl- 3 (5), 4 -dinitropyrazole.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} aroused a great {{interest}} about <b>explosive</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> discontinuous) transitions. They manifest in distinct systems, such as synchronization in coupled oscillators, percolation regime, absorbing phase transitions and more recently, in the majority-vote (MV) model with inertia. In the latter, the model rules are slightly modified by {{the inclusion of a}} term depending on the local spin (an inertial term). In such case, Chen et al. (Phys Rev. E 5, 042304 (2017)) have found that relevant inertia changes the nature of the phase transition in complex networks, from continuous to discontinuous. Here we give a further step by embedding inertia only in vertices with degree larger than a threshold value 〈 k 〉 k^*, 〈 k 〉 being the mean system degree and k^* the fraction restriction. Our results, from mean-field analysis and extensive numerical simulations, reveal that an explosive transition is presented in both homogeneous and heterogeneous structures for small and intermediate k^*'s. Otherwise, large restriction can sustain a discontinuous transition only in the heterogeneous case. This shares some similarity with recent results for the Kuramoto model (Phys Rev. E 91, 022818 (2015)). Surprisingly, intermediate restriction and large inertia are responsible for the emergence of an extra phase, in which the system is partially synchronized and the classification of phase transition depends on the inertia and the lattice topology. In this case, the system exhibits two phase transitions. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

The plutonium gun, codenamed Thin Man, needed a muzzle velocity of at least [...] per second, which they hoped to achieve with a modified Navy 3-inch antiaircraft gun. The alternative was to build an implosion-type nuclear weapon. McMillan took an early interest in this, watching tests of this concept conducted by Seth Neddermeyer. The results were not encouraging. Simple explosions resulted in distorted shapes. John von Neumann looked at the implosion program in September 1943, and proposed a radical solution involving explosive lenses.

40|$|Post-activation {{potentiation}} (PAP) is {{induced by}} a voluntary conditioning contraction (CC), performed typically at a maximal or near-maximal intensity, and has consistently {{been shown to}} increase both peak force and rate of force development during subsequent twitch contractions. The proposed mechanisms underlying PAP are associated with phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains, increased recruitment of higher order motor units, and a possible change in pennation angle. If PAP could be induced by a CC in humans, and utilized during a subsequent <b>explosive</b> activity (<b>e.</b> g. jump or sprint), it could potentially enhance mechanical power and thus performance and/or the training stimulus of that activity. However, the CC might also induce fatigue, {{and it is the}} balance between PAP and fatigue that will determine the net effect on performance of a subsequent explosive activity. The PAP-fatigue relationship is affected by several variables including CC volume and intensity, recovery period following the CC, type of CC, type of subsequent activity, and subject characteristics. These variables have not been standardized across past research, and as a result, evidence of the effects of CC on performance of subsequent explosive activities is equivocal. In order to better inform and direct future research on this topic, this article will highlight and discuss the key variables that may be responsible for the contrasting results observed in the current literature. Future research should aim to better understand the effect of different conditions on the interaction between PAP and fatigue, with an aim of establishing the specific application (if any) of PAP to sport. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{dynamical}} systems {{in which a}} large number N of identical Landau-Stuart oscillators are globally coupled via a mean-field. Previously, {{it has been observed}} that this type of system can exhibit a variety of different dynamical behaviors including clumped states in which each oscillator is in one of a small number of groups for which all oscillators in each group have the same state which is different from group to group, as well as situations in which all oscillators have different states and the macroscopic dynamics of the mean field is chaotic. We argue that this second type of behavior is ^extensive^' {{in the sense that the}} chaotic attractor in the full phase space of the system has a fractal dimension that scales linearly with N and that the number of positive Lyapunov exponents of the attractor also scales with linearly N. An important focus of this paper is the transition between clumped states and extensive chaos as the system is subjected to slow adiabatic parameter change. We observe <b>explosive</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> discontinuous) transitions between the clumped states (which correspond to low dimensional dynamics) and the extensively chaotic states. Furthermore, examining the clumped state, as the system approaches the explosive transition to extensive chaos, we find that the oscillator population distribution between the clumps continually evolves so that the clumped state is always marginally stable. This behavior is used to reveal the mechanism of the explosive transition. We also apply the Kaplan-Yorke formula to study the fractal structure of the extensively chaotic attractors...|$|R
