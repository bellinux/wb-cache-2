5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds <b>densely</b> packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E
5|$|About 73 {{percent of}} Japan is forested, mountainous and {{unsuitable}} for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan {{is one of}} the most <b>densely</b> populated countries in the world.|$|E

As of 2011, with an {{estimated}} population of 1.2 billion, India is the world's second most populous country after the People's Republic of China in the world. India occupies 2.4percent of the world's land surface area and is home to 17.5percent of the world's population. After the Gangetic plains, the eastern and western coastal regions of the Deccan plateau are the most <b>densely</b> populated regions of India. The Thar desert in western Rajasthan {{is one of the}} most <b>densely</b> populated deserts in the world. The northern and north-eastern states along the Himalayas contain cold arid deserts with fertile valleys. These states have less population density due to indomitable physical barriers.|$|E
5|$|Large chromatophores <b>densely</b> {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side. The fins do not possess chromatophores on the underside. Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through pale yellow to brownish pink and brownish violet.|$|E
5|$|New York County is the United States' second-smallest county by {{land area}} (larger only than Kalawao County, Hawaii), {{and is also}} the most <b>densely</b> {{populated}} U.S. county. It {{is also one of the}} most <b>densely</b> populated areas in the world, with a census-estimated 2016 population of 1,643,734 living in a land area of , or 71,999 residents per square mile (27,799/km2), higher than the density of any individual U.S. city. On business days, the influx of commuters increases this number to over 3.9 million, or more than 170,000 people per square mile (65,600/km2).

5|$|Portsmouth, as {{the most}} <b>densely</b> {{populated}} city in the United Kingdom, is the only city whose population density exceeds that of London. As of the 2011 census, the city had 205,400 residents. This equates to 5,100 people living in every square kilometre (0.4 sq.mi.), which is eleven {{times more than the}} regional average of 440 people per square kilometre and more than London, which has 4,900 people per square kilometre. The city used to be even more <b>densely</b> populated, with the 1951 census showing a population of 233,545. In a reversal of that decrease, the population of the city has been gradually increasing since the 1990s. With about 860,000 residents, the South Hampshire built-up area is the fifth-largest urban area in England and the largest in South East England, forming the centre of one of the United Kingdom's most populous metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Pichilemu was very <b>densely</b> populated, {{especially}} in Cáhuil, {{where there are}} salt deposits that were exploited by natives. Pichilemu has had censuses taken since the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The coins of Ælfwald's reign are {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} that were minted in East Anglia. The coinage of silver pennies known as sceattas expanded {{in his time}} and several types are attributed to East Anglian production. Most of them fall into two main groups, known as the 'Q' and 'R' series. Neither group bears a royal name or title and the authority by which they were issued cannot not established. The 'Q' series, which has some Northumbrian affinities, is most <b>densely</b> distributed in western East Anglia, along the Fen edge between the Wash and Cambridge. The R series, with bust and standard, derived from earlier Kentish types, is more <b>densely</b> distributed {{in central and eastern}} East Anglia, including the Ipswich area. According to Michael Metcalf, the 'R' series was also East Anglian, being minted at Gipeswic.|$|E

5|$|This makes Zaprešić {{urban area}} at 1,036 {{inhabitants}} per square kilometer (2,683 per square mile) the most <b>densely</b> populated {{in the whole}} of Zagreb County. The town is administratively divided into nine settlements, the largest of which is also called Zaprešić, covering a third of the town's area.|$|E
5|$|Various {{residential}} neighbourhoods {{surround the}} downtown in all directions; expansion is greatest {{to the south}} and west, although several areas remain underdeveloped.

5|$|A funk {{and dance}} album, Rhythm Killers has a dense sound that {{incorporates}} contrasting musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long gapless suites, the album's songs {{are characterized by}} electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by turntable scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music elements, and Laswell's <b>densely</b> layered production.|$|E
5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a <b>densely</b> populated Jewish area of settlement. This came as a surprise to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E
5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's <b>densely</b> populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this portion}} of NY441 is {{surrounded}} by woodlands, it is actually located in a largely developed area of Penfield known locally as Panorama. The woods cease as NY441 approaches an interchange with Panorama Trail (NY153), the lone limited-access junction along the divided highway. East of NY153, NY441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road. Here, Route441 becomes Penfield Road and enters the <b>densely</b> populated hamlet of Penfield.|$|E
5|$|As {{a largely}} rural county, Dorset has fewer major {{cultural}} institutions than larger or more <b>densely</b> populated areas. Major venues for concerts and theatre include Poole's Lighthouse arts centre, Bournemouth's BIC, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy, and the Pavilion theatre in Weymouth. One of Dorset's most noted cultural institutions is the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra {{which was founded}} in 1893. Based in Poole, the orchestra performs over 130 concerts across southern England each year.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Brussels was still in many ways a medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members of the bourgeoisie, was upscale and modern. The rest of the city, however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of the Pentagon, was <b>densely</b> populated and industrial, characterized by an illogical street layout, back alleys, narrow streets, and numerous dead ends.|$|E
5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very <b>densely</b> in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|Bedfordshire is {{a county}} in the East of England. It is bounded by Hertfordshire to the south-east, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Northamptonshire to the north, and Buckinghamshire to the west.

Geographically, it is mainly rural, but still the fourteenth most <b>densely</b> populated county of England, with over half the population living in the two largest built-up areas, Luton and Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1920, the {{population}} of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold. Many of the new residents were immigrants who sought employment in the factories and mills and introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city. Ethnic neighborhoods emerged on <b>densely</b> populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{early history}} {{is that of}} a remote and {{marginal}} area. The main centres of population, power and wealth in the pre-industrial English Midlands lay in the fertile and accessible river valleys of the Trent, the Severn and the Avon. The area of modern Birmingham lay in between, on the upland Birmingham Plateau and within the <b>densely</b> wooded and sparsely populated Forest of Arden.|$|E
5|$|Caliph al-Mu’izz li-Din Allāh, {{the fourth}} Ismāʿīli Imam, conquered Egypt through his general Gawhar, wresting {{it from the}} Sunni Ikhshidid dynasty. By order of the Caliph, Gawhar then oversaw the {{construction}} of the royal enclosure of the Fatimid Caliphate and its army, and had al-Azhar built as a base to spread Ismāʿīli Shi'a Islam. Located near the <b>densely</b> populated Sunni city of Fustat, Cairo became the center of the Ismāʿīli sect of Shi'a Islam, and seat of the Fatimid empire.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found {{throughout}} almost all countries of South America except Chile. They live in <b>densely</b> forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, {{as well as}} flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth {{was not as}} <b>densely</b> {{populated}} as Halifax and {{was separated}} from the blast by {{the width of the}} harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Almost 100 people were estimated to have died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company. Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital in Dartmouth and many of the victims were treated there.|$|E
