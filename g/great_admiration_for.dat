5|$|In December 1883 Messager and Chabrier {{gave the}} first {{performance}} of the latter's Trois valses romantiques at the Société Nationale de Musique. The concert also included the two-piano version premiere of España. A close friend of Chabrier from the 1880s until Chabrier's death, Messager had a <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> Chabrier's opera Gwendoline and swore that he would conduct it in Paris, which he later did. He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the published vocal score of the work.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{began to}} have {{difficulty}} with his balance as early as 1988, although Alzheimer's disease was not diagnosed until the early 1990s. From September 1995 his Times column appeared once weekly instead of twice, and in January 1997 the editor, Peter Stothard, concluded, despite a <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> Levin, that the weekly column should cease. Levin retired, though he continued to write for the paper occasionally over the next year.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon III, {{who had a}} <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> {{all things}} Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close {{interest}} in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisné to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855–58, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed {{at one end and}} the conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.|$|E
5|$|By about 05:00, Dyck's {{ammunition}} {{supplies were}} running low, and the ZIPRA attackers {{had hit the}} Alamo {{a number of times}} with RPG fire. Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ {{in the form of a}} Lynx light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an FN MAG machine gun and SNEB rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered through the floor of his cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> James's bravery during this air strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had gone into the operational area against orders.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Mussolini and Adolf Hitler was a contentious one early on. While Hitler cited Mussolini as an influence and privately expressed <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> him, Mussolini had {{little regard for}} Hitler, especially after the Nazis had assassinated his friend and ally, Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrofascist dictator of Austria in 1934.|$|E

Plant and band performed thirteen songs– five by Arthur Lee & Love, five Led Zeppelin songs and three others, including a duet with Ian Hunter.

25|$|Lifar {{gave the}} company a new {{strength}} and purpose, initiating the rebirth of ballet in France, and began to create {{the first of many}} ballets for that company. During his three decades as director of the Paris Opéra Ballet, Lifar led the company through the turbulent times of World War II and the German occupation of France. Lifar brought the Paris Opéra Ballet to America and performed to full houses at the New York City Center. Audiences were enthusiastic and had <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> the company of dancers.|$|E
25|$|In 1779, {{he opened}} his own studio at Calle Del Traghetto at S. Maurizio,. At this time, Procurator Pietro Vettor Pisani {{commissioned}} Canova's first marble statue: a depiction of Daedalus and Icarus. The statue inspired <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> {{his work at the}} annual art fair; Canova was paid for 100 gold zecchini for the completed work. At the base of the statue, Daedalus' tools are scattered about; these tools are also an allusion to Sculpture, of which the statue is a personification. With such an intention, there is suggestion that Daedalus is a portrait of Canova's grandfather Pasino.|$|E

25|$|Degas's style {{reflects}} his deep {{respect for the}} old masters (he was an enthusiastic copyist well into middle age) and his <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugène Delacroix. He was also a collector of Japanese prints, whose compositional principles influenced his work, as did the vigorous realism of popular illustrators such as Daumier and Gavarni. Although famous for horses and dancers, Degas began with conventional historical paintings such as The Daughter of Jephthah (c.1859–61) and The Young Spartans (c.1860–62), in which his gradual progress toward a less idealized treatment of the figure is already apparent. During his early career, Degas also painted portraits of individuals and groups; {{an example of the}} latter is The Bellelli Family (c.1858–67), a brilliantly composed and psychologically poignant portrayal of his aunt, her husband, and their children. In this painting, as in The Young Spartans and many later works, Degas was drawn to the tensions present between men and women. In his early paintings, Degas already evidenced the mature style that he would later develop more fully by cropping subjects awkwardly and by choosing unusual viewpoints.|$|E

Brother Gimblet professed the <b>greatest</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> Brother Hawkyard, but (I had thought more than once) bore him a jealous grudge.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn four studies, {{we report}} {{evidence}} that admiration affects intergroup behaviors that regulate social hierarchy. We demonstrate that manipulating {{the legitimacy of}} status relations affects <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> the dominant and that this emotion negatively predicts political action tendencies aimed at social change. In addition, we show that greater warmth and competence lead to <b>greater</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> an outgroup, which in turn positively predicts deferential behavior and intergroup learning. We also demonstrate that, for those with a disposition to feel <b>admiration,</b> increasing <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> an outgroup decreases willingness to take political action against that outgroup. Finally, we show that when the object of admiration is a subversive “martyr,” admiration positively predicts political action tendencies and behavior aimed at challenging the status quo. These findings provide the first evidence for {{the important role of}} admiration in regulating social hierarchy...|$|R

500|$|Messiaen had a <b>great</b> <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> {{the music}} of Igor Stravinsky, {{particularly}} the use of rhythm in earlier works such as The Rite of Spring, and his use of colour. He was further influenced by the orchestral brilliance of Heitor Villa-Lobos, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and gave acclaimed concerts there. Among composers for the keyboard, Messiaen singled out Jean-Philippe Rameau, Domenico Scarlatti, Frédéric Chopin, Debussy and Isaac Albéniz. He loved {{the music of}} Modest Mussorgsky and incorporated varied modifications {{of what he called}} the [...] "M-shaped" [...] melodic motif from Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, although he modified the final interval in this motif from a perfect fourth to a tritone (Example 3).|$|E
