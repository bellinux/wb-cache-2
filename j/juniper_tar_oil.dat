40|$|Preparations of coal-tar and <b>juniper</b> <b>tar</b> (cade <b>oil)</b> {{that are}} used in the {{treatment}} of psoriasis are known to contain numerous potentially carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Evidence of covalent binding to DNA by components of these mixtures was sought in a) human skin biopsy samples from 12 psoriasis patients receiving therapy with these agents, b) human skin explants maintained in organ culture and treated topically with the tars, and c) the skin and lungs of mice treated with repeated doses of the formulations following the regimen used in the clinic. DNA was isolated from the human and mouse tissues and digested enzymically to mononucleotides. 32 P-Post-labeling analysis revealed the presence of aromatic DNA adducts in the biopsy samples at levels of up to 0. 4 fmol total adducts/μg DNA. Treatment of human skin in organ culture produced similar levels of adducts, while treatment with dithranol, a non-mutagenic therapeutic agent, resulted in chromatograms indistinguishable from those from untreated controls. In mouse skin, coaltar ointment and <b>juniper</b> <b>tar</b> gave similar DNA adduct levels, with a similar time-course of removal: maximum levels (0. 5 fmol/μg DNA) at 24 h after the final treatment declined rapidly to 0. 05 fmol/μg at 7 d, thereafter declining slowly over the succeeding 25 d. However, while coal-tar ointment produced only very low levels of adducts in mouse lung (< 0. 03 fmol/μg DNA), <b>juniper</b> <b>tar</b> produced adducts at a high level (0. 7 fmol/μg DNA) that were persistent in this tissue. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of potentially carcinogenic DNA damage in human and mouse tissue by components of these therapeutic tar preparations...|$|R

50|$|Tar {{was used}} as seal for roofing {{shingles}} and tar paper and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia, wood tar was used to waterproof sails and boats, but today, sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have reduced the demand for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well as painting exterior walls of log buildings. Tar is also a general disinfectant. Pine <b>tar</b> <b>oil,</b> or wood <b>tar</b> <b>oil,</b> is a pure natural product used for the surface treatment of wooden shingle roofs, boats, buckets, and tubs and in the medicine, soap, and rubber industries.

40|$|LC-MS-MS {{analysis}} of groundwater of a <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated site showed {{the occurrence of}} the N-heterocycles quinoline and isoquinoline {{as well as their}} hydroxylated and hydrogenated metabolites. The concentrations of the hydroxylated compounds, 2 (1 H) -quinolinone and 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, were significantly higher than those of the nonsubstituted parent compounds. Therefore, exclusive quantification of the parent compounds leads to an underestimation of the amount of N-heterocycles present in the groundwater. Microbial degradation experiments of quinoline and isoquinoline with aquifer material of the site as inocculum showed the formation of hydroxylated and hydrogenated products under sulfate-reducing conditions, the prevailing conditions in the field. However, since analyses of seven tar products showed that these compounds are also primary constituents, their detection in groundwater is found to be a nonsufficient indicator for the occurrence of biological natural attenuation processes. Instead, the ratio of hydroxylated to parent compound (R-metabolite) is proposed as a useful indicator. We found that 65 - 83 % of all groundwater samples showed R-metabolite for 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, and 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, which was higher than the highest ratio found in tar products. With respect to the observed partition coefficient between <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> and water of 3. 5 for quinoline and isoquinoline and 0. 3 for 2 (1 H) -quinolinone and 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, the ratio in groundwater would be approximately 10 times higher than the ratio in <b>tar</b> <b>oil.</b> When paying attention to these two parameters, 19 - 31 % of groundwater samples exceed the highest <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> ratio. This indicates that biological processes take place in the aquifer of the site and R-metabolite is an applicable indicator for natural attenuation...|$|R

40|$|Birch <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> (BTO) is a {{by-product}} of processing birch wood in a pyrolysis system. Accumulating evidence suggests the suitability of BTO as a biocide or repellent in terrestrial environments for the control of weeds, insects, molluscs and rodents. Once applied as biocide, BTO may end up, either through run-off or leaching, in aquatic systems and may have adverse effects on non-target organisms. As very {{little is known about}} the toxicity of BTO to aquatic organisms, the present study investigated acute toxicity (LC 50 /EC 50) of BTO for eight aquatic organisms. Bioassays with the Asellus aquaticus (crustacean), Lumbriculus variegatus (oligochaeta worm), Daphnia magna (crustacean), Lymnea sp. (mollusc), Lemna minor (vascular plant), Danio rerio (fish), Scenedesmus gracilis (algae), and Vibrio fischeri (bacterium) were performed according to ISO, OECD or USEPA-guidelines. The results indicated that BTO was practically nontoxic to most aquatic organisms as the median effective BTO concentrations against most organisms were > 150 mg L- 1. In conclusion, our toxicity tests showed that aquatic organisms are to some extent, invariably sensitive to birch <b>tar</b> <b>oil,</b> but suggest that BTO does not pose a severe hazard to aquatic biota.

40|$|Renardine is a bone tar product {{available}} {{for use as a}} coyote (Canis latrans) repellent in Canada. The substance is applied to pasture borders to prevent coyotes from entering and attacking sheep. Because data regarding the effectiveness of Renardine are lacking, we designed two experiments. In the first, six pairs of coyotes were first presented with 400 g of ground meat in two pans (200 g/pan) with false screen bottoms. Beneath the screens were absorbent tubes wetted with 10 ml of distilled water. Subsequently, during a treatment period, the absorbent tube was wetted with 10 ml of Renardine. Pans were presented for 60 minutes, and the amount of time to consume the meat was recorded. In the second experiment, six additional pairs of coyotes were first presented with 200 g of ground meat inside a barrier created with baling twine and wooden dowels. The area inside the barrier was 1 m 2, and the twine was tied onto the dowels 0. 25 m above the ground. During the treatment period, the twine and dowels were painted with Renardine. In both experiments, all coyote pairs consumed all of the ground meat shortly after presentation. We conclude that Renardine probably is not an effective coyote repellent. However, because the active ingredient in Renardine is bone <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> and bone <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> is deer repellent, we speculate that Renardine may have utility as an herbivore repellent...|$|R
