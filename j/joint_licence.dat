50|$|Writhe was {{the first}} Garter of the College of Arms, which had been {{incorporated}} in March 1484. Contrary to popular belief, though, the College did not take its own coat of arms from Writhe; the converse is more likely. As Falcon and Garter he was employed on numerous diplomatic missions to Scotland and the continent, and at least once to Ireland. An experienced armorist, Writhe collected and compiled many important armorial and genealogical manuscripts. In 1498 King Henry VII granted him and Roger Machado, Clarenceux King of Arms, a <b>joint</b> <b>licence</b> to make visitations.|$|E
50|$|In June 1498, Machado and John Writhe, Garter King of Arms, {{were granted}} a <b>joint</b> <b>licence</b> to make visitations. There is no {{evidence}} that they or their deputies undertook these journeys. Machado wished to concentrate on his trading activities and diplomatic missions rather than on his heraldic duties. In 1505, the king offered Machado the office of Garter King of Arms, but he declined on the grounds that he was too old and weak. Machado also handed over to Thomas Writhe, the new Garter, many of the duties of Clarenceux. In January 1509 the two formalized an agreement where Machado handing over substantial powers as Clarenceux in return for a payment of £4 a year from Garter Writhe.|$|E

An earlier ministerial meeting, {{had decided that}} the new licence should have a chip to be introduced at a later time. The advantage of a chip built into a plastic card is that, {{in addition to the}} printed licence information, the chip may contain additional information about the bearer if that is desirable. The chip information may increase the security of the card and, for instance, store a coded fingerprint. This will make it very difficult to use the card if it is in the wrong hands...|$|R

Since average usage time (usage time per employee) of statistical software is very small compared to office tools (word processors, spreadsheets, etc.), “global ” availability of commercial statistical software is therefore not economical. This means that even in companies in which a common commercial statistical tool was available to everybody before, this {{will no longer be}} the case in the near future. Access to commercial statistical software will be limited to a pool of statisticians and para-statisticians. All others have to live with what their spreadsheet offers. I believe that now is a unique opportunity for imposing standardized opensource/zero-cost software: This would allow global coverage, training, and communication even under changing environment. The R-language holds the potential to become such a solution. However, its lack of a GUI facilitating elementary tasks and its insufficient integration into office tools (Microsoft, OpenOffice, etc) make this currently impossible. This abstract is essentially the content of the talk I gave at the DSC 2003 session. In this paper, I shall describe my view of the status just after the conference.
