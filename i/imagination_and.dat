When Ralph is freed by a museum employee, Marge and Chief Wiggum are there to meet him. Marge observes that Ralph has a vivid <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> learns that he has no friends to play with; she {{arranges}} a play-date for Ralph to spend time with a horrified Bart.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{returned}} to Britain in September 1904. The expedition {{had caught the}} public <b>imagination,</b> <b>and</b> Scott became a popular hero. He was awarded a cluster of honours and medals, including many from overseas, and was promoted {{to the rank of}} captain. He was invited to Balmoral Castle, where King Edward VII promoted him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO).|$|E

To help illustrate the scientific topics, NASA supplied Haarsma with space related information to present.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Kon {{released}} the 13-episode television series Paranoia Agent, in which Kon revisits {{the theme of}} the blending of <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> reality, as well as working in additional social themes. The series was created from an abundance of unused ideas for stories and arrangements that Kon felt were good but did not fit into any of his projects.|$|E
5|$|The Gold Rush {{propelled}} California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to {{a center}} of the global <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> the destination {{of hundreds of thousands}} of people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable inventiveness and civic-mindedness. For example, in the midst of the Gold Rush, towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.|$|E
5|$|The {{primacy of}} <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> intuition over the {{subjective}} character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco's style. El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion. He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace {{only if he}} manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease.|$|E

5|$|Verville {{was born}} in Atlantic Mine, {{a small town in}} Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on November 16, 1890, as the son of Victor Verville and Fabianna Miron. As a child, his mother bought him a Conyne-style box kite from Sears Roebuck, which {{captured}} his <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> started his interest in flight and aviation. Verville also began reading stories about the Wright Brothers in newspapers and magazines with great interest. Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses.|$|E
5|$|When {{it opened}} on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall, the Shakespeare Gallery {{contained}} 34 paintings {{and by the}} end of its run it had between 167 and 170.

5|$|After {{the success}} of Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Burton was sent several scripts and became disheartened by their lack of <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> {{original}}ity. When he was sent Michael McDowell's original script for Beetlejuice, Burton agreed to direct, although Larry Wilson and later Warren Skaaren were hired to rewrite it. Beetlejuice was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$73.7 million from a budget of US$15 million. It won the Academy Award for Best Makeup and three Saturn Awards: Best Horror Film, Best Makeup and Best Supporting Actress for Sylvia Sidney, her final award before her death in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In September 2003, {{a version}} of Newman played by actor Ian Brooker {{appeared}} in the straight-to-CD Doctor Who Unbound radio play Deadline, written by Rob Shearman and released by Big Finish Productions. The play was set {{in a world in}} which Doctor Who had never been created, existing only in the <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> memories of fictional writer Martin Bannister, played by Derek Jacobi. As part of the plot of the play, Bannister was unable to clearly remember whether Newman had been Canadian or Australian, with the Newman character's accent changing according to Bannister's varying memories.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during her North American debut in 2011, Kurosaki mentioned {{that it had}} been her long-time dream to perform theme songs for anime series, and that anime {{is a big part of}} her life. She related her experiences working at Dear Stage, where originally worked as a waitress and performer. She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage would prove to be a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> gave him glamour.|$|E

5|$|Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland (Felicity Jones), {{daughter}} of Mr. and Mrs. Morland (Gerry O'Brien and Julia Dearden), is a tomboy with a wild <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> {{a passion for}} Gothic novels. Family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen (Desmond Barrit and Sylvestra Le Touzel), invite Catherine to spend the season in Bath and she readily accepts. At her first ball, Catherine meets and dances with Henry Tilney (JJ Feild). The following day, Catherine makes the acquaintance of the Thorpe family. She becomes good friends with Isabella Thorpe (Carey Mulligan) and she meets Isabella's brother, John (William Beck), when she is reunited with her own brother, James (Hugh O'Conor).|$|E
5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} as a vehicle to further explore Janeway's <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> her social relationships, but critics disagreed on whether the storyline was appropriate for the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway Lambda one were never fully resolved due to lack of interest from fans of the Voyager series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway Lambda one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of the Voyager series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the Harivamsa. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (lila), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in Harivamsa, but is a symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} <b>imaginations</b> <b>and</b> struggles of early {{adolescent}} males {{for the purpose}} of providing a research foundation for future missiological strategies to and with this age cohort. The method used to access the excited <b>imaginations</b> <b>and</b> existential struggles of early adolescent males is to report and compare two ethnographic studies, the Early Adolescent Male Study and the Lutheran Men in Mission Male Spirituality Study. These studies show that there are five factors that excite the <b>imaginations</b> <b>and</b> five factors that describe the existential struggles of early adolescent males. These factors reflect the first two uses of the Law. In addition, five congregational practices are significant in engaging the faith life of the cohort. Interpreting these data from the perspective of brain research and evolutionary psychology shows that three factors in particular, the Relationship Factor, the Action Factor and the Achievement Factor, are neural-biologically determined. Ministry to and with this cohort calls for cross-generational relationships with adult males who are authentic, available, affirming, action and achievement-oriented (AAAAA) ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the <b>imagination,</b> <b>and</b> a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Hamling {{started a}} {{companion}} magazine, Imaginative Tales; in addition, his company Greenleaf Publishing was {{the publisher of}} Rogue, a men's magazine modelled after Playboy. In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, {{but in many cases}} it proved impossible to attract the additional advertising income that would have kept the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with Imagination one of the victims; Hamling closed down both <b>Imagination</b> <b>and</b> its sister magazine to invest the money in Rogue instead. The last issue of Imagination was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while Imaginative Tales, retitled Space Travel, ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of Imagination omitted its letter, book review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.|$|E
5|$|In a long {{article in}} Le Figaro in July 1856, Offenbach traced {{the history of}} comic opera. He {{declared}} that the first work worthy to be called opéra-comique was Philidor's 1759 Blaise le savetier, and he described the gradual divergence of Italian and French notions of comic opera, with verve, <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> gaiety from Italian composers, and cleverness, common sense, good taste and wit from the French composers. He concluded that comic opera had become too grand and inflated. His disquisition was a preliminary to the announcement of an open competition for aspiring composers. A jury of French composers and playwrights including Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, Charles Gounod and Eugène Scribe considered 78 entries; the five short-listed entrants were all asked to set a libretto, Le docteur miracle, written by Ludovic Halévy and Léon Battu. The joint winners were Georges Bizet and Charles Lecocq. Bizet became, and remained, a devoted friend of Offenbach. Lecocq and Offenbach took a dislike to one another, and their subsequent rivalry was not altogether friendly.|$|E
