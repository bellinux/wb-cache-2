500|$|B-52s {{prior to}} the G models had very small ailerons with a short span that was {{approximately}} equal to their chord. These [...] "feeler ailerons" [...] were used to provide feedback forces to the pilot's control yoke and to fine tune the roll axes during delicate maneuvers such as aerial refueling. Due to twisting of the thin main wing, conventional outboard <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> ailerons would lose authority and therefore could not be used. In other words, aileron activation would cause the wing to twist, undermining roll control. Six spoilerons on each wing {{are responsible for the}} majority of roll control. The late B-52G models eliminated the ailerons altogether and added an extra spoileron to each wing. Partly {{because of the lack of}} ailerons, the B-52G and H models were more susceptible to dutch roll.|$|E

50|$|The Stena Britannica {{has four}} main MAN diesel engines, {{producing}} between them 33,600 kW, and providing for a maximum speed of 22 knots (25 mph). Two of the engines are rated at 9,600 kW {{and the other two}} at 7,200 kW. The engines are connected via two gearboxes to two controllable pitch propellers. The two rudders, one behind each propeller, are of the Becker <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> with twisted leading edges. Control of the bow while docking is by two tunnel thrusters.|$|E
50|$|A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or exhaust {{over the}} flaps to {{increase}} lift beyond that attainable with mechanical <b>flaps.</b> <b>Types</b> include the original (internally blown flap) which blows compressed {{air from the}} engine {{over the top of}} the flap, the externally blown flap, which blows engine exhaust over the upper and lower surfaces of the flap, and upper surface blowing which blows engine exhaust {{over the top of the}} wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. Upper Surface Blowing was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Phase lag (rotorcraft) {{will cause}} the extra lift to be seen {{approximately}} 90 degrees later in rotor rotation in semi-rigid two bladed rotor systems. Phase lag is a separate phenomenon from gyroscopic precession. Phase lag is a property of all rotating systems acted upon by a periodic force. For systems hinged at the axis of rotation (in our case, a semi rigid <b>flapping</b> <b>type</b> rotor head) the phase lag is 90 degrees. For systems that are hinged at {{some distance from the}} axis of rotation (such as a fully articulated rotor head) the phase lag is less than 90 degrees. The pilot will experience either a right or left roll (see flight dynamics), depending upon whether the rotor of the helicopter rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Perfusion {{dynamics}} of 16 free DIEP flaps and 4 free SIEA flaps were studied during the first, third, and sixth postoperative day using dynamic infrared thermography (DIRT). For both <b>flap</b> <b>types</b> the zone positioned over the perforator is perfused first, {{followed by the}} adjacent ipsilateral zone, and finally the contralateral zones. Perfusion of the subdermal plexus of all zones preceded the perfusion of the subcutaneous layer of all zones. While the initial hyperemia subsided with time, {{the total number of}} hot spots increased with time. Perfusion of free DIEP and SIEA flaps during the first postoperative week is a dynamic process. The perfusion shows a stepwise progression {{at the level of the}} subdermal plexus and at the level of the subcutaneous layer each with its own time sequence and with the midline as an area of resistance for circulation...|$|R
50|$|In the Sherpa, the wing, {{which was}} used without a tailplane, was fitted with {{rotating}} tips comprising approximately one-fifth of the total wing area. These were rotated together (to act as elevators) or in opposition (when they acted as ailerons). They were hinged at about 30% chord and each carried, on the trailing edge, a small anti-balance tab, the fulcrum {{of which could be}} moved by means of an electric actuator. It was expected that the rotary wing tip controls would prove greatly superior to the <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> at transonic speeds and provide greater man≈ìuvrability at high altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Although {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the preceding Z1 and Z2-class trams they had significant design differences, and were a significant improvement on the Z1 and Z2-class trams. They are fitted with AEG control equipment and Duewag bogies, have an additional door each side (for a total of three rather than two for the Z1 and Z2), drop down (as opposed to top sliding) Beclawat windows and improved headlights. The unreliable <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> destination displays and route number indicators were replaced by rollable plastic film destination displays. They also had much smoother acceleration and braking performance, and improved suspension. The Z3-class build process went smoothly, with few problems, bar a slow delivery of equipment from AEG, and a few minor faults that required remedying after construction.|$|E

5000|$|The rear {{portion of}} airfoil rotates {{downwards}} {{on a simple}} hinge mounted {{at the front of}} the flap. The Royal Aircraft Factory and National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom tested flaps in 1913 and 1914, but these were never installed in an actual aircraft. In 1916, the Fairey Aviation Company made a number of improvements to a Sopwith Baby they were rebuilding, including their Patent Camber Changing Gear, making the Fairey Hamble Baby as they renamed it, the first aircraft to fly with flaps. These were full span plain flaps which incorporated ailerons, making it also the first instance of flaperons. Fairey were not alone however, as Breguet soon incorporated automatic flaps into the lower wing of their Breguet 14 reconnaissance/bomber in 1917. Due to the greater efficiency of other <b>flap</b> <b>types,</b> the plain <b>flap</b> is normally only used where simplicity is required.|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s {{some more}} {{extensions}} were necessary. The great demand for specialist research required {{the building of}} more sophisticated test facilities. The first one was the Seakeeping Basin (1956) for research into ship behaviour in waves. Next came the Shallow Water Basin (1958), for tug boats, inland shipping and merchandise shipping in shallow water. In 1965 a High Speed Basin and a Wave and Current Basin were put in operation.In the High Speed Basin tests are carried out with ship models or appendages that are propelled at very high speeds. In the Wave and Current Basin (today‚Äôs Offshore Basin) wind, current and waves are simulated for research into the behaviour of structures during complex operations at sea, such as {{the oil and gas}} production and dredging operations.In 1970 the Manoeuvring Simulator was built to find solutions for ever more complex manoeuvring operations and because of increased interest in the relation between man and ship.In 1972 the institute was further extended with a Vacuum Tank at Ede for the research into problems caused by propeller cavitation. In 1980 NSP and NMI (Rotterdam) decided to merge, which {{was the beginning of the}} Maritime Research Institute Netherlands, MARIN. The latest extension was the Vessel Traffic Service simulator, where VTS operators are trained. In 2000 and 2001 the institute was again thoroughly updated. The former Seakeeping Basin and Wave and Current Basin were replaced by a new Seakeeping and Manoeuvring Basin and a new Offshore Basin. Moreover, the Vacuum Tank was completely renovated. In 2012 <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> wave maker were added on two sides of vacuum tank which is now called depressurized towing tank (DWB).|$|E

40|$|The {{flow field}} {{generated}} by a two-dimensional airfoil with a statically deflected <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> spoiler has been experimentally studied. Subsonic tests ascertained the effect of varying spoiler deflection and angle of attack on the flow field at two Reynolds numbers.

The results pertaining to the unsteady characteristics of the spoiler flow field are presented. It is shown that vortex shedding characterized the spoiler wake and determines the unsteady nature of the overall flow field; {{the character of the}} vortex shedding changes with spoiler deflection; and the fluctuating surface pressure field (vortex shedding frequency component) is of appreciable magnitude at large spoiler deflections...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the correlation between non-technical risk factors and the perioperative flap survival rate and to evaluate the choice of skin flap for the reconstruction of foot and ankle. This was a clinical retrospective study. Nine variables were identified. The Kaplan-Meier method coupled with a log-rank test and a Cox regression model was used to predict the risk factors that influence the perioperative flap survival rate. The relationship between postoperative wound infection and risk factors was also analyzed using a logistic regression model. The overall flap survival rate was 85. 42 %. The necrosis rates of free flaps and pedicled flaps were 5. 26 % and 20. 69 %, respectively. According to the Cox regression model, <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> (hazard ratio [HR] = 2. 592; 95 % confidence interval [CI] (1. 606, 4. 184); P < 0. 001) and postoperative wound infection (HR = 0. 266; 95 % CI (0. 134, 0. 529); P < 0. 001) were found to be statistically significant risk factors associated with flap necrosis. Based on the logistic regression model, preoperative wound bed inflammation (odds ratio [OR] = 11. 371, 95 % CI (3. 117, 41. 478), P < 0. 001) was a statistically significant risk factor for postoperative wound infection. <b>Flap</b> <b>type</b> and postoperative wound infection were both independent risk factors influencing the flap survival rate in the foot and ankle. However, postoperative wound infection was a risk factor for the pedicled flap but not for the free flap. Microvascular anastomosis is a major cause of free flap necrosis.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{dynamics}} of wave energy converters and vortical structure of breaking waves are challenging hydrodynamic problems relevant to coastal engineering. These issues can be addressed at the laboratory scale through a specialized class of devices known as experimental wave flumes and numerical wave tanks (NWTs). This paper presents the process of design and development of a NWT and a wave flume that would eventually be applied for analyzing the hydrodynamics of breaking waves. The wave characteristics to be simulated have been selected from literature based on measurements {{carried out in the}} Gulf of Kutch, Gujarat. The NWT is based on a volume-of-fluid (VOF) formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations on a staggered grid using the mass-source function technique for wave generation. The flume is an acrylic tank equipped with a <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> wavemaker having dimensions adopted from the NWT.
