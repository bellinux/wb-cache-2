40|$|Vietnam is a {{poor country}} with large and {{increasing}} needs in infrastructure, education, health, and {{other areas of the}} public sector. The current policy of the Government of Vietnam (GOV) is not to increase tax effort, but actually to reduce it. Recently, the GOV has cut the rates of several taxes with the goal of making Vietnam’s exports more competitive internationally and to attract more foreign direct investment. Tax revenues will be further cut in the near future as the GOV prepares for accession to the WTO by reducing the level and dispersion of customs tariff rates. The large current needs for additional public funds and the plans not to increase taxes, or actually to decrease them, present the GOV with a significant policy dilemma. Possibly the only non-inflationary solution to this dilemma is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire public sector. Because Vietnam has significantly decentralized expenditure responsibilities to the provincial and local governments (the share of subnational governments in total expenditures is around 40 percent; see Table 1), the GOV decentralization policy takes special importance in the overall drive for greater efficiency and overall fiscal balance of the public sector. The ability of the GOV to increase {{the quantity and quality of}} public services lies largely in a more efficient and equitable system of <b>decentralized</b> <b>finance.</b> This is the fundamental reason for assessing in this chapter of the Public Expenditure Review (PER) the ongoing decentralization process in Vietnam.

40|$|While the {{theoretical}} arguments for fiscal decentralization {{developed over the}} past thirty-five years have proven compelling enough for the concept to win great favor, very little empirical work has proven the merits of such policies in the forms governments have actually implemented. We examine the results of educational fiscal decentralization in a developing country with an established framework for fiscal federalism and a concomitant history of intense centralization. The structure {{of the flow of}} funds in the Mexican education sector provide an example to study: (1) the importance of the spatial distribution of outcomes resulting from expenditures rather than simply the distribution of the expenditures alone; (2) the distribution of resources to subnational political units; (3) intergovernmental relations and the resulting incentive structure for service provision, particularly with respect to fiscal transfers and grants administration; (4) the effects from decentralization efforts over the past decade, and the resulting implications for probable outcomes from efforts to decentralize; and (5) the interplay of centralized versus <b>decentralized</b> <b>finance</b> and administration. We develop methods to analyze political and socio-economic factors that affect intergovernmental fiscal allocations. The results show that (1) the Federal Government does trade some efficiency for the sake of distributional concerns in the provision of educational resources, but in doing so may discriminate against subnational jurisdictions based on factors like voting behavior or marginalized minority populations; and (2) the pattern of Federal-to-state allocations may not be replicated at the state-to-municipal level, even by Federal agencies at the state level. We also provide evidence that states may not currently be as effective educational providers as the Federal Government, raising concern for efforts to decentralize. Policy implications and recommendations resulting from Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s experience revolve around the development of an accountable matching grant mechanism for fiscal transfers that would retain those aspects of centralized financial control beneficial to efficient and equitable service provision, while stimulating the improvements that may result from augmenting regional and local fiscal and administrative responsibilities for education. ...|$|E

A nuanced assessment of the potential effectiveness of fiscal decentralization reform around the world requires recognition of the following facts: (1) The intergovernmental dimension of public finance is critically important for the public sector to support economic growth and deliver public services in an effective and pro-poor manner.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we explore some of the policy {{issues related to the}} {{provision}} of primary and secondary education in the United States from an economic stand-point. We begin with stylized facts and a brief reference to the uniquely <b>decentralized</b> <b>financing</b> and delivery of public education in the United States, and the resulting issues of equity and quality that arise. As a reference point we review the basic efficiency and equity arguments for public financing and the provision of public goods in general, and education specifically, both of which suggest that current prac-tices are unlikely to be efficient or equitable. These are issues that have motivated a number of policy avenues—the accountability movement, including No Child Left Behind, as well as recent efforts to establish higher and uniform standards for our public schools. We then turn to the sizable body of literature assessing school perform-ance. We include an empirical example of this approach for Texas primary and secondary schools, with a focus on the many challenging issues involved with model-ing and assessing educational performance. Our application demonstrates that research findings are highly sensitive to modeling choices, suggesting that a mixed methods approach is most likely to lead to effective education reforms...|$|R

40|$|One {{objective}} frequently {{found in}} models of <b>decentralized</b> <b>financing</b> {{is that of}} equalization. The concern is that poorer jurisdictions receive enough resources for basic services and for development promotion, thus eliminating horizontal and vertical imbalances. In Portugal, decentralization has occurred at two levels: the local, for the whole country and the regional for the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira. Decentralization to local governments has undergone several changes in recent decades. The current paper focuses on testing {{for the presence of}} an equalization effect in the models adopted to finance municipalities in Portugal, since the nineteen nineties. Using the theoretical background that maintains that for the presence of an equalizing effect it is necessary that, on a per capita basis, poorer regions or localities receive relatively more transfers than the richer jurisdictions, a test is made using a data set that includes all municipalities of Portugal. The situation of the two autonomous regions is controlled with dummy variables. The hypothesis that the models used have an equalizing effect is tested through the sign of the coefficient of the regression of per capita transfers on per capita own resources. In the presence of an equalizing effect the sign will be significant and negative. It is confirmed that, for the period under analysis, the municipalities with lower per capita own revenues are those that receive more transfers per capita. There is, therefore, an equalizing effect in the current transfer system to municipalities. Using pooled data, one can also conclude that the equalization effect has become stronger with the 1998 and 2002 reviews of the system, when compared to the system in effect in 1991...|$|R
40|$|Most economists {{agree that}} new {{investments}} in highways {{at this point}} in time in the United States have little impact on overall growth in output. New highways play a more important role in shifting economic activities among places, drawing jobs from other locations into the highway corridors, a phenomenon known as negative spillovers. The objective of this dissertation is two-fold, to examine the proposal to <b>decentralize</b> highway <b>finance,</b> which aims to solve the financial responsibility mismatch problem that stems from economic spillovers of highways, and to test the hypothesis of economic spillovers of highway investment at the metropolitan level. First, to better understand how spillovers influence the highway investment decision, the theoretical framework from the interjurisdictional tax competition literature is borrowed to model governments' investment behaviors. Numerical simulations show that decentralized local governments, which independently maximize output in their own jurisdiction, may engage in wasteful investments in highways with the presence of spillovers. Second, to shed more light on the spatial detail of economic spillovers, empirical tests of the spillover hypothesis are conducted at the metropolitan level, with census tracts as the unit of observation. The results of the quasi-experiment reveal census tract employment growth patterns that confirm the existence of negative spillovers caused by the opening of the Interstate 105 in 1993. The benefiting area, which grew substantially after the highway was opened, is limited to a long narrow corridor around the highway, while nearby locations outside the corridor experienced slow growth relative to the rest of the metropolitan area after controlling for various factors. Together, these results suggest that although negative spillovers are present at the metropolitan level, <b>decentralizing</b> highway <b>finance</b> may not be an effective policy to deal with the financial responsibility mismatch problem. Highway finance should remain centralized within metropolitan areas, and regional governing bodies should pay special attention to the distributional impact of highway projects...|$|R

40|$|To {{shed light}} on {{decentralization}} in Russia, the authors examine intergovernmental fiscal relations within regions. To analyze trends, they review channels of fiscal allocation within regions - tax sharing and local transfer schemes. To evaluate {{the potential impact of}} various fiscal decentralization patterns on regional economic performance (including growth and the budget deficit), the authors study data on the structure of 89 Russian consolidated regional budgets for 1992 - 96. They find that local governments'relative share of Russia's consolidated budget, although substantive (roughly a quarter of the total budget), did not expand after 1994. The federal government's relative role in financing public goods and services declined as the relative role of local governments increased substantially. Local governments collected more revenues in 1996 (6. 4 percent of GDP) and spent more than regional governments. They also substantially increased social financing (including health, education, and social protection). Russia made no progress toward a more transparent system for tax assignments. The average level of expenditure decentralization is similar for ethnically Russian regions and national republics and"okrugs"but revenue arrangements differ greatly. "True"decentralization has taken place in"oblasts"and"krais"where local authorities are provided with a bigger share of sub-national tax revenues. A redistribution model applies in republics and autonomous okrugs, where greater local outlays have been financed through larger transfers from regional governments. Regions near each other tend to have similar budget arrangements - the result of intensive interactions between neighbors and probably supported by the activities of regional associations. The size of a region's territory does not influence decentralization outcomes. Fiscal decentralization seems positively related to the share of education spending in regional budgets. And regions with more <b>decentralized</b> <b>finances</b> tend to experience less economic decline. But budget control is weaker in more decentralized regions. Instability and lack of transparency in intergovernmental fiscal relations provide sub-national governments little incentive for responsible fiscal policy. Further decentralization without greater transparency could bring greater debt and deficits.

40|$|<b>Decentralizing</b> public <b>finances</b> {{has many}} {{advantages}} but also raises potential problems, {{especially in the}} area of fiscal management. One problem arises mainly during and soon after the transition to fiscal decentralization, when the central government, unless it reduces spending or increases its own tax resources, tends to have higher deficits as it shifts fiscal resources to subnational governments, via transfers, revenue sharing, or delegation of tax bases. Reducing spending is hard not only because cuts are always hard but also because subnational governments might not take on the tasks anticipated, leaving the central government with a legal or political obligation to continue spending for certain services. The second problem arises after decentralization, when the local or state government faces popular pressures to spend more and tax less, creating the tendency to run deficits. This universal tendency can be especially problematic if subnational governments and their creditors expect or rely on central government bailouts. Econometric evidence from 32 large industrial and developing countries indicates that higher subnational spending and deficits lead to greater deficits at the national level (Fornasari, Webb, and Zou 1998; see also Treisman 1998).

40|$|Abstract: This paper sets outs evaluative {{criteria}} that planners must consider in organizing school systems and applies them to systems where student populations and communities are diverse. Specifically, school systems should allow {{for families to}} exercise some degree of freedom of choice in what schooling options they take; but they should also be efficient, be fair, and promote the social good. To apply these criteria to education systems characterised by diversity, {{it is necessary to}} understand what diversity entails. Diversity will impact in terms of curricular or pedagogical changes, but its most fundamental effect will be in the way students group with each other, i. e. the formation of peer groups according to ethnicity, learning need, religion, family wealth, or social status. Thus, these evaluative criteria need to be considered in the context of peer group diversity. Three key policy instruments may be used to influence how peer groups are formed. These instruments are: eligibililty (which students, which schools, and which curricula are to be permitted within the school system); financing (what resources should be allocated to different types of students); and support services (what information, transportation, and adjudication services are available for students). This allows us to draw lessons for planning and influencing peer groups. We draw on examples from the U. S., contrasting the system of <b>decentralized</b> local <b>financing</b> with targetted programs to enhance school choice, from the U. K., where public school choice is extensive, from Chile, where a large scale voucher program exists, and from New Zealand, where school-level peer effects are explicitly identified in the funding formula...|$|R
40|$|China's {{transition}} into {{a market economy}} has exerted some influence on the health sector {{in terms of a}} significant growth of facilities, but it has also produced a range of destabilizing social costs. This thesis analyzes the relations between healthcare pricing and payment reforms and the different delivery aspects such as the exemption program for the poor, public health programs for tuberculosis control and the provision of hospital services. A health economics and systems conceptual framework is used for analyzing aspects of the health systems in terms of market failures and the institutional response from governments and regulators. In study I, the exemption programs for hospitals where the poor are relieved of paying the price or user charges are analyzed. The study is a case study where patient records from nine hospitals were reviewed, together with interviews with key informants and community representatives. The study showed that the discount offered was limited, where only a minority of indigents received discounts and the hospitals lacked incentives for efficiently carrying out the programs. Study II investigates the effect of the new urban health insurance system on hospital charges. The study uses two tracers, acute appendicitis and normal childbirth, at six hospitals from two cities with different insurance systems. The result showed a lower rate of increase in hospitals charges in the city implementing the urban health insurance reform. Regression analysis showed contracting mechanisms and length of stay to be the main determinants for hospital charges. Study III analyzes the operation of TB control programs in a decentralized financial system. A case study was conducted in four counties with different economic developments in the Shandong province. Data was collected from a review of documents and interviews with patients and key informants. The study showed weak government support to the TB control program and less developed DOT (directly observed therapy) programs in the poorer counties. TB patients suffered heavy financial burdens. The <b>decentralized</b> <b>financing</b> system had negatively affected the provision of public health programs such as TB control programs. In study IV, the impact of retail price control of drugs on hospital drug expenditures was examined. The study is a case study at two hospitals. Total drug expenditures were analyzed based on financial records and a tracer, cerebral infarction, was used for an in-depth examination of prices, volume, expenditures and rationality of drug use. Findings showed that after the implementation of the drug pricing policy, total drug expenditures increased as rapidly as before. Drug expenditure per patient for cerebral infarction showed indistinct results, indicating that the regulation was not effective. Utilization rather than price was more determinative for drug expenditures. Study V investigates the development of revenues, costs and performance in the hospital sector. In a sample of 41 hospitals in two cities, the use of inputs, investments and productivity was estimated. The findings showed that hospitals had expanded their staff and invested in new medical equipment. The corresponding change of outputs in terms of outpatient and inpatient performance showed a slower increasing rate, resulting in a diminishing productivity rate over time. The market-oriented health care system in China is faced with different 'market failures' problems such as limited access to health services for the poor and the inaccuracy in relying on market mechanisms for services characterized by positive externalities, such as the public health programs. Financial autonomy has given health providers the incentives to maximize revenues. Government interventions to contain costs and improve efficiency show that a sole reliance on the price mechanism is insufficient and must be combined with other tools set by regulators and insurers...|$|R

40|$|In {{shifting}} to <b>decentralized</b> public <b>finances,</b> a country's central government faces certain fiscal management problems. First, during {{and soon after}} the transition, unless it reduces pending or increases its own tax resources, the central government tends to have higher deficits as it shifts fiscal resources to sub-national governments through transfers, revenue sharing, or delegation of tax bases. Reducing spending is hard, not only because cuts are always hard, but because sub-national governments might not take on expected tasks, leaving the central government with a legal or political obligation to continue spending for certain services. Second, after decentralization, the local or state government faces popular pressure to spend more and tax less, creating the tendency to run deficits. This tendency {{can be a problem}} if sub-national governments and their creditors expect or rely on bailouts by the central government. Econometric evidence from 32 large industrial and developing countries indicates that higher sub-national spending and deficits lead to greater national deficits. The authors investigate how, and how successfully, Argentina and Brazil dealt with these problems in the 1990 s. In both countries, sub-national governments account for about half of public spending and are vigorous democracies in most (especially the largest) jurisdictions. The return to democracy in the 1980 s revived and strengthened long-standing federal practices while weakening macroeconomic performance, resulting in unsustainable fiscal deficits, high inflation, sometimes hyperinflation, and low or negative growth. Occasional stabilization plans failed within a few years. Then Argentina (in 1991) and Brazil (in 1994) introduced successful stabilization plans. National issues were important in preventing and then bringing about macroeconomic stabilization, but so were intergovernmental fiscal relations and the fiscal management of sub-national governments. State deficits and federal transfers were often out of control in the 1980 s, contributing to national macroeconomic problems. Stabilization programs in the 1990 s needed to establish control, and self-control, over sub-national spending and borrowing.
