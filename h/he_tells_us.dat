5|$|Oddr Snorrason has an {{elaborate}} {{account of the}} problems arising from Thyri's marriages. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> that she was betrothed and married to the Wendish king Burislav, who received a large dowry for her; {{but she did not}} want to be his wife and starved herself after their wedding, so Burislav sent her back to Denmark. She then arranged to have herself married to Olaf Tryggvason, to the displeasure of her brother Svein. Svein's queen, Sigrid the Haughty, a staunch opponent of Olaf, egged Svein to make war on him. Svein then conspired with Jarl Sigvaldi and King Olaf of Sweden to lure Olaf Tryggvason into a trap. Olaf Tryggvason travelled to Wendland to collect Thyri's dowry from King Burislav and while there heard rumours of a planned ambush; but Sigvaldi arrived to tell him these rumours were false. Believing Sigvaldi, Olaf sent most of his fleet home, as his men were impatient. He therefore had only a small fleet left when he was ambushed near Svolder.|$|E
25|$|First {{asserting that}} his own {{experience}} of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that {{had it not been}} for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} when his third book was brought out he had retired {{for a short time}} to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness, as <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> of his {{unprofitable}} attendance to the bigwigs of Rome. For a time he seems to have felt the charm of the new scenes which he visited, and in a later book (iv. 25) he contemplates the prospect of retiring to the neighbourhood of Aquileia and the Timavus. But the spell exercised over him by Rome and Roman society was too great; even the epigrams sent from Forum Corneli and the Aemilian Way ring much more of the Roman forum, and of the streets, baths, porticos, brothels, market stalls, public houses, and clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated.|$|E

25|$|Mainly {{known for}} his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times {{architecture}} was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture. Frontinus mentions him {{in connection with the}} standard sizes of pipes. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of echeas placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> about, a basilica completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The Basilica di Fano (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various {{attempts have been made to}} visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman basilicae (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the basilica may be incorporated into the cathedral located in Fano.|$|E
25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (<b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us)</b> half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|E
500|$|Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{notes that}} by the end of the first episode Frank establishes that his metaphor of choice is meat because both literally and figuratively it is his preference. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I’m feelin’ hungry today!", but also he describes life with meat metaphors: he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak."; he plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time."; and he endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." [...] Poniewozik notes that all of this comes from a character whose name, Underwood is a reference to the hallmark deviled ham of the William Underwood Company.|$|E

500|$|Patchy the Pirate {{is stuck}} in traffic on US 101 near Encino and gets cross {{that he is going}} to miss the new SpongeBob episode, and his super rare eight track also breaks down. [...] His cell phone rings, and Potty tells him to hurry because the episode is about to start. [...] Patchy tells Potty to record the episode, but Potty tells him that he threw the Betamax machine in the trash, making him more mad. [...] The traffic lines moves, but suddenly, he finds himself nowhere, and finds out that [...] "Encino is gone", and then he cries that this is not the only time a Lost-City had occurred. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> that the episode is what we should watch instead of {{watching}} him suffer. Patchy gets his eight track fixed, but not for long when it explodes again and produces smoke.|$|E
500|$|Alfred, by [...] in {{full control}} of Wessex and {{at the height of}} his power, was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son, Edward, to the {{exclusion}} of his brother Æthelred's heirs. That kingship was never in Alfred's gift, but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward, the stronger he made that son's position in any future contest for the kingship. We must, therefore, treat anything <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution, if not scepticism. The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little. As king, Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns, who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property. It is significant that the case ever came before the witan at all. That it did, suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex.|$|E
500|$|Gerald {{tells us}} further that a Breton knight {{had come to}} the church for Mass and found a band of about twenty young men, all armed and {{equipped}} according to the local custom. He asked [...] "which was the abbot, and they pointed out to him a man with a long spear in his hand, who was walking in front of the others". He then {{tells the story of the}} murder of a bishop of Llanbadarn, murdered by the predecessors of the present generation of clergy. We cannot be sure how much of this was true. But Gerald disapproved of married clergy (which had been declining generally though only finally abolished by Rome in the eleventh century and deplored in principle the inheritance of church office. But all <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> of Llanbadarn is hearsay, apart from the name of the abbot. In any case, no move was made by Archbishop Baldwin in favour of reform: the Lord Rhys was with them, and they would not have wished to offend him. In any event, it would have been a matter for the Bishop of St David's, who was Peter de Leia. There is then no further information about Llanbadarn for nearly sixty years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{of these years}} is well conveyed in Octavian Blewitt's book A Panorama of Torquay, published in 1832. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> among other things, that those who wished to avoid the fatigue of the long coach journey from London, travelled to Portsmouth by coach and there took the Brunswick [...] "a steam vessel of considerable power" [...] directly to Torquay.|$|E

2500|$|Wood {{was sent}} to New College School in 1641, and {{at the age of}} twelve was removed to the free Lord Williams's School at Thame, where his studies were {{interrupted}} by Civil War skirmishes.

2500|$|The {{work was}} {{published}} in 1886, when its author was eighty-five years of age. For some little time previously he had been harassed by a suspicion that certain errors had crept into the computations, and accordingly he addressed himself {{to the task of}} revision. But his powers were no longer what they had been, and he was never able to examine sufficiently into the matter. In 1890 <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> how a grievous error had been committed in one of the first steps, and pathetically adds, [...] "My spirit in the work was broken, and I have never heartily proceeded with it since." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wentz noted Eiseley's {{belief that}} science {{may have become}} misguided in its goals: [...] "Loren Eiseley thought {{that much of the}} modern {{scientific}} enterprise had removed humanity ever farther from its sense of responsibility to the natural world it had left in order to create an artificial world to satisfy its own insatiable appetites." [...] Interpreting Eiseley's messages, he adds, [...] "It would be well, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> to heed the message of the Buddha, who knew that 'one cannot proceed upon the path of human transcendence until one has made interiorly in one’s soul a road into the future.'
