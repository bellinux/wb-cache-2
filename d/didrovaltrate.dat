40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>didrovaltrate</b> on L-type calcium current (Ica-L) in rabbit ventricular myocytes. MethodsWe used the whole cell patch clamp recording technique. ResultsDidrovaltrate at concentrations of 30 μg/L and 100 μg/L significantly decreased peak ICa-L (ICa-Lmax) from (6. 01 ± 0. 48) pA/pF to (3. 45 ± 0. 27) pA/pF and (2. 16 ± 0. 19) pA/pF (42. 6 % and 64. 1 %, n= 8, P< 0. 01), respectively. <b>Didrovaltrate</b> shifted upwards the current-voltage curves of ICa-L without changing their active, peak and reverse potentials. <b>Didrovaltrate</b> affected the steady-state inactivation of ICa-L. The half activation potential (V 1 / 2) was significantly shifted from (− 26 ± 2) to (− 36 ± 3) mV (n= 6, P< 0. 05), with {{a significant change in}} the slope factor (k) (from 8. 8 ± 0. 8 to 11. 1 ± 0. 9, n= 6, P< 0. 05). <b>Didrovaltrate</b> did not affect the activation curve. ConclusionDidrovaltrate blocks ICa-L in a concentration-dependent manner and probably inhibits ICa-L in its inactive state, which may contribute to its cardiovascular effect...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} some Iranian wild species of Valerianaceae with respect to their contents of valepotriates. Identification of these compounds which are known as reliable markers in Valerianaceae family was achieved using TLC and UV-spectrophotometry methods. Valepotriates makes substantial contribution to the sedative effect of valerian. Separation of these compounds was performed by TLC using a ternary mobile phase of toluene-ethyl acetate - methyl ethyl ketone (80 : 15 : 5 v/v) on silica gel HF 254 + 366 plates. Separated bands were observed in ultraviolet light at 254 nm. For bands revelation, 2, 4 - dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) solution spray was used at visible light. For the quantitative determination of valepotriates a standardized product (Valmane ®) was used to plot two calibration curves. One calibration curve was drawn in the concentration range of 5 - 156 mg L - 1 for determination of valtrate + acevaltrate amounts. The second one was linear in the range of 5 - 52 mg L - 1 for <b>didrovaltrate</b> quantification. The qualitative and quantitative determinations were carried out in all organs of Valeriana sisymbriifolia Vahl, Valeriana alliariifolia Adams and Centranthus longiflorus Stev. (Iranian wild plant species) and commercial Valeriana officinalis L. sample. Results showed that <b>didrovaltrate</b> amounts (dry weight basis) ranged from 0. 13 % in inflorescence of V. alliariifolia to 3. 51 % in leaf of C. longiflorus. Also acevaltrate + valtrate contents varied from minimum 0. 06 % in stem of V. sisymbriifolia to maximum 10. 85 % in root of V. alliariifolia. Valepotriates contents in these species were compared to those of commercial Valeriana officinalis L. root and rhizome samples (<b>didrovaltrate</b> 1. 99 - 3. 23 %, valtrate + acevaltrate 5. 1 - 9. 26 %) ...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method combined with {{diode array detection}} is described by which the valerian constituents valtrate, isovaltrate, acevaltrate, <b>didrovaltrate,</b> isovaleroxyhydroxydidrovaltrate, valerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and acetoxyvalerenic acid, {{as well as the}} valepotriate decomposition products baldrinal and homobaldrinal, can be separated and identified simultaneously. Using this procedure, roots of Valeriana officinalis, which are used for the production of phytomedicines, were analysed. The influence of different ethanol:water mixtures, used as extraction liquid, on the composition of extracts of V. officinalis is reported. The analytical procedure was also applied to a number of valerian-containing phytomedicines available on the Dutch market. In order to study the stability of the valepotriates and the formation of their decomposition product(s), samples of freshly prepared valerian tinctures were analysed after being stored at 4, 20, and 36 degrees C for up to one month...|$|E
40|$|Underground {{parts of}} three Valeriana species, namely V. officinalis L. s. l., V. wallichii DC. (V. {{jatamansi}} Jones), and V. edulis Nutt. ex Torr & Gray ssp. procera (H. B. K.) F. G. Meyer (V. mexicana DC.), {{are used in}} phytotherapy because of their mild sedative properties. Characteristic constituents of these species, which are regarded also as the active principles, were tested for cytotoxicity against GLC(4), a human small-cell lung cancer cell line, and against COLO 320, a human colorectal cancer cell line, using the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Valepotriates of the diene type (valtrate, isovaltrate and acevaltrate) displayed the highest cytotoxicity, with IC 50 values of 1 - 6 mu M, following continuous incubation. The monoene type valepotriates (<b>didrovaltrate</b> and isovaleroxyhydroxydidrovaltrate) were 2 - to 3 -fold less toxic. Baldrinal and homobaldrinal, decomposition products of valepotriates, were 10 - to 30 -fold less toxic than their parent compounds. Isovaltral had a higher cytotoxicity than its parent compound isovaltrate. Valerenic acids (valerenic acid, acetoxyvalerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and methyl valerenate), which are characteristic for V. officinalis, had a low toxicity with IC 50 values between 100 and 200 mu M. Freshly prepared and stored tinctures, prepared from roots and rhizomes of the three valerian species, were analysed for valepotriates, baldrinals and valerenic acids, and also tested for cytotoxicity. There was a clear relationship between the valepotriate contents of the freshly prepared tinctures and their toxicity. Upon storage, valepotriates decomposed, which was reflected in a significant reduction of the cytotoxic effect...|$|E
