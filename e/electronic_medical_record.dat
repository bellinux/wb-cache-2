40|$|Abstract Background Handheld <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> are {{expected}} to improve physician performance and patient care. To confirm this, we performed a systematic review of the evidence assessing the effects of handheld <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> on clinical care. Methods To conduct the systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library from 1966 through September 2005. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated effects on practitioner performance or patient outcomes of handheld <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> compared to either paper <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> or desktop <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> Two reviewers independently reviewed citations, assessed full text articles and abstracted data from the studies. Results Two studies met our inclusion criteria. No other randomized controlled studies or non-randomized controlled trials were found that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were methodologically strong. The studies examined changes in documentation in orthopedic patients with handheld <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> compared to paper charts, and both found an increase in documentation. Other effects noted with handheld <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> were an increase in time to document {{and an increase in}} wrong or redundant diagnoses. Conclusion Handheld <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> may improve documentation, but as yet, the number of studies is small and the data is restricted to one group of patients and a small group of practitioners. Further study is required to determine the benefits with handheld <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> especially in assessing clinical outcomes. </p...|$|R

500|$|In healthcare, Watson's natural language, {{hypothesis}} generation, and evidence-based learning {{capabilities are}} being investigated {{to see how}} Watson may contribute to clinical decision support systems for use by medical professionals. To aid physicians {{in the treatment of}} their patients, once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors, Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information; then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patient's medical and hereditary history; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses; and finally provides a list of individualized, confidence-scored recommendations. The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines, <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>record</b> data, notes from physicians and nurses, research materials, clinical studies, journal articles, and patient information. Despite being developed and marketed as a [...] "diagnosis and treatment advisor", Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process, only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a surge of {{interest}} in using <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> in hospitals and clinics to capture information about patients that is normally buried in doctors handwritten notes. Indeed, the U. S. government has made the implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> a priority area and has instigated standards for the recording and use of these records. The clinical data captured in <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> including diagnoses, <b>medical</b> tests, and medications provide accurate clinical information that will improve patient care. With the ability to sequence the genomes of individuals faster and cheaper than ever before, {{it may be possible}} in the future to include the genome sequences of patients in their <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records.</b> A consortium called the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> and Genomics Network (eMERGE) has set out to investigate whether clinical data captured in <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> could be used to accurately identify patients with particular diseases for inclusion in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS scrutinize the genomes of individuals with particular diseases to identify tiny genetic variations that are associated with the risk of developing that disease. Here, the eMERGE consortium reports its study of the <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> from five clinical centers and how accurately it identified patients with one of five diseases: dementia, cataracts, peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes, and cardiac conduction defects. The investigators show that even though the <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> were of different types and did not all use natural language processing to extract information from the records, they were able to obtain robust positive and negative values for identifying patients with these diseases with sufficient accuracy for use in GWAS. They conclude that widespread adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> will provide real-world clinical data that will be valuable for GWAS and other types of genetic research.

2500|$|In 2002, Kaiser Permanente {{abandoned}} {{its attempt to}} build its own clinical information system with IBM, writing-off some $452 million in software assets. This information technology failure led to {{major changes in the}} organization's approach to digital records. Under George Halvorson's direction, Kaiser looked closely at two medical software vendors, Cerner and Epic Systems, ultimately selecting Epic as the primary vendor for a new system, branded KP HealthConnect. Although Kaiser's approach shifted to [...] "buy, not build," [...] the project was unprecedented for a civilian system in size and scope.

2500|$|The Electronic {{health record}} (EHR), {{previously}} {{known as the}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>record</b> (EMR), reduces several types of errors, including those related to prescription drugs, to emergency and preventive care, and to tests and procedures. [...] Important features of modern EHR include automated drug-drug/drug-food interaction checks and allergy checks, standard drug dosages and patient education information. [...] Drug Information at the point-of-care and drug dispensing points help in reducing errors. Example: India, MedCLIK. Also, these systems provide recurring alerts to remind clinicians of intervals for preventive care and to track referrals and test results. Clinical guidelines for disease management have a demonstrated benefit when accessible within the electronic record {{during the process of}} treating the patient. [...] Advances in health informatics and widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records promise access to a patient's records at any health care site. Still, there may be a weak link because of physicians' deficiencies in understanding the patient safety features of e.g. government approved software. Errors associated with patient misidentification may be exacerbated by EHR use, but inclusion of a prominently displayed patient photograph in the EHR can reduce errors and near misses.|$|E

Each prescription is dated and some jurisdictions may place a time limit on the prescription. In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the pharmaceutical product but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.|$|E

50|$|The {{usage of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> can vary {{depending}} on who the user is {{and how they are}} using it. <b>Electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> can help improve the quality of medical care given to patients. Many doctors and office-based physicians refuse {{to get rid of the}} traditional paper records. Harvard University has conducted an experiment in which they tested how doctors and nurses use <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> to keep their patients' information up to date. The studies found that <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> were very useful; a doctor or a nurse was able to find a patient's information fast and easy just by typing their name; even if it was misspelled. The usage of <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> increases in some work places due to the ease of use of the system; whereas the president of the Canadian Family Practice Nurses Association says that using <b>electronic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> can be time consuming, and it isn't very helpful due to the complexity of the system. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center reported that doctors and nurses prefer to use a much more friendly user software due to the difficulty and time it takes for a medical staff to input the information as well as to find a patients information. A study was done and the amount of information that was recorded in the EMRs was recorded; about 44% of the patients information was recorded in the EMRs. This shows that EMRs are not very efficient most of the time.|$|R
