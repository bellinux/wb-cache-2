The latter estriction permits atransformation f the governing equations toa single universal form, which is solved {{with the help of}} boundary integral theory. As in the constant force case, the numerical results show the formation of a dimple but the final drainage behaviour differs considerably. Finally, the influence of van der Waals forces is investigated and the results are shown to correspond well with a simple model proposed earlier for the effective critical film-rupture thickness...|$|R

A total of 2, 092 chaplains from 23 countriesresponded to the survey. Over 80 % thought research was definitelyimportant and nearly 70 % thought chaplains should definitely beresearch literate. Just over 40 % said they regularly read researcharticles and almost 60 % said they occasionally did. Therespondents rated their own research literacy as 6. 5 on a 0 – 10 scale.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} theresults of hypospadias surgery. Methods: In this study the results of 87 patients who underwenthypospadias repair surgery between 2005 and 2010 were evaluated retrospectly. Results: 21 patients; Meatal Advancement and Glanuloplasty(MAGPI), 33 patients; Tubularized Incised PlateUrethroplasty (TIPU), 21 patients; Parameatal Based Flap(Mathieu), 6 patients; Mathieu and Incision Sutured (MAVIS) and the other 6 patients were operated via TransversTubularized Preputial Island Flap (TTPIF). To prevent fistulaformation double layer dartos flap (DLDF) was appliedto all patients to whom MAVIS had <b>been</b> applied <b>andto</b> 27 of the patients to whom TIPU had been applied, andtunica vaginalis flap over neourethra was placed to thepatients to whom TTPIF was applied. While fistula wasnot seen in the patients to whom flap <b>was</b> used, <b>it</b> wasseen that the urethrocutaneous fistula ratio was high inthe patients without flap uses. Conclusion: TIPU is a kind of method which can beeasily applied and preferred regardless of localizationof urethral meatus. A barrier layer placed between skinand neourethra to prevent fistula formation significantlydecreases the fistula ratio. Preputial dartos flap is a goodpreference, But tunica vaginalis must be kept in mind asan alternative to this flap in the patients who underwenturethroplasty with preputial dartos flap or who had circumflexbefore. TTPIF can be used as an alternative methodto TIPU method in patients with more proximal localizedhypospadias, especially if the urethral plate was exicedbecause of chordee and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> successful when combinedwith tunica vaginalis flap.

40|$|Clever Hans, {{the famous}} horse who was {{believed}} to be able to count, is generally cited as the paradigm of the influence of the observer. Psychologist Rosenthal has illustrated this phenomenon with his well-known experiment about ‘bright’ and ‘dull’ maze rats. Hans, however, achieved something much more interesting. Hecould not only read human minds through their bodies: he could also influence his questioners to produce gestures he could read as cues for finding the answer. Hans could make human bodies be moved and be affected, and move and affect other beings and perform things without their owners’ knowledge. The question of ‘influence’ when we read this case becomes therefore far more complicated and interesting. It involves the question of the way bodies can attune, affect and transformeach other. We may follow carefully how scientists of ethological practices create access to the creatures they study, how they are moved by their subjects of interest, and how they {{give them a chance to}} <b>be</b> interesting <b>andto</b> articulate other responses. Doing so, we notice that the signs that define subject and object, what talks and what is talked about, subjectivity and objectivity, are redistributed in a new manner. These practices offer a new and pragmatic definition of the body, close to James’s theory of emotions: to have a body is to learn how to feel. Peer reviewe...|$|R

ETR and A showed strong correlation, and were able todiscriminate significantly two groups of inbred lines: a) inbred line G 1; and, b) inbredlines G 2 and G 3. The higher photosynthetic capacity of inbred line G 1 was explained byits greater carboxylation efficiency. Similar response was observed for total aerialphytomass and grain production. The results showed the nitrogen as being an importantfactor to maize yield, which can be monitored by chlorophyll content and photochemistryparameters of photosynthesis.

The main imaging findings were the presence and locationof abdominal distention, the herniated intestinal loop segment, thepresence of mesenteric vessel rotation and haziness of mesentericfat, {{the position of the}} Treitz angle ligament and the course of theileum. Results: In all cases, abdominal distention was located inthe upper abdomen; the herniated jejunal loop was located abovethe gastric level; mesenteric vessel rotation was associated withmesenteric fat haziness; the middle/distal ileum descended from theleft hypochondrium; and the Treiz angle <b>was</b> displaced anteriorly <b>andto</b> the right.
