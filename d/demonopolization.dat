40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>demonopolization</b> process of granted monopolies. A <b>demonopolization</b> process may have {{different}} origins such as changes in the policy of a government or a regulator, or new invention or innovation competing with existing patented ones. The <b>demonopolization</b> of the market represents a threat for the granted monopolist and is a relevant source of risk. In the existing real options literature, the market structure {{is assumed to be}} steady state, not allowed to change. In the current paper, this assumption is relaxed. Here a monopolistic firm faces the threat of <b>demonopolization,</b> that changes the market structure to a duopoly market. This threat is treated as a random source of uncertainty and represents an additional risk both for a granted monopolistic operating firm, and for a company having a granted monopolistic option to invest...|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} reform fosters approaching of State and cooperative proparty, {{but does not}} effect elimination of essential differences between them. On the other hand, State and cooperative forms alternate in a higher degree in several domains. Simultaneously, the reform causes higher alternation of cooperative and private forms. Those circumstances must be accounted for in order {{to solve a problem}} of <b>demonopolization</b> of certain spheres of production and market, including agricultural market. Transformation from a one-subject to multi-subject organizational structure on that market can aid <b>demonopolization</b> processes but is not able to perform their role. The following are the main directions of structural and organizational transformations on the agricultural market: creating new cooperative or mixed State- -cooperative units, sometimes private units having retained the legal monopoly of the socialist state to purchase basic agricultural products. At the same time it seems indispensable to improve organization and functioning of rural cooperatives. Transformations of property and organizational structure on agricultural market ought to be gradually carried out as favourable economic conditions develop, especially when a buyer market is formed.

40|$|Interconnection, equal access, unbundling, and {{industry}} structure are four key determinants of facilities-based competition in telecommunications. Using these building blocks, this paper analyzes {{the differences in}} telecommunications regulatory regimes in Australia, Chile, Guatemala, and New Zealand, assessing the effect on competition and consumer welfare. Some regulation is necessary as incumbents can prolong their market power after <b>demonopolization</b> by exploiting positive externalities inherent to telecommunications networks. The authors emphasize the superiority of market mechanisms over traditional regulatory processes to achieve efficient transactions among operators. Such market mechanisms need clear rules and credible enforcement. ...|$|E

Our empirical test reveals that natural monopoly properties did not exist in PLDT's provision of toll and local telephone services. At least two firms could have provided the same level of services without increasing total cost. Our results therefore provide evidence in support of the <b>demonopolization</b> of the industry. ...|$|E

This problem is particularly prevalent in transition economies but is also pervasive in market economies. Following Dewatripont and Maskin [1995], the paper looks at soft budget constraints as dynamic commitment problems {{in the presence of}} sunk costs. Various ways to harden budget constraints are analyzed: privatization, <b>demonopolization,</b> decentralization of government, decentralization of credit, and banking reform. Finally, the paper looks at the role of budget constraints on risk taking and innovation. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple two-sector {{model of a}} socialist economy, in which government revenues required for servicing external debt are obtained from taxation of the socialized sector and from import taxes. Wages and employment in the socialized sector are the outcome of Nash bargaining {{between the government and}} an import-competing labor-dominated state enterprise with domestic market power. The effects of trade liberalization, <b>demonopolization,</b> technical improvements, and limitations on labor’s bargaining power are examined, and the implications for privatization are considered. It is shown that some combination of tax reform and debt reduction may be a precondition for market-oriented reforms. ...|$|E

Extremely pressing economic, social, and political problems are intertwined. In the economic area proper, the transition to the market requires untangling a tight knot of problems: the liberation [deregulation] of prices, the financial rehabilitation of the economy, <b>demonopolization</b> and the formation of a market infrastructure, the strengthening of the ruble {{to the point where it}} is convertible, and the creation of a tax system appropriate to the market. The social and political aspects of the reform have taken on enormous significance. After all, they determine the general background of and the potential limits to the radicalization of the economic reforms. ...|$|E

The issues involved and the process of reform in developing countries with a strong tradition of state capitalism and state monopolies in the name of socialism, are different.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} value and optimal timing for {{investment}} in finite-lived monopolies, extending the literature on real option games by considering the cases of random and certain-lived monopolies. Under these settings, firms face the risk of <b>demonopolization,</b> that can occur as a random or a certain event. We show that these new settings produce significantly different results {{when compared to the}} canonical monopolistic and duopolistic models. In a certain-lived monopoly, the leader invests sooner than in a duopoly if there is a risk of being preempted, and later than in a monopoly if the leader role is pre-assigned. In a random-lived monopoly, entry occurs somewhere between the duopoly and monopoly cases. Higher uncertainty delays investment in all cases.

40|$|This paper uses {{representative}} {{firm level}} panel data of 1, 701 Bulgarian and 2, 047 Romanian manufacturing firms to estimate price-cost margins and to analyze how these {{are affected by}} privatization and increased competitive pressure. The estimation method used, {{which is based on}} Roeger (1995), deals with potential endogeneity problems that are associated with estimating firm performance, by making use of the properties of the primal and dual Solow residual. We find that privatization is associated with higher price-cost margins in both Bulgaria and Romania. Moreover, foreign owned firms have higher markups than domestic privatized firms. Our results suggest that the sequencing of reforms, such as <b>demonopolization</b> prior to privatization and the establishment of competition policy, may be important. In addition, our results give support to the idea that opening to trade has a disciplining effect on firms ’ market power. We find that increased import penetration is associated with lower price-cost margin...|$|E

40|$|For {{nearly two}} centuries, an {{inventor}} {{applying for a}} U. S. patent has been required to obtain the opinion of an expert who has searched the prior art and determined that the inventor’s application meets the standards of patentability. And for nearly two centuries, those expert opinions could be obtained only from a single office run by the U. S. government. The patenting monopoly, which is almost certainly undesirable, is now being eroded. Rising global trade and technological sophistication have {{increased the number of}} patent filings in every country; government patent offices here and abroad are thus being driven to rely on patenting opinions from other public and private entities. For <b>demonopolization</b> to be effective, however, entities determining patentability must have high-powered incentives to make accurate judgments. Two disciplining mechanisms may be particularly useful: (1) randomly selecting private patenting opinions for an intensive governmental evaluation, with fines imposed on any examining firm if its opinion is found to have led to the issuance of an invalid patent, and (2) authorizing legal challenges to patents by private attorneys general. This article offers preliminary assessments of the optimal design of these and other disciplining mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from an economy organized {{according to plan}} {{to a market economy}} must be viewed as a most complex, prolonged, and essentially contradictory socioeconomic process demanding qualitative changes in the productive forces and production relations and the formation of new forms of property that call a new structure of economic and management agents to life. There is a need here for a fundamentally new infrastructure, new cadres, and new systems of prices, finances, credit, and distribution relations. This structure cannot be called a market structure; it is mixed in many parameters and criteria. The mechanism for managing such a structure and its functioning cannot be an exclusively market mechanism or an exclusively plan-oriented mechanism. In order for market and nonmarket mechanisms, including plan-oriented mechanisms and regulators, to "work," it is necessary to know how to forecast the development of forms of property, their structures, and the bases of an incipient mixed economy. It is necessary to know how to foresee the course of development of such processes as privatization, destatization, <b>demonopolization,</b> the formation of new forms of management, the modernization of production technology, the supplying of production with financial, material, and labor resources, etc. ...|$|E
