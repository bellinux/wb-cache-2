25|$|A neuroscientific {{explanation}} {{claims that}} intruder hallucinations arise {{due to a}} functional disturbance in the multisensory processing of body and self at the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). During sleep paralysis there is a desynchrony between motor-execution and feedback from limbs (proprioception) which results in massive <b>deafferentation</b> (conflicting efferent and afferent neural conduction).|$|E
25|$|Nociceptor neuron {{sensitivity}} is modulated {{by a large}} {{variety of}} mediators in the extracellular space. Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This {{is commonly known as}} hyperalgesia. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in allodynia: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in <b>deafferentation,</b> which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.|$|E
40|$|Background: Vestibular reflexes, {{evoked by}} human {{electrical}} (galvanic) vestibular stimulation (EVS), are utilized to assess vestibular function and investigate its pathways. Our study aimed {{to investigate the}} electrically-evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (eVOR) output after bilateral and unilateral vestibular <b>deafferentations</b> to determine the characteristics for interpreting unilateral lesions such as vestibular schwannomas. Methods: EVOR was recorded with dual-search coils as binocular three-dimensional eye movements evoked by bipolar 100 ms-step at EVS intensities of [0. 9, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0]mA and unipolar 100 ms-step at 5 mA EVS intensity.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} changes in the topographic representations of the special senses in cerebral cortex following partial peripheral <b>deafferentations.</b> This approach has demonstrated the short- medium- and long-term aspects of plasticity. However, the extensive capacity for immediate plasticity, while first demonstrated more than 15 years ago, still challenges explanation. What such studies indicate is that each locus in sensory cortex receives viable input from a far wider area of the sensory epithelium than is represented in the normal receptive field, with the implication that much of this input is normally inhibited. Consideration of the geometric and temporal aspects of receptive field plasticity suggests that this inhibition must be tonic and must derive its driving input from a tonically active periphery...|$|R
40|$|Menière disease usually {{begins in}} adults from 20 to 60 years old, and occurs {{in more than}} 10 % of {{patients}} older than 65. The treatment of Menière disease in the elderly represents a challenge because of polymedication. Antivertiginous drugs such as betahistine and cinnarizin give good results with minor secondary effects. In contrast, major vestibular suppressor drugs such as thiethylperazin must be avoided as long-term treatment because of their side effects. Definitive vestibular surgical <b>deafferentations</b> such as labyrinthectomy and selective vestibular neurectomy represent optional procedures but must be carefully evaluated from case to case. Ablative procedures remain the efficient treatment of drop attacks, which represent a high potential risk of severe injuries by older patients sometimes with important social consequences...|$|R
500|$|A neurolytic {{block is}} the {{deliberate}} injury of a nerve by {{the application of}} chemicals (in which case the procedure is called [...] "neurolysis") or physical agents such as freezing or heating ("neurotomy"). These interventions cause degeneration of the nerve's fibers and temporary interference with the transmission of pain signals. In these procedures, the thin protective layer around the nerve fiber, the basal lamina, is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber regrows, it travels within its basal lamina tube and connects with the correct loose end, and function may be restored. Surgically cutting a nerve severs these basal lamina tubes, and without them to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, a painful neuroma or <b>deafferentation</b> pain may develop. This is why the neurolytic is preferred over the surgical block.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{may take}} place at the central level after peripheral nerve damage. The loss of afferent signals induces functional changes in dorsal horn neurons. A decrease in the large fiber input decreases the activity of interneurons inhibiting nociceptive neurons i.e. loss of afferent inhibition. Hypoactivity of the descending antinociceptive systems or loss of descending inhibition may be another factor. With the loss of neuronal input (<b>deafferentation)</b> the STT neurons begin to fire spontaneously, a phenomenon designated [...] "deafferentation hypersensitivity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Out-of-body {{experiences}} (OBEs) {{have become}} {{to some extent}} conflated {{in the public mind}} with the concept of the near-death experience. [...] However, the evidence suggests that the majority of out-of-body experiences do not occur near death, but in conditions of either very high or very low arousal. McCreery [...] has suggested that this latter paradox may be explained by reference to the fact that sleep may be approached, not only by the conventional route of low arousal and <b>deafferentation,</b> but also by the less familiar route of extreme stress and hyper-arousal. On this model OBEs represent the intrusion of Stage 1 sleep processes into waking consciousness.|$|E
40|$|Somatotopic maps in {{the cortex}} and the {{thalamus}} of adult monkeys and humans reorganize {{in response to}} altered inputs. After loss of the sensory afferents from the forelimb in monkeys because of transection of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, therapeutic amputation of an arm or transection of the dorsal roots of the peripheral nerves, the deprived portions of the hand and arm representations in primary somatosensory cortex (area 3 b), become responsive to inputs from the face and any remaining afferents from the arm. Cortical and subcortical mechanisms that underlie this reorganization are uncertain and appear to be manifold. Here we show that the face afferents from the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem sprout and grow into the cuneate nucleus in adult monkeys after lesions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord or therapeutic amputation of an arm. This growth may underlie the large-scale expansion of the face representation into the hand region of somatosensory cortex that follows such <b>deafferentations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vestibular {{compensation}} for the postural and oculomotor deficits following unilateral labyrinthectomy {{is a model of}} functional plasticity in the brain of adult vertebrates. The mechanisms involved in this recovery are still controversial. The post-lesional lack of vestibular input might be compensated by changes in the efficacy of the remaining sensory inputs involved in gaze and posture stabilization. However, the compensation process could also rapidly become independent of these external cues, and thus be detectable in vitro in preparations obtained from lesioned animals. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have shown recently that prominent traces of the compensation process appeared three days after the lesion on in vitro isolated brains taken from labyrinthectomized guinea-pigs, where the connectivity of the central vestibular-related networks is preserved. We report here that, one week after the lesion, a slight increase in the intrinsic, spontaneous activity of the deafferented, central vestibular neurons was found in brainstem slices. This increase became stronger in slices taken after one month of compensation, and was associated at this stage with a significant decrease in the intrinsic activity of the vestibular neurons on the contralesional side. Vestibular compensation could thus follow a "top-down" strategy: it would first rely on the external cues given by the intact sensory systems, then on an internal reorganization of the vestibular-related networks, and finally on changes in the intrinsic properties of the vestibular neurons themselves. Similar strategies may be used by the mammalian brain to compensate for other types of <b>deafferentations</b> or environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vestibular reflexes, {{evoked by}} human {{electrical}} (galvanic) vestibular stimulation (EVS), are utilized to assess vestibular function and investigate its pathways. Our study aimed {{to investigate the}} electrically-evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (eVOR) output after bilateral and unilateral vestibular <b>deafferentations</b> to determine the characteristics for interpreting unilateral lesions such as vestibular schwannomas. METHODS: EVOR was recorded with dual-search coils as binocular three-dimensional eye movements evoked by bipolar 100 ms-step at EVS intensities of [0. 9, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0] mA and unipolar 100 ms-step at 5 mA EVS intensity. Five bilateral vestibular deafferented (BVD), 12 unilateral vestibular deafferented (UVD), four unilateral vestibular schwannoma (UVS) patients and 17 healthy subjects were tested with bipolar EVS, and five UVDs with unipolar EVS. RESULTS: After BVD, bipolar EVS elicited no eVOR. After UVD, bipolar EVS of one functioning ear elicited bidirectional, excitatory eVOR to cathodal EVS with 9 ms latency and inhibitory eVOR to anodal EVS, opposite in direction, at half the amplitude with 12 ms latency, exhibiting an excitatory-inhibitory asymmetry. The eVOR patterns from UVS were consistent with responses from UVD confirming the vestibular loss on the lesion side. Unexpectedly, unipolar EVS of the UVD ear, instead of absent response, evoked one-third the bipolar eVOR while unipolar EVS of the functioning ear evoked half the bipolar response. CONCLUSIONS: The bidirectional eVOR evoked by bipolar EVS from UVD with an excitatory-inhibitory asymmetry and the 3 ms latency difference between normal and lesion side may be useful for detecting vestibular lesions such as UVS. We suggest that current spread {{could account for the}} small eVOR to 5 mA unipolar EVS of the UVD ear...|$|R
2500|$|One theory {{states that}} the mirror neuron system is {{important}} in giving rise to the intruder hallucination and out-of-body experiences during sleep paralysis. [...] The mirror neuron system {{is believed to be}} modulated by sensory afferents and the prefrontal cortex, and interact with the right superior parietal lobule. These circuits may in turn allow for a theory of mind—seeing the world from another person's perspective. A functional disturbance of these circuits would interfere with the feeling of being anchored in one's body. According to this theory, sleep paralysis leads to disinhibition of the mirror neuron system, paving the way for hallucinations of human-like shadowy beings. The <b>deafferentation</b> of sensory information during sleep paralysis is proposed as the mechanism for such mirror neuron disinhibition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most direct}} of related disorders, <b>deafferentation</b> occurs when sensory {{input from the}} body is reduced or absent, without {{affecting}} efferent, or motor, neurons. The most famous case of this disorder is [...] "IW", who lost all sensory input from below the neck, resulting in temporary paralysis. He was forced to learn to control his movement all over again using only his conscious body image and visual feedback. As a result, when constant visual input is lost during an activity, such as walking, it becomes {{impossible for him to}} complete the task, which may result in falling, or simply stopping. IW requires constant attention to tasks to be able to complete them accurately, demonstrating how automatic and subconscious the process of integrating touch and proprioception into the body schema actually is.|$|E
50|$|Palinopsia {{can occur}} from {{posterior}} visual pathway (post-geniculate) <b>deafferentation,</b> which causes homonymous visual field deficits. This mechanism {{is thought to}} be similar to the <b>deafferentation</b> hyperexcitability seen in visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome), which are distinguished from palinopsia by whether the formed image or scene previously occurred. It is hypothesized that <b>deafferentation</b> hyperexcitability is the cause of neuropathic pain. Molecular changes from <b>deafferentation</b> include an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles and heightened post-synaptic receptor sensitivity.|$|E
40|$|Central and {{intraperitoneal}} C 75, an inhibitor of {{fatty acid}} synthase and stimulator of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase- 1, inhibits eating in mice and rats. Mechanisms involved in feeding inhibition after central C 75 have been identified, but little is yet known about how systemic C 75 might inhibit eating. One {{issue is whether}} intraperitoneal C 75 reduces food intake in rats by influencing normal physiological controls of food intake or acts nonselectively, for example by eliciting illness or aversion. Another issue relates to whether intraperitoneal C 75 acts centrally or, similar to some other peripheral metabolic controls of eating, activates abdominal vagal afferents to inhibit eating. To further address these questions, we investigated the effects of intraperitoneal C 75 on spontaneous meal patterns {{and the formation of}} conditioned taste aversion (CTA). We also tested whether the eating inhibitory effect of intraperitoneal C 75 is vagally mediated by testing rats after either total subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (TVX) or selective subdiaphragmatic vagal <b>deafferentations</b> (SDA). Intraperitoneal injection of 3. 2 and 7. 5 mg/kg of C 75 significantly reduced food intake 3, 12, and 24 h after injection by reducing the number of meals without affecting meal size, whereas 15 mg/kg of C 75 reduced both meal number and meal size. The two smaller doses of C 75 failed to induce a CTA, but 15 mg/kg C 75 did. The eating inhibitory effect of C 75 was not diminished in either TVX or SDA rats. We conclude that intraperitoneal injections of low doses of C 75 inhibit eating in a behaviorally specific manner and that this effect does not require abdominal vagal afferents...|$|R

50|$|Dendrodendritic synapses {{can play}} a role in neuroplasticity. In a {{simulated}} disease state where axons were destroyed, some neurons formed dendrodendritic synapses to compensate. In experiments where <b>deafferentation</b> or axotomy was performed in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cats it was found that pre-synaptic dendrites began to form to compensate for the lost axons. These pre-synaptic dendrties were revealed to form new dendrodenritic excitatory synapses in the cells that had survived. The development of presynaptic dendrites forming dendrodendritic synapses in the Cerebellar Cortex of mice has also been found following the differentiation of that region. This type of dendritic reactive synaptogenesis is thought to occur in order to re-saturate the region which has become vacant postsynaptic sites following neurodegeneration caused by <b>deafferentation</b> or axotomy in order to restore partial functionality to the affected region. Partial recorvery within the LGN has been shown thus supporting the validity of dendrodendritic synapses between neighboring relay neurons functionality.|$|E

50|$|An {{afferent nerve}} is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses {{from the skin}} and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. <b>Deafferentation</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure in which the spinal cord is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain. A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or {{even be able to}} sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off. Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at New York University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as pure research, he conducted several kinds of <b>deafferentation</b> experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth.
