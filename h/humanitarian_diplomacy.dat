In order to provide an empirically backed response to such research questions, this paper initially studies What Turkey did with <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> What were Turkey’s objectives in utilizing it?

Humanitarian aid is also subject to geopolitics and the politics of parties that instrumentalize aid to advance their interests. In addition, there are organizational politics that rule the hierarchies and power games within organizations and make organizations devise strategies in order to gain or retain their competitive advantage vis-à-vis other players.|$|R

40|$|Mitigation {{of human}} {{suffering}} in Afghanistan has been a mammoth task and remains a cause of concern. The currently ongoing phase which started in 2001 has been characterized with disregard of IHL, grave human suffering, given {{the increased use of}} more injurious means and methods of warfare by warring parties. In response, the ICRC has been engaging its <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> to ensure development of IHL and parties compliance it, all for the alleviation and prevention {{of human suffering}}. Based on the hypothesis that, the ICRC <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in the armed conflict in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014 has made positive impact in respect to mitigation of human suffering. The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of the ICRC <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in ensuring the alleviation of human suffering in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. In that context following were the specific objectives of the study were; to discuss the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> of the ICRC as a key concept in the mitigating human suffering in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014 as in other armed conflict situations; to discuss asymmetric warfare as a concept and itâ€Ÿs bearing on the mitigation of human suffering in light of the armed conflict in Afghanistan form 2001 to 2014 and to suggest recommendations for the improvement of the effectiveness of the ICRC <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in mitigating human suffering in Afghanistan. The study used qualitative research methodology. Data was collected using documentary and key informant, in-depth interviews. In this respect, content and thematic analyses were used in the presentation and analysis of findings. The findings of the study have established that; the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> of the ICRC in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, has been delivering concrete results in ensuring the alleviation and prevention of human suffering. It resulted to more consideration by warring parties and other relevant stakeholders of the need to mitigate human suffering in Afghanistan, reduction of civilian deaths and casualties, securing of humanitarian access and space by the ICRC to mention but a few. However, the ICRC <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in Afghanistan continue to face challenges due to, the realistic nature of warring parties who pursue their self-interests at the expense of mitigation of human suffering, the overemphasis of confidential dialogue by the ICRC where public discussions will be feasible and above all, the discrepancy between the existing body of IHL and the asymmetric internationalized-NIAC in Afghanistan. Against this bedrock, the study surmised that though the ICRC <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in Afghanistan may not have been effective in all situations and continues to face challenges, it has made great impact and remains necessary rather than optional. To this end, the study recommended that; for continued relevance of IHL, relevant actors (state and non-state) need to acknowledge the limitations of existing body of IHL and to address them rather than avoiding them, warring parties in Afghanistan should desist from pursuing self-interest in disregard of the human suffering that result from their actions and that, the ICRC should be avoid overemphasising confidential dialogue were public discussions will be feasible...|$|E
30|$|There {{have been}} {{previous}} studies (Castles, 2000; Teitelbaum, 1984; Zolberg, 1989 and Zolberg, Suhrke, Aguayo, 1986) that foregrounded Western states’ – particularly the United States’ – involvement with immigration and refugees {{as a foreign}} policy tool. However, their works did not use discursive theoretical tools and approached study of immigration within the realist framework. While this framework informs this study, I will elaborate on Turkish engagement with the Syrian refugees as a particular reflection of the new <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> narrative of Turkish foreign policy.|$|E

30|$|The Syrian crisis {{gained a}} new and more complex {{character}} following the incursions of IS, culminating in summer 2014, targeting non-Sunnite and particularly the ancient Christian and Yazidi populations in the region. Hence, starting with summer 2014, Turkey has faced a more complex mass movement of people toward its borders, who are not necessarily of an ethnic and religious character that the AKP establishment has so far felt itself at ease with. Although in some instances these people can have access to camps, media reports from the region show they feel themselves more secure in the hands of mostly Kurdish-led HDP (Peoples’ Democracy Party) local governments in south-eastern Turkey as well as their communities. Thereby, the handling of non-Sunnite, non-Arab and non-Syrian refugees has become a litmus test for Turkish refugee regime and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> In order to understand the implications of selective humanitarianism, I will now examine the treatment that different refugees have experienced in Turkey.|$|E

30|$|What is {{particularly}} {{crucial for the}} Turkish government’s position toward the Syrian refugees {{is the lack of}} integration policies and programmes. As the interviews at three different levels of Turkish public administration have shown, the officials follow a particular discursive framework appealing to the collective memory of the Turkish state and society as a charitable polity and a traditionally generous society. This particular discursive construction seeks to culminate in public support for the government’s position vis-à-vis the Syrian refugees, but falls short of institutionalizing comprehensive humanitarianism and integration policies to respond to the needs of refugees. While this discursive framework conceives certain sections of refugees as guests and temporary, it maintains the rejection of non-Arab, non-Muslim, non-Sunnite refugees. Turkish <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> toward Syrian refugees suggests that the only victims in the Syrian conflict are the Arab/Muslim/Sunnite populations that suffer from Assad’s despotism. Hence, their suffering necessitates that Turkey temporally hosts and assists them. Overall, this article has debated the Syrian refugee crisis as a case study to assess how far Turkey’s immigration policy can maintain pragmatic solutions but avoid drastic changes in policy and public philosophy dealing with foreigners.|$|E
40|$|The ‘responsibility to protect’ (R 2 P) {{places the}} ‘international community’ under an {{obligation}} to take coercive action {{for the protection of}} lives in the circumstances of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Following the dismal response to the May 2008 cyclone disaster in Myanmar where many affected people were provided with almost no relief assistance by the country's military regime that also hampered external assistance, the idea of military humanitarian intervention under the rubric of R 2 P was proposed by Bernard Kouchner. However, considering the urgency of the provision of relief assistance in an emergency, which is often a matter of life or death, this paper questions the effectiveness of invoking R 2 P as a possible response strategy in the aftermath of natural disasters. Therefore, in relation to state sovereignty the paper focuses on the concept of ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ at macro and micro levels as an alternative strategy and having analysed the issue in the wider framework of humanitarianism, the paper concludes with the importance of exploring the opportunities provided by <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> before invoking R 2 P in the context of natural disasters...|$|E
40|$|By 2018 {{the war in}} Syria {{has been}} going on for seven years. The {{conflict}} has caused the death of hundreds of thousands and has forced more than 11 million Syrians to flee their homes. The responsibility for the huge humanitarian disaster rests on the perpetrators but who has the responsibility to protect? The resolution ’Responsibility to Protect’ [R 2 P] determines the responsibility to protect on to the international community and the United Nations [UN]. When looking at the large numbers of refugees, wounded and dead the question arises, why hasn't the UN succeed in its responsibility to protect the Syrian people? This case study of the UN:s diplomatic mission and why it has failed to protect the Syrian people rests on the theoretical foundations of resolution R 2 P, two branches of diplomacy and further the inclusion of women in peacemaking processes. The inclusion of women in the decision-making peace processes are highly important to gain a holistic perspective and an enduring peace according to several available sources. Available data reveals, however, that the numbers of women included in the peace process in Syria are rather low and when women are included they are in a position of advocacy, not decision-making. The essay’s conclusion establishes the prospects for peace in Syria as quite low due to the poor preconditions. Further, the essay finds that the international community through the UN possesses the necessary framework, and bears the responsibility for the Syrian people due to the Syrian government's atrocities committed against its people. The UN:s diplomatic strategy are by the Secretary-General Special Envoys characterized by <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> but unfortunately, all attempts by the UN or any other actor to the time of writing have been without success...|$|E
40|$|This study explores Chinas <b>humanitarian</b> <b>{{diplomacy}}</b> in Africa in {{the past}} decade. It posits that while this diplomacy is often characterised in the literature as evolving from a rigid adherence {{to the principle of}} non-interference in internal affairs to a more flexible or pragmatic stance, attachment to sovereignty has actually remained an important hallmark of China's intervention policy. Chinas stance can therefore be characterized as one comprising both non-interference and non-indifference. This puzzle of continuity and change forms the central topic of this study, which includes five case studies of China's recent diplomacy on humanitarian crises in Africa and invokes insights from identity and role theory. It {{is one of the first}} studies to apply role theory extensively to Chinese foreign policy. The study relates the diversity in the outlook of Chinas <b>humanitarian</b> <b>diplomacy</b> to elements of change and continuity in Chinas foreign policy identity. Identity is conceptualized as a set of mutually constructed beliefs about the self and others in the international arena and about the relationships that exist between the self and these others. Following role theory, identity is assumed to provide states with a sense of which behaviour is appropriate for them and also of which interests to prioritize in a given situation. Identity thus offers a foundation for states motivational and behavioural orientation in foreign policy. The study holds identity to be a particular valuable concept when trying to understand the motivations of China as an emerging and evolving power, in Africa and beyond. It posits that China is reinventing itself for a new era but keeps on revisiting old senses of self and long-held beliefs. On the one hand, there is clear recognition among the Chinese leadership of the potential for a more active role in international affairs considering China's increasing material and non-material power resources. Chinese foreign policy elites cautiously acknowledge the legitimacy of the expectations that are projected onto China in this regard, both domestically and internationally. This acknowledgment has given rise to the endorsement of a new foreign policy identity as a responsible great power and a role conception that entails greater activism. With regard to international peace and security, China's activism has mostly come to the fore in its increased participation in UN peacekeeping and to a markedly lesser extent involvement in conflict diplomacy. However, on the other hand, older Chinese self-representations such as that of China as a weak power and a victim of Western imperialism and that of China as a member of the Third World continue to hold relevance. Historically developed beliefs about the intrinsic value of sovereignty and about inherent tensions between the developed and the developing world on issues of sovereignty continue to instil role conceptions that defend sovereignty and uphold solidarity with developing countries. Identity thus acts not only as a source of change in China's humanitariandiplomacy but also of continuity. Traditional self-images impede the development of a novel, more proactive intervention doctrine. Studies often highlight the enabling effect of older corporate and social identities, for instance in terms of an alleged Chinese propensity to act as a free-rider or to present itself in a favourable manner in Africa vis-à-vis established great power. However, this study reveals how, in the case of Chinas intervention policy, older identities also act as a constraint. For instance, a perceived need to maintain a united front with developing powers at times causes China to endorse more intervention than a strict application of the non-interference principle would allow for. China has occasionally abandoned its insistence on key principles such as host nation consent due to the support of key regional players for proposed UN enforcement measures. In this regard, it is interesting how for a rising China, developing countries continue to provide guidance on what exactly constitutes responsibility with regard to the specific issue of intervention in the Third World. In another example, deep-rooted reservations about power politics make China reluctant to intervene in domestic conflicts even in defence of its own interests as an emerging power. The research highlights the value of an approach centred on localisation when studying China's acceptance of new norms of sovereignty, such as sovereignty as responsibility and responsibility to protect. Localisation does not seek evidence of full-fledged norms compliance or moral transformation but attempts to understand how new beliefs and practices become embedded in the old beliefs and relationships that once constituted a normative order of their own. Change is thus not approached as the replacement of the old with the new but rather as the product of an interaction between these two elements. The study concludes by pointing at the potential for role compatibility between traditional great powers and China, which it holds to offer better prospects than a traditional approach of socialisation: on the one hand, attachment to sovereignty and wariness of power politics continue to be entrenched in the Chinese sense of self. For older Chinese self-representations such as that of China as a victim or a developing power, notwithstanding Chinas rising power, the tension between external role and inner appreciation has not - or not yet - reached a point that would cause the former to be discarded. On the other hand, an increasingly powerful China is less likely to be susceptible to socialisation, which mostly - and probably most fruitfully - occurs in an asymmetrical power situation, which no longer corresponds to current-day realities. nrpages: 317 status: publishe...|$|E
