5000|$|In immunology, an {{idiotype}} is {{a shared}} characteristic between {{a group of}} immunoglobulin or T cell receptor (TCR) molecules based upon the antigen binding specificity and therefore structure of their variable region. The variable region of antigen receptors of T cells (TCRs) and B cells (immunoglobulins) contain complementarity determining regions (CDRs) with unique amino acid sequences. They define the surface and properties of the variable region, determining the antigen specificity and therefore the <b>idiotope</b> of the molecule. Immunoglobulins or TCRs with a shared <b>idiotope</b> are the same idiotype. Antibody idiotype is determined by: ...|$|E
5000|$|If a {{separate}} antibody is produced that has specific binding capabilities to an <b>idiotope</b> {{of the previously}} described antibody, {{it is said to}} be an [...] "anti-idiotypic antibody".

5000|$|An <b>idiotope</b> is {{the unique}} set of {{antigenic}} determinants (epitopes) of the variable portion of an antibody. In some cases {{it can be the}} actual antigen-binding site, and in some cases it may comprise variable region sequences outside of the antigen-binding site on the antibody itself.

40|$|From the serum of 10 {{allergic}} subjects we {{have prepared}} IgG antibodies recognizing <b>idiotopes</b> carried by specific antibodies to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dpt) allergens, and studied cross-reactivity of anti-Dpt IgG bystander and antigen-binding site-associated <b>idiotopes</b> by latex agglutination assays. <b>Idiotopes</b> of specific anti-Dpt IgE {{were evaluated by}} radioimmunoassays. Depending on the assay, a binding or inhibition of more than 50 %, {{as compared to the}} reactivity of specific antibodies with the corresponding anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) IgG, was considered significant. Cross-reactivity of antigen-binding site-associated <b>idiotopes</b> attained a mean proportion of 6 / 10 for IgG and 9. 6 / 10 for IgE. By contrast, bystander <b>idiotopes</b> cross-reacted only occasionally with a mean proportion of 2 / 10 for both IgG and IgE antibodies. Anti-Id antibodies from two subjects have been isolated by adsorption on insolubilized anti-Dpt antibodies of the corresponding patient. Using this purified material we have confirmed that (a) the majority of anti-Id antibodies carry an "internal image" of the initial antigen and compete in a dose-dependent manner with Dpt allergens for the binding to the anti-Dpt antibodies and (b) paratope-associated <b>idiotopes</b> of anti-Dpt antibodies are shared by unrelated individuals. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} BALB/c B cell {{precursors}} {{responsive to the}} T-independent (TI) type 2 (TI- 2) antigen, dextran B 1355 S (DEX), and the T-dependent (TD) derivative, dextran-Limulus hemocyanin (DEX-Hy) were examined for isotype and <b>idiotope</b> expression using the splenic focus assay. The predominant isotype detected in the TI assay was IgM, while IgA was the predominant isotype expressed in the TD assay. There was also a fourfold {{increase in the number}} of foci secreting more than one isotype in the TD assay vs. the TI assay without an overall change in anti-DEX precursor frequency, suggesting that carrier-primed T cells enhance the expression of non-IgM isotypes possibly by increasing the frequency of isotype switching by individual B cell precursors. A panel of distinct monoclonal antiidiotype antibodies (MAIDs) was then used to examine <b>idiotope</b> expression by antibodies secreted in splenic foci responding to DEX and DEX-Hy. This analysis revealed considerable diversity in the <b>idiotope</b> profiles expressed by all isotypes tested. There appeared to be no differences in <b>idiotope</b> diversity among the various isotypes. A similar diversity of <b>idiotope</b> profiles was obtained from both TI and TD splenic foci, indicating that a comparable degree of diversity was associated with the antibodies generated by TI and TD precursors. Idiotype analysis of IgM-IgA-secreting foci with a panel of monoclonal antiidiotope antibodies revealed slight idiotypic differences between the two isotypes secreted in the same focus in about half the cases. These results suggest that somatic variation occurs during the antigen- driven maturation of B cell precursors, within the 15 -d time frame of the splenic focus assay, and may be associated with isotype switching...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} {{proposed that the}} immune system's idiotypic repertoire includes a particular class of <b>idiotopes</b> that play an integral role in the regulation of immune responses (1, 2). Hence, these <b>idiotopes</b> are designated as the regulatory <b>idiotopes</b> and can be defined by the following criteria: (a) they function as autoimmunogens; (b) they are shared by various members of an idiotype (Id) 1 network pathway, which may consequently include antibodies with distinct antigenic specificities; (c) they are recognized by regulatory T cells that control the expression of clones expressing them. These clones possess the potential of becoming dominantly expressed in an immune response because of the possible mediation of these regulatory T cells that are either present before immunization or may be easily elicited {{during the course of}} an immune response (3). The notion that this special class of <b>idiotopes</b> exists was based on our study of the immunochemical properties of several members of an idiotypic network pathway, which was initiated by the immunization of normal BALB/c mice with ABPC- 48 (A 48), a BALB/c levan-binding myeloma protein.

40|$|IgG {{isolated}} from the plasma of seven individuals hypersensitive to the common house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DPT) was exhaustively adsorbed onto insolubilized DPT. The unbound fraction was found by radioimmunoassay to contain antibodies recognizing the variable region of both anti-DPT IgG and IgE antibodies. This recognition was idiotype (Id) -specific as it persisted after passage over insolubilized polyclonal IgG of unrelated specificity. Most of these anti-Id IgG carried the internal image of the initial antigen in that they competitively inhibited the binding of anti-DPT antibodies to DPT. Immunoadsorption of anti-Id IgG onto insolubilized anti-DPT IgG antibodies from the same individual completely eliminated their reaction with anti-DPT IgG but not with anti-DPT IgE, suggesting that <b>idiotopes</b> included in the antigen-binding site of specific IgG and IgE antibodies were not identical. Anti-Id IgG recognizing <b>idiotopes</b> located outside the antigen-binding site (bystander <b>idiotopes)</b> were also completely removed by passage over insolubilized anti-DPT IgG; {{in this case the}} reaction of the anti-Id IgG with both anti-DPT IgG and anti-DPT IgE was inhibited, indicating that, for a given individual, bystander <b>idiotopes</b> were shared between anti-DPT antibodies pertaining to these two isotypes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Idiotope</b> Ac 38, a V region {{determinant}} of the lambda 1 chain-bearing, germ line encoded antibody B 1 - 8, is expressed at high frequency (approximately 1 / 40) in lambda 1 chain-bearing B cells. Here, {{we describe the}} isolation of lambda-positive hybridomas from C 57 BL/ 6 mice which had been immunized with antibody Ac 38, the antibody recognizing <b>idiotope</b> Ac 38. In Northern blot analysis, mRNA isolated from 10 such hybridomas hybridizes with a cDNA probe from the VH gene expressed in the cell line B 1 - 8. Amino acid sequence analysis of the VH regions of four of the hybridoma proteins reveals {{that they are all}} derived from related, though distinct, germ line VH genes. In one case the sequence data suggest that extensive somatic mutation has taken place. Only one of the four sequences derives from the same VH gene that is expressed in the cell line B 1 - 8. Together with earlier evidence, the present data demonstrate that the Ac 38 <b>idiotope</b> is a marker for at least five VH and three D region genes in the C 57 BL/ 6 germ line. This explains the high frequency at which this <b>idiotope</b> is expressed in the B cell population. In addition, our sequence determinations identify two VH genes in the C 57 BL/ 6 strain which are closely related (and possibly allelic) to two known BALB/c VH genes.

This paradigm was supported by data suggesting a triple relationship between the sequence of the hypervariable region, specificity of the combining site, and <b>idiotope</b> (4). This concept was challenged by two unexpected observations: that the same <b>idiotope</b> can be shared by antibodies with various specificities (5), and that a myeloma protein can bind to two different antigens (i. e., MOPC 460, which binds to dinitrophenyl hapten and menadione) (6) ...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory {{disease of the}} central nervous system. The target antigen of the intrathecal immune response has not been identified, and the immune response in MS may also hold neuroprotective potential. MS patients display an increased frequency of T cells that recognize CSF IgG. Work in this thesis shows that these T cells recognize idiotopes, which are mutated fragments on the IgG variable regions. We show that <b>idiotope</b> specific T cells from the blood and CSF of MS patients recognize several epitopes on self-IgG, that autologous B cells may present their own <b>idiotope</b> to T cells, and that <b>idiotope</b> specific T cells are able to induce apoptosis of oligodendrocytes.

The antibody responses induced in different strains of mice by the hapten phosphorylcholine (PC) coupled to ovalbumin, PC-OVA, were compared with the responses induced by carrier conjugates of two different anti-idiotopic antibodies. One anti-idiotope, 4 C 11, exhibits the characteristics of an internal image of phosphorylcholine, and therefore is classified as an Ab 2 beta; the other, F 6, does not mimic antigen, and therefore is classified as an Ab 2 alpha. The analysis of the temporal kinetics of the IgM and IgG 1 anti-PC responses induced by nominal and <b>idiotope</b> antigens revealed dynamic responses characterized by changes in {{the quality and quantity of}} the antibody populations during the course of the immune response. All three antigens could stimulate antibodies that were PC-specific and T 15 idiotope-positive in BALB/c and A/St mice. The highest titre of T 15 + anti-PC antibodies was achieved with an immunization protocol which involved priming with Ab 2 alpha followed by challenge with PC-OVA. Antibodies specific for the extended hapten, diazophenylphosphorylcholine, and hapten-carrier bridge determinants were being stimulated late in the responses to PC-OVA. BALB-c, A/St and CBA/N (Xid) mice all produced, late in the response to Ab 2 alpha, high T 15 + antibody titres which do not bind PC. The induction of T 15 +, non-PC binding, antibody suggests that T 15 is a regulatory <b>idiotope,</b> expressed on antibodies having differing antigenic specificities. With regard to vaccine development, these results support the contention that effective induction of antibodies does not depend on stimulating a unique <b>idiotope</b> but can be achieved by anti-idiotypes reacting with different idiotopes.

In sharp contrast, it has been exceedingly difficult to obtain antiidiotypic reagents defining CRI on human monoclonal IgM reactive with myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG).

Idiotypic determinants (<b>idiotopes)</b> are fingerprints of the variable region of the antibody molecule and, as such, they represent unique probes with which to explore the diversity of the immune response.

The second subpopulation is not found in normal serum, binds ABA, is found on all IgG subclasses, expresses CRI 5 Ci, and is selectively stimulated by ABA-conjugated proteins. Since CRIAD 8 was found on both subpopulations of antibody, and since each subpopulation could be selectively expanded, {{it was possible to}} study the effect that expansion of the ABA- CRIAD 8 + set had on subsequent responses elicited by ABA-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in the ABA+ CRIAD 8 + set.

Administration of this antiserum before Ar immunization resulted in an anti-Ar response that lacked idiotypepositive (Id ÷) antibodies (1). This suppression was shown to be associated with T suppressor cells (Ts) capable of transferring the suppressed state to naive, lightly irradiated recipients (2). An apparent suppressed state was also transferred by B cells from mice suppressed with rabbit anti-Id antiserum, through a mechanism of clonal dominance (3, 4). It has been reported that homologous monoclonal antiidiotopes, as well as heterologous anti-Id, suppress Id production in the Ar system (5, 6). In previous work, we demonstrated that suppression induced by two monoclonal reagents with overlapping specificities was <b>idiotope</b> specific, suggesting that homologous antiidiotope exerts its effect through direct binding to diversified B cell surface immunoglobulin (7). We have now further investigated the mechanism of suppression induced by the homologous antiidiotope, MB. Suppression induced by MB was remarkably stable, and long-lasting suppression could be transferred to naive recipients by B cells from suppressed donors. The transfer experiments indicated it was not necessary to invoke Ts to explain the perpetuation of <b>idiotope</b> suppression, once established.

The anti-ID Abs were rendered idiotype specific by appropriate adsorption. Binding of labelled mAb to homologous anti-ID Ab bound to a polystyrene matrix was completely inhibited when the same mAb was added. In contrast, addition of other mAbs sharing the same isotype and the same light chain but with different specificity {{did not affect the}} binding reaction. Each anti-ID Ab inhibited completely and selectively the reaction between the allergen and the homologous mAb idiotype. Labelled rye I binding to a given polystyrene-bound mAb idiotype was completely blocked if the relevant anti-ID Ab was used as an inhibitor. Murine polyclonal anti-rye I antisera inhibited the reaction between all three mAbs and the antigens, as well as the reaction between all three mAb idiotypes and their homologous anti-ID Abs. On another hand, goat polyclonal anti-rye I antisera only inhibited the reaction between the mAbs and the antigens. These results suggest that the anti-ID Abs produced are directed against <b>idiotopes</b> located within the paratopes and such <b>idiotopes</b> are shared by murine monoclonal and polyclonal Abs. Human rye I-specific IgE and murine anti-rye I mAbs could share common <b>idiotopes,</b> since human IgE binding to the antigen was inhibited by the anti-ID Abs. These observations imply structural similarity in the V gene coding for the variable region of the antibody of two different species...|$|R
40|$|Using {{monoclonal}} antiidiotypic antibodies, {{we developed}} a sensitive binding assay that detects molecules with one or with two <b>idiotopes</b> of the ABPC 48 idiotype. ABPC 48 cross-reactive idiotypes were thus shown {{to be present in}} substantial amounts in sera of nonimmunized mice. Levan binding sites are found on these idiotypes. During the life time of the mice, the natural anti-levan titer increases while ABPC 48 idiotypic expression remains constant, suggesting different controls for these two activities. On the other hand, ABPC 48 cross-reactive idiotypes participate [...] as minor components [...] in the response that follows a deliberate immunization with bacterial levan. This induction process is likely to reflect the selection of <b>idiotopes</b> expressed by the B cell clones preactivated in sera of nonimmunized mice rather than the activation of silent clones. We suggest that a similar situation might explain the reported emergence of ABPC 48 idiotypes in animals primed with antiidiotypic antibodies and subsequently stimulated with levan...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAbs) {{directed against}} the prototype enterovirus 70 (EV- 70) strain J 670 / 71 were generated and characterized {{in order to produce}} anti-idiotypic MAbs (MAb 2 s) for use as surrogate immunogens. Western immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation assays suggested that all the MAbs recognize conformational epitopes on the virion surface. An EV- 70 -neutralizing antibody, MAb/ev- 12 (MAb 1), was selected for the production of MAb 2 s. Five MAb 2 s were selected for their capacities to inhibit the interaction of MAb/ev- 12 with EV- 70 in dot immunobinding inhibition and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, these five MAb 2 s inhibited virus neutralization mediated by MAb/ev- 12, suggesting that they recognize paratope-associated <b>idiotopes.</b> In competition enzyme immunosorbent assays, none of the five MAb 2 s recognized other neutralizing and nonneutralizing EV- 70 -specific MAbs, demonstrating that the MAb 2 s were specific for private <b>idiotopes.</b> Immunization with each of the MAb 2 s was carried out for the production of anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab 3). All five MAb 2 s induced an immune response. Moreover, results suggested that they share <b>idiotopes,</b> since MAb 2 -MAb/ev- 12 binding could be inhibited by homologous as well as heterologous Ab 3 s. Ab 3 sera were shown to possess antibodies capable of immunoprecipitating 35 S-labeled viral proteins {{in the same manner as}} MAb/ev- 12. Nine of 15 mice immunized with MAb 2 s demonstrated Ab 3 neutralizing activity specific for the prototype EV- 70 strain, J 670 / 71. The potential application of MAb 2 s to serve as surrogate immunogens for conformational epitopes is substantiated by the results presented in this report...|$|R
