5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} {{is currently}} a contentious subject as some investigators {{do not believe the}} presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP. <b>Even</b> <b>among</b> proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{also offer}} game {{broadcasts}} in Spanish on an eight-station network fronted by WGSP-FM in Pageland, South Carolina, {{as well as}} additional radio affiliates in Mexico. Jaime Moreno provides the play-by-play while his nephew, Luis Moreno Jr., is the color commentator.

It is considered a classic by anime and manga critics, and has been influential in anime industry.|$|E
5|$|At its height, {{the second}} city {{was the home}} of about 40,000 people. This {{population}} was East-Semitic speaking one, and used a dialect much similar {{to the language of}} Ebla (the Eblaite language), while the Shakkanakku period had an East-Semitic Akkadian speaking population. West Semitic names started to be attested in Mari since the second kingdom era, and by the middle Bronze-Age, the west Semitic Amorite tribes became the majority of the pastoral groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys. Amorite names started to be observed in the city {{toward the end of the}} Shakkanakku period, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> the ruling dynasty members.|$|E
5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> the younger fans who {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Malón, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio would not allow it and that they would not reunite the band if the four members do not have a good personal relationship.|$|E
60|$|We {{stopped there}} that night, and next day were off, whirled along through {{boundless}} landscapes of villages, and meadows, and parks: and over arching viaducts, and through wonderful tunnels; till, half delirious with excitement, I found myself dropped {{down in the}} <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> gas-lights, under a great roof in Euston Square.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{so close}} {{was the great}} house, and so minute a watch was kept, that the fact of Lord Ivinghoe's {{spending}} the whole day at the parsonage was known, and conclusions were arrived at.

5|$|However, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> Senate Republicans, {{there were}} {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} <b>even</b> <b>among</b> the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|Most 17th-century Muscovites {{received}} little education, {{and there were}} low levels of literacy <b>even</b> <b>among</b> the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and {{a small amount of}} history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister Tsarevna Sophia—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of Kiev, and could speak Latin and Polish.|$|E

60|$|When {{two weeks}} had gone, Grace and Barbara sat one <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> the stones by a lake. The evening was calm, {{the sun was}} setting, and {{the shadow of the}} pines {{stretched}} across the tranquil water. Now and then the reflections trembled and a languid ripple broke against the driftwood on the beach. In the distance a loon called, but when its wild cry died away all was very quiet.|$|R
5|$|Philip {{was born}} in a village in Auranitis, part of the {{district}} of Trachonitis, east of the Sea of Galilee in Palestine. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern al-Shahbā', Syria) during his reign as emperor. He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). <b>Even</b> <b>among</b> Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and that he must have been prominent in his community.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl drew on his {{imprisonment}} at Auschwitz in composing Man's Search for Meaning (1946), one of {{the most}} widely read works about the camp. An existentialist work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose <b>even</b> <b>among</b> great suffering, and that this sense of purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli was {{initially}} {{brought up in}} a pro-Ottoman environment, owing to his family's connections in Istanbul. The restrictions of the Abdul Hamid II era, however, started to be felt around the Ottoman Empire, and discontent was brewing <b>even</b> <b>among</b> the empire's elite. Following the Young Turk Revolution against Abdul Hamid II in 1908, parliamentary elections were called in all provinces, and liberal Arab intellectuals like Shukri al-Asali, Shafiq Muayyad al-Azm, and Rushdi al-Shama'a secured seats as deputies (members of the legislature) representing Damascus. The liberal current that established itself through these figures, and the political dailies they established including al-Qabas ("The Firebrand") and al-Ikha' al-Arabi ("Arab Brotherhood"), greatly influenced Quwatli and other Arab youths.|$|E

50|$|Shaw told Ellen Terry:Kissing in the <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> {{the trees}} was very pleasant, {{but she knows}} the value of her {{unencumbered}} independence, having suffered a good deal from family bonds and conventionality before {{the death of her}} mother and the marriage of her sister left her free... The idea of tying herself up again by a marriage before she knows anything — before she has exploited her freedom and money power to the utmost.|$|R
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|The British {{casualties}} were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but {{a member of}} Howe's staff wrote in his diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded. David McCullough gives much higher figures of 90 killed and 300 wounded. The Americans had about 30 killed and 100 wounded, including Knowlton and Major Andrew Leitch among the dead. The American victory raised morale in the ranks, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> {{those who had not}} been engaged. It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington's command.|$|E
5|$|The law had its detractors, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> {{those groups}} {{protected}} by it. Puritans {{were concerned that}} the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were also concerned that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, they were being required {{to submit to the}} Pope, whom they considered to be the antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony's sole established church.|$|E
6000|$|Faddle reached London {{the evening}} before the Colonel's letter, and again dined with his friend at Bolivia's. At first they were both {{extremely}} angry, acerbating each other's wrath. Now that he was safe back in London Faddle thought {{that he would have}} enjoyed an <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> the [...] "swells" [...] of Stalham, and felt himself to be injured by the inhospitable treatment he had received--"after going all the way down there, hardly to be asked to sit down!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the work}} was not {{completely}} finished, the ship was launched on April 16, 1907: [...] "A special train brought guests to the Landing for launching ceremonies...the beautiful boat then floated out on the bosom of Okanagan Lake as graceful as a swan." [...] Mrs. Gore, wife of Captain Gore, manager of the British Columbia Lake and River Service in the early 1900s, named the ship after Okanagan Lake and the couple hosted a ball in the <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> other festivities.|$|R
60|$|Tavernake {{felt that}} he had indeed wandered into an alien world as he took his place the {{following}} <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> the little crowd of people who were waiting outside the stage-door of the Atlas Theatre. These were surroundings to which he was totally unaccustomed. Two very handsome motor-cars were drawn up against the curb, and behind them a string of electric broughams and taxicabs, proving conclusively that the young ladies of the Atlas Theatre were popular in other than purely theatrical circles.|$|R
5|$|The two {{ecotypes}} of {{the common}} bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, {{but they have been}} shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> nearby populations. As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.|$|E
5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and <b>even</b> <b>among</b> some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E
5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but <b>even</b> <b>among</b> individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E
50|$|Some Pyraloidea {{are still}} not {{unequivocally}} placed in a particular tribe or <b>even</b> family; <b>among</b> these, Tanaobela for example is sometimes assigned to the Pyraustinae.|$|R
