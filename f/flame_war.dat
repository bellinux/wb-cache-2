5|$|The {{series has}} gained a strong {{popularity}} in not only Japan but also throughout the world. For instance, coverage of the anime appeared {{on the front page}} of the Hong Kong free newspaper am730 on May 27, 2013, concerning its popularity within Hong Kong as well as in China and Taiwan. However, the series also attracted criticism: the South Korean Electronic Times magazine accused Attack on Titan of having a militaristic message that serves Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's political leanings; while the series also resonated with Hong Kong youths who saw the invading Titans as a metaphor for mainland China. Hong Kong media commentator Wong Yeung-tat praised Isayama's style and the versatility of Attack on Titans setting, which opens itself to readers' various interpretations. In 2013, after media linked to a 2010 blog post by Isayama indicating that the design of the character Dot Pixis was based on the Imperial Japanese General Akiyama Yoshifuru, an Internet <b>flame</b> <b>war</b> about the general's war record (e.g. allowing the Port Arthur massacre to occur) ensued on his blog and included death threats to the author. Because many of the threats written in Japanese had grammatical errors, it is believed that they were written by people outside of Japan.|$|E
25|$|When a {{topic that}} has {{degenerated}} into a <b>flame</b> <b>war</b> is considered akin {{to that of the}} forum (be it a section or the entire board), spam and flames have a chance of spreading outside the topic and causing trouble, usually in the form of vandalism. Some forums (commonly game forums) have suffered from forum-wide flame wars almost immediately after their conception, because of a pre-existing <b>flame</b> <b>war</b> element in the online community. Many forums have created devoted areas strictly for discussion of potential <b>flame</b> <b>war</b> topics that are moderated like normal.|$|E
25|$|When a thread—or in some cases, {{an entire}} forum—becomes unstable, {{the result is}} usually {{uncontrolled}} spam {{in the form of}} one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a <b>flame</b> <b>war.</b> To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics that discuss pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g., rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.).|$|E

Two weeks after the deal was announced Michael Robertson speculated on the secret terms of the deal and argued that ultimately this was a bad deal for imeem. This speculation lead to a <b>flame</b> <b>war</b> on the Pho digital media email list as imeem representatives denied his claims and dismissed his theories as unfounded. All traffic was redirected to MySpace after the company acquired Imeem on December 8, 2009.|$|E

50|$|Straczynski {{interacted with}} Babylon 5 fans on rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 and similar groups on GEnie and CompuServe, however rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 slowly {{turned into a}} morass of spam and <b>flame</b> <b>wars</b> (usually perpetrated and carried forward by a rather small group of people). The more Babylon 5s ratings increased, and the more {{attention}} was drawn to Straczynskis involvement in the group, the more extensive and vitriolic the many <b>flame</b> <b>wars</b> got. By the end of 1995, Straczynski was also being net-stalked, and had to scrap a script in pre-production because fans were posting story ideas. Eventually, Straczynski left rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5, focusing on the moderated Internet based forums.|$|R

These <b>flame</b> <b>wars</b> sparked my {{interest in}} the passionately argued positions that lesbians took over the possibility that a woman could (or could not) be violent to her partner. This led me to look at other representations of violence in the series between a transgender character and his female partner, and between a heterosexual male character and his female partner, and to the question of why these did not lead to the same level of passionate argument in the forums as did the incident between the lesbian couple...|$|R
