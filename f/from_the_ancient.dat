5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{was named}} by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905, {{along with the}} family Tyrannosauridae.

The {{superfamily}} name Tyrannosauroidea {{was first published in}} a 1964 paper by the British paleontologist Alick Walker. The suffix -oidea, commonly used in the name of animal superfamilies, is derived from the Greek ειδος/eidos ('form').|$|E

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> world.|$|E

He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to {{be representative of the}} species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Port Arthur in January 1905, Japanese engineers refloated Poltava on 22 July, and commissioned her as Tango a month later, {{taking her}} name <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Japanese province of Tango, now {{a part of}} Kyoto Prefecture. Classified as a 1st class battleship, she departed for Maizuru Naval Arsenal two days later and arrived on 29 August. Except for participating in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905, she remained there under repair until November 1907. Tango then sailed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to complete fitting out.|$|E
5|$|In the Guale and Timucuan Mocama provinces, La Tama {{refugees}} established four towns descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> interior Georgia chiefdoms: Altamaha, Okatee (Ocute), Chechessee (Ichisi), and Euhaw (apparently {{descended from}} Toa); Altamaha remained the leading town. Within the Yamassee confederacy, these towns formed the Lower Yamassee, while Guale towns {{and some others}} formed the Upper Yamassee. The Yamaseee shifted alliances and later relocated to present-day South Carolina in 1685. They remained a significant power in the Southeast until the English defeated them in the Yamasee War of 1715–1717, after which they integrated into the multiethnic settlements in Spanish Florida.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Its generic name, Cleptornis, {{is derived}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> Greek kleptes, a robber or thief, and ornis, a bird.

The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred Marche, who procured the original specimens.|$|E

5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits.

While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E
