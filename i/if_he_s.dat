40|$|The Vanilla Passport Option is an {{insurance}} against trading loss. In this paper, we add various exotic features to the Vanilla contract and price the resulting financial products. The assumptions {{that we make}} {{are the same as}} the Black-Scholes ones and the resulting pricing equations are Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equations or parabolic free boundary PDE's which can be solved via finite difference methods. 1 1 Introduction: the Vanilla Passport Option The Passport Option is {{an insurance}} against trading loss. The noteholder is allowed to `trade' a particular asset (of price S) during the life of the Option, T. The number of assets he 'holds' at a particular time t is denoted q and can be positive (if the noteholder thinks the asset price is going to go up) or negative (<b>if</b> <b>he</b> thinks <b>S</b> is going to go down). There is however a constraint (specified in the contract) on q, this is the position limit C: jqj C. So q can be any value in [; C] and it is the noteholder who decide [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{first phase}} in {{developing}} information systems {{is often called}} conceptual modelling phase. The model constructed is the first formal document describing the desired system. The conceptual model must deal with structural and behavioural aspects of the world. The complexity of such a model often prevents a detailed understanding by the customers. One way to estimate <b>if</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> really gets what (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> wants are prototype systems constructed by conventional programming. We propose a way to construct prototypes out of formal specifications by means of transformation into a kernel language that can be executed in a suitable distributed runtime environment. We introduce the modelling language, the basic execution mechanism, and the basic architecture of the runtime system. 1 Introduction A large number of software systems {{can be characterized as}} information systems.

40|$|In 2002, Toyama Prefecture in Japan had {{a change}} of policy {{allowing}} residents to submit various kinds of forms electrically, in accordance with the development of the Internet. At that time, many municipal officers were forced to rewrite regional ordinances by hand. Legal codes are intrinsically destined to be modified and revised in later years, {{to catch up with the}} requirements of our society. However, with each revision the coherence of the code is threatened, and in worse cases it may contain discordance and inconsistency in itself. In many research on legal reasoning, researchers often regard that the code is always consistent though they may sometimes need to add incomplete knowledge to get beneficial consequences. However, when a new legislation, jurists need to inspect rigidly whether it is coherent with existing one. In this revision procedure, jurists must assess how the affected area is large. <b>If</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> finds discordance with a new legislation, and (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> modifies it, then (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> needs to search for the affected area further from the newly revised law recursively. Thus, such a revision would be a tedious and painstaking work. Our motivation in this study is to identify the affected area automatically and to detect discordance in a practical code.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the effects of recent {{regulatory}} reforms that Spanish Health Authorities have implemented in the pharmaceutical market: the introduction of a reference price system together with the promotion of generic drugs. The main objectives of these two reforms are to increase price competition and, ultimately, reduce pharmaceutical costs. Before the introduction of reference prices, consumers had to pay a fixed copayment of the price of whatever drug purchased. With the introduction of such system, the situation differs in the following way: <b>if</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> buys the more expensive branded drug, then (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> pays a sum of two elements: the copayment associated to the reference price plus the difference between the price of this good and the reference price. However, if the consumer decides to buy the generic alternative, with price lower than the reference price, then (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> has to pay the same copayment as before. We show that the introduction of a reference price system together with the promotion of generic drugs increase price competition and lower pharmaceutical costs only if the reference price is set in a certain interval. Also profits for the duopolists might be reduced. These results are due to the opposing effects that reference prices have on branded and generic producers respectively.
