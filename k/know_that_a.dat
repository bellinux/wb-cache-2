5|$|In Black's home in Seattle, {{his wife}} Catherine (Megan Gallagher) confides in {{policeman}} Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) her worry about Black's overprotective nature, fearing he may {{quit his job}} if he believes his family to be in danger. Catherine does not yet <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> stalker from their past has resurfaced and has been posting polaroids of the family to Black. Black has meanwhile been persuaded by his fellow Group member Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell) that his family is in no immediate risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038. Portions {{of an earlier}} structure were alleged {{to be included in}} the present edifice, which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later, and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, although we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new tower and porch were built around 1115. Much evidence which might have shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even as far back as late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present church, or is in the churchyard.|$|E

25|$|During {{his visits}} to the United Kingdom, between 1846 and 1848, Douglass asked British Christians never to support American Churches that {{permitted}} slavery, and he expressed his happiness to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders {{as members of the}} Church.|$|E
25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality.

The important point to remember is that these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event.|$|E
25|$|Due to Thorfinn's severe injuries, {{the group}} stays in Norway {{for the whole}} winter.

25|$|Another {{important}} point {{to consider is}} that Tolkowsky did not follow {{the path of a}} ray that was reflected more than twice in the diamond. However, we now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> diamond's appearance is composed of many light paths that reflect considerably more than two times within that diamond. Once again, we can see that Tolkowsky's predictions are helpful in explaining optimal diamond performance, but they are incomplete by today's technological standards.|$|E
25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, the Dutch {{commander}} at Rotterdam, Colonel Scharroo, {{received an}} ultimatum: {{if he did}} not surrender, the town would be bombed. As the ultimatum was not signed, Scharroo sent it back. A few hours later, he received another ultimatum, this time duly signed by General Schmidt, the German commander at Rotterdam. Schmidt did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> squadron of bombers was already on its way to bomb Rotterdam. The Germans tried to warn the bomber crews by shooting red flares, but only half of the squadron noticed this; the other half continued on their mission and dropped their bombs on the city (see the Rotterdam Blitz).|$|E

He was to travel along the Scottish coast and report on the {{warships}} stationed there; [...] "If or when Mr. Lody comes to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> naval battle has taken place, he will enquire as much and unobtrusively as possible regarding losses, damage etc." [...] His orders reflected the Admiralstab's belief that the war would be decided by a single major naval battle.|$|E

After they leave, Salerno orders his {{associates}} to hire professional hitman Ray Ferritto to kill them both. Nardi is killed in a car explosion, McComber dies in a bombing at the Cleveland docks, and Ritson is shot near his house.

500|$|In 1890, the Queen had Karim's {{portrait}} {{painted by}} Heinrich von Angeli. According to the Queen, von Angeli was keen to paint Karim {{as he had}} never painted an Indian before and [...] "was so struck with his handsome face and colouring". On 11 July 1890, she wrote to Lansdowne, and the Secretary of State for India Lord Cross, for [...] "a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi, Hafiz Abdul Karim". The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household {{to look after the}} Munshi after she was gone, and so sought to secure his future. Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers, and then only in cases of long and meritorious service. [...] Nevertheless, the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually, the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally. [...] Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October, pressuring him on the land grant. Apart from wasteland, there was little government-controlled land near Agra; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot. On 30 October, the Munshi left Balmoral for four months' leave in India, travelling on the same ship as Lady Lansdowne. On the same day, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen to let her <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged. Lansdowne made a point of informing the Queen: ...|$|E
