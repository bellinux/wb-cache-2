Because of strict controls upon Han Chinese families imposed by the Mongols in which only 1 out of every 10 households was allowed to own a <b>knife</b> <b>guarded</b> by a Mongolian guard, this coordinated message was important to gather as many available weapons as possible.|$|R

40|$|Scars after burns {{frequently}} cause {{functional and}} psychological disturbances. Loss of deep dermis {{is one of}} the principal factors that contributes to a poor scar outcome. In contrast to other treatments, surgical debridement of burns using the Versajet Hydrosurgery System ensures preservation of deep dermis and therefore could {{play an important role in}} the prevention of worse scar outcomes after deep dermal burns. However, so far, no studies evaluated scar outcomes after having used the Versajet. The objective of this retrospective observational study was, to determine whether surgical treatment of deep dermal burns using the Versajet, gives better scar outcomes than surgical treatment with a <b>guarded</b> <b>knife</b> or conservative treatment with silver sulfadiazine/ ceriumnitrate. Included in this study were all acute patients hospitalized in the Burn Center of Groningen between January 2006 and April 2010 with deep dermal burns and a follow-up period of at least four months. Included patients were divided into four groups according to treatment: 1. Versajet, 2. <b>guarded</b> <b>knife,</b> 3. combination of the Versajet and a <b>guarded</b> <b>knife</b> 4. conservative with silver sulfadiazine/ceriumnitrate. Subsequently patients were divided into age-related groups. The primary outcome measure was scar quality, expressed in OSAS total scores, OSAS general impression scores and percentage of hypertrophy. Scar quality was assessed both ‘in vivo’ (clinical) and from photographs at 6, 12 and 24 months or more post-burn. In total, 186 patients were eligible for participation in the study. Finally, 114 patients could be included. In patients from five years and older, OSAS scores and percentages of hypertrophy were significantly lower (better) in patients treated with the Versajet compared to patients treated with a <b>guarded</b> <b>knife</b> at 12 and 24 months post-burn. Adding the Versajet to treatment with a <b>guarded</b> <b>knife</b> gave lower OSAS scores and percentages of hypertrophy only at 6 months post-burn. Patients treated with the Versajet did not have lower OSAS scores and percentages of hypertrophy than patients treated conservatively at both 6, 12 and 24 months post-burn. In patients from zero to four years old, treatment with the Versajet was only compared to conservative treatment, because of the small number of patients in the other treatment groups. No significant lower OSAS scores and percentages of hypertrophy were seen in patients treated with the Versajet. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of deep dermal burns with the Versajet Hydrosurgery System provides better scar outcomes compared to surgical treatment with a <b>guarded</b> <b>knife</b> from one year post-burn in patients from five years and older. Adding the Versajet to treatment with a <b>guarded</b> <b>knife</b> results in betters scar outcomes only on the short time. Compared to conservative treatment with silver sulfadiazine/ceriumnitrate, treatment with the Versajet does not provide better scar outcomes, independent of age. Because of the small number of patients per treatment group per evaluation moment, results should be interpreted with caution and only tentative conclusions can be drawn. ...|$|R
50|$|Styles {{and types}} of blocking, as well as terminology, vary widely among the various martial arts. In Japanese martial arts such as Karate, these {{techniques}} {{are referred to as}} uke waza. Examples include age uke (rising block) and shuto uke (<b>knife</b> hand <b>guarding</b> block). In Korean martial arts such as Taekwondo, these techniques are referred to as makgi(막기), with some examples being chukyeo makgi (rising block) and sonkal daebi makgi (knifehand guarding block). Some martial arts, such as Capoeira, reject blocking techniques completely as they consider them too inefficient. In Capoeira, they use evasion instead of blocking.|$|R

40|$|The present article {{describes}} {{materials from the}} ritual site of Shaitanskoye Ozero II, Sverdlovsk Oblast. Few excavations carried out at the site measuring less than 240 sq. m in size, yielded more than 160 bronze artifacts: utensils, weapons, rolled copper ornaments, and abundant smelting and casting waste. Apart from Seima-Turbino (celts and laminar knives) and Eurasian types (daggers with cast hilts, truncated <b>knives</b> with <b>guards,</b> fluted bracelets and rings), several metal artifacts were revealed manufactured {{in the style of}} the Samus-Kizhirovo tradition. Bronze artifacts, stone knives and scrapers, and numerous arrowheads are accompanied by ceramics of the Koptyaki type. Metals use mainly a copper-tin alloy. This assemblage is shown to be relevant to the local tradition of metalworking, which, in this particular region, was comparatively ancient having been left uninterrupted by the rapid migrations of the Seima-Turbino people. In addition, the assemblage indicates the sources from which post-Seima artifacts reached the Alakul people. These artifacts may also have been linked with a large metalworking center located in the Middle Urals. Este artículo describe los materiales del sitio ritual de Shaitanskoye Ozero II, Provincia de Sverdlovsk. Las reducidas excavaciones emprendidas en el lugar con superficie inferior a los 240 m 2 han entregado más de 160 objetos de bronce: utensilios, armas, adornos en espiral de cobre y abundantes residuos de la fusión y el trabajo del metal. Además de tipos Seima-Turbino (hachas tubulares y cuchillos planos) y Euroasiáticos (puñales de mango fundido, cuchillos con empuñadura de lengüeta, brazaletes y anillos acanalados), varios artefactos metálicos resultaron manufacturados según el estilo de la tradición Samus-Kizhirovo. Los artefactos de bronce, los líticos (cuchillos, raspadores y numerosas puntas de flecha) están acompañados por cerámicos de tipo Koptyaki. El metal es generalmente una aleación de cobre y estaño. Este conjunto se considera relevante en la tradición local de trabajo del metal que, en esta región particular, era comparativamente antigua y quedó interrumpida por las rápidas migraciones de la gente Seima- Turbino. Además, el conjunto muestra las fuentes a partir de las cuales los artefactos post-Seima llegaron a la gente. Tales artefactos pueden relacionarse también con un gran centro de trabajo del metal localizado en los Urales centrales...|$|R
6000|$|In {{spite of}} this discouragement my brother was quite {{determined}} to learn the art of defending himself with a knife, and he would often {{go out into the}} plantation and practise for an hour with a tree for an opponent, and try to capture Jack's unpremeditated art of darting hither and thither about his enemy and making his deadly strokes. But as the tree stood still and had no knife to oppose him, it was unsatisfactory, and one day he proposed to me and my younger brother to have a fight with knives, just to find out if he was making any progress. He took us out {{to the far end of}} the plantation, where no one would see us, and produced three very big knives, with blades like butchers' knives, and asked us to attack him with all our might and try our best to wound him, while he would act solely on the defensive. At first we declined, and reminded him that he had punished us terribly with gloves and foils and singlestick, and that it would be even worse with knives-he would cut us in pieces! No, he said, he would not dream of hurting us: it would be absolutely safe for us, and for him too, as he didn't for a moment believe that we could touch him with our weapons, no matter how hard we tried. And at last we were persuaded, and taking off our jackets and wrapping them, gaucho- fashion, on our left arms as a protection, we attacked him with the big knives, and getting excited we slashed and lunged at him with all our power, while he danced and jumped and flew about a la Jack the Killer, using his <b>knife</b> only to <b>guard</b> himself and to try and knock ours out of our hands; but in one such attempt at disarming me his weapon went too far and wounded my right arm about three inches below the shoulder. The blood rushed out and dyed my sleeve red, and the fight came to an end. He was greatly distressed, and' running off to the house, quickly returned with a jug of water, sponge, towel, and linen to bind the wounded arm. It was a deep long cut, and the scar has remained to this day, so that I can never wash in the morning without seeing it and remembering that old fight with knives. Eventually he succeeded in stopping the flow of blood, and binding my arm tightly round; and then he made the desponding remark, [...] "Of course they will have to know all about it now." ...|$|R
