40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{understand}} the characteristics of fire whirls in the <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> with corner gap, large eddy simulations (LES) of thermal flow field in a 9 -meter-high <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> were employed. In the <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft,</b> the conrner gap is 0. 3 m and 0. 7 m in width, and the inclination angle is 5 °, 30 °, 45 °, 50 ° and 55 ° from the vertical orientation axes respectively. It is found that a whirling flow field could be formed under proper inclination angles and corner gap width. Rotational axis of fire whirls in the <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> would have same inclination angles with the shaft. Similar to the case of fire whirls in a vertical shaft, the width of corner gap of <b>inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> also influences the whirling motion of the flame. In this paper, for the same fire and inclination angle, the 0. 3 -meter-wide corner gap is easier to form stable fire whirls than the 0. 7 -meter-wide corner gap. By comparison with buoyancy, the slightly greater Coriolis force was found above a height 3 m for inclined fire whirls when the width of croner gap is 0. 3 m, however, the Coriolis force acts only on {{the lower part of the}} shaft when the width of croner gap is 0. 7 m...|$|R

40|$|A deposit to be mined by {{underground}} {{methods can}} be accessed {{by a number of}} methods: • Adit • Decline or ramp • <b>Inclined</b> <b>shaft</b> • Vertical shaft. Adits are an economical approach when the orebody is above the general floor elevation i. e. suitable in hilly or mountainous terrain. <b>Incline</b> <b>shafts</b> are limited to relatively shallow deposits, and because they are developed on an incline, development lengths for a given depth are the three to five times longer than for a vertical shaft. Vertical shafts are the preferred method for deposits deeper than 300 m but the development rate is slow and construction costs are very high. Declines or ramps offer early access to shallow deposits, which develops the ore body expediently, but are generally developed at a gradient of approximately 12 per cent. Decline haulages have become an attractive alternative to shaft hoisting, and over recent years the role of decline access has become more widespread throughout South Africa. Traditionally, South Africa has enjoyed the use of shaft systems, largely due to the large knowledge base of mining the Witwatersrand Basin, where vertical and <b>inclined</b> <b>shafts</b> were the norm. South Africa has also had the advantage of cheap electricity, giving shafts a definite economic advantage. However, in recent years the national power utility ESKOM has undergone an expansion programme that has led to tariff increases of nearly 100 % over a three-year period. Based on the changes in electricity tariffs and technological improvements to underground haulage trucks, the economic inputs to access development have changed. This paper reviews mine access for shallow deposits as currently applied in South Africa. Based on current economic inputs, the paper investigates at what point a vertical shaft would be more economical than a decline system utilizing typical South African mining equipment...|$|R

50|$|To {{support the}} {{required}} {{economies of scale}} for Coal-to-Liquids (CTL) process to be economical and competitive with crude oil, all stages of the operations, from coal mining to the Fischer-Tropsch process and product work up must be run with great efficiency. Due {{to the complexity of}} the Lurgi gasifers used the quality of the coal was paramount. The initial annual output from the Sigma underground mine in Sasolburg was 2 million tons. Annual coal production from this mine peaked in 1991 at 7.4 million tons. Today the majority of the gasifers in Sasolburg have been replaced with autothermal reformers that feed natural gas piped from Mozambique. Natural gas generates approximately 40 - 60% less carbon dioxide for the same energy produced as coal and is thus significantly more environmentally friendly. Gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology converts natural gas, predominately methane to liquid fuels.Today Sasol mines more than 40 million tons (Mt) of saleable coal a year, mostly gasification feed-stock for Sasol Synfuels in Secunda. Sasol Mining also exports some 2.8 Mt of coal a year. This amounts to approximately 22% of all the coal mined in South Africa. Underground mining operations continue in the Secunda area (Bosjesspruit, Brandspruit, Middelbult, Syferfontein and Twistdraai collieries) and Sigma: Mooikraal colliery near Sasolburg. As some of these mines are nearing the end of their useful life, a R14bn mine replacement program has been undertaken. The first of the new mines is the R3.4bn Thubelisha shaft which will eventually comprise an operation delivering more than eight million tons per annum (mtpa) of coal over 25 years. The Impumelelo mine, which will replace the Brandspruit operation, is set for first production in 2015. It will be ramped up to produce 8.5 mtpa, and can later be upgraded to supplying some 10.5 mtpa. This coal will be used exclusively by the Sasol Synfuels plant.An underground extension of the Middelbult mine is also on the cards, with the main shaft and <b>incline</b> <b>shaft</b> being replaced by the Shondoni shaft.

Bosjesspruit is penalised with more than nine million rands per year for fine coal that exceeds the set limits. Compliance to quality is the main reason. The cost is directly deducted from the profit. The quality of coal is of importance for the effectiveness of the gasifying process. A feasibility study has indicated that this study is viable. Various factors in the process were studied to identify the system deviations such as: coal bunkers, section and main conveyor belts, geology, production section activities and coal production equipment. A literature study was done and time was spent to become conversant with the coal transport system. The process is described from where the coal is mined, through the handling action up to where it is fed into the Sasol plant gasifiers. Several coal samples of the identified bottleneck areas were taken and analysed. The four main areas that were studied are: Loading actions at East 700 bunker. <b>Incline</b> <b>shaft</b> transfer chute. The horizontal bunker on surface. The South section conveyor chutes. The free-flow technology was researched and developed for an acceptable chute design. The design is now computerised and in use at Sasol Collieries.

A detailed cost analysis was done to determine the expenditures such as: Penalties for fine coal. The cost of adaptability and redesign. - Forecast cost savings after the redesigns are implemented. - Cost to produce coal as well as the income for Bosjesspruit.
