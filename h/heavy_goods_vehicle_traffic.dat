50|$|Each tube {{of the old}} tunnel {{was only}} wide enough to {{accommodate}} two lanes of traffic (with no hard shoulder). As traffic volumes rose, the tunnel became a bottleneck, especially for <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Traffic</b> jams were not so much caused by the restriction to two lanes as the steep approach to the tunnel. Vehicles approaching from the north had to overcome a 6 per cent ascent. Lorries slowed significantly before reaching the tunnel causing long tailbacks.|$|R

40|$|Delay is an {{important}} factor in the optimization of traffic signals and the determination of the level of service of a signalized intersection. Various models have been developed to estimate delay to traffic at signalized intersections. All the models are based on homogeneous traffic conditions; these models may not estimate the delays satisfactorily under heterogeneous traffic conditions. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the applicability of Signalized Intersection Design Aid (SIDRA) Software which is widely used for estimating delay at signalized intersections in Malaysia. This is because SIDRA considers only two main types of vehicles, i. e. passenger car and <b>heavy</b> <b>good</b> <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Traffic</b> control delays for a range of traffic volumes and compositions were collected at a selected signalized intersection. The associated traffic volumes were used to evaluate the delay estimated by SIDRA software were compared with the corresponding delays measured at selected sites. The results show that the delay estimated by SIDRA software is higher than the observed delay. This implies that the analysis of delay for heterogeneous traffic cannot be based on existing homogeneous traffic delay model...|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the decking was {{strengthened}} {{by adding a}} reinforced concrete slab. In 1990, tests showed the bridge was too weak for many <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and <b>traffic</b> was limited to a 7.5 ton maximum. This was increased to 17 tons after the bridge had been strengthened in 1992. The secondary members needed strengthening and this was effected by enhancing the shear strength of the transverse cross beams by bonding steel plates to the web of the cross beams. The longitudinal cross-bracing was {{strengthened by}} using angle splints and {{the space between the}} splints and the cross-bracing was grouted. Additional transverse bracing was supplied by reinforcing the central spine of the arch, with one end bolted to steel sleeves, and the other end bolted to the cross beams {{at the top of the}} arch.|$|R
40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{overtaking}} ban is {{a traffic}} technique action {{used in many}} European countries {{in order to satisfy}} safety, capacity and efficiency requirements on the motorway network. In Hungary, a permanent ban is in effect, which does not take into consideration the current traffic conditions and traffic flow. This kind of restriction impedes the circulation of <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> on low <b>traffic</b> sections that increases the costs of transport. The possibility of introducing a dynamic overtaking ban that reduces the unnecessary use of the restriction both in time and in space have been examined, providing optimum solution for vehicle and truck drivers...|$|R
50|$|The B5470 {{is one of}} {{only two}} routes {{entering}} Macclesfield from the east. As well as being used as a main commuter route from the towns of northwest Derbyshire it also carries a high number of <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> and tourist <b>traffic</b> into the Peak District National Park, the last including cyclists and walkers. The road also forms part of the well-known 'Cat And Fiddle - Long Hill - Highwayman’ triangle, which is particularly attractive to motorcyclists because of the frequency and severity of the bends. Given this mix of usage, the number and sharpness of the bends {{and the fact that it}} is not uncommon to encounter straying livestock on the road it is necessary to employ a great deal of caution. Severe winter weather can also make the road extremely hazardous.|$|R
40|$|Lane {{utilization}} represents how {{the rate}} of traffic flow is distributed among the available number of lanes in a given section. This utilization or split is affected by several factors including traffic flow rates {{as well as the}} presence and amount of <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> within the <b>traffic.</b> The importance of studying lane utilization {{comes from the fact that}} it is one of the input parameters for any traffic micro-simulation models which are increasingly being used in order to assess and suggest solutions for traffic problems. This paper uses two sources of data to model lane utilization including "Motorway Incident detection and Automatic Signaling" MIDAS data and individual vehicles raw data. The latter source of data is specifically used to model how <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> (HGVs) are distributed between motorway lanes as flow increases since MIDAS data does not specify the proportions of HGVs by lanes. It is found that the developed models could represent real data in a more efficient way than other previous models. The development of lane utilization models for HGV traffic will help in providing more realistic predictions of traffic behavior when represented by micro-simulation models and in the assessment of such commercial vehicles using the lanes when it comes to pavement design...|$|R
40|$|Motorways {{are often}} seen as {{intrusive}} to both landscape and soundscape, and recent studies on multisensory perception suggest that an integrated assessment of the environmental impacts is necessary. This paper investigates the effects of traffic condition, distance to road and background landscape on the perceived integrated impact of noise and visual intrusion of motorways, and explores if noise exposure {{can be a powerful}} indicator for the perceived integrated impact. Six traffic conditions, consisting of three levels of noise emission × two levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>good</b> <b>vehicle</b> percentage in <b>traffic</b> composition, two types of background landscape and three distances to road, were designed as experimental scenarios, and created using computer visualisation and edited audio recordings. A laboratory experiment was carried out to obtain ratings of perceived environmental quality of each experimental scenario. The results show that traffic volume as expressed by noise emission level strongly influenced the perceived integrated impact, whereas traffic composition did not make noticeable differences. Distance to road was the second most influential factor, followed by background landscape. A regression model using noise level at receiver position and type of background landscape as independent variables was developed and can explain {{about a quarter of the}} variation in the perceived integrated impact...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of a {{theoretical}} and experimental study aimed at a better characterisation of the effect of traffic induced vibrations on monumental buildings. The theoretical analysis was based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM), which allows the effect of a concentrated load (Green’s solution) on the stress-strain behaviour of an elastic ground to be studied. The propagation of the “traffic induced vibration” phenomenon has been characterised, after schematising the road vehicle as a 2 degree of freedom system. The method has been evaluated after varying/modifying the structure of the road pavement and the properties of the medium in which the vibration transmission happens. The theoretical model has then been calibrated on the basis of deflectometric measures on the road pavement and accelerometric tests on buildings. Several surveys have been carried out along the Brenta Riviera, in Venice Province (Italy). Beside the waterway, many monumental sixteenth/eighteenth-century buildings (Ville Venete: historical country houses of the Veneto Region) are flanked by a major road (“Padana superiore” National Road no. 11), with high volumes of traffic and significant flows of <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Because of <b>traffic</b> induced vibrations, the buildings show degradations and cracks. The research intended to quantify the impact of traffic on the historical buildings in order to propose road design and construction solutions useful to guarantee the durability of monumental edifices...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} driver’s {{car following}} headway on multilane highways. The {{aim of this}} study is to analyse the driver’s car following headway along multilane highway at four selected locations. The objectives of this study were to determine car headway at Jalan Batu Pahat – Ayer Hitam multilane highway and to develop linear regression models to present the relationships between headway and speed. Videotaping method was used in field data collection during peak hours. Data were extracted from recorded video by using the image processing technique software. The distance headways and associated vehicles speeds were classified into vehicle following category by vehicle type: car following car, car following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> and <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> following car categories. Linear regressions models were used to develop the relationships between headway and speed. Based on all headway distribution, it is found that patterns of the vehicle headways at four study locations were similar, which shown a significant number of the vehicles travel at headways less than 5 seconds. Furthermore, it can be concluded that many drivers tend to follow the vehicles ahead closely on multilane highways. The regression models were significantly reliable based on their R-square values which are ranging between 0. 80 and 0. 95. From the analysis, cars were found to maintain larger headways when following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> compare to when following other cars...|$|R

A survey was conducted among 24 municipalities to accomplish this study. According to the Regional Committees for Road Safety, twelve of these municipalities experienced (or are experiencing) problems with <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The remaining twelve municipalities were selected from the Statistics Netherlands' file of Dutch municipalities by means of a stratified sample. `Obvious' problems mentioned by the municipalities were: (1) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> within, and travelling through, the town centre; (2) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> on major roads inside built-up areas; and (3) inconveniences caused by these vehicles.

It is concluded that definitely more attention should be given to measures concerning <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The approach to problems involving these vehicles was based on the principles of the `sustainably safe' concept. Measures recommended for solving these problems were: realising major roads, and creating areas with low vehicle concentrations. (A...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{elasticity}} {{for petrol}} or diesel {{is an important}} policy parameter, both from energy security and global warming perspective. Despite an abundance of literature on petrol demand, there are few studies on diesel demand, and even fewer on demand by different vehicle types. This paper aims to model diesel demand for different freight duty vehicle types (e. g. <b>heavy</b> vs. light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> and rigid vs. articulated trucks) in the UK. We argue that the switch to diesel from petrol engines in the light vehicles sectors could have biased earlier petrol or diesel demand elasticities in Europe, and show that it was indeed {{the case for the}} light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> sector. Results show that both light and <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> have similar income elasticities, although within the heavy duty sector, articulated trucks are more elastic than rigid trucks. Overall, <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were responsive to fuel prices, but light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were not. Within the heavy duty sector, rigid trucks showed statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks did not respond to changes in fuel prices. Our results show that price-based policies to curb fuel consumption from the light or <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> are unlikely to be effective...|$|R
