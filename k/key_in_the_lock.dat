2500|$|McGee was {{returning}} to his boarding house on Sparks Street {{in the early morning}} hours of 7 April 1868. Smoking a cigar and fumbling with his <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> he was greeted as the owner Mary Ann Trotter opened the door for him. At that moment, a muzzle flash erupted, and as a [...]32 calibre bullet tore through McGee's neck and through his jaw, knocking his dentures out, the politician fell back into the street.|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed the}} room, fitted the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and turned it.|$|E
60|$|Patsy, with {{trembling}} fingers, put a <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> {{and after}} {{one or two}} efforts opened the door.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening at}} supper we {{discovered}} that Hans was missing; also that he had got possession of my keys and broken into a box containing liquor, for there it stood open <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cooking-hut with <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} door of the garage, leaving <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and they both passed inside. The place was gloomy and lit only by a single narrow window near the roof. The only vehicle it {{contained}} was the Professor's little car.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and we {{all stood}} quiet to listen.|$|R
60|$|They stood, for a moment, hand in hand. Then {{they heard}} the sound of a <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
60|$|Still {{receiving}} no reply, {{he started}} to put the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and found {{that he could not}} do so.|$|E
60|$|As {{the name}} passed her lips, she sprang {{to the door}} of the room, and turned the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{left the}} room, and Jeanne heard <b>the</b> <b>key</b> turn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{passed up}} the stair, {{unlocked}} the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord {{and removed the}} transverse bar. Then he tried <b>the</b> various <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} we heard {{approaching}} footsteps. Presently <b>the</b> <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and <b>the</b> door opened.|$|R
60|$|He {{blew out}} the candle, and turned the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> took it out, {{and put it in}} his pocket.|$|E
60|$|The general utility man {{tried to}} insert a <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> but failed {{on account of}} the key on the inside.|$|E
60|$|He fitted the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> {{and pushed}} the door open. Mr. Lynn took one step forward and drew back hurriedly.|$|E
60|$|The voice muttered and grunted {{behind the}} paling, and a <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> of <b>the</b> gate.|$|R
60|$|She {{picked up}} the tray, {{went to the door}} and passed out. Louise heard <b>the</b> <b>key</b> click <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mechanically, {{and without}} uttering a word, she hastened {{to do his}} bidding. As <b>the</b> <b>key</b> grated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> he rose.|$|R
60|$|He {{followed}} {{them from the}} room, stopped to quietly turn the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and then motioned them to precede him down the staircase.|$|E
60|$|Somebody was at {{the hallway}} door, trying to insert a <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> But the key would not go in, because of the key already there.|$|E
60|$|It was dark, {{before he}} was awoke by the turning of the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and two men entered, one of them bearing a horn lantern.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and Julius {{swung open}} the door, and searched inside. He was some {{time over the}} task.|$|R
60|$|We all trooped {{out into}} the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone, and I heard <b>the</b> <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> behind us.|$|R
60|$|A <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> <b>the</b> {{door was}} flung open, and the skipper, dazed and {{blinking}} with the sudden light, {{stumbled into the}} room.|$|R
60|$|Halidome {{turned the}} <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> {{and opened the}} door into his hall, where the firelight fell on the {{decanters}} and huge chairs drawn towards the blaze.|$|E
60|$|As {{the words}} passed his lips the clerk joined us, {{and at the}} same moment there was another and a last grating turn of the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
60|$|Richard {{repeated}} his kicking, and presently there were sounds of footsteps within, the turning of a <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> {{and then the}} door opened cautiously, revealing Mrs. Linyard.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{was that}} they heard {{footsteps}} outside their cell {{and a moment later}} a <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and <b>the</b> door opened. A warrior faced them.|$|R
60|$|His trained ear {{recognized}} {{the sound of}} cocking triggers. The next moment a heavy body bumped against {{the door of the}} cupboard and <b>the</b> <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
60|$|To this Mary only replied by {{a gesture}} of dismissal. The three gentlemen drew back, a <b>key</b> grated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and <b>the</b> mother and {{daughter}} were left alone.|$|R
60|$|She {{stepped into}} the darkened room, {{and closed the door}} behind her. Domiloff, who was looking white and scared, turned the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and faced her nervously.|$|E
60|$|He {{held the}} door for the lad to pass out. As they stood in the dimly lighted passage he closed it softly after them, and turned the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As {{she blew}} out the lights, stepped out on the walk, and turned the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> he said, [...] "Well, Nellie, you won't {{have to do that}} any more." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of {{approaching}} footsteps my good-humour was restored. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> rattled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and Master Ronald entered, {{closed the door behind}} him, and leaned his back to it.|$|R
60|$|Philip ran {{upstairs and}} {{knocked at the}} door. There was no reply. He called her name. <b>The</b> door was <b>locked,</b> and on bending down he found <b>the</b> <b>key</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and Mr. Travers, {{stepping}} forth, {{clapped his}} hand over his mouth and endeavoured to obey. Mrs. Waters, stepping back with the gun ready, scrutinized him closely.|$|R
