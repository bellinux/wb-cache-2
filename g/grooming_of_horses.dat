60|$|Captain Donnellan, whom we {{saw there}} on the {{occasion}} of our first morning visit, was now gone, and Owen Fitzgerald was all alone in his home. The captain had been an accustomed guest, spending perhaps half his time there during the hunting season; but since Mr. Prendergast had been at Hap House, he had been made to understand that the master would fain be alone. And since that day Owen had never hunted, nor been noticed in his old haunts, nor had been seen talking to his old friends. He had remained at home, sitting over the fire thinking, wandering up and down his own avenue, or standing about the stable, idly, almost unconscious <b>of</b> the <b>grooming</b> <b>of</b> his <b>horses.</b> Once and once only he had been mounted; and then as the dusk of evening was coming on he had trotted over quickly to Desmond Court, as though he had in hand some purport of great moment; but if so he changed his mind {{when he came to the}} gate, for he walked on slowly for three or four hundred yards beyond it, and then turning his horse's head, slowly made his way back past the gate, and then trotted quickly home to Hap House. In these moments of his life he must make or mar himself for life; 'twas so that he felt it; and how should he make himself, or how avoid the marring? That was the question which he now strove to answer.|$|R

50|$|King Bharthruhari (Serkulathur Sama) {{is married}} to 300 wives. He {{spends most of his}} time with the {{youngest}} of them and his most favourite, Pingala (B. Jayamma). The chief <b>groom</b> <b>of</b> the king's <b>horses,</b> Aswapaalan (N. S. Krishnan) resorts to thievery to satisfy the needs of his mistress, Sundari (T. A. Madhuram). The people who were robbed complain to the king, who decides to find the culprit and punish him. Through sheer happenstance, Aswapaalan meets Pingala and both start having an affair without the king's knowledge. Vikramadityan (G. Pattu Iyer), the king's brother, catches Aswapaalan one night and puts him in custody in Pingala's palace. To escape from the situation lest her affair with Aswapaalan is discovered, complains to Bharthruhari that Vikramadityan tried to seduce her, which Vikramadityan denies. The king immediately banishes Vikramadityan without looking into the matter properly. Later, the king realises that his younger brother was telling the truth when he sees Aswapaalan and Pingala together. Shocked and aggrieved, he gives up his throne, brings Vikramadityan back and crowns him as the new king. Bharthruhari then becomes a hermit and retires to the forest to do penance.|$|R
