40|$|Votes in an {{election}} are often <b>counted</b> by <b>machines.</b> Winners are legally determined by what a full hand count would show. Risk-limiting election audits can help validate correct election outcomes. Moreover, when hand-count winners differ from machine-count winners, regardless {{of the source of}} the differences, these audits have a guaranteed pre-specified chance of escalating to a full hand-count thereby correcting the election outcome. Most states that have election audits require each county to independently select a random set of precincts for audit. For contests that span multiple counties, this amounts to a stratified random sample of precincts. Ballots in each audited precinct are <b>counted</b> by hand <b>and</b> differences between the hand <b>count</b> <b>and</b> the <b>machine</b> <b>count</b> are recorded.

40|$|Ground {{vehicles}} {{equipped with}} monocular vision systems are a valuable source of high resolution image data for precision agriculture applications in orchards. This paper presents an image processing framework for fruit detection <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> using orchard image data. A general purpose image segmentation approach is used, including two feature learning algorithms; multi-scale Multi-Layered Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These networks were extended by including contextual information about how the image data was captured (metadata), which correlates {{with some of the}} appearance variations and/or class distributions observed in the data. The pixel-wise fruit segmentation output is processed using the Watershed Segmentation (WS) and Circular Hough Transform (CHT) algorithms to detect <b>and</b> <b>count</b> individual fruits. Experiments were conducted in a commercial apple orchard near Melbourne, Australia. The results show an improvement in fruit segmentation performance with the inclusion of metadata on the previously benchmarked MLP network. We extend this work with CNNs, bringing agrovision closer to the state-of-the-art in computer vision, where although metadata had negligible influence, the best pixel-wise F 1 -score of $ 0. 791 $ was achieved. The WS algorithm produced the best apple detection <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> results, with a detection F 1 -score of $ 0. 858 $. As a final step, image fruit counts were accumulated over multiple rows at the orchard and compared against the post-harvest fruit counts that were obtained from a grading <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>count</b> estimates using CNN and WS resulted in the best performance for this dataset, with a squared correlation coefficient of $r^ 2 = 0. 826 $.
