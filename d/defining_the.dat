5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
5|$|Between 1845 and 1847, Belgian-French {{composer}} César Franck {{wrote an}} orchestral piece based on Victor Hugo's poem Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne. The work exhibits {{characteristics of a}} symphonic poem, and some musicologists, such as Norman Demuth and Julien Tiersot, consider it {{the first of its}} genre, preceding Liszt's compositions. However, Franck did not publish or perform his piece; neither did he set about <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> genre. Liszt's determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre's inventor.|$|E

G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E
5|$|General vector spaces do {{not possess}} a {{multiplication}} between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field. Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E

5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E
