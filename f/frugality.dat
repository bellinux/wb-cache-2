5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion.

Fields' <b>frugality</b> also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{ran into}} trouble with Lawrence's harsh <b>frugality</b> while working on his {{cyclotron}} and was fired twice from the Radiation Laboratory. The first time was for losing a rubber seal in the 37-inch cyclotron which prevented its use in a demonstration to a potential donor. He was later rehired at Luis Alvarez's urging, but melted an expensive pair of pliers while welding, and was fired again. Though offered his job back, he decided instead to go to Princeton University to work with Henry DeWolf Smyth.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Holst {{wrote the}} music for an {{operetta}} {{in the style of}} Gilbert and Sullivan, Lansdown Castle, or The Sorcerer of Tewkesbury. The piece was performed at Cheltenham Corn Exchange in February 1893; it was well received and its success encouraged him to persevere with composing. He applied for a scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, but the composition scholarship for that year was won by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Holst was accepted as a non-scholarship student, and Adolph borrowed £100 to cover the first year's expenses. Holst left Cheltenham for London in May 1893. Money was tight, and partly from <b>frugality</b> and partly from his own inclination he became a vegetarian and a teetotaller. Two years later he was finally granted a scholarship, which slightly eased his financial difficulties, but he retained his austere personal regime.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of <b>frugality</b> upon her.

He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages <b>frugality,</b> technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E
5|$|With Indiana's rapid {{increase}} of population {{during the middle}} of the 19th century, the state's government increased in size, causing the previous capitol building to become crowded. In 1865, a state office building had to be constructed to house some of the burgeoning government, and the Supreme Court and several bureaus were relocated into the new building. When the statehouse was condemned in 1877, the state was without a real capitol building, and the administration of Governor James D. Williams proposed the construction of the current state capitol building. The plan was approved by the Indiana General Assembly during the legislative session of 1878. After the third state capitol building had been razed, the new building was constructed on the same site. Two million dollars (USD) were appropriated for construction of the new building, and it was completed in 1888. Governor Williams, who was famed for his <b>frugality,</b> was able to complete the project for $1.8 million and returned the extra $200,000 to the general fund.|$|E
5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his <b>frugality,</b> due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

25|$|Neo-Confucianism {{inspired}} new architectural paradigms.

25|$|The 1912 Oregon ballot for United State Senate was cluttered.

25|$|Despite the problems, {{this was}} a time of {{optimism}} for many. A baby boom followed the war, as young Dutch couples started planning their families. They had lived through the hardships of depression and the hell of war. They wanted to start fresh and live better lives without the poverty, starvation, terror, and extreme <b>frugality</b> they knew so well. They had little taste for a strictly imposed rule-oriented traditional system with its rigid hierarchies, sharp pillarized boundaries and strictly orthodox religious doctrines. They made a best seller out of the translation of The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care (1946), by American pediatrician Benjamin Spock. His vision of family life as companionate, permissive, enjoyable and even fun took hold, and seemed the best way to achieve family happiness in a dawning age of freedom and prosperity.|$|E
25|$|In 199 BC Cato {{was chosen}} aedile, {{and with his}} {{colleague}} Helvius, restored the Plebeian Games, and gave upon that occasion a banquet in honor of Jupiter. In 198 BC he was made praetor, and obtained Sardinia as his province, with the command of 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Here he took the earliest opportunity to demonstrate his main beliefs by practicing his strict public morality. He reduced official operating costs, walked his trips with a single assistant, and, by the studied lack of ceremony, placed his own <b>frugality</b> in striking contrast with the oppressive opulence of provincial magistrates. The rites of religion were celebrated with reasonable thrift, justice was administered with strict impartiality; usury was controlled with deep severity, and the usurers were banished. Sardinia had been for some time completely calmed, but according to Aurelius Victor, a revolt in the island was subdued by Cato during his Praetorship.|$|E
25|$|In Guangdong, the {{campaign}} severely upset the political ecosystem {{that had long}} been dominated by native Cantonese politicians. Wan Qingliang, the popular and relatively youthful party chief of Guangzhou known for his <b>frugality</b> and accessibility, was sacked {{in the third quarter}} of 2014, and was also replaced by an outsider, former Tianjin vice mayor Ren Xuefeng. The province's top political advisor, Zhu Mingguo, also became one of the few incumbent officials of full provincial rank to be investigated for corruption. Vice Governor Liu Zhigeng, another native Cantonese official who was once the party chief of Dongguan, and Zhuhai party chief Li Jia, who had spent his entire political career in Guangdong, were also sacked. The breaking down of local patronage networks had already begun before the 18th Party Congress, and continued with greater intensity following the Congress under newly anointed party chief Hu Chunhua. The party leadership team in Shenzhen, China's most successful Special Economic Zone, also underwent significant changes, with party chief Wang Rong moving to a provincial office; several of Wang's subordinates were investigated for corruption.|$|E
25|$|For the {{residents}} of Brussels, however, the priorities were completely different. A rapid reconstruction was vital to allow economic activities to resume and to prevent an exodus of the population. The city's authorities, who had few resources, {{did not have the}} means to finance grandiose proposals. No financial aid from Spain or the governor could be expected, as their resources were dedicated to the war effort. The solution thus involved <b>frugality</b> and effectiveness, based on tradition, and the re-use of materials and surviving foundations. The residents and the guilds did not look favourably on the imposition of a new, foreign, architectural style. Local architects and artisans, with their better understanding of locally available materials and needs, still made attractive buildings, although they bore no resemblance to the baroque style. The weakness of the central government and the governor's absence due to the war during the first stages of reconstruction, in addition to the strength of the local upper classes, resulted {{in the structure of the}} city being kept largely the same, a situation similar to that after the Great Fire of London in 1666.|$|E
500|$|Although {{these traits}} are shared among both living and extinct lemurs, they are {{uncommon}} among primates in general. [...] Two prevailing hypotheses to explain these unique adaptations are the energy <b>frugality</b> hypothesis by Patricia Wright (1999) and the evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis by Carel van Schaik and Peter M. Kappeler (1996). [...] The energy <b>frugality</b> hypothesis expanded on Alison Jolly's energy conservation hypotheses {{by claiming that}} most lemur traits not only help conserve energy, but also maximize the use of highly limited resources, enabling them to live in severely seasonal environments with low productivity. [...] The evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis postulated that living lemurs {{are in the process}} of evolving to fill open ecological niches left by the recently extinct subfossil lemurs. [...] For example, small nocturnal prosimians are typically nocturnal and monogamous, while the larger living lemurs are generally active both day and night (cathemeral) and live in small groups (gregarious). [...] Cathemerality and increased gregariousness might indicate that the larger living lemurs are evolving to fill the role of the giant lemurs, which were thought to be diurnal (day-living) and more monkey-like in behavior. [...] Since most giant subfossil lemurs have been shown to share many of the unique traits of their living counterparts, and not those of monkeys, Godfrey et al. (2003) argued that the energy <b>frugality</b> hypothesis seems to best explain both living and extinct lemur adaptations.|$|E
500|$|Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft {{contends that}} people should be judged on their merits rather than on their birthrights. As Wollstonecraft scholar Janet Todd writes, [...] "the vision of society {{revealed}} [...] A Vindication of the Rights of Men was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged." [...] Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, <b>frugality,</b> and morality, values she contrasts with the [...] "vices of the rich", such as [...] "insincerity" [...] and the [...] "want of natural affections". She endorses a commercial society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities. For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force. However, several years later, in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.|$|E
500|$|Kehoe had a {{reputation}} for <b>frugality,</b> and he was elected in 1924 as a trustee on the school board for three years and treasurer for one year. He argued endlessly for lower taxes, and later superintendent of the board M. W. Keys said that he [...] "fought the expenditure of money for the most necessary equipment." [...] He was considered extremely difficult to work with, often voting against the rest of the board and wanting his own way. He repeatedly accused Superintendent Emory Huyck of financial mismanagement. He argued with township financial authorities, trying to get the valuation of his property reduced, and claimed that he had paid too much for the farm. He also tried to get the mortgage taken off but was not successful. [...] In June 1926, he was notified that the mortgage company was going to foreclose on his property.|$|E
500|$|As in {{the earlier}} years, the cantata text {{is related to the}} gospel in the general way that the Christian should be content with his share of good fortune, without envy of others who may seem more fortunate. The title and the text show {{similarities}} to Picander's [...] (I am content with my position), published in 1728. It is unclear if both texts are by Picander, or if Picander based his on a former one, or if Picander's was already available {{at the time of the}} composition but was changed. As the Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann observes, the thoughts are in the spirit of the beginning Enlightenment, [...] "praise of <b>frugality,</b> of modesty with that which God has allocated to us, of satisfaction, of lack of envy towards others". The language is no longer the [...] "rhetorical pathos of baroque poetry", but [...] "radicality and artistry of the imagery. The language is simple and terse; it is rational rather than figurative." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of Wollstonecraft's early productions are about education; she assembled {{an anthology of}} literary extracts [...] "for the improvement of young women" [...] entitled The Female Reader and she translated two children's works, Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambon's Young Grandison and Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's Elements of Morality. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her conduct book Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) and her children's book Original Stories from Real Life (1788), Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos: self-discipline, honesty, <b>frugality,</b> and social contentment. Both books also {{emphasize the importance of}} teaching children to reason, revealing Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to the important seventeenth-century educational philosopher John Locke. However, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of sensibility popular {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century. Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation.|$|E
500|$|Shellenberger and {{his fellow}} {{bondholders}} {{had good reason to}} seek control of the railroad. After their failure to deliver control of the road to Langdon, he brought suit against them. In exchange for his dropping the suit, they agreed to lease the Altoona and Beech Creek to the Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad, a holding company formed by Langdon, on highly favorable terms. The new company was to operate the Altoona & Philipsburg Connecting, planning to convert to standard gauge and extend the two railroads to a junction at East <b>Frugality,</b> near Dougherty. The PJE would be extended further south through Ebensburg and then down to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Johnstown. During this period, the line was known as the [...] "Altoona Division" [...] of the PJE On December 17, 1898, Langdon chartered the Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal Railroad, which would extend the Altoona and Beech Creek from Juniata to a new terminal at 9th Street and 15th Avenue in Altoona. However, he was unable to carry out these plans, and his lease was invalidated on March 27, 1900. Through appeals and legal maneuvers, Langdon was able to hold out until December 27, 1901, when the Sheriff of Blair County ejected the PJE employees and returned the Altoona and Beech Creek to its stockholders. The Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal was dissolved in 1905–6.|$|E
500|$|The Danish {{sociologist}} Benedikte Brincker {{observes that}} {{the perception of}} Nielsen and his music in his home country is rather different from his international appreciation. His interest and background in folk music had special resonance for Danes, and this was intensified during the nationalistic movements of the 1930s and during World War II, when singing was an important basis for the Danes to distinguish themselves from their German enemies. Nielsen's songs retain an important place in Danish culture and education. The musicologist Niels Krabbe describes the popular image of Nielsen in Denmark as being like [...] "the ugly duckling syndrome" [...] – {{a reference to the}} tale of the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen – [...] whereby [...] "a poor boy... passing through adversity and <b>frugality...</b> marches into Copenhagen and... comes to conquer the position as the uncrowned King". Thus while outside Denmark Nielsen is largely thought of as the composer of orchestral music and the opera Maskarade, in his own country he is more of a national symbol. These two sides were officially brought together in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a list of the twelve greatest Danish musical works, which included three by Nielsen – Maskarade, the Fourth Symphony, and a pair of his Danish songs. Krabbe asks the rhetorical question: [...] "Can 'the national' in Nielsen be demonstrated in the music in the form of particular themes, harmonies, sounds, forms, etc., or is it a pure construct of reception history?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Quakers {{emigrated to}} the New World from the {{northern}} English Midlands during the 17th century, and eventually settled primarily in the Delaware Valley. They were similar to the Puritans in the strictness that they applied to everyday life, though their religious teachings were far different. Their food was plain and simple. Excessive consumption was discouraged and failure to eat or drink moderately was punished with public acts of criticism. William Penn was the founder of Pennsylvania and an important figure {{in the development of}} the Quaker movement, and he encouraged <b>frugality</b> in his followers with advice such as, [...] "If thou rise with an appetite thou are sure never to sit down without one". The Quakers, like the Puritans, encountered an abundance of food in the New World: forests rich with game and berries, streams teeming with fish, and abundant flocks of birds. Still the asceticism persevered. Many Quakers avoided eating butter as a form of self-mortification, and the most eccentric followers would avoid tea and meat. The idealist and pacifist ideas of the Quakers also encouraged many to boycott products that were considered to be tainted by sin. This included butter, due to its role in raising war taxes, and coffee, because it was produced by slave labor. Eating habits were more egalitarian than those of either the Puritans or the Virginian Anglicans. At meals, entire households would dine at the same table, including children and servants.|$|E
500|$|His son, Peter O'Malley, {{described}} his management style as follows: [...] "As president, {{the way he}} ran the business, he believed in stability and very little turnover. It was {{the strength of the}} organization. The management team worked as well as the team on the field." [...] This is evidenced in many ways, including the long tenure of both Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda as Dodgers managers and Vin Scully, the broadcast voice of the Dodgers. Alston was repeatedly rehired to consecutive one-year contracts from 1954–1976 until he retired. Then Lasorda, who had been a long-time employee in as a coach and minor league baseball manager, took over as manager for another 20 years. Scully has been the voice of the Dodgers since the O'Malley family acquired the team. In addition, the infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, shortstop Bill Russell and third baseman Ron Cey was the longest-running intact infield in major league history. Furthermore, O'Malley is said to have kept Bowie Kuhn in office as the Commissioner of Baseball until O'Malley's death. [...] O'Malley rewarded loyal employee Bavasi by allowing the San Diego Padres franchise to establish an expansion team with Bavasi as President in Southern California. Alston said O'Malley convinced him that when he signed his first one-year contract it could be a lifetime job by pointing out that [...] "signing one-year contracts can mean a lifetime job, if you keep signing enough of them." [...] Although O'Malley had good stories of loyalty with some employees, there were several stories of O'Malley's <b>frugality.</b>|$|E
