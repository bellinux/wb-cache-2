Fox concludes that [...] "quite simply, the contention is nonsense. A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, but it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide". Fox in his turn has been criticized for selectively using Indian oral tradition when it suits him, but discarding it as nonsense when he finds it disagreeable.|$|E

Ry Cooder's guitar parts are handled by Manuel Galbán, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer's first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as [...] "something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they've never really had one defining front person", adding, [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to expect from what is more of a brand than a band." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New Zealand {{branch of}} human rights group Amnesty International {{reported}} that soldiers in the archipelago state of Fiji, under military rule since 2006, were increasingly resulting to beatings, abuse, and even torture to enforce order, allegedly detaining and abusing opposition members, unionists, and youth activists for planning a protest against the junta in late February. Amnesty CEO Patrick Holmes said he believed the more violent tactics are intended to thwart a Middle East-inspired uprising against the junta in Fiji. A Fiji pro-democracy group based in Sydney called for an international response to the alleged crackdown, comparing the situation in Fiji {{to the situation in}} Libya. On 7 March, The Australian reported that a former government minister declared his intent to seek asylum in Australia, claiming Fiji soldiers had detained and tortured him. The Fiji military has denied this, with a highly placed officer telling Radio Australia that soldiers only use [...] "some minimal force" [...] when making arrests and denying any knowledge of either planned protests or martial action in response {{on the part of the}} military or police. One expert on Fiji politics told Radio New Zealand that he believed unrest within the military was a greater threat to Commodore Frank Bainimarama's rule than popular protests like those in Tunisia and Egypt, but said it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the junta's thinking was. New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said his government was seeking more information on the alleged beatings, echoing concerns expressed by the Australian government. The Fiji Human Rights Commission said that while it hasn't received any recent complaints directly, it is monitoring the situation and trying to check up on published allegations.|$|E

When they returned home and were interviewed by Channel 2, there was a wave of reaction from others with siblings with Down Syndrome. “We got a lot of reactions,” said Cassel. “And we understood that we’d done something very positive that awakened all kinds of impressions.” When Itamar Peleg, the owner of Travelog, a tour company specializing in unusual journeys got in touch with Cassel, the two began planning a trip for 22 siblings, 11 pairs.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of studies using microlevel data to analyse the aid-conflict nexus at local level, however most of these studies focus on how conflict dynamics are influenced by aid allocations whereas there is relatively little analysis on how conflict affects subnational aid allocations. Estimating the effect of conflict on aid can be difficult given possible reverse causality, therefore this study exploits an exogenous driven shock in conflict intensity in Uganda to estimate the effect of aid allocations at subnational level. Using district level data for Uganda between 2002 - 2010, and information on both foreign aid commitments and disbursements, the results show that conflict is negatively related to aid allocations: Conflict-struck regions see both lower commitment and disbursement levels in the wake of conflict. Although the sudden outburst of violence in Uganda can help identifying the effect of conflict on aid allocations, one caveat of this approach is that it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> extent the results generalise...|$|R
