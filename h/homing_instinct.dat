60|$|His pony of its {{own accord}} turned, and by a {{circuitous}} route headed at last for the home canon as if it knew its master's wavering mind. Cavanagh observed what he was doing, but his lax hand did not intervene. Helpless to make the decision himself, he welcomed the intervention of the <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> of his horse.

60|$|He {{came back}} by Wells Fargo Express, {{was tied up}} three days, and was loosed on the fourth and lost. This time he gained {{southern}} Oregon before he was caught and returned.

The Braces potentate was at present passing, in {{excellent}} health, through the Indian summer of life. He was, moreover, as has been stated, by birth and residence a Pittsburgh man. And the tendency of middle-aged Pittsburgh millionaires to marry chorus-girls is notoriously like the <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> of pigeons.

60|$|Ghak didn't {{know what}} Perry meant by heavenly bodies or a compass, but he assured {{us that you}} might {{blindfold}} any man of Pellucidar and carry him to the farthermost corner of the world, yet {{he would be able}} to come directly to his own home again by the shortest route. He seemed surprised to think that we found anything wonderful in it. Perry said it must be some sort of <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> such as is possessed by certain breeds of earthly pigeons. I didn't know, of course, but it gave me an idea.|$|E
60|$|And {{the idea}} had gone glimmering. I did not know, and he had forgotten. But the next morning it awoke in him again. Perhaps it was the <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> in him asserting itself that made the idea persist. At any rate it was there, and clearer than before. He led {{me down to the}} water, where a log had {{grounded}} in an eddy. I thought he was minded to play, as we had played in the mouth of the slough. Nor did I change my mind as I watched him tow up a second log from farther down the shore.|$|E

America's our model {{and we have no}} use for English patronage, but every now and then the pull comes and we long to go back, though we wouldn't like to stop there. It's illogical, but if there was trouble in Europe and the Old Country needed help, we'd all go across." ...|$|E
60|$|The Frenchman looked {{round at}} the brown sun-scorched hills, with the dusty empty road showing {{here and there}} in the middle {{distance}} and other brown sun-scorched hills rounding off the scene; he looked at the lizards on the verandah walls, at the jars for keeping the water cool, at the numberless little insect-bored holes in the furniture, at the heat-drawn lines on his hostess's comely face. Notwithstanding his present wanderings he had a Frenchman's strong <b>homing</b> <b>instinct,</b> and he marvelled to hear this lady, who should have been a lively and popular figure in the social circle of some English county town, talking serenely of the ways of humped cattle and native servants.|$|E
60|$|Bertie Steffink, {{nephew of}} the {{aforementioned}} Luke, had early in life adopted the profession of ne’er-do-weel; {{his father had been}} something of the kind before him. At the age of eighteen Bertie had commenced that round of visits to our Colonial possessions, so seemly and desirable {{in the case of a}} Prince of the Blood, so suggestive of insincerity in a young man of the middle-class. He had gone to grow tea in Ceylon and fruit in British Columbia, and to help sheep to grow wool in Australia. At the age of twenty he had just returned from some similar errand in Canada, from which it may be gathered that the trial he gave to these various experiments was of the summary drum-head nature. Luke Steffink, who fulfilled the troubled role of guardian and deputy-parent to Bertie, deplored the persistent manifestation of the <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> on his nephew’s part, and his solemn thanks earlier in the day for the blessing of reporting a united family had no reference to Bertie’s return.|$|E

There was Williams, for example, the Dolgelly man who killed a game-keeper at Petworth in a {{poaching}} affray; he was taken on Cader Idris, skulking among rocks, a week later. Then there was that unhappy young fellow, Mackinnon, who shot his sweetheart at Leicester; he made, straight as the crow flies, for {{his home in the}} Isle of Skye, and there drowned himself in familiar waters. Lindner, the Tyrolese, again, who stabbed the American swindler at Monte Carlo, was tracked after a few days to his native place, St. Valentin, in the Zillerthal. It is always so. Mountaineers in distress fly to their mountains. It is a part of their nostalgia. I know it from within, too: if I were in poor Hugo LeGeyt's place, what do you think I would do? Why, hide myself at once in the greenest recesses of our Carnarvonshire mountains." ...|$|E

He got through {{a vast amount of}} work, only soother of the nerves he knew. A cablegram came {{while he was in the}} office with details from the agent in Buenos Aires, and the name and address of a stewardess who would be prepared to swear to what was necessary. It was a timely spur to Soames, with his rooted distaste for the washing of dirty linen in public. And when he set forth by Underground to Victoria Station he received a fresh impetus towards the renewal of his married life from the account in his evening paper of a fashionable divorce suit. The <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> of all true Forsytes in anxiety and trouble, the corporate tendency which kept them strong and solid, made him choose to dine at Park Lane. He neither could nor would breath a word to his people of his intention--too reticent and proud--but the thought that at least they would be glad if they knew, and wish him luck, was heartening.|$|E
60|$|One word as to {{the fate}} of the London pterodactyl. Nothing can be said to be certain upon this point. There is the {{evidence}} of two frightened women that it perched upon the roof of the Queen's Hall and remained there like a diabolical statue for some hours. The next day it came out in the evening papers that Private Miles, of the Coldstream Guards, on duty outside Marlborough House, had deserted his post without leave, and was therefore courtmartialed. Private Miles' account, that he dropped his rifle and took to his heels down the Mall because on looking up he had suddenly seen the devil between him and the moon, was not accepted by the Court, and yet it may have a direct bearing upon the point at issue. The only other evidence which I can adduce is from the log of the SS. Friesland, a Dutch-American liner, which asserts that at nine next morning, Start Point being at the time ten miles upon their starboard quarter, they were passed by something between a flying goat and a monstrous bat, which was heading at a prodigious pace south and west. If its <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> led it upon the right line, {{there can be no doubt}} that somewhere out in the wastes of the Atlantic the last European pterodactyl found its end.|$|E

50|$|Most bat {{species have}} a good homing ability, the {{mechanisms}} of which are still unknown. Unusually for bats, the cave myotis does not {{have a good}} <b>homing</b> <b>instinct.</b> Speculation is that bat species' homing ability relies heavily on olfactory sense and vision.|$|E
50|$|Letting skunks outside by {{themselves}} is risky since, like ferrets, they lack a <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> and can easily get lost. Descented skunks lack their most powerful defense against predators such as coyotes and foxes. Their nearsightedness also makes them susceptible to becoming roadkill.|$|E
50|$|A {{major project}} was the island-wide survey of {{horseshoe}} crabs in 2009. Under {{the leadership of}} Dr. Hsu Chia Chi, it was to establish {{the population of the}} two local species, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda and Tachypleus gigas. A year later the researchers started using electronic tagging equipment to study their movements, <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> and hopefully locate their spawning sites.|$|E
50|$|Hedleyella falconeri is nocturnal. It {{spends the}} day {{stationary}} and may hide itself under a rotting log or similar location but often {{remains in the}} open although it is usually at least partially covered in leaf litter. On most nights it starts to move around and feed, favouring wet nights. In a study, the average distance travelled by a snail in any night on which it moved was 8.7 m. It appeared to wander at random and {{did not seem to}} have a <b>homing</b> <b>instinct.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Indian Gola {{is a small}} pigeon {{that looks}} similar to dragoon pigeons. This pigeon has red eyes, and is a bird of speed and endurance. They have an average speed of 65-70 mph, and can fly more than 10-11 hours without stopping. It is a homing pigeon with a very good <b>homing</b> <b>instinct,</b> but cannot be used for racing because the adults cannot be trained. These pigeons always move freely; {{the only way to}} train them is by {{bringing}} them when they are 10-12 days old, and feeding them by hand. Once they grow up and know their loft properly, they will try their level-best to return to their loft.|$|E
50|$|The {{weakened}} Badger takes charge, though Tawny Owl remains irritable, {{believing he}} and Badger should be joint leaders. Toad then becomes disorientated (due to his <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> drawing {{him back to}} Farthing Wood), whilst the mice and voles leave when several give birth. This swiftly ends in tragedy {{as they are in}} the territory of a red-backed shrike, or 'butcher bird' (which in fact became extinct within the UK only a few years after the book was published), who kills the babies. Feeling guilty over not heeding Badger (he had wanted to keep the party as united as possible), the mice and voles rejoin. Badger also blames himself, but becomes more assertive after the crisis, ending the dissent.|$|E
50|$|On the moon's surface {{they find}} no Borg, only the {{wreckage}} of an old Federation ship. It shows signs of Borg invasion and partial assimilation. Seven feels that the ship is familiar to her; very familiar. There {{is a bit of}} Borg machinery still active on board, which is what caused Seven's <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> to reactivate. As she looks around the ship, the memories hit her hard. This is her parents' ship, the Raven. It was taken by the Borg almost twenty years ago, when Seven was a little girl named Annika Hansen. She and her parents were assimilated on this very spot. Suddenly, the B'omar attack though the crew is able to escape and Voyager disables the B'omar ships before fleeing.|$|E
5000|$|Arthur Davis Hasler (January 5, 1908 - March 23, 2001) was an {{ecologist}} who {{is credited}} with explaining the salmon's <b>homing</b> <b>instinct.</b> Hasler {{was a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The New York Times called him [...] "an internationally recognized authority on freshwater ecology". He served as President of The Ecological Society of America, which called him [...] "one of the leading figures in 20th century freshwater ecology". Hasler pioneered a research method based on manipulation of entire lake ecosystems. This method became an instrumental new tool for ecology. He published over 200 scientific papers, was an author or an editor of 7 books, and supervisor of 52 doctoral degrees.|$|E
50|$|Research {{was done}} on Pacific tree frogs to {{discover}} if they have homing instincts and what was their main source for knowing where their home was. To find the answer, these frogs were marked and moved 300 yards away from their pond. Several days later, the researchers did a recapture on the original pond in which 66.3% of the frogs were recaptured, indicating there was some source of <b>homing</b> <b>instinct.</b> This was made apparent again when 24 frogs were placed into a larger pond, and 20 of those frogs returned to their original pond. The frogs' movement patterns and olfactory, auditory, and kinesthetic senses could be explanations for the homing, but not a single factor was able to explain the results, indicating that these frogs might be using all {{or a combination of}} these factors for homing.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps the {{earliest}} patented mousetrap was a live capture device patented in 1870 by W K Bachman of South Carolina. [...] These traps {{have the advantage}} of allowing the mouse to be released into the wild, or the disadvantage of having to personally kill the captured animal if release is not desired. These traps need to be regularly checked (once a day at least) as captured mice can die slowly from stress or dehydration. Mice would need to be released some distance away, as mice have a strong <b>homing</b> <b>instinct.</b> Survival after release is not guaranteed, since house mice will tend to seek out human buildings, where they might encounter lethal mousetraps or may be eaten by predators. House mice tend to not survive away from human settlements in areas where other small mammals, such as wood mice, are present.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, as {{the animals}} cannot stop the humans, or suggest a {{long-term}} {{solution for the}} lack of water, they do not progress until Toad appears, having vanished almost a year before. He explains that he was captured by humans and taken far away. He eventually escaped and followed his <b>homing</b> <b>instinct</b> back to Farthing Wood. Near the beginning of his travels, he met a group of frogs whose pond was located in a nature reserve called White Deer Park. With no hope of surviving in the wood, all agree to set out for the reserve with Toad as their guide. Badger nominates Fox as leader, while the birds agree to act as scouts. The smaller animals are wary of travelling with their natural enemies, so Badger insists they all take the Oath of Mutual Protection, in which each animal resolves to put their natural differences and instincts aside to help each other. The animals arrange to meet the following midnight, and set off.|$|E
