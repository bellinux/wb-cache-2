5|$|Groups of players, {{large or}} small, are often {{required}} to complete objectives. In addition to forming teams and informal chat groups, joining a player organization <b>is</b> <b>encouraged.</b> These are, like guilds in similar games, officially recognized groups bound together for technical and social benefits. Organizations are able {{to build their own}} cities across the game world, control areas of land, run player markets, and access other special content.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Half of Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{residents}} work in {{the city}} where they live. Most residents drive cars, but 60% of the 160,000 people working downtown commute by means other than a single person per auto. Alternative transportation <b>is</b> <b>encouraged.</b> The Metropolitan Council's Metro Transit, which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program to allay fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they work late hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{appearances}} Raiden is a rookie agent who, {{as a result}} of training only in virtual reality, is inexperienced. However, he later reveals that he was feared as a child soldier—known as —who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past. This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he does not have free will. Raiden <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E

5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|Robert realizes his {{daughter}} Caroline {{is a drug}} addict and is caught between his demanding new position and difficult family life. On a visit to Mexico, he <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> by Salazar's successful efforts in hurting the Obregón brothers. When he returns to Ohio, Robert learns his efforts to see Caroline rehabilitated have failed. She has run away {{to the city of}} Cincinnati, and no one knows her exact location. She steals from her parents to procure money for drugs.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5000|$|Said finalists were {{subjected}} to makeovers where they <b>were</b> <b>encouraged</b> to emulate pop stars. Contestants would then <b>be</b> falsely <b>encouraged</b> and praised by the judges {{as well as the}} stylists, choreographers and vocal coaches; in particular, they would <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> to try and stretch their vocal range far beyond what they could actually reach. Contestants with charismatic personalities, such as the singer/songwriter pro-cheerleader Nina [...] "Diva", <b>were</b> heavily <b>encouraged</b> to follow all of the producer driven directives.|$|R

However, when they all go to Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams the door before he {{gets a chance to}} enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first agent, and was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed agent, and as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him back as a client, and she eventually accepts.|$|E
5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} <b>is</b> <b>encouraged,</b> {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
5000|$|The game, as {{explained}} by John Hill's Designer's Notes, encourages players {{to learn and}} adopt basic infantry tactics - defenders <b>are</b> <b>encouraged</b> to site machine guns to dominate fields of fire, while attackers <b>are</b> <b>encouraged</b> to have some men give covering fire while others moved.|$|R

2500|$|Labor {{shortages}} were felt in agriculture, {{even though}} most farmers were given an exemption and few were drafted. Large numbers volunteered or moved to cities for factory jobs. At the same time many agricultural commodities were in greater demand by the military and for the civilian populations of Allies. Production <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> and prices and markets were under tight federal control. Civilians <b>were</b> <b>encouraged</b> to create [...] "victory gardens", farms that were often started in backyards and lots. Children <b>were</b> <b>encouraged</b> to help with these farms, too.|$|R
5|$|Kojima Productions have {{compared}} Raiden and Solid Snake {{as to their}} experiences and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation {{to make a new}} sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination <b>is</b> <b>encouraged,</b> although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E
