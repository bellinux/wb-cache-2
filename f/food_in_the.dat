5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} <b>food.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States was 240 to 300μg/day {{for men and}} 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with {{women of childbearing age}} and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often in the form of Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E
5|$|Fat-rich plant {{products}} such as nuts and conifer seeds are particularly important as winter <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of the woodpecker's range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird's energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, berries and tree sap, the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.|$|E
5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wet season, October to May. Jasminum kerstingii {{is part of the}} hartebeest's diet {{at the start of the}} rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest a higher proportion of food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E

5|$|In Grenada, the island's {{governor}} {{issued an}} emergency order against the hoarding of <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of Janet, {{due to the}} food and water shortage that resulted from Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to Grenada, and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies. The British government later {{announced that it would}} send £50,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines. The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.|$|E

According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E

5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food capable of being consumed by the child during the weaning process. The chewed <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a bolus is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.|$|E
5|$|Spoo is {{a fictional}} {{foodstuff}} {{that served as}} a running joke within the Babylon 5 science fiction television series. In the series' fictional universe, spoo is made from worm-like creatures of the same name and is generally regarded as the most delicious <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> galaxy; the creature itself, however, is regarded with contempt by most species. Despite appearing only in a few episodes, spoo was embraced by fans and became part of the series' extended mythology.|$|E
5|$|Terns are {{long-lived}} {{birds and}} are relatively free from natural predators and parasites; most species are declining in numbers due {{directly or indirectly}} to human activities, including habitat loss, pollution, disturbance, and predation by introduced mammals. The Chinese crested tern is in a critical situation and three other species are classed as endangered. International agreements provide a measure of protection, but adults and eggs of some species are still used for <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropics. The eggs of two species are eaten in the West Indies because they {{are believed to have}} aphrodisiac properties.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source of <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficult}} {{habitat and}} retiring {{nature of the}} invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, and there are few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds at cut sago plants, although {{it is unclear whether}} it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small stones, as do all rails, to help break up its <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gizzard.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} is omnivorous. Animal <b>food</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diet includes snails and slugs, earthworms, spiders {{and insects}} such as beetles and their larvae, flies and grasshoppers. When berries ripen {{in the autumn}} these are taken in great number. Hawthorn, holly, rowan, yew, juniper, dog rose, Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Berberis are all relished. Later in the winter windfall apples are eaten, swedes attacked {{in the field and}} grain and seeds eaten. When these are exhausted, or in particularly harsh weather, the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found.|$|E
