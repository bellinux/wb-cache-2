The developed techniques are highly efficient when applied to the die-casting process, but their capability with sand and ceramic moulding are unknown. Sand/ceramic aluminium castings are prone to coarse microstructure, porosities and inclusions due to low cooling rates and turbulent gravity pouring, and suitable processing techniques are required to eliminate those drawbacks.

40|$|Non-destructive testing using {{ultrasonic}} measurement {{is used to}} ensure the quality of the die-casting products. The quality of a casting depends on the presence of discontinuities such as porosity and on the final metallurgical structure. Discontinuities occurring in the sub-surface of the cast structure mostly have irregular surfaces which scatter the ultrasound waves and make ultrasonic testing more difficult. The effective use of ultrasonic testing for inspection of castings depends greatly upon the skills and expertise of the operator. However, the initial experimental set-up is important to develop a proper inspection procedure that is easily understood by the operators. The aim of the present work is to investigate and develop an automated ultrasonic inspection system for detecting sub-surface defects in <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-casting</b> parts. Two sample test cases were selected from the industrial partners. Ultrasonic immersion testing was carried out on the sample parts using different probes situated at different water path distances to obtain the best possible signal from the defect.

40|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>die-casting</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{automotive}} industry. Brackets, engine blocks, wheels and suspension arms etc. are typical applications. Due to the gases contained in the melt, more or less spherical pores arise in the cast components during the cooling procedure, usually with a higher concentration in the middle. The distribution of the pores depends both on the casting condition and on {{the form of the}} components and is stochastic. In the past, the simple way is often chosen for the fatigue life estimation of aluminium die-casting: The fatigue strengths of the material, e. g. in the form of S-N curves, are determined by an unnotched specimen which are then used in the fatigue calculation. However, the application of these data to real components with notches leads in many cases to fatigue life estimations which are by far too conservative. In the present paper a simple geometrical model of pores is presented. Using this model, the notch stress caused by a pore can be estimated. The behaviour of pores in a real component with notches will be treated. It will be shown that the mentioned conservative nature of the fatigue life prediction and the apparent notch insensitivity of <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-casting</b> {{can be explained by the}} facts that the stress distribution in a real component, contrary to an unnotched specimen, is inhomogeneous and that the porosity density on the surface is often low...|$|R

50|$|The 4B11T is {{the first}} engine in the Lancer Evolution series that uses a <b>die-cast</b> <b>aluminium</b> {{cylinder}} block versus the cast-iron block used in the previous turbocharged 4G63 engine that powered all previous models.

A revised turbocharger offers up to 20-percent quicker response at lower engine speeds compared to previous 4G63. The 4B11T offers a broader torque curve, producing more torque than the 4G63 at all engine speeds, helped by the engine's square bore and stroke design (both measure 86.0 mm).

40|$|Automotive quality {{demands are}} getting higher every year. Aluminium die-castings are {{especially}} important {{components in the}} automotive industry because of their light weight, rigidity, good corrosion resistance and heat dissipation. Since the pressure die-casting process {{is a very complex}} procedure, there must also be a number of quality controls to avoid dimensional, internal and surface defects. The dimensional and internal objective quality controls are already implemented on in-line real time production. As for the surface quality control of die-castings only subjective visual control of the worker is used. This subjective visual control of surface is substituted with objective surface quality control by the laser control system. The laser control system acquires the three-dimensional (3 D) data by the principle of laser triangulation and analyses the surface defects by LACO (Laser Casting Control) analysis. 3 D data representing the measured surface of the die-casting is statistically analyzed and evaluated. It is capable of detecting the most common die-casting surface defects, such as laminations, cold shuts, non-fills, stains and imprints. We found that the LACO system satisfies the requirements for detecting surface defects on diecastings. Combined with the dimensional and internal quality controls, it is a good way of obtaining a total automatic quality inspection with records of die-castings in real time production.

40|$|During {{high-pressure}} <b>die-casting</b> (HPDC) of <b>aluminium</b> alloys, {{there is}} a tendency for the molten alloy to react with the tool steel die, core pins and inserts. This occurrence within the high pressure die casting (HPDC) industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. It is of concern to high-pressure die casters because of down-time due to the regular removal of the soldered layer and its detrimental affect on die life and casting quality. In this investigation, several physical vapour deposited (PVD) coatings, namely, TiN, CrN and TiCN, were evaluated for their ability to eliminate soldering during HPDC of aluminium alloys. Accelerated semi-industrial trials were carried out in a 250 -t Toshiba HPDC machine using a specially designed die made of P 20 tool steel with removable core pins. The results from these trials showed that PVD coatings can act as a physical barrier coating preventing any reaction between the molten aluminium alloy and the tool steel. Thus the problem of soldering on such tools as core pins can be eliminated in high HPDC of aluminium alloys. In the accelerated trials, it was found that soldering was replaced by a built-up layer of cast aluminium alloy, which was less detrimental to tool life and reduced machine down-time due to the reduced need for tool polishing. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials...|$|R

40|$|In serial {{production}} of components for automotive {{applications such as}} cooling and air-conditioning systems, <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-cast</b> material is frequently used due to its excellent castability. The aim of providing light weight components can be approached with thin walled cross sections even for complex structural parts. However, cast components are usually connected to semi-finished products, such as profiles or tubes. The connections have to be mostly pressure tight. The joining technique for those applications has to be highly productive to obtain high component outcome as well as cost-efficient. Laser beam welding techniques are especially suitable for those tasks. Die-cast components have limited or no weldability due to their manufacturing process. Reasons for that are entrapped gases within pores or cavities under high pressure conditions. Furthermore, the mold release agents forthe die-cast process are inappropriate for obtaining homogeneous and sound weld seams. Consequently, a high {{amount of pores in}} the weld seam and stochastic melt pool blow-outs occur, which prohibit mostly the use of the component. To solve these issues a new welding technique, remoweld®T, has been developed at Fraunhofer IWS. The unique method has been extensively tested and transferred to serial-production. The decisive step was to use laser sources with brilliant beam quality in combination with a high frequency beam oscillation within the melt pool. In this paper the technological approach will be presented. With the remoweld®T method it was possible to obtain homogeneous weld seams with low porosity and a strongly reduced distortion for the first time.

40|$|Tools for {{machining}} {{are made}} of hard steels and cemented carbide (WC-Co). For specialized applications, such as aluminium machining, diamond or polycrystalline cubic boron nitride are also used. The main problem with steel, is that it exhibits a relatively low hardness (below 10 GPa) which strongly decreases upon annealing above about 600 K. Thus, the majority of modern tools are nowadays coated with hard coatings that increase the hardness, decrease the coefficient of friction and protect the tools against oxidation. A similar approach has been recently used to obtain a longer duration of the dies for <b>aluminium</b> <b>die-casting.</b> Multi-component and nanostructured materials represent a promising class of protective hard coatings due to their enhanced mechanical and thermal oxidation properties. Surface properties modification is {{an effective way to}} improve the performances of materials subjected to thermo-mechanical stress. Three different thin hard nitrogen-rich coatings were mechanically, microstructurally, and thermally characterized: a 2. 5 micron-thick CrN-NbN, a 11. 7 micron-thick TiAlN, and a 2. 92 micron-thick AlTiCrxNy. The CrN-NbN coating main feature is the fabrication by the alternate deposition of 4 nm thick-nanolayer of NewChrome (new type of CrN, with strong adhesion and low coating temperature). All the three coatings can reach hardness and elastic modulus in excess of 20, and 250 GPa, respectively. Their main applications include stainless steel drawing, plastic materials forming and extrusion and aluminum alloys die-casting. The here studied TiAlN (SBN, super booster nitride) is one of the latest evolution of TiAlN coatings for cutting applications, where maximum resistance to wear and oxidation are required. The AlTiCrxNy combines the very high wear resistance characteristic of the Cr-coatings and the high thermal stability and high-temperature hardness typical of Al-containing coatings. All the coatings were deposited on a S 600 tool steels. The coatings were subjected to two different thermal cycling tests: one for 100 thermal cycles consisting of 60 s dwelling time, respectively at the high- (573 to 1173 K) and at the room-temperature, a second for 100 thermal cycles consisting of 115 s dwelling time, at same temperatures of the first test, followed by 5 s dwelling at room-temperature. The investigated coatings showed a sufficient-to-optimal thermal response in terms of stability of hardness, elastic modulus, and oxidation behavior. The temperature induced hardness and elastic modulus coating variations were measured by nanoindentation.
