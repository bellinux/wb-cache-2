5|$|Archaeologists <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. Nothing was found {{that could be used}} as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees, {{despite their}} ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> by badgers and eaten whole, {{including}} any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees, while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.|$|E

5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, {{the ground}} floor of the keep– made of {{hardened}} gravel– was <b>dug</b> <b>up,</b> probably to reuse for surfacing roads or pathways. The apartments in the forebuilding were abandoned and this part of the keep fell into decay as well. In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{return to}} the {{cemetery}} to exhume the other victims {{only to find the}} graves already <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> and the coffins missing. Mulder realizes that Billy Miles is responsible for bringing the victims to the woods. Returning to the woods, they again encounter Detective Miles, but hear a scream and find Billy nearby with Theresa in his arms. There is a flash of light, and Billy and Theresa are recovered unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Once the Navy took over, {{the camp}} {{became known as}} HMS Royal Arthur and was used to train sailors for the war effort. In order to operate as a {{military}} base, many of the bright external colours were painted over, the dance hall became an armoury, and the rose beds were <b>dug</b> <b>up,</b> to become sites for air raid shelters.|$|E
5|$|The temple lore of Tirupunkur narrates that Shiva {{instructed}} his son Ganesha to aid Nandanar in digging {{the temple}} tank named Nandanar tirtha, after the saint. Another variant tells that Ganesha <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> the tank {{in the night}} so that Nandanar can bathe in its sacred waters before seeing Shiva in the temple.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of the Netherlands, the Grave Registration units of 2nd Army began the task of {{identifying}} the British dead. They were buried together in a field that is on permanent loan to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission just north of Oosterbeek. There are nearly 1,800 graves {{in what is now}} known as the Airborne Cemetery, ¾ of which are for those killed during the 1944 battle. By 2003, there were still 138 men unaccounted for and human remains, equipment and weaponry continue to be <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> in the farmland around the city.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started in}} January 2008. To pass over Strømmen, a fourth Nygård Bridge {{was built for}} cars, and the oldest was {{upgraded}} and used by the light rail line. In several places the road needed to be <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> to remove pipes and cables. In November 2009, Gulating Court of Appeal ruled that the power company BKK had to pay 80 million NOK for the moving of power lines, and could not charge the costs to the project. By June 2008, the first tracks had been laid.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|From arms caches {{hidden in}} 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades. However, {{due to their}} {{inadequate}} preservation, which had had to be improvised in {{the chaos of the}} September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.|$|E
50|$|After the Japanese occupation, the Shaw {{brothers}} {{returned to}} their movie business. With the impending invasion of Singapore, the Shaw brothers converted their assets into gold, jewellery and cash, and buried them in their back garden. After the war, Runme <b>dug</b> these <b>up,</b> and rebuilt his theatres and restarted his movie business.|$|R

The {{intention}} was to fire them on the King's birthday, but the Haganah learned about the plan and warned the British through Teddy Kollek of the Jewish Agency. Army sappers then <b>dug</b> them <b>up.</b> On another occasion, members of an unknown group threw grenades, which missed, at the hotel.|$|R
60|$|And hasten I did. I {{hastened to}} {{cultivate}} the weeds which grew among the melon-vines. Where {{there had been}} one sickly weed before, I nourished two healthy ones. When I found a particularly promising variety of weed growing elsewhere than among my melons, I forthwith <b>dug</b> it <b>up</b> and transplanted it among my charges.|$|R
5|$|His {{body was}} 'translated' (the ecclesiastical term for {{relocation}} of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, {{where it was}} placed in the same tomb with Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. Later Bede's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at Durham Cathedral in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation, but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there. Other relics were claimed by York, Glastonbury and Fulda.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of the vampire {{folklore}} originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E
60|$|Leading {{the way to}} {{the spot}} where the caskets had been buried, Dick looked on while Surajah and Ibrahim <b>dug</b> them <b>up.</b> They were then wrapped up in rugs, and {{strapped}} securely behind their owners' saddles. Then, after a warm adieu to the kind old man, they turned their horses' heads, and rode back out of the woods.|$|R

But if ye'll believe words, that man, Christopher Coney, went and <b>dug</b> 'em <b>up,</b> and spent 'em at the Three Mariners. 'Faith,' he said, 'why should death rob life o' fourpence? Death's not of such good report {{that we should}} respect 'en to that extent,' says he." ...|$|R

5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If <b>dug</b> <b>up,</b> the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1978, Chaplin's coffin was <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> {{and stolen}} from its grave by two {{unemployed}} immigrants, Roman Wardas, from Poland, and Gantcho Ganev, from Bulgaria. The body {{was held for}} ransom {{in an attempt to}} extort money from Oona Chaplin. The pair were caught in a large police operation in May, and Chaplin's coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of Noville. It was re-interred in the Corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete.|$|E
5|$|Texians <b>dug</b> <b>up</b> {{the cannon}} and mounted it on cart wheels. In {{the absence of}} cannonballs, they {{gathered}} metal scraps to fill the cannon. James C. Neill, who had served in an artillery company during the War of 1812, was given command of the cannon. He gathered several men, including Almaron Dickinson, also a former US Army field artilleryman, together to form the first artillery company of Texians. A local Methodist minister, W. P. Smith, blessed their activities in a sermon which made frequent reference to the American Revolution.|$|E
50|$|Coal mining for the {{railroad}} {{led to the}} settlement of {{the nearby town of}} Fossil, Wyoming. When the fossils were discovered, miners <b>dug</b> them <b>up</b> to sell to collectors. In particular, Lee Craig sold fossils from 1897 to 1937. Commercial fossil collecting is not allowed within the National Monument, but numerous quarries on private land nearby continue to produce extraordinary fossil specimens, both for museums and for private collectors.|$|R
2500|$|The {{vestibule}} {{itself was}} forty-three feet by seventeen feet in dimension. [...] It {{was composed of}} limestone on all four of its walls. The floor has been speculated {{to be made of}} wood, because when the mob occupied the temple briefly in late 1847, they broke through the floor to reach a sealed off room in the basement. [...] Had the floor been limestone, it seems unlikely that they would have <b>dug</b> it <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|Miss Blimber, too, {{although}} a slim and graceful maid, did no soft violence to {{the gravity of}} the house. There was no light nonsense about Miss Blimber. She kept her hair short and crisp, and wore spectacles. She was dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages. None of your live languages for Miss Blimber. They must be dead--stone dead--and then Miss Blimber <b>dug</b> them <b>up</b> like a Ghoul.|$|R
