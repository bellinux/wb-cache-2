In this work, the architecture of hen's eggshell at different length scales has been systematically investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and environmental SEM (ESEM). It is found that the skeleton of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) has hierarchical structures at nano- to micro-scales: primary nano-particles of ~ 10 nm loosely congregate giving a porous and rough texture, and compose the upper-level morphologies including submicro spheres, nano-rods, rhombohedral-cleavage pattern and slices, which are elaborately arranged in a surface layer, palisade layer and mammillary layer along the radial direction. Accordingly, the pore system exhibits a three-level hierarchy, namely nano-scale pores (between nano-rods and primary nano-particles), submicro-scale pores ("bubble pores") and micro-scale pores (opening of "gas pores"). Further investigation shows that hen's eggshell regulates <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> through adjusting the sizes and numbers of submicro-scale "bubble pores". Based on our observations, a new description of hen's eggshell is presented, which amends the conventional view of micro-scale, straight and permeating "gas pores", and reveals the role of hierarchical pores in <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> and contamination resistance.

40|$|AbstractThe melter feed, slurry, or calcine charged {{on the top}} of a pool {{of molten}} glass forms a {{floating}} layer of reacting material called the cold cap. Between the cold-cap top, which is covered with boiling slurry, and its bottom, where bubbles separate it from molten glass, the temperature changes by up to 1000 K. The processes that occur over this temperature interval within the cold cap include liberation of <b>gases,</b> <b>conduction</b> and consumption of heat, dissolution of quartz particles, formation and dissolution of intermediate crystalline phases, and generation of foam and gas cavities. These processes have been investigated using thermal analyses, optical and electronic microscopies, x-ray diffraction, as well as other techniques. Properties of the reacting feed, such as heat conductivity and density, were measured as functions of temperature. Investigating the structure of quenched cold caps produced in a laboratory-scale melter complemented the crucible studies. The cold cap consists of two main layers. The top layer contains solid particles dissolving in the glass-forming melt and open pores through which gases are escaping. The bottom layer contains bubbly melt or foam where bubbles coalesce into larger cavities that move sideways and release the gas to the atmosphere. The feed-to-glass conversion became sufficiently understood for representing the cold-cap processes via mathematical models. These models, which comprise heat transfer, mass transfer, and reaction kinetics models, have been developed with the final goal to relate feed parameters to the rate of glass melting...|$|R

The theoretical estimation of heat flux through MLI, using a simple analytical model, is also discussed in this paper.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} {{to gain a better understanding}} of the various mechanisms of heat transfer through fibrous materials and to gain insight into how fill-gas pressure influences the effective thermal conductivity. By way of first principles and some empiricism, two mathematical models are constructed to correlate experimental data. The data are obtained from a test series measuring the effective thermal conductivity of Nomex using a two-sided guarded hot-plate heater apparatus. Tests are conducted for certain mean temperatures and fill-gases over a range of pressures varying from vacuum to atmospheric conditions. The models are then evaluated to determine their effectiveness in representing the effective thermal conductivity of a fibrous material. The models presented herein predict the effective thermal conductivity of Nomex extremely well. Since the influence of <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> is determined to be the most influential component in predicting the effective thermal conductivity of a fibrous material, an improved representation of <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> is developed.

40|$|Freeze-drying {{is often}} used in {{manufacture}} of pharmaceuticals to remove a solvent {{in such a way}} that the sensitive molecular structure of the active substance of a drug is least disturbed, and to provide a sterile powder that can be quickly and completely rehydrated. In this work heat transfer rates in a laboratory-scale freeze-dryer have been measured to investigate the contribution of different heat transfer modes. Pure water was partially dried under low-pressure conditions and sublimation rates were determined gravimetrically. The heat transfer rates were observed to be independent of the separation distance between a product vial and a dryer shelf and linearly dependent on the pressure in the free molecular limit. However, under higher pressures the heat transfer rates were independent of pressure and inversely proportional to the separation distance. Previous heat transfer studies in conventional freeze-drying cycles have attributed a dominant portion of the total heat transfer to radiation, the rest to conduction, whereas the convection has been found insignificant. While the measurements revealed the significance of the radiative and <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> components, the convective component was found to be comparable to the <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> contribution at pressures greater than 100 mTorr.

40|$|An {{infrared}} (IR) detector {{is simply}} a transducer of radiant energy, converting radiant energy into a measurable form. Since radiation does not rely on visible light, it offers the possibility of seeing in the dark or through obscured conditions, by detecting the IR energy emitted by objects. One of the prime applications of IR detector systems for military use is in target acquisition and tracking of projectile systems. The IR detectors also have great potential in commercial market. Typically, IR detectors perform best when cooled to cryogenic temperatures {{in the range of}} nearly 120 K. However, the necessity to operate in such cryogenic regimes makes the application of IR detectors extremely complex. Further, prior to proceeding on to a full blown transient thermal analysis it is worthwhile to perform a steady-state numerical analysis for ascertaining the effect of variation in viz., material, <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> coefficient, h, emissivity, ε, on the temperature profile along the cryo chamber length. This would enable understanding the interaction between the cryo chamber and its environment.

30|$|Nowadays, vacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIPs) {{are regarded as}} one of the optimum thermal adiabatic materials for the energy conservation purpose on the market. The thermal insulation performances observed, even ten times better than common heat insulation materials can be achieved by applying VIPs, resulting in a great potential for the reduction of energy loss in thermal space with slim exterior-protected walls (Fricke et al. 2008; Baetens 2010; Nussbaumer et al. 2006; Nussbaumer et al. 2005; Brunner et al. 2012; Caps et al. 2001). The flat VIPs contain a porous core material which withstands the atmospheric air pressure, a gas-tight barrier envelope that is optimized for low air & moisture leakage rate and for a long service life to maintain the internal vacuum level, and getter or gas absorption materials, if necessary, to absorb internal gas from leakage or other sources. That is, the VIPs make use of vacuum to suppress heat transfer due to rarefied gaseous conduction (Bouquerel et al. 2012 a; Bouquerel et al. 2012 b; Alam et al. 2011). So the thermal adiabatic property of VIPs dramatically depends on the core materials and the internal gas pressure. The porous materials, such as, micro-open foam, nano-structured power and fine fiber, are commonly used as core materials of VIPs, which are easily evacuated and have minimum thermal conduction effect (Kwon et al. 2009). The heat transfer processing in VIPs is via solid conduction, rarefied <b>gas</b> <b>conduction,</b> radiation and convection occurring at interface of gas and solid wall which is nearly zero, is always ignored in calculation. The solid conduction and radiation depends on the structure, the porosity and properties of core materials, while the <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> by the residual gases embraced in the caves depends on the internal gas pressure which maybe increased with time.

These are mixing of cold and hot <b>gas,</b> and heat <b>conduction</b> initiated by magnetic fields reconnection between hot and cold gas. These processes when incorporated into the moderate cooling flow model lead to a general cooling flow model with the following ingredients. (1) Cooling flow does occur, but with a mass cooling rate ∼ 10 times lower than in old (∼ 10 years ago) versions of the cooling flow model. Namely, heating occurs such that the effective age of the cooling flow is much below the cluster age, but the heating can’t prevent cooling altogether.

The flow is cooling-dominated and energetically similar to the Shapiro, Lightman, & Eardley (1976, SLE) solution. Since the SLE solution is known to be thermally unstable, one might suspect that the new solution would also be unstable. However, due to the very high temperature of the accreting <b>gas,</b> thermal <b>conduction</b> is very strong and could suppress the thermal instability. We analyze the role of thermal conduction in both the hot settling flow and the SLE solution. In the hot settling flow collisions are very rare. Therefore, thermal transport occurs via free streaming of electrons along tangled magnetic field lines. We find that conduction is strong enough to make the flow marginally stable. In contrast, in the cooler SLE solution, conduction is via collisional, Spitzer-type transport. In this case, conduction is weaker, and we find that the SLE solution is thermally unstable even in the presence of conduction. Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures; submitted to ApJ.
