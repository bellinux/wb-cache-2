The need for male soldiers during World War One provided many <b>job</b> <b>vacancies</b> that women <b>filled.</b> Women thus assumed a substantial role within national economies during the war.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{matching}} process using monthly panel data for local labour markets in Sweden. We find that {{an increase in}} the number of vacancies has a very weak effect on the number of unemployed workers being hired: unemployed workers appear to be unable to compete for many available <b>jobs.</b> <b>Vacancies</b> are <b>filled</b> quickly and there is no (or only weak) evidence that high unemployment makes it easier to fill vacancies; hiring appears to be determined by labour demand while frictions and labour supply play small roles. These results indicate persistent mismatch in the Swedish labour market...|$|R

Local authorities also hold joint job festivals and joint job interviews for local job seekers and establishments.

50|$|On February 26, {{after six}} weeks of strike, the workers {{returned}} to work, forced to accept the government’s terms. Less than a dozen people were arrested. Of the 200 people dismissed during the strike, 37 were pensionable workers, some with over twenty years’ worth of experience, and twenty daily wagers were dismissed from the railway. The Secretary of the Railway Workers’ Union, President of the Bo branch, and other Protectorate workers, were also dismissed. The President of the union was demoted and reassigned, and ended up resigning from the department. The <b>job</b> <b>vacancies</b> were <b>filled</b> with West Indian and local workers. Three months after the strike ended, all worker-paid daily wages were returned to their previous incremental rates. After {{the end of the}} strike, the union suffered from a lack of leadership and was replaced by a government-approved Railway Staff Committee.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} institutions, {{a recent survey}} paper by Schröder ([2010]) focuses {{on the role of}} {{recruitment}} channels and other labor market institutions. Most <b>jobs</b> <b>vacancies</b> are <b>filled</b> through personal networks and informal recruitment channels, and there are differences in both the size and quality of the networks of ethnic natives and immigrants. Furthermore, institutions that pave the way from school to work, such as training or apprenticeship slots can foster and prolong labor market disadvantage. Colding ([2005]) finds a much higher dropout rate from vocational education in Denmark among children of immigrants (60 % compared to 30 % among ethnic natives), which is presumably due to the difficulties immigrant children face in finding an internship. Thus, if employers perceive immigrant children as being harder to train or more risky to employ in a setting where the wage for unskilled labor is given, this will result in higher unemployment for immigrant children compared to ethnic natives, even if their productivity is the same.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{numbers of}} the 19th century Cornish emigrants {{eventually}} returned to Cornwall, whilst the rate of emigration from Cornwall declined after World War I. However, the global connections of the remaining Cornish diaspora, which is concentrated in English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United States, are [...] "very strong". Their outreach {{has contributed to the}} international spread of Methodism, a movement within Protestant Christianity that was popular with the Cornish people {{at the time of their}} mass migration. [...] "Cousin Jacks" [...] is a nickname for the overseas Cornish, thought to derive from the practice of Cornishmen asking if <b>job</b> <b>vacancies</b> could be <b>filled</b> by their cousin named Jack in Cornwall.|$|R
30|$|In Jie’s case, {{the company}} did not {{make an effort to}} recruit {{security}} guards publicly; instead, <b>job</b> <b>vacancies</b> were <b>filled</b> mainly through existing employees’ recommendations. The use of employee referrals is the cheapest way to obtain labor. Although its main disadvantage lies in the inability to generate a large candidate pool due to the homophily principle of contact use (Fernandez et al. 2000; Fernandez and Weinberg 1997; Rees 1966), the use of the internal referral system is ideal when certifiable qualifications are not a concern of the employer. In addition to reducing costs by a large margin in both the recruitment and selection stages, the use of internal referrals also increases the new employee’s loyalty to the employer and reduces the turnover rate by tying the new worker’s performance to the interests and reputation of his or her sponsor (Jenkins 1984; Petersen et al. 2000). In short, for a security guard position, non-certifiable qualifications such as trustworthiness, sense of responsibility, and willingness to help homeowners are emphasized more than certifiable qualifications such as education. When a job mainly requires non-certifiable qualifications, the employer’s hiring methods tend to be informal in both recruitment and selection. In this scenario the sole reliance {{on the use of the}} informal channel would work the best.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} the job-broking {{function of}} the Finnish Public Employment Service (PES). The empirical analysis {{is based on the}} Finnish <b>job</b> <b>vacancy</b> microdata in 2002 and 2003 including information on over 320, 000 <b>job</b> <b>vacancies</b> each year. The open <b>job</b> <b>vacancy</b> period, the recruitment duration and various outcomes of the filling process are analysed mainly by applying logit regression estimations. As the duration of the recruitment process is of ultimate importance in taking into use the potential employment hidden into open <b>job</b> <b>vacancies,</b> the factors which have an effect on duration are analysed. Low risk for both long vacancy period and recruitment duration are found for job duration less than 3 months, <b>filling</b> the <b>vacancy</b> with PES job-seeker and using the job assignment. The effects of two alternative or additional policy methods, job assignments and job announcements are found consistent in all estimations: the more selective job assignment which may lead to sanctions for the job-seeker is much more effective when <b>filling</b> the <b>vacancy</b> with PES applicant than the job announcement of purely informative character, which seems to have little or no effect at all on the <b>filling</b> of <b>vacancies.</b> A policy conclusion is drawn to recommend cutting the excessive and costly use of announcements and to selectively increase the volume of assignments in cooperation with the employers.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on results from a {{qualitative}} study of recruitment processes and job searches. The focus lies on the saliens of interpersonal processes that create potential value in social networks. As is well established, most <b>job</b> <b>vacancies</b> are <b>filled</b> via social networks or informal recruitment procedures. However, social network recruitment also contributes to the reproduction of inequality structures in society. Whether a social network creates opportunities or not means more than having contacts in the labour market. According to Zhou and Bankston (2002 : 286), the value of social relations is relative, i. e. a social network can function as social capital in one context but lack value in another. In other words, the value of social capital is context-bound and open to negotiation. This article discusses the significance of these relations and their link to society’s structural conditions based on different network studies and an interactional perspective. The empirical data is based on interviews with young people who work in a fast-food chain, and their managers. Three young persons describe their entry into the labour market and their social networks. How do they feel about referring, or being referred to a workplace by their friends and relatives? Are their choices and perceived horizons of action influenced by society’s preconceptions and prejudices? Are their opportunities affected by their parents’ position and social networks? Do they feel that their social networks create opportunities or limitations...|$|R
40|$|Labor market flows, labor productivity, {{and wages}} in Slovenia are {{analyzed}} using macroeconomic and firm-level survey evidence. A decline in employee numbers is confirmed, but {{a shortage of}} qualified applicants is the major obstacle to creating <b>jobs</b> or <b>filling</b> <b>vacancies,</b> suggesting a mismatch in the labor market. The employee's personal qualification in terms of quality of human capital is recorded {{as the most important}} single factor in wage determination. The gap in labor productivity between Slovenia along with other analyzed Central and East European economies and Germany is clearly confirmed. The increase in labor productivity only partly explains real wage increases in Slovenia, suggesting an important role of other, unexplained factors in wage formation during transition and adjustment toward European Union membership. ...|$|R
40|$|Providing {{employers}} with recommendations {{about whom}} to recruit can substantially lower {{the number of}} vacancies that go unfilled.

50|$|Appointments to {{the civil}} service are based on open and fair competition. Candidates {{have to go through}} {{competitive}} appointment processes and are appointed only if they possess the qualifications and capabilities required for the <b>job.</b> <b>Vacancies</b> can be <b>filled</b> by promotion from within the service. In the case of basic ranks or where promotion is not possible or where there is a special need, <b>vacancies</b> are <b>filled</b> by open recruitment. To achieve the target of reducing the civil service establishment, the Government implemented a general recruitment freeze {{to the civil}} service with effect from April 1, 2003, with exemption granted only on very exceptional circumstances. Entry requirements for civil service posts in general are set on the basis of academic or professional qualifications obtainable from local institutions or professional bodies (or equivalent), technical skills, work experience, language proficiency and other qualities and attributes as required. To achieve the aim of a civil service which is biliterate (Chinese and English) and trilingual (generally conversant in spoken Cantonese, English and Mandarin), language proficiency in Chinese and English is also required. From January 2003 onwards, for civil service posts requiring degree or professional qualifications, applicants should pass the two language papers (Use of Chinese and Use of English) in the Common Recruitment Examination before job application. For civil service posts with general academic qualifications set below degree level, applicants should attain at least Grade E in Chinese and English (Syllabus B) in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, or equivalent. In accordance with the Basic Law, new recruits appointed on or after July 1, 1997 must be permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, save for certain specified exceptions.|$|R

The response to high local <b>job</b> <b>vacancy</b> rates indicates that migration in general is driven by differences in matching efficiency in local labour market areas rather than a pure response to high local unemployment.
