This system improved the performances of the Romanian 6 kV motors, by allowing a power up to 2500 kW, insuring a higher reliability compared to the older ones. One of the essential advantages provided by the selected insulation system consists in space saving in the slots of the stator which gives the possibility to reduce both weight and size up to 15 % compared to the same kind of motors using the ancient insulation system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe thermal and {{mechanical}} properties of bio-aggregate concretes {{are known to}} be anisotropic.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{research}} project, acousticians along with psychologists have analyzed the cognitive performance of primary school pupils depending on classroom acoustics. This paper presents the acoustic {{part of the}} cooperative project. Appropriate class rooms of several school buildings were selected after a preliminary procedure including inspections, measurements and questionnaires was accomplished. Thus, 65 class rooms of 23 different schools were examined by the reverberation time and the background noise level. The measurement of background noise levels were carried out for both opened and closed windows. Although the reverberation time in some cases exceeds {{the recommendations of the}} new German standard DIN 18041, the measured reverberation time is within an acceptable range. The results show that with windows closed teaching should not be affected substantially. In contrast, in the case of open windows significantly high background noise levels were observed frequently. Based on these results 16 class rooms of 8 schools were selected for further detailed investigations comprising the determination of a set of room-acoustic parameters. Additionally, the sound <b>insulation</b> to adjacent <b>class</b> rooms, corridors and of the facade were measured. The acoustical properties of a selection of class rooms were modified in order to achieve reference situations. These rooms have served as environment for psychological tests.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{interest in}} the pursuit of excellence in education is derived from a long tradition of efforts to provide special schooling defined as excellent. In the current movement, excellence, though ambiguously defined and political in nature, denotes a necessary separation among people and in its subtle trappings of class, contains elitist goals for society and school. The expression of these hidden goals required means and indicators that were more politically acceptable. As with excellence, gifted and talented programs and teacher certification programs operate under vague and ambiguous guidelines. Test scores, used as the objectification of quality in gifted and talented programs, provide an <b>insulation</b> for dominant <b>classes</b> who produce and utilise them, and represent a public myth of fairness and objectivity consistent with Abner Cohen's mystique of elites presented in "The Politics of Elite Culture " (1981). Another manifestation of the excellence movement was the proclamation of current teachers as "non-excellent " and the search for a new set of teacher certification standards. The politics of excellence, using vague and confusing goals and means which convey a mystique, operates to obscure the direction of action being pursued in social and educational policy. Hence, the excellence movement in education appears to persuade the overclasses of their superiority and socially sanctioned ruling position.

The focus of this project was on solar hot water, as this technology (unlike solar photovoltaics (PVs), it appears) actually saves about 30 % of a typical household energy bill. I was able to interview the leading manufacturer of solar hot water systems in Arequipa and consult with a colleague and his students at the Universidad Nacional San Agustín about a summer 2016 joint household survey of solar hot water uses and understandings. The emerging project is focused on solar energy production and consumption in Arequipa, and it has me especially interested as a case study within the emerging paradigm of “energopolitics” 1 since Arequipa features world <b>class</b> <b>insulation</b> that has been harnessed both in bottom-up solar thermal projects (since the 1940 s we think), as well as more recently a huge top-down solar PV project there – the largest PV array to date in Latin America (44 megawatts).

40|$|Abstract. Volcanic Pumice (VP) {{is found}} abundantly {{in various parts}} of the world. In this study, VP from East New Britain {{province}} of Papua New Guinea is investigated and assessed for its industrial utilization. The manufacturing of heat-insulating lightweight concrete, building blocks or composites using VP is of prime importance as an energy saver. The utilization of VP as a heat-insulating material is tested and the results are found to satisfy the ASTM requirements. This fact suggests that VP could be utilized in the manufacture of composite building blocks or concrete. Acoustic performance of composite building floors with lightweight volcanic pumice concrete (VPC) is also described based on the performance of normal concrete (NC) and Code based requirements. The performance of VPC and NC composite floors is judged based on Sound Transmission Class (STC) or Impact <b>Insulation</b> <b>Class</b> (IIC) values.

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a big shout for more {{renewable}} and more rational use of energy. This has a big impact on the building sector. Figures of 60 – 70 % of energy consumption reduction in the building sector are being raised. These reductions can only be accomplished when most of the existing buildings get renovated and every new building is built with an optimum in sight. A big part of the building industry sees the demise of electrical heating as a given and the use of electricity for heating currently has a negative effect on the EPB rating. However to achieve big reductions in consumption all options should be kept open. Electrical heating is not limited anymore to direct heating, heat pumps may also offer a solution.

30|$|In an {{electric}} power system, over current or excess current {{is a situation}} where the value larger than intended electric current exists through a conductor, leading to excessive generation of heat which leads to the risk of fire or damage to equipment [5 – 7]. Possible causes for over current include short circuit, excessive load, incorrect design, or a ground fault. Fuses, circuit breakers, temperature sensors and current limiters are commonly used protection mechanisms to control the risks of over current. Over current protection also includes the protection against over loads and this is most widely used protection. Over loading of a machine (or equipment) means the machine is taking more current than its rated current. Hence, with overloading there is an associated temperature rise. The permissible temperature rise has a limit based on <b>insulation</b> <b>class</b> and material. Over current protection against overload is generally provided by thermal relays. Over current protection also includes protection against short-circuit. Short circuits may leads to phase faults, earth faults or winding faults. Short circuit currents are generally several times more than full load current. Hence fast fault clearance is always desirable at the time of short-circuits.|$|E
40|$|Transportation {{electrification}} {{has experienced}} a significant growth in recent years, and the electrification of the powertrain - namely hybridization - is considered the most viable solution seen by car manufacturers to achieve the challenging emission targets. Among the hybrid electrical powertrain topologies, the mild-hybrid configuration with the 48 V battery system offers the best ratio cost versus CO 2 improvements. In particular, the 48 V technology does not require electrical shock protection whilst allows to leverage a variety of fuel saving functions such as electrical boost and regenerative braking. The thesis {{is focused on the}} electromagnetic and thermal design of a Belt-driven Starter Generator, BSG, for 48 V mild-hybrid powertrains. In the BSG layout, the starter-generator replaces the conventional alternator with a low impact on the engine compartment layout, even if a redesign of the belt tensioner is required. It is noteworthy {{to keep in mind that}} the electrical machine shall provide high starting torque and wide constant power speed range, both in motor and generator mode. Furthermore, the application imposes the adoption of low cost materials and the electrical machine is located in a harsh environment. As a consequence, the design is challenging from the electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical point of view. The novelties of the research lie in the 48 V automotive applications, by describing the practical difficulties to fulfill the design specifications through a suitable material selection, the identification of the cooling system and the available technological solutions. The first section of the thesis reports results from a literature review on electrical machine for mild-hybrid application aiming to highlight different criteria for the selection of the electrical machine. In this context the advantages in terms of fault tolerance and stator current splitting of multiphase drives are investigated. Furthermore, in this section the required performances and the constraints imposed by the specific application are analyzed. Among the different motor technologies, a dual three-phase induction machine having two stator winding sets shifted by 60 electrical degrees is selected as a suitable candidate. The second part of the thesis reports electromagnetic and mechanical issues addressed during the design stage, with special focus on stator winding layout, pole number and rotor slot. The adopted six-phase machine uses a four-layer bar stator winding that has been demonstrated as a good solution to improve the slot fill factor and thermal behavior. In addition, the thesis reports a comparison supported by experimental tests between open and closed rotor slots solutions; the focus is to maximize the machine electromagnetic performance according to the mechanical limits imposed by the rotating speed. Finally, predicted and measured performance of the prototypes are reported and discussed for validation purposes. The third part of the thesis deals with the thermal assessment of the BSG with particular emphasis on accurate winding temperature prediction as well as the cooling system selection. Since the stator-winding region is very sensitive to thermal issues and is usually attributed as being the main heat source within the machine body, its thermal modeling is of major importance. In these regards, a simplified stator winding thermal model was developed for the temperature prediction during transient condition. Moreover, considering that the driving cycle is characterized by time variable loss distribution, an effective cooling system must be mandatorily adopted together with high temperature <b>class</b> <b>insulation</b> material. In this context, the development of heat extraction through forced convection is experimentally investigated on the BSG prototype. As a main outcome of this research activity, it has been demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed design solution with respect to electromagnetic and thermal requirements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} of the research is to investigate the effect of periodic switching on/off in cyclical pumping on resistance to wear of high voltage electric motors of main pump units. Frequent motors starts in a cyclic pumping lead to accelerated wear of the mechanical motor parts owing {{to the impact of}} dynamic loads at startup, as well as winding insulation due to high inrush currents flow. As a result accelerated depreciation may decrease residual life, overhaul period and service life of electric motors. The main factors affecting the service life of insulation motors are winding temperature, and as a consequence, the thermal aging of the insulation. The use of variable frequency drive can significantly reduce the cyclic transfer modes, or even eliminate them. The authors obtained analytical expressions for the evaluation of insulation deterioration {{at the start of the}} motor, which allow us to study the impact of the following factors: <b>insulation</b> <b>class,</b> the start time, break time at work, initial and nominal temperature, the temperature rise of the windings over the ambient temperature.
