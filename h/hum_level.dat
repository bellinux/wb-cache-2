25|$|There is {{a fourth}} type of pickup under a P-90 cover, {{referred}} to as a large mini-humbucker. These, however, are not intended to mimic the sound of a P-90. Like all side-by-side humbuckers, they have lower <b>hum</b> <b>levels.</b> This configuration operates {{in the same way as}} a humbucker: both coils individually respond to string vibrations, but since the two coils have a reversed magnetic polarity, the signal from both coils is added, while the hum is effectively canceled. Consequently, these types of pickups sound more like a humbucker than a P-90.|$|R
40|$|CDG-Ib is the "gastro intestinal'' type of the {{congenital}} disorders of glycosylation (CDG) and {{a potentially}} treatable disorder. It {{has been described}} in patients presenting with congenital hepatic fibrosis and protein losing enteropathy, The symptoms result from hypoglycosylation of serum- and other glycoproteins, CDG-Ib {{is caused by a}} deficiency of mannose- 6 -phosphate isomerase (synonym: phosphomannose isomerase, EC 5. 3. 1. 8), due to mutations in theMPI gene. We determined the genomic structure of the MPI gene in order to simplify mutation detection, The gene is composed of 8 exons and spans only 5 kb. Eight (7 novel) different mutations were found in seven patients with a confirmed phosphomannose isomerase deficiency, analyzed {{in the context of this}} study: six missense mutations, a splice mutation and one insertion. In the last, the mutation resulted in an unstable transcript, and was hardly detectable at the mRNA level. This emphasizes the importance of mutation analysis at. the genomic DNA <b>level.</b> <b>Hum</b> Mutat 16 : 247 - 252, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests the spontaneous BOLD signal synchronization of corresponding interhemispheric, homotopic regions as a stable trait of human brain physiology, with emerging differences in such organization being {{also related to}} some pathological conditions. To understand whether such brain functional symmetries play a role into higher-order cognitive functioning, here we correlated the functional homotopy profiles of 119 healthy subjects with their intelligence level. Counterintuitively, reduced homotopic connectivity in above average-IQ versus average-IQ subjects was observed, with significant reductions in visual and somatosensory cortices, supplementary motor area, rolandic operculum, and middle temporal gyrus, possibly suggesting that a downgrading of interhemispheric talk at rest could be associated with higher cognitive functioning. These regions also showed an increased spontaneous synchrony with medial structures located in ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres, with such pattern being mostly detectable for regions placed in the left hemisphere. The interactions with age and gender have been also tested, with different patterns for subjects above and below 25 years old and less homotopic connectivity in the prefrontal cortex and posterior midline regions in female participants with higher IQ scores. These findings support prior evidence suggesting a functional role for homotopic connectivity in human cognitive expression, promoting the reduction of synchrony between primary sensory regions {{as a predictor of}} higher intelligence <b>levels.</b> <b>Hum</b> Brain Mapp, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|We used {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{to study}} responses to speech and {{music on the}} auditory cortices of 13 healthy full-term newborn infants during natural sleep. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the lateralization of speech and music responses at this stage of development. NIRS data was recorded from eight positions on both hemispheres simultaneously with electroencephalography, electrooculography, electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and inclinometry. In 11 subjects, statistically significant (P < 0. 02) oxygenated (HbO(2)) and total hemoglobin (HbT) responses were recorded. Both stimulus types elicited significant HbO(2) and HUT responses on both hemispheres in five subjects. Six of the 11 subjects had positive HbO(2) and HbT responses to both stimulus types, whereas one subject had negative responses. Mixed positive and negative responses were observed in four neonates. On both hemispheres, speech and music responses were significantly correlated (r = 0. 64; P = 0. 018 on the left hemisphere (LH) and r = 0. 60; P = 0. 029 on the right hemisphere (RH)). On the group level, the average response to the speech stimuli was statistically significantly greater than zero in the LH, whereas responses on the RH or to the music stimuli did not differ significantly from zero. This suggests a more coherent response to speech on the LH. However, significant differences in lateralization of the responses or mean response amplitudes of the two stimulus types were not observed on the group <b>level.</b> <b>Hum</b> Brain Mapp 31 : 595 - 603, 2010.

40|$|In recent years, {{functional}} imaging {{studies have}} revealed a supraspinal network, which {{is involved in}} perception and processing of bladder distention. Very little information exists on the cortical representation of C-fiber transmitted temperature sensation of the human bladder, although C-fibers seem {{to be involved in}} the pathomechanisms of bladder dysfunctions. Our aim was, therefore, to evaluate the outcome of bladder cold stimulation on supraspinal activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A block design fMRI study was performed in 14 healthy females at the MR-center of the University of Zurich. After catheterization, all subjects were investigated in a 3. 0 -Tesla Scanner. The scanning consisted of 10 repetitive cycles. Each cycle consisted of five conditions: REST, INFUSION, SENSATION, DRAIN 1, and DRAIN 2. Cold saline was passively infused at 4 - 8 degrees C during scanning. Not more than 100 ml were infused per cycle. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal analysis of the different conditions was compared to REST. All activations were evaluated on a random effects level at P = 0. 001. Activation of brain regions for bladder cold stimulation (DRAIN 1 period) was found bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobe [Brodmann area (BA) 40], the right insula (BA 13), the right cerebellar posterior lobe, the right middle temporal gyrus (BA 20), and the right postcentral gyrus (BA 3). In conclusion, bladder cooling caused a different supraspinal activation pattern compared to what is known to occur during bladder distention. This supports our hypothesis that cold sensation is processed differently from bladder distension at the supraspinal <b>level.</b> <b>Hum</b> Brain Mapp, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedMusic Information Retrieval (MIR) {{is gaining}} {{widespread}} attention and becoming increasingly important. The growing capacity of web servers parallels {{the explosion of}} information generated worldwide. The need for efficient and natural access to these databases cannot be overstated. Digital music and its associated information are prime examples of such complex {{information that can be}} stored in a variety of formats, such as MP 3, MIDI, wav, scores etc. These data can also be accessed in multiple ways. If the user is familiar with the name of the song or the band, and the source material is annotated with metadata, retrieval can be straightforward. However, if one does not know the lyrics, title, or the performer, alternative retrieval methods are necessary, such as through singing, humming, or playing a sample of the piece as a the query to the database. Enabling such kinds of natural human interactions with large databases has thus become an essential component of effective and flexible MIR systems.; In this thesis, two general domains for MIR systems are under discussion: a) Retrieval in Monophonic Music, and b) Retrieval in Polyphonic Music. For both domains, this thesis investigates the different sources and effects of uncertainty that is present in the input level, and system level, and present algorithms for solving the robust retrieval problem by combining music knowledge, signal processing techniques and statistical analysis.; First, we discuss Query by Humming, a specific instance of music retrieval systems in monophonic music domain, where only one sound source is available at a time. Here, straight forward signal analysis via prosodic features such as pitch and energy can be used to achieve accurate transcription from audio to symbol domain, however, the variability in the way people produce humming is not easy to handle with such straight forward algorithms. Since the transcription provided by the system front end will be used in the query engine, the robustness against user dependent variability is important. The performance of the transcription directly affects the performance that of the retrieval engine.; Our approach for achieving robust performance under the effect of uncertatinty is statistical. We first discuss our experiments for collection of real world humming data. The data is important in designing statistical systems. The goal is to achieve a collection of data that represents the general variability that is expected in the input of QBH systems. The data is also used in estimating important parameters of {{the front end of the}} system for segmentation, and also it is used in testing our QBH system's retrieval performance. We analyzed the humming performance of different users against different criteria such as, the effects of musical background, musical structure of the target melody, and familiarity. We also tried to observe performance differences over <b>humming</b> different interval <b>levels</b> such as high intervals vs low intervals, perfect intervals vsaugmented intervals etc [...] . The final goal is to use the acquired statistical information as a guidence through our retrieval calculations.; An Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based speech recognition system is used in the front end of our QBH system. The goal is to segment humming syllables that represent musical notes in the input audio. Accurate segmentation leads accurate representation of the audio in the symbol domain. We use relative information of change in pitch and duration for consecutive notes to ensure key and rhythm independent representation. From the two dimensional transcription of pitch contour and duration ratios, we extract fixed length characteristic finger prints(FP) from the audio at rare pitch movements and duration movements where highest and lowest change in the input is performed. The main assumption we use is a subsequence of pitch contour and duration ratios would be enough for representing a melody. These subsequences, finger prints are mapped ontothe database entries and compared to see if any similarities can be found. Statistical measures are used to define and calculate the similarity distance from the extracted finger prints and the database entries to achieve robust performance.; We also extended the MIR problem to a next level, which is retrieval in polyphonic domain. Now the retreival task is performing matching between audio files, that has unlimited sound sources, and they might be in different forms with respect to expressive parameters and orchestration. In polyphonic music, since the number of instruments playing at a time and their identity is unknown, mapping the audio signal into a true note transcription is a hard task to achieve. Researchers used different machine learning techniques and they were only able to report around 55 % note detection accuracy in monotimbral domain. Here a mid level representation whose performance is not affected by different spectral characteristics of the different instruments should be defined. We used a representation technique that maps small audio frames into a symbolic representation that tracks general tonal movement, behaviour and characteristics of the polyphonic audio. The selected representation is a string sequence of lexical chords for each major and minor chord of twelve distinct sounds in a full octave. The representation is achieved by mapping the audio spectrum of the individual frames onto the Spiral Array, a 3 d space for tonality, that has specific tonal marks at specific coordinates. The Spiral Array is updated with respect to the tonal labeling task for faster transcription. Fromthe mapping, a decision is made for identifying which tonal cluster the audio frame belongs to, and appropriate labeling is perfromed. The transcription process is continuously labeling consequtive audio frames with the most appropriate (closest to the tonal center).; For modeling, we used sequential statistical models, which are n-grams. An n-gram is a sub-sequence of n items from a given sequence. The n-gram sequential modeling strategy can be applied to the tonal sequences that are transcribed from polyphonic audio for statistically representing tonal movements. This sequential representation technique is similiar to the ones that is used in genetic analysis, instead of protein names, we have chord names in our sequential code. N-grams are extracted from tonal string sequences to create a statistical model for each of the polyphonic melody that is in our melody database. After appropriate smoothing, which is needed to compansate for different audio lengths, the smoothed n-grams will ne accumulated in the melody database. For retrieval, a symbolic sequence is compared to each of the smoothed ngrams in the database using perplexity based scoring. Perplexity calculates the cross enthrophy between a query sequence and the smoothed n-grams in the database. The sequential models which are close to the query sequence will be less surprised from the subsequences generated by the query, so their perplexity score will be less, which will be used as the similarity metric in our retrieval calculations...|$|R
