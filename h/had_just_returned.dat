Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking {{down the stairs to the}} cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself.

5|$|The Army and Navy Union awarded {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst the Gold Medal of Honor for {{distinguished service}} in June 1945. The Kings County {{division of the}} Union was awarded a plaque for outstanding service to convalescent sailors by the Brooklyn Naval Hospital on May 24, 1946. The Brooklyn Navy Yard garrison sponsored a reception at their headquarters on May 25, 1946, for Lieutenant Charles W. Shea, the recipient of Medal of Honor, and Colonel Richard E. Cole who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> from overseas duty. The Union through their Cincinnati, Ohio, division adopted a resolution on August 13, 1948, asking the government to provide a bonus for World War II veterans.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the command}} of Brigadier George F.

Upon formation, the brigade consisted of the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment (Borders), the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment (Staffords), the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (OBLI), the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles (Ulsters) and supporting units. These were the brigade's original infantry battalions and all remained part of its order of battle.

5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{at a party}} held in Athens by court marshal Theodore Ypsilantis, Alexander became re-acquainted {{with one}} of his {{childhood}} friends, Aspasia Manos. She <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances. She was the daughter of Constantine's Master of the Horse, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons. Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> {{from a trip}} to Sorrento, {{called for}} a {{government}} meeting on the night of March 16. During the meeting he argued that the ultimatum needed to contain only one demand: the establishment of diplomatic relations. In his view, such an ultimatum would not have violated any genuine Lithuanian interests and would offer much-improved prospects for peaceful resolution of the conflict and a speedy relief of tension. It was in accordance with Beck's vision for Eastern Europe, which was based on a Warsaw-dominated Polish–Baltic–Scandinavian bloc free of Soviet or German influence, a modified version of Józef Piłsudski's Międzymorze, which required the normalization of relations with Lithuania. The removal of the other demands also reflected political pressure on Poland from the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to prevent the conflict from escalating into warfare.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E

5|$|On the July 7 {{episode of}} SmackDown, it was {{announced}} that Lesnar would be facing Randy Orton at SummerSlam, who himself <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> to WWE from injury. Two days later on July 9, WWE allowed Lesnar to have a one-off fight for UFC 200. Lesnar failed two of his drug tests for this fight, but he was not suspended by WWE because he is not a full-time performer. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar was the #5 draft pick for the Raw brand. Reports claimed that he would have been #1 had he not failed his UFC drug tests. Orton was drafted to SmackDown, thus making their match an interbrand match, while WWE billed their face-off as a match fifteen years in the making. Along with Heyman, Lesnar made his return to Raw on August 1 (his first appearance on WWE programming since WrestleMania 32), but during his segment Orton appeared and attacked Lesnar with an RKO. Lesnar then attacked Orton during his match the following night on SmackDown Live, performing an F-5 on Orton. At SummerSlam on August 21, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required ten staples. Much to Shane McMahon's dismay, Lesnar would later attack Shane with an F-5. The end made many people believe Lesnar had gone off script due to the severity of Orton's head wound. Lesnar was later storyline fined $500 for delivering an F-5 to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon and his assault on Orton. On September 24 at a house show in Chicago, Illinois, Lesnar defeated Orton in a no-disqualification rematch, with the match being billed as a Suplex City death match.|$|E
