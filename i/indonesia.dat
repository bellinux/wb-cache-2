40|$|Abstract—Due {{to rapid}} {{economic}} growth, <b>Indonesia’s</b> energy needs is rapidly increasing. <b>Indonesia’s</b> {{primary energy consumption}} has doubled in 2007 compared to 2003. <b>Indonesia’s</b> status change from oil net-exporter to oil net-importer country recently has increased <b>Indonesia’s</b> concern over energy security. Due to this, oil import becomes center of attention in the dynamics of <b>Indonesia’s</b> energy security. Conventional studies addressing <b>Indonesia’s</b> energy security have focused on energy production sector. This study explores <b>Indonesia’s</b> energy security considering energy import sector by modeling and simulating <b>Indonesia’s</b> energy-related policies using system dynamics. Simulation result of <b>Indonesia’s</b> energy security in 2020 in Business-As-Usual scenario shows that in term of supply demand ratio, energy security will be very high, but also it poses high dependence on energy import. The Alternative scenario result shows lower energy security in term of supply demand ratio and much lower dependence on energy import. It is {{also found that the}} Alternative scenario produce lower GDP growth...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} links between <b>Indonesia's</b> growth, debt, and trade {{performances}} from 1970 to 1990, and it compares <b>Indonesia's</b> performance with countries that have similar characteristics. This descriptive analysis points to the strong influence of oil revenue fluctuations, open capital markets, and exchange rate management on <b>Indonesia's</b> economy. A decomposition analysis of <b>Indonesia's</b> uses of external debt indicates that the financing of current account deficits cannot explain large proportions of rapid debt accumulation after 1970. Finally, <b>Indonesia's</b> real manufactured export growth of at least 28 percent per year during the 1980 s rivalled its regional neighbors. <b>Indonesia's</b> experience demonstrates that despite severe external shocks, sensible policy reforms can help developing countries to achieve impressive economic performances.

5|$|<b>Indonesia</b> is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, <b>Indonesia</b> {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. <b>Indonesia</b> is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, <b>Indonesia</b> has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, <b>Indonesia</b> remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently <b>Indonesia</b> adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in <b>Indonesia.</b> This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, <b>Indonesia</b> is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{to what extent}} <b>Indonesia’s</b> transition to democracy has impacted Jakarta’s foreign policy, particularly regarding the foreign policy-making process, its fundamental doctrine, and foreign policy strategies in three specific areas: regional cooperation in ASEAN, promotion of political values, and conflict management. The puzzle this thesis addresses is that <b>Indonesia’s</b> foreign policy in many ways does not conform to expectations generated by theoretical works on democratization and foreign policy. The dissertation argues that <b>Indonesia’s</b> democratisation has affected Jakarta’s foreign policy only in a mixed and limited fashion. While <b>Indonesia’s</b> democratisation has shaped ideas that have influenced <b>Indonesia’s</b> foreign policy, some traditional foreign policy pillars continue to be relevant. First, notwithstanding <b>Indonesia’s</b> democratic transition, Jakarta remains committed {{to the principle of}} an independent and active (bebas-aktif) foreign policy. As such, maintaining a balanced presence of big powers remains a key explanation for <b>Indonesia’s</b> policies on East Asia cooperation. Second, while democratisation has led to the proliferation of foreign policy actors, foreign policy-making remains largely unaltered, with the president and the foreign minister serving as the central decision-makers. However, democratisation has changed the substance or style of Indonesian foreign policy, and such a change is discernible in efforts to shape political cooperation in ASEAN, Jakarta’s management of conflict on Ambalat dispute with Malaysia, and its Myanmar policy. Additionally, democracy and human rights now prominently feature in <b>Indonesia’s</b> foreign policy strategy towards the wider Asia. Significantly, however, while democracy promotion has been driven by the desire of <b>Indonesia’s</b> foreign policy leaders to reflect its newfound identity, human rights promotion has been lacking in <b>Indonesia’s</b> promotion of political values abroad due to domestic considerations. Hence, frameworks focusing on the role of identity and ideas in foreign policy flowing from democratization offer an important, yet insufficient explanation of <b>Indonesia’s</b> foreign policy in the cases discussed. Using an integrative approach that draws on works on the role of leaders, the salience of institutions, and the influence of identity and ideas in foreign policy, this study contributes to the wider discussion about the relationship between democratisation and foreign policy...|$|R
