5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
500|$|According to Njál's saga, Gormflaith [...] "egged on her son Sigtrygg {{very much}} to kill King Brian", sending him to win the support of Earl Sigurd of Orkney, and Bróðir and Óspak of Man at any price. Sigtrygg arrived in Orkney for Sigurd's Yule feast, where <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high seat between the two brothers-in-law, Earl Sigurd of Orkney and Earl Gilli of the Southern Isles. The saga also records that Sigtrygg was very {{interested}} in the Burning of Njáll Þorgeirsson at Bergþórshvoll and what had happened since. Afterwards, Sigtrygg bade Sigurd {{to go to war with}} him against Brian. Despite Sigurd's initial hesitance and against the advice of his men, he eventually agreed to arrive in Dublin by Palm Sunday with all his men, on the condition that if Brian was slain, Sigurd would marry Gormflaith and become King of Ireland.|$|E
500|$|Hale's {{legal theory}} was highly {{influenced}} by both Coke and Selden. He {{argued that the}} making of the law was a contract, but that it was subject to a test of [...] "reasonable" [...] character, something that only the judges could rule on. In this way, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> middle ground between Selden and Coke. This was in conflict with the argument of Hobbes. In 1835, Hale's [...] "Reflections on Hobbes' Dialogue" [...] was discovered; Frederick Pollock posits that since Hobbes' Dialogue was first published in 1681, six years after Hale's death, Hale must have seen an early copy or draft. D.E.C. Yale, writing in the Cambridge Law Journal, suggests that Chief Justice Vaughan had access to the Dialogue, and may have passed a copy on to Hale before his death. In his Reflections, Hale agreed with Coke that the judge's task was to bring the reason of the common law (the coherence of the legal system) in line with the reason of the law in question (to justify that law). He disagreed with Hobbes that a layman could understand the law, saying that [...] "he that hath been educated {{in the study of the}} law hath a great advantage over those that have been otherwise exercised". The distinction between Coke and Hale is that Hale agreed with Selden that law was created through agreement, and disagreed that reason had an inherent binding power. Hale agreed with Hobbes that the interpretation of the law could not be left to individual reason, and that the law is not an exact science; the best that can be produced is a set of laws which give a reasonable outcome in the majority of cases.|$|E

Zyazikov blamed Chechen rebels for that attack and a June 2004 raid in Ingushetia that killed more than 90 people.|$|R

60|$|Tavernake rose to {{his feet}} and lit a cigarette--a new habit with him, while Beatrice busied herself with a small coffee-making machine. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> easy-chair and smoked slowly. He was still wearing his {{ready-made}} clothes, but his collar was of the fashionable shape, his tie well chosen and neatly adjusted. He seemed somehow to have developed.|$|R

2500|$|On 23 January 1788, he {{transferred}} into the 41st Regiment of Foot, then again on 25 June 1789, still a lieutenant, {{he transferred}} to the 12th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons and, according to military historian Richard Holmes, he also dipped a reluctant toe into politics. Shortly before the general election of 1789, {{he went to the}} rotten borough of Trim to speak against the granting of the title [...] "Freeman" [...] of Dublin to the parliamentary leader of the Irish Patriot Party, Henry Grattan. Succeeding, he was later nominated and duly elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Trim in the Irish House of Commons. Because of the limited suffrage at the time, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parliament where at least two-thirds of the members owed their election to the landowners of fewer than a hundred boroughs. Wellesley continued to serve at Dublin Castle, voting with the government in the Irish parliament over the next two years. He became a captain on 30 January 1791, and was transferred to the 58th Regiment of Foot.|$|E
2500|$|Thoreau also {{influenced}} many artists and authors including Edward Abbey, Willa Cather, Marcel Proust, William Butler Yeats, Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, Upton Sinclair, E. B. White, Lewis Mumford, Frank Lloyd Wright, Alexander Posey, and Gustav Stickley. Thoreau {{also influenced}} naturalists like John Burroughs, John Muir, E. O. Wilson, Edwin Way Teale, Joseph Wood Krutch, B. F. Skinner, David Brower, and Loren Eiseley, whom Publishers Weekly called [...] "the modern Thoreau". English writer Henry Stephens Salt wrote {{a biography of}} Thoreau in 1890, which popularized Thoreau's ideas in Britain: George Bernard Shaw, Edward Carpenter, and Robert Blatchford were among those who became Thoreau enthusiasts {{as a result of}} Salt's advocacy. Mohandas Gandhi first read Walden in 1906 while working as a civil rights activist in Johannesburg, South Africa. He first read Civil Disobedience [...] "while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> South African prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the Indian population in the Transvaal. The essay galvanized Gandhi, who wrote and published a synopsis of Thoreau's argument, calling its 'incisive logic [...] unanswerable' and referring to Thoreau as 'one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced'." [...] He told American reporter Webb Miller, [...] " [...] ideas influenced me greatly. I adopted some of them and recommended the study of Thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of Indian Independence. Why I actually took the name of my movement from Thoreau's essay 'On the Duty of Civil Disobedience', written about 80years ago." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Sabin {{was deep}} <b>in</b> thought. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> easy-chair {{with his back}} to the window, his hands crossed upon his stick, his eyes fixed upon the fire. Duson was moving noiselessly about the room, cutting the morning's supply of {{newspapers}} and setting them out upon the table. His master was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mood which he had been taught to respect. It was Mr. Sabin who broke the silence.|$|R
60|$|They {{had already}} bidden their hostess good-night, and getting their things, {{they set out}} to walk their {{different}} ways. When Dick got home he did not go to bed. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> armchair, considering the events of the evening, and trying to find some way out of the complexity of his thoughts. He was surprised when the morning sun sent a bright ray of light into his room.|$|R

60|$|While Lingard spoke Willems {{looked up}} quickly, but soon his head {{fell on his}} breast in the {{discouraging}} certitude that the knowledge he and Hudig had wished for so much {{had come to him}} too late. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> listless attitude.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Chalk, {{about to}} speak, checked himself and blew his nose instead.

60|$|Montezuma {{was carried}} to his chamber. When he {{recovered}} sensibility, he refused absolutely to allow his wounds to be dressed, and tore off the bandages.

He had drunk deeply of the cup of humiliation, {{at the hands of}} the Spaniards; but this last drop filled it to overflowing. There was nothing for him but to die.|$|R

60|$|In a spacious, sparsely {{furnished}} room {{she found the}} Duke awaiting her, wearing now a gown of black and gold that was trimmed with rich fur. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tall chair of oak and leather, and leaning {{on the back of}} it lounged gracefully the lovely scarlet youth who had ridden at his side.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{corner of}} the {{playroom}} pretending to watch a game of dominoes and once or twice {{he was able to}} hear for an instant the little song of the gas.

60|$|The pilot {{had indeed}} an {{intelligent}} cast of countenance, but as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> careless {{attitude in the}} bow of the boat smoking listlessly and gazing dreamily, almost stupidly, towards the shore, it did seem as though he had indulged too freely in the noxious drag which poisons so many inhabitants of these unhappy lands.|$|E
