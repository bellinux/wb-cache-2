5|$|Bolt {{turned his}} main {{focus to the}} 200 m and equalled Roy Martin's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships. This {{performance}} attracted interest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to Maurice Greene's season's best that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Brown {{was briefly}} hospitalized for hypertension, {{and near the}} end of his term, he {{underwent}} quadruple bypass surgery. While recovering from the surgery, Brown suffered a rare pulmonary disease, keeping him hospitalized for weeks, part of which he was comatose. He had no pulse for a period of time, and one of his lungs partially collapsed. Brown's office tried to conceal the seriousness of his condition, drawing fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> Following his recovery, he gave up smoking and took up jogging.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, 2002, Blizzard Entertainment {{announced}} {{the development of}} StarCraft: Ghost in conjunction with fellow video game company Nihilistic Software. Nihilistic aimed to release the game for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube video game consoles in late 2003, which elicited positive reactions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> The game was consistently delayed, and during {{the third quarter of}} 2004, Nihilistic discontinued their work on the project. Blizzard stated that Nihilistic had completed the tasks it had been contracted for, and the game would be delivered on time.|$|E
5|$|The competition's viewing {{figures have}} been rising since 2002. In 2007, {{approximately}} 4.1million Swedes—almost 44% of the country's population—watched the final, and between 2.9million and 3.2million viewers watched each of the semifinals. The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990. Melodifestivalen is given heavy coverage in the Swedish press. A study by the Economic Science and Communication Department at Karlstad University concluded that coverage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> may have influenced {{the results of the}} 2007 festival.|$|E
5|$|The single drama {{was first}} shown on BBC One and BBC HD on 28 December 2008 {{as part of}} BBC One's Christmas 2008 line-up, {{and it was the}} most watched {{programme}} of the day. Compared to Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film, it received mostly negative reviews <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> The production was criticised for its historical inaccuracies, particularly its use of anachronistic props.|$|E

5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The Silence of the Lambs. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> but Moore claimed she {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E
5|$|Dean was {{the highest}} ranking UN {{prisoner}} of war of the Korean War. He was also the highest ranking Medal of Honor recipient. His story of capture and imprisonment by the North Koreans was recorded by numerous publications. His initial capture was covered by Life Magazine in July 1950 with a photo essay detailing his life. In December 1951, when he was discovered to be alive, TIME Magazine did an article on his story and imprisonment, featuring an image of him on the magazine's front cover. He subsequently received more attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> Multiple media outlets attempted to interview Dean but the North Koreans rarely allowed it. Few photos and little information on his status was released, mostly that which showed him in good condition. After his release, Dean's story, as well as Lee's, was told in Life Magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Maine Republicans {{refused to}} pass more anti-alcohol legislation, and Dow quit {{the party to}} join the Prohibitionists; he {{instantly}} became the party's most prominent member. His friend and ally James Black requested that Dow's name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the 1880 convention, to which Dow agreed. The convention that met in Cleveland that June welcomed delegates from twelve states, but attracted almost no attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> Dow himself did not attend, staying home with his ailing wife (candidates for a party's nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time). He was nominated, heading a ticket with vice-presidential nominee Henry A. Thompson of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since 2010, Penn State visited TCF Bank Stadium {{to face a}} Minnesota team looking for their fourth {{consecutive}} Big Ten victory, and their eighth win of the season, {{which would have been}} their first time since the 2003 season. There was consensus among both Penn State's and Minnesota's SB Nation sites, as well as independent picks, that Minnesota would win a relatively close game. Minnesota's offense was one of the better rushing teams in the conference (20th in the nation), but Penn State's defense was also pretty good against the run, making it a good matchup. Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg in tandem with a running game that, in theory, was led by Bill Belton and supplemented by Zach Zwinak, and receivers Allen Robinson had potential to score a lot of points. Keys to the game included avoiding turnovers and running the football. Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill, recovering from seizures stemming from epilepsy, coached <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> box.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> on his supposed indecency, poor {{taste and}} lack of creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm. He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
5|$|R.S. Yeoman's 2014 {{edition of}} A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the Lafayette dollar at $650 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) ranging upwards to $19,000 in near-pristine MS-66. One in MS-67 condition, tied with {{multiple}} others {{for the best}} condition known, sold in 2004 for $66,700. Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> into a hopper and no {{attempt was made to}} preserve their appearance for collectors. Although whether the specimen is well-struck or not rarely affects value, clearly struck specimens will show the engraving line separating Lafayette's boot from the rest of his uniform, and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct. The highest points on the coin, at which wear should be most apparent, are Washington's cheekbone on the obverse and the face of Lafayette on the reverse.|$|E

5|$|Some nudes {{by foreign}} artists {{were held in}} private English collections, but Britain had no {{tradition}} of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and {{the reaction of the}} lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. (Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.) From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.|$|E
5|$|The Enquiry into Plants (along {{with the}} Causes of Plants) was first {{translated}} into Latin by Theodore Gaza by 1454, circulated in manuscript, and then published at Treviso in 1483. In its original Greek it first appeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> of Aldus Manutius at Venice, 1495–98, {{from a single}} corrupt manuscript which has since been lost. Wimmer identified two manuscripts of first quality, the Codex Urbinas in the Vatican Library, which was not made known to Johann Gottlob Schneider, who with H. F. Link made the first modern critical edition, Leipzig 1818–1821, and the excerpts in the Codex Parisiensis in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture of}} the 15th century Poland can be {{described}} as retaining typical medieval characteristics. Nonetheless, the crafts and industries in existence already in the preceding centuries became more highly developed under favorable social and economic conditions, and their products were much more widely disseminated. Paper production was one of the new industries that appeared, and printing developed during {{the last quarter of the}} century. In 1473, Kasper Straube produced the first Latin print in Kraków, whereas Kasper Elyan printed Polish texts for the first time in Wrocław (Breslau) in 1475. The world's oldest prints in Cyrillic script, namely religious texts in Old Church Slavonic, appeared after 1490 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> of Schweipolt Fiol in Krakow.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavated}} hoard {{was taken}} to the British Museum. The discovery was leaked to the press, and on 19 November, the Sun newspaper ran a front-page story, alongside a picture of Lawes with his metal detector. Although the full contents of the hoard and its value were still unknown, the newspaper article claimed that the hoard was worth £10 million. In response to the unexpected publicity, the British Museum held a press conference at the museum on 20 November to announce the discovery. Newspapers lost interest in the hoard quickly, allowing British Museum curators to sort, clean and stabilize the hoard without further disruption <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> The initial cleaning and basic conservation of the hoard was completed within a month of its discovery.|$|E
