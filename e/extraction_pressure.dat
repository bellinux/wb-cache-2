40|$|Purpose: Particle size of Beclometasone Dipropionate (BDP) {{was reduced}} by the rapid {{expansion}} of supercritical solution (RESS) process, using CO 2 as supercritical solvent. Also, the effect of RESS parameters such as <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure,</b> pre-expansion temperature, and weight fraction of co-solvent on the size and distribution of BDP particles were investigated. Methods: The effects of <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure</b> (200 - 260 bar), pre-expansion temperature (70 - 110 °C) and weight fraction of menthol as a co-solvent on mean particle size (MPS) of BDP were investigated by design of experiment (DOE). Particles were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Results: The average sizes of precipitated BDP were between 64. 1 and 294 nm. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure</b> was the most significant parameter and a higher <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure</b> caused production of smaller particles. Also, it was found that higher temperature and weight fraction of co-solvent increased the MPS. The interaction effects of extraction pressure-pre-expansion temperature and pre-expansion temperature-co-solvent ratio were significant through the analysis of variance. It was observed that the MPS of precipitated particles was mostly influenced by pressure. Conclusion: The smallest MPS of BDP obtained from the RESS process was 65 nm that revealed a significant size reduction from its original MPS of 9 μm. Moreover, a slight change was observed for precipitated particles of BDP into spherical form while the original particles were irregular in shape.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the phase behaviour of CO 2 –brine and CO 2 –oil systems under various operating conditions. Through this study, CO 2 solubility measurement tests were carried out for CO 2 –water, CO 2 –brine, and CO 2 –oil mixtures at various equilibrium pressures ranging Peq = 0. 7 – 10. 3 MPa and temperatures ranging Texp = 21 – 40 °C. Additionally, series of oil swelling/extraction tests were conducted at aforementioned experimental conditions using a see-through high- pressure cell to determine the oil swelling factor at various equilibrium conditions. CO 2 solubility measurement tests showed that at constant temperatures, an increase in CO 2 solubility value was observed for CO 2 –water, CO 2 –brine, and CO 2 –oil mixtures when the equilibrium pressure increases. Furthermore, as it was expected for all mixtures, the solubility of CO 2 reduces with increased temperature. In this study, it was also found that at a constant temperature, the oil swelling factor, SF, increases up to a pressure so called <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure,</b> Pext, at which majority of the light to medium hydrocarbon groups in the oil phase are extracted by CO 2 and vaporized into the CO 2 -rich phase. Additionally, it was observed that for the pressures higher than the <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure,</b> the oil swelling factor reduced with equilibrium pressure because more hydrocarbon components were extracted at higher pressures. The <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure</b> was determined at different experimental temperatures and results revealed that the <b>extraction</b> <b>pressure</b> increases by increasing experimental temperature. Comparison of the CO 2 solubility values in oil at extraction pressures corresponding to different experimental temperatures also showed that the major hydrocarbon extraction occurs when a certain amount of CO 2 has dissolved in the oil phase which is called threshold CO 2 solubility, χth.
