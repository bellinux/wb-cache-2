5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E
25|$|When small {{silica dust}} {{particles}} are inhaled, they can embed themselves deeply <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> alveolar sacs and ducts in the lungs, where oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} gases are exchanged. There, the lungs cannot clear out the dust by mucous or coughing.|$|E
25|$|Ridley also improvised a vital {{piece of}} {{equipment}} at the last minute. Two days before taking the X-1 on its first supersonic flight, Chuck Yeager broke two ribs in a horseback riding accident. With the aid of an understanding civilian doctor, {{he was able to}} conceal his condition from everyone but Ridley. Without the full use of his right arm, however, {{it would be impossible to}} seal himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> X-1 cockpit. Ridley quietly provided a length of broom handle that Yeager was able to use to close the hatch without difficulty.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few moments}} the little {{creature}} had spun two slender but strong strands that reached way across the gulf, one being five or six feet above the other. When these were completed the Scarecrow started across <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> bridge, walking upon one strand as a person walks upon a rope, and holding to the upper strand with his hands {{to prevent him from}} losing his balance and toppling over <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gulf. <b>The</b> <b>tiny</b> threads held him safely, thanks to the strength given them by the magic pills.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} pollinated by insects. In {{a survey of}} {{pollinator}}s in Alberta, the primary pollinator was Osmia proxima, a mason bee. Other pollinators included several hoverflies, such as Eriozona laxus, Eristalis hirta, Eristalis rupium, and Eupeodes lapponicus. The insects were observed probing the flower spur with their mouthparts and then getting the sticky pollen wads stuck on their heads as they pushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flower. <b>The</b> <b>tiny,</b> light seeds are dispersed on the wind.|$|R
25|$|As the prototypes took shape, the {{exterior}} lines resembled {{more of a}} Ferrari or Porsche than a typical GM car, but the tight budget was taking its toll on the design, particularly on Aldikacti's dream of a high performance, aluminum-block V6; the cost of developing a new engine {{would be more than}} the production of the whole car itself. Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for the Pontiac, the “Iron Duke,” nicknamed for its heavy iron block. This engine was too blocky to fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> car so it was equipped with a smaller oil pan, causing the engine to always run a quart low.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{powerful}} argument hooks discusses is one {{in which}} she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught {{that the most important thing}} she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, [...] "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love" [...] (hooks). Another central argument in hooks's All About Love is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone. This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.|$|E

50|$|The western {{banded gecko}} is a {{terrestrial}} lizard, ranging in total length (including tail) from 4 - 6 in. Hatchlings measure 1 in.

50|$|The long-tailed planigale has an {{extraordinary}} head shape. All planigales have a flattened head, much broader {{than it is}} deep. This smallest planigale takes that trend to an extreme: at just 3 to 4 mm from top to bottom, the skull is one-fifth as deep as it is wide. The purpose, it seems, is {{to allow it to}} squeeze <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> of soil cracks; to find its prey, perhaps to avoid predators, or more probably for both reasons. The clays and blacksoils of the Top End typically develop deep cracks as they dry after the monsoonal summer rains, which persist right through the eight-month dry season until the wet begins again, usually producing floods that force small creatures like the Long-tailed Planigale to seek refuge on high ground.|$|R
25|$|Crystal Beach, a populous {{community}} located roughly at {{the midpoint}} of the peninsula, was submerged and destroyed; waves and wind pounded houses, and even some houses elevated on 14-ft (4.3m) stilts rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waters. <b>The</b> <b>tiny</b> beachfront community of Gilchrist, which sat astride the north-facing Rollover Bay on Bolivar, was completely swept away, save for only a few homes. One of these homes, the only one in its neighborhood to remain intact (although it was rendered uninhabitable), attracted widespread media interest after images of it began to appear in newspapers and on television. At least six bodies were found in an extensive search.|$|R

50|$|As the Gray Seal, {{he wears}} a mask and carries a girdle full of lock picks and such meaning no door or safe can defy him. A case starts with Dale {{receiving}} a letter in a roundabout way from the woman with very complete instructions on what he is to do. There is never any explanation how she gains such incredible knowledge of every crime, every house and every criminal and even how she knows everything about Dale, though she too has an underworld identity. He memorises each letter then tears them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> pieces and discards them. He has searched for clues as to who she is but has found none. Though Dale carries a gun, he does not kill, not even when a thief stole a letter before he read it and learned his identity. It is mostly used as a threat. The Gray Seal originally has {{the respect of the}} Underworld, thinking him another thief but when he exposes to the police a crooked lawyer who helped many of them as well as some crooks, they want him dead.|$|R

50|$|The {{marshmallow}} is a foam, {{consisting of}} an aqueous continuous phase and a gaseous (air) dispersed phase. In {{addition to being}} a foam, this also makes marshmallows an aerated confection because it is made up of 50% air. The goal of an aerated confection like marshmallow is to incorporate gas into a sugar mixture, and stabilize the aerated product before the gas can escape. When the gas is introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> system, <b>tiny</b> air bubbles are created. This is what contributes to the unique textural properties, and mouth-feel of this product.|$|R

At least six bodies were found in an extensive search. Two flood water sensors in Chambers County, Texas survived Ike's storm surge, while those on eastern Bolivar Peninsula were left inoperable during the hurricane. Along the Eastern shores of Galveston Bay surge heights were measured at 16.9 feet (5.15 m) and a measurement along SH126 measured 17.0 feet (5.18 m). Massive amounts of surge carried debris, largely from Bolivar Peninsula and southern Chambers County were left along the northern coast of Rollover bay Chambers county.|$|R
25|$|Swim Little Fish Swim {{focuses on}} the {{domestic}} life of Leeward (Dustin Guy Defa) and Mary (Brooke Bloom), a young married couple at a crossroads. Mary is a hardworking nurse determined to turn the couple’s lives around while Leeward is a struggling marginal musician who fancies himself a misunderstood artist and New Age visionary.

40|$|Meteorites {{contain a}} record of impacts during all stages of {{asteroid}} origin and evolution: the formation and accretion of chondritic particles; the alteration, metamorphism and melting of asteroids; and the erosion and disruption of asteroids by hypervelocity impacts. A review of meteorite classification shows that numerous meteorites are not readily classified {{because they do not}} fit simple models for asteroid formation and evolution that assume impacts were only important during the final stage of asteroid evolution and because of inadequate understanding of asteroidal impacts. Chronological, textural, and thermal constraints allow us to identify mete-orite impact breccias that formed during accretion (e. g., Kaidun), when asteroids were partly molten (e. g., mesosiderites), and during the subsequent disruption of asteroids (e. g., L chon-drites). Studies of chondrites including Kaidun suggest that chondrules accreted with similar-sized fragments of preexisting bodies that formed at greater heliocentric distances. In the inner solar system, chondrules appear to have been crucial for initiating accretion. Without chon-drules and rock fragments, dry dust failed to accrete to the nebular midplane because of nebular turbulence and spiraled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> protosun. <b>The</b> <b>tiny</b> mass of asteroids may be partly due to inefficient chondrule formation beyond 2 AU or less-efficient delivery of chondrules from near the protosun. 1...|$|R
