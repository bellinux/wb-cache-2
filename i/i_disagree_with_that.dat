Attorney General Greg Abbott, {{on behalf of the}} state of Texas, moved to intervene to block the divorce, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. On October 1, 2009, Dallas District Judge Tena Callahan rejected Texas's intervention and held that the Texas Constitution's ban on same-sex marriage, article I, section 32(a), known as Proposition 2, violated the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses. Schulte commented: [...] "I have a feeling {{there are going to be}} opponents who say this is going to allow the floodgates of gay marriage to open, and <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Gay marriage and gay divorce are two separate things."

The future likelihood of a borrower defaulting is probabilistic, and so the terms (the risk premia) and conditions on which a borrower can raise cash, her access to liquidity, are stochastic and time varying, Section III.

I look at two cases in particular in this intersection area: the development of the Hodgkin–Huxley giant squid model for action potentials, and at a more recent model of Ferrée and Lockery for worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) chemo-taxis. The Hodgkin–Huxley strategy uses equations, but in specialized ways involving empirical curve-fitting and heuristic approximations, to build their model.

My analysis begins <b>with</b> the proposition <b>that</b> all tort rules are loss-allocating.

All tort rules determine who will bear a loss and thus all are loss-allocating. In addition to all tort rules being loss-allocating, I believe that most affect conduct. The reason is directly tied to loss-allocation. Loss-allocation creates incentives for those who must bear the loss to behave differently than they would if they did not bear the loss. To the extent people respond to incentives, tort rules will affect conduct II As I note later in the paper, these effects on conduct may not always be intended by the lawmaker, and in particular situations, the conduct effect of two different rules may be quite small.

40|$|Assumptions are the rule, not the exception, in both {{descriptive}} and causal inference {{in the social}} sciences. This fact has long {{been used as a}} defense of the specific families of assumptions used to make causal inferences on the basis of regression-type models (Freedman 2004 : 195). Yet the defense is weak. Inferences differ in terms of the strength, complexity, plausibility, and testability of the assumptions they require. On all of these fronts, regression-type analysis of observational data often performs so poorly {{that it is difficult to}} give the results a persuasive causal interpretation. In what follows, I will make this argument by showing how hard it can be to assign causal interpretations to regression models that show either unstable or stable results across the range of models that the discipline considers plausible, as well as the challenges involved with drawing causal conclusions from either the unconditional or the conditional analysis of quantitative observational data. For these reasons, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Gerring’s argument <b>that</b> the regression analysis of messy data is a good default option for social scientists; instead, it is a weak default, and one far more suited to describing initial facts, discovering puzzles, and characterizing patterns than to causal inference.

40|$|Sylvia Plath {{wrote in}} the midst of growing racial {{tensions}} in 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s America. Her work demonstrates ambivalence towards her role as a middle-class white woman. In this paper, I examine the racial implications in Plath’s color terms. <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Renée Curry’s reading in White Women Writing White that Plath only considers her whiteness insofar as it affects herself. Through a phenomenological study of how whiteness shifts meaning in this poem, I hope to show that Curry’s negative estimation is only partly right. I suggest that embodiment is a problem for Plath in general, and this contributes to her inability to fully examine other bodies. “Everything you painted you painted white” (Hughes, 1998, p. 197) In this paper, I show how philosophy and poetry can help each other work out their overlapping concerns. * I focus on the concepts of releasement, freedom, otherness and difference, especially as they relate to race. Sylvia Plath’s poetry is instructive for uncovering the ways in which privilege remains hidden to individual subjects, entire groups of people, and within poetry. Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological account of the body will reveal Plath’s inabilities to properly understand her own embodiment as a subject and agent who is at once privileged and marginalized. Recently, Renée Curry has suggested that Plath’s extensive use of color terms should be analyzed for their social and political meanings. While I agree with Curry on this point, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> her claim <b>that</b> Plath does not move beyond her own interests and concerns. Phenomenology helps us see Plath’s limitations are not limited to ignorance of the raced body. Rather, her ignorance of the body in general affects and infects her ability to more fully understand race and gender.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I deal with Bernard Mandeville's views on {{political}} economy, {{in order to}} reconstruct his overall perspectives on individual moral psychology and {{on the topic of}} luxury. First, I discuss Mandeville's views on labour, wages, political management and the balance of trade against the background of contemporary paradigms of 'mercantilism' and 'free trade'. I argue that he freely moved between these categories, and I also contend that they can not be taken as a rigid orthodoxy, which would prevent a real historical recovery of their meaning. Then I turn to his discussion of luxury. I maintain that this aspect of Mandeville's thought {{can not be reduced to}} a paradoxical provocation (however brilliant), but must be reconstructed along a three-dimensional framework, because Mandeville elaborated the relative difference between needs and desires in three contexts. This framework was not explicitly stated by Mandeville, but can be recosntructed through a close reading of his writings: first, an international context, in which certain countries specialised in exporting, whereas others in consuming, luxury goods; secondly, a social context, in which the differentiation between luxuries and wants mirrors a social hierarchy; and finally an evolutionary dimension, in which the consumption of luxury goods helps spread benefits to all social ranks in the next generations. In a final section I reconsider the classic question of Mandeville's role in the growth of political economy and his alledged theory of 'possessive individualism' coupled <b>with</b> classical liberalism. <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> those reconstructions <b>that</b> take for granted the attendant rise of free trade, individualism and liberalism.

40|$|In my paper, I {{argue that}} Kant {{identifies}} a good will with {{an end in}} itself. I provide textual support for this interpretation from several of Kant’s works.

First, because a good will is a negative end, i. e. one that limits the kind of subjective ends that can be adopted, {{it is the right}} logical type of end to be identified with an end in itself. Second, Kant claims both that a good will {{is the only thing that}} has absolute worth and that an end in itself has absolute worth. The focus of my paper is to defend this interpretation from the objection that it has morally repugnant consequences. Commentators including Henry Allison argue that if Kant identifies a good will with an end in itself then only rational beings that possess a good will must be treated as ends in themselves and never as mere means. I agree <b>with</b> Allison <b>that</b> Kant could not have intended to exclude the many rational beings lacking a good will from the fullest sort of moral consideration. <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Allison <b>that</b> the good will interpretation has this consequence. I argue that Allison’s objection can be met by attending to a distinction Kant makes between two kinds of ends in themselves. I claim that Kant identifies a good will with an actual end in itself. This kind of end has absolute worth and the status of an end in itself. I claim that Kant identifies all rational beings as practical ends in themselves. This kind of end does not have absolute worth or the status of an end in itself but must be treated as if it did. I draw a detailed analogy between Kant’s argument for the formula of humanity as an end in itself and his argument that rational beings are practically free to demonstrate that Kant makes this distinction. I claim that just as rational beings are practically rather than actually free in virtue of necessarily representing themselves as free, they are practically rather than actually ends in themselves in virtue of necessarily representing themselves as ends in themselves. Furthermore, just as rational beings are bound by the laws of freedom whether they are actually or practically free, they are bound by moral laws whether they are actually or practically ends in themselves. It follows that the moral law to treat others always as an end and never as mere means applies to all rational beings in virtue of necessarily representing themselves as ends in themselves, whether or not they have a good will and are actually ends in themselves. Thus, recognizing the distinction between two kinds of ends in themselves renders the good will interpretation of Kant compatible <b>with</b> the claim <b>that</b> all rational beings must be treated always as an end and never as mere means.

40|$|After Harold Bloom’s Anxiety of Influence, {{questions}} about influence surrounding Shakespeare rather exploded; feminist readings, post-Foucault readings, and other recent scholarship {{have all been}} interested in where Shakespeare’s genius might have come from. When Bloom revised the work, he commented that he was wrong to claim that Shakespeare had no influences and goes into a long discussion about Shakespeare’s relationship to Marlowe – a discussion particularly relevant here, as he finds much “Marlovian” in Shakespeare’s character Richard III. Although I do not deny the importance of Marlowe for creating Richard III, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Bloom <b>that</b> {{he was the only}} influence involved for Shakespeare. The problem with suggesting other influences on Shakespeare’s Richard III is proving them. To “prove” literary influence can be either very difficult or very easy – after all, Bloom does not engage in a great deal of close reading to “prove” his statement that Marlowe influenced Shakespeare’s Richard – he is Harold Bloom; he says it and there are few questions, particularly as the general resemblance is easy to spot. However, I am attempting something closer to a paternity test than an examination of family photographs: I want to demonstrate that Thomas Legge’s Richardus Tertius is a likely influence on Richard III. There is only one way to establish this probability. The two plays share a historiographic inheritance {{in the form of the}} chronicles – so we must remove any commonality that can be traced to this common, older source-material. Seneca, too, is a shared “influence” on them both – proved by multiple other scholars, and therefore a fact 3 that I will accept rather than question here. Nevertheless, there are some moments that could come from Legge or Seneca, and those should be examined carefully. But any moments that remain, that belong to neither Seneca nor the chronicles, can be taken, added, quantified, and gathered into proof of influence. Once the issue of influence has been examined, a more complicated one emerges. Both Legge and Shakespeare must find language to handle the audience’s foreknowledge of their plots. Legge uses “fate” as a stand in for history, eliminated the need for strong characters and giving his play an overall feeling of inevitability, and Shakeseare uses “curse,” thereby allowing the strong characters that make Richard III function. Both men must make choices about negotiating the problems of pre-plottedness, and in doing so, create very different play structures despite their multiple connections to each other. Written by Master of Caius College Thomas Legge in 1580, more than six thousand lines that I will accept rather than question here. Nevertheless, there are some moments that could come from Legge or Seneca, and those should be examined carefully.

40|$|I {{have never}} given {{much thought to}} where the {{rainwater}} collected from the roof goes. If pressed, I would have assumed that it was piped {{into one of the}} many Victorian drains which take the runo from the moors safely away from the house. If pressed further I would have given that answer a high probability of being correct, using a process of elimination (where else could it go?). I now know that I was spectacularly wrong. A previous owner had piped this water directly into the septic tank; a practice which is both illegal and likely to cause problems as the tank is not designed to be swamped by excess water. (For the uninitiated, many old houses on the moors are not connected to a mains drainage network, so dirty water from the house is collected in a tank where the solids settle out, and then the grey water is treated in a soakaway.) We had to renew our soakaway and decided to replace it with a reed bed and living soakaway. The rainwater is now diverted into a new pond, which will undoubtedly be a topic of a future article. This puts me in mind of Donald Rumsfeld's comment at a press brie ng in 2002 when he was US Defense Secretary (since <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> so much <b>that</b> Rumsfeld did and stood for it pains me to use this quote, but it is a wonderful statement) : There are known knowns. There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don't know. To which I would add There are mistaken knowns. There are things we think we know, that we do not know. One such mistaken known, for me, is in my understanding of the legal concept of guilt `beyond a reasonable doubt'. Beyond a reasonable doubt is the level of proof demanded by the US and British legal systems to allow a juror to support the conviction of an accused person in a criminal case.
