5|$|An <b>empty</b> matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. <b>Empty</b> {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for <b>empty</b> matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the <b>empty</b> product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E

Forty-five patients (9 M, 36 F) with a mean (SD) BMI of 37. 0 (4. 0) kg/m(2) entered the Study. The mean T- 50 (<b>emptying</b> of 50 %) of fluids was 20. 7 (10. 3) min, and that of solids 141. 9 (168. 3) min. The percentage <b>emptying</b> of solids was 34. 5 (19. 9) %/hr. CCK values peaked within 42 min and paralleled the subjective ratings of satiety but did not correlate with gastric <b>emptying.</b> Five of 45 subjects (11 %) had very prolonged gastric <b>emptying</b> of solids; they showed higher caloric intakes and higher insulin levels. They did not differ in CCK values and ratings of satiety but scored higher in being active and awake.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Data on the {{prevalence}} of abnormal gastric <b>emptying</b> in diabetic patients are still lacking. The relation between gastric <b>emptying</b> and dyspeptic symptoms assessed during gastric <b>emptying</b> measurement {{has not yet been}} investigated. The aim was to investigate {{the prevalence}} of delayed gastric <b>emptying</b> in a large cohort of unselected diabetic patients and to investigate the relation between gastric <b>emptying</b> and gastrointestinal sensations experienced in the 2 weeks before and during the test meal, prospectively. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Gastric <b>emptying</b> was evaluated in 186 patients (106 with type 1 diabetes, mean duration of diabetes 11. 6 +/- 11. 3 years) using 100 mg (13) C-enriched octanoic acid added to a solid meal. RESULTS: Gastric <b>emptying</b> was significantly slower in the diabetic subjects than in the healthy volunteers (T(50) : 99. 5 +/- 35. 4 vs. 76. 8 +/- 21. 4 min, P < 0. 003; Ret(120 min) : 30. 6 +/- 17. 2 vs. 20. 4 +/- 9. 7 %, P < 0. 006). Delayed gastric <b>emptying</b> was observed in 51 (28 %) diabetic subjects. The sensations experienced in the 2 weeks before the test were weakly correlated with the sensation scored during the gastric <b>emptying</b> test. Sensations assessed during the gastric <b>emptying</b> test did predict gastric <b>emptying</b> to some extent (r = 0. 46, P < 0. 0001), whereas sensations experienced in the previous 2 weeks did not.

Vagotomy significantly inhibited the <b>emptying</b> of both liquids and solids (p less than 0. 001) when the pyloric antrum was intact. When the antropyloric mechanism was removed by antrectomy, the effect of vagotomy was to accelerate the <b>emptying</b> of liquids (p less than 0. 05) but to impair the <b>emptying</b> of solids (p less than 0. 001). When the pylorus was destroyed by pyloroplasty, vagotomy markedly accelerated the <b>emptying</b> of liquids but {{had little effect on}} the <b>emptying</b> of solids.

We compared the effect on gastric <b>emptying</b> half-times (t) between AZI and ERY in patients diagnosed with gastroparesis by gastric <b>emptying</b> scintigraphy. Methods Patients stopped medications known to affect gastric <b>emptying</b> prior to the study, and then ingested 1 scrambled egg meal labeled with 18. 5 - 37 MBq of technetium- 99 m sulfur colloid followed by continuous imaging for 120 minutes, at 1 minute per frame. A simple linear fit {{was applied to the}} rate of gastric <b>emptying,</b> and gastric <b>emptying</b> t was calculated (normal = 45 - 90 minutes). At 75 - 80 minutes, if the stomach had clearly not <b>emptied,</b> patients were given either ERY (n = 60) or AZI (n = 60) 250 mg IV and a new post-treatment gastric <b>emptying</b> t was calculated.

40|$|Gastric <b>emptying</b> of indigestible solids {{depends on}} their size.

We studied gastric <b>emptying</b> of three differently shaped particles, (cubes, spheres, rods) of either hard or soft consistency during the fasting state in human volunteers. The shape of indigestible particles did not affect their <b>emptying.</b> The area under the gastric <b>emptying</b> curve (AUC: particles x hour) was for hard cubes 24. 7 (2. 2), for hard spheres 27. 9 (1. 6), for hard rods 26. 9 (2. 7). All soft particles <b>emptied</b> faster than their identically shaped hard counterparts, but there was no difference among the three shapes (AUC for soft cubes: 29. 2 (3. 0), for soft spheres 32. 0 (1. 8), for soft rods 34. 1 (1. 2).

40|$|The gastric <b>emptying</b> {{of a mixed}} {{solid and}} liquid meal was {{assessed}} in 24 normal subjects using a single camera/computer system which allowed continuous monitoring of both solids and liquids.

A technique for the correction of attenuation is described which used factors derived from a lateral image of the stomach. In all subjects, solid <b>emptying</b> was slower than liquid <b>emptying</b> and was characterised by a delay (lag period) which was followed by linear <b>emptying.</b> Liquid <b>emptying</b> usually followed a single exponential pattern.

Nine healthy volunteers were studied in basal condition, after intravenous administration of 200 mg erythromycin, and after peroral administration of 30 mg propantheline. Erythromycin significantly enhanced gastric <b>emptying</b> in all subjects, with an increase of the gastric <b>emptying</b> coefficient (p = 0. 0043) in eight of nine and a fall in both the gastric half <b>emptying</b> time (p = 0. 0020) and the lag phase (p = 0. 0044) in all nine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} know the role of gastric <b>emptying</b> in the {{mechanism}} of weight loss and early satiety after a restrictive surgical procedure for treatment of morbid obesity, a consecutive series of patients were scintigraphically investigated before and after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. METHODS: Sixteen patients undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding underwent preoperatively, and at 6 months postoperatively, a gastric <b>emptying</b> study (solid meal and single isotope). Esophageal retention time, lag phase, peak activity time, gastric <b>emptying</b> rate, fundus <b>emptying</b> rate, and weight loss were recorded. Upper GI symptom assessment {{was carried out by}} using a standardized questionnaire. Gastric <b>emptying</b> parameters were correlated with the upper GI symptoms. RESULTS: Gastric band placement showed no significant influence on postoperative gastric <b>emptying</b> rate [median % (interquartile range) : 42 (23. 3 - 59) preoperatively vs 38 (31 - 71) postoperatively and fundus <b>emptying</b> rate: 59 (37 - 91) preoperatively vs 70 (53 - 89) postoperatively]; however, an increase in early satiety was found. Neither gastric <b>emptying</b> rate nor fundus <b>emptying</b> rate showed a relation with early satiety or weight loss. Furthermore, no correlation was found between early satiety and lag phase, esophageal retention time, start of activity, and peak activity time in proximal stomach. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding seems not to affect gastric <b>emptying.</b> Neither a relation between postoperative gastric <b>emptying</b> rate and weight loss nor between early satiety and weight loss was found. Therefore, it is unlikely that gastric <b>emptying</b> plays a role in the mechanism of weight loss following laparoscopic adjustable gastric bandin...|$|R

In adrenal intact rats, i. c. v. injection of N/OFQ (2. 5 nmol rat(- 1)) significantly delayed gastric <b>emptying</b> (by 70 %) and increased plasma corticosterone concentrations. Conversely, in ADX rats, N/OFQ left gastric <b>emptying</b> unchanged.
