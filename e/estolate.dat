40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of erythromycin <b>estolate</b> and ethylsuccinate suspensions in infants under 4 {{months of age}} who were being treated for chlamydial infections or pertussis. We conducted our studies after the initial dose of 10 mg/kg and subsequently during steady-state treatment. The <b>estolate</b> preparation resulted in higher peak concentrations in sera, and its absorption and elimination half-lives were longer. Peak concentrations occurred 3 h after a dose with the <b>estolate</b> preparation and 1 h after a dose with the ethylsuccinate preparation. The area under the curve for the <b>estolate</b> preparation was about three times greater than that for the ethylsuccinate preparation. Based on these findings, we recommend that erythromycin <b>estolate</b> suspensions be given to young infants at 8 - or 12 -h intervals (30 mg/kg per day in three divided doses or 20 mg/kg per day in two divided doses) and that erythromycin ethylsuccinate is best given at 6 -h intervals (40 mg/kg per day in four divided doses) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of erythromycin <b>estolate</b> (500 mg) and erythromycin ethylsuccinate (600 mg) {{were compared}} in 12 healthy volunteers after single doses and after repeated oral doses (every 8 h).

The maximum concentration of drug in the serum, the half-life, and the area under the curve for erythromycin <b>estolate</b> were significantly greater than those of erythromycin ethylsuccinate after both regimens. After single and multiple doses, the respective areas under the curve of erythromycin base generated by <b>estolate</b> formulation were 3 and 1. 6 times greater (P less than 0. 05) than those of ethylsuccinate.

This study underscores the need for a specific high-pressure liquid chromatography assay and the importance of wide variability, rate-limited processes, changes with multiple doses, and the appearance of a second peak when one studies the pharmacokinetics of erythromycin esters.

Both erythromycin esters displayed very good plasma bactericidal activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The median bactericidal titers produced in plasma against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly higher with erythromycin <b>estolate</b> than with the ethylsuccinate ester at both 2 and 8 h after dosing (P less than 0. 05 by Student's t test). Both erythromycin esters showed rather weak bactericidal activity against Branhamella catarrhalis; a further look at these results indicated that erythromycin <b>estolate</b> presented 50 % of the plasma samples at 2 h with bactericidal titers superior or equal to 1 : 8, versus 11 % for the ethylsuccinate ester.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{administration}} of macrolide antibiotics on cytochrome P- 450 in liver microsomes of male rats were investigated. The macrolides tested were {{those with a}} 14 -membcred ring such as oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and eryth-romycin <b>estolate,</b> and those with a 16 -membered ring such as rokitamycin, leuco-mycin and josamycin. Cytochrome P- 450 -metabolite complex was detected with oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin <b>estolate,</b> whereas no such effect was observed with rokitamycin, leucomycin and josamycin. The content of uncompleted cytochrome P- 450 in liver microsomes remained unchanged with rokitamycin, leucomycin and josamycin, decreased with troleandomycin and oleandomycin, and increased with erythromycin and erythromycin <b>estolate,</b> indi-cating that oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin <b>estolate</b> also affect the amounts of other forms of cytochrome P- 450. The administration of oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin <b>estolate</b> resulted in a dramatic decrease {{in the activities of}} testosterone 2 a- and 16 a-hydroxylases in liver microsomes. Supporting these results, a marked decrease (more than 75 %) in the content of P- 450 -male, a major constitutive form of cytochrome P- 450 in male rats, was noted with oleandomycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin <b>estolate,</b> while the decrease was rather small with rokitamycin and leucomycin.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare azithromycin, a novel 15 -membered ring azalide, and erythromycin <b>estolate</b> for the potential to cause hepatic microsomal enzyme induction and inhibition in Sprague-Dawley rats. The daily oral administration of 800 mg of erythromycin <b>estolate</b> per kg for 7 days resulted in statistically significant elevations of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, erythromycin N-demethylase (3. 2 -fold), and total cytochrome P- 450 content. Approximately 40 % of cytochrome P- 450 was complexed with erythromycin metabolite. In contrast, the daily administration of 200 mg of azithromycin per kg for 7 days caused significant elevations of N-demethylase (2. 5 -fold) only and did not produce any increases in total cytochrome P- 450 content or NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. No complexed cytochrome P- 450 was detected in the azithromycin-dosed rats despite liver concentrations of azithromycin that were 118 times greater than the liver concentrations of erythromycin <b>estolate</b> in erythromycin estolate-dosed rats. Although the short-term oral administration of azithromycin produced hepatic accumulation of the drug and elevated azithromycin demethylase activity, there was no other evidence of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 induction or inactivation via cytochrome-metabolite complex formation.

40|$|Erythromycin is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic used {{mainly in}} the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive organisms. Erythromycin base is rap idly degraded in acidic media necessitating the use of structurally modified erythromycin derivatives or acid resistant dosage forms in order to decrease gastric inactivation of the drug. The majority of pharmacokinetic studies to-date have utilized relatively non-specific microbiological assay procedures which are unable to differentiate between concentrations of active erythromycin base and the inactive pro-drug derivatives. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique is described for the simultaneous determination of erythromycin base and propionate (inactive pro-drug form) in human serum and urine following the oral administration of erythromycin <b>estolate,</b> an acid stable derivative of erythromycin. The method involves a solid-phase extraction step prior to chromatography on a C 18 reversed-phase column with coulometric electrochemical detection. Sample handling and storage techniques are presented which minimize hydrolysis of the inactive ester moiety between sample collection and analysis, thereby more accurately reflecting the in vivo situation than in previously published studies. Results from single dose pharmacokinetic studies indicate that only 10 - 15 % of the total erythromycin concentration in vivo is present as the active base component following oral administration of erythromycin <b>estolate.</b> This percentage increases to approximately 25 % during multiple dose administration. Novel urinary excretion data are presented which reveal that approximately 40 % and 55 % of the total erythromycin excreted in urine is excreted as erythromycin base following single and multiple dosages respectively. Computer fitting of mean serum concentration-time data revealed that an open one compartment model with linear first order absorption and elimination best described the absorption and disposition of erythromycin, although poor computer fits for individual data sets were observed. Some evidence of non-linear elimination is presented utilizing both compartmental and non-compartmental pharmacokinetic techniques. Large intra-and inter-personal variability in erythromycin absorption and disposition was experienced which was evaluated in five subjects who each received one 500 mg erythromycin <b>estolate</b> tablet from the same batch, on three separate occasions.

The accumulated macrolides egressed rapidly when cells were incubated in antibiotic-free medium. No uptake and no loss of accumulated drugs were observed at 4 degrees C.

Afr. med. l., 53, 527 (1978). Tn 1952 erythromycin was discovered among the meta-bolic products of a strain of Streptomyces erythreus Waksman, from the fungal growth in a soil sample from the Philippines. Hosts of new and allegedly new antibiotics have made their appearance since 1952, and these newcomers tend to displace interest in, and familiarity with, the benefits of some of the older agents still available.

40|$|Erythromycin is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic with {{a spectrum}} similar to penicillin {{and is used}} mainly {{in the treatment of}} infections caused by gram-positive organisms. Since its discovery in 1952, erythromycin has achieved wide-spread clinical use. Susceptibility of erythromycin base to inactivation by acid results in decreased availability following exposure to acidic gastric fluids. Formulation of acid resistant dosage forms and the preparation of acid stable chemical derivatives have been attempted to improve absorption and subsequent clinical efficacy. Two of the most commonly used erythromycin derivatives are the stearic acid salt (erythromycin stearate) and the lauryl sulphate salt of the propionyl ester (erythromycin <b>estolate).</b> Although it has been known for many years that erythromycin is susceptible to acid degradation, very few reports on the stability of erythromycin in aqueous solutions appear in the literature. In this study, a high-performance liquid chromatographic system using electrochemical detection was employed for a kinetic study of erythromycin degradation. The effect of varying acid pH on the degradation rate of both erythromycin base and erythromycin stearate, and the effect on the hydrolysis rate of erythromycin <b>estolate</b> is presented. In addition, the effect of temperature on erythromycin degradation was also investigated. Until recently, the majority of pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies have utilized relatively non-specific microbiological assay procedures.

40|$|Erythromycin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic {{isolated from}} Streptomyces erythreus, {{was first introduced}} into clinical medicine in 1952. It is active against most gram-positive bacteria, some gram-negative bacteria and is currently the agent of choice for Legionella pneumophila. Erythromycin is an acid-labile compound rapidly degrading in acidic solutions such as the acid environment of the stomach. As such, erythromycin absorption following oral administration of solid dosage forms is relatively poor. Accordingly there have been various approaches used to protect the drug against gastric inactivation. These precautions include enteric-coating of tablets, capsules or pellets of erythromycin base, the synthesis of acid stable 2 ' esters of erythromycin (ethylsuccinate and propionate) and salts of these esters (erythromycin <b>estolate),</b> and more recently, the synthesis {{of a range of}} new acid-stable, semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics. The 2 ' esters are antimicrobially inactive or much less active than the parent compound and must be converted to the free erythromycin base in vivo in order to exhibit antibacterial activity. Intrinsic dissolution rates determined on raw material can provide extremely useful information relating to the gastrointestinal absorption of drugs from solid dosage forms. The large inter- and intrasubject variability associated with erythromycin base has, to date, mainly been attributed to gastric acid inactivation of the drug. However, changes in duodenal pH resulting in altered solubility and intrinsic dissolution rates may account for the observed variability. Thus, the intrinsic dissolution rates of erythromycin base at pH 6. 0, 6. 5, 7. 0, 7. 5 and 8. 0 were compared in order to investigate the possible effects of pH changes which may occur in the duodenal contents, on the in vivo dissolution and subsequent absorption of this compound. The standard intrinsic dissolution rate test procedure employing a rotating disc of pure erythromycin base powder which only allows for dissolution from a constant surface area, was adapted and the drug quantitatively determined by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet detection. Results of intrinsic dissolution studies at both 22 °C and 37 °C indicate that the solubility, and therefore the rate of dissolution of erythromycin base is pH dependent, being more soluble at pH 6. 0 than pH 8. 0 (an approximate 800 times and 1000 times reduction in the amount dissolved after 30 minutes, at 22 °C and 37 °C respectively, when the pH of the medium was increased from 6 to 8). Although the stability of erythromycin and its ester derivatives in aqueous acidic solutions has been well documented, very little has been reported on the compound's stability in organic solvents. Methanol is recommended by official drug compendia (U. S. P. and B. P.) for use in erythromycin identification tests {{as well as in the}} sample preparation steps during assay procedures. Thus, the effect of methanol and acetonitrile, organic solvents of similar polarities and densities, on the stability of erythromycin base, erythromycin ethylsuccinate, propionyl erythromycin and erythromycin <b>estolate</b> at room temperature (22 °C ± 0. 5 °C), using HPLC with electrochemical detection, was investigated. Erythromycin base is relatively stable in both methanol and acetonitrile, remaining intact for over 168 hours in acetonitrile and showing less than 5 % degradation in methanol over the same period. Erythromycin ethylsuccinate in acetonitrile shows less than 5 % degradation over 168 hours whereas in methanol, rapid hydrolysis occurs resulting in almost total conversion to base within 40 hours. Approximately 87 % of erythromycin propionyl ester remained intact after 168 hours in acetonitrile whilst methanol caused rapid hydrolysis to erythromycin base (35 % remaining after 28 hours). Erythromycin <b>estolate</b> appeared to be unstable in both acetonitrile and methanol. In acetonitrile, only 13 % of the <b>estolate</b> remained intact after 168 hours, whereas in methanol, the reaction was much more rapid with 35 % of the <b>estolate</b> remaining after 28 hours. The use of methanol as a solvent for erythromycin <b>estolate</b> reference standards is thus contraindicated. A number of conflicting reports on the half- life as well as the body compartment model that best describes erythromycin base serum concentration-time profiles (lBCM generally used to describe orally administered erythromycin, whilst a 2 BCM has been used to describe erythromycin administered intravenously), appear in the literature. These differences may be largely attributed to the sampling period (between 6 and 12 hours) used in the repective studies. The objective of this study was to determine the body compartment model that best describes erythromycin base serum concentration-time curves by increasing the sampling time to 24 hours. In addition, the effect of chronic dosing of erythromycin on erythromycin pharmacokinetics, in the same group of subjects, was investigated. The single and multiple oral dose pharmacokinetics of erythromycin enteric coated base pellets within a gelatin capsule (250 mg), were studied in 6 healthy, normal volunteers (19. 5 ± 0. 76 years, 71. 5 ± 8. 18 kg, 180. 33 ± 5. 99 cm). Furthermore, steady state concentrations were predicted using the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the single dose study, and compared with those obtained in the multiple dose study. Plasma concentrations were determined using a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection. For the single dose study, after a tlag of 2. 5 ± 0. 71 hr, Cmax (1. 12 ± 0. 47 μ/ml) was reached at a tmax of 4. 08 ± 0. 93 hr post dose, with serum concentrations ranging from 0. 31 - 1. 62 μ/ml. The half-life was found to be 5. 42 ± 1. 31 hr. On multiple dosing (250 mg six hourly), serum concentrations for the fifth, ninth and thirteenth dosing intervals ranged from 0. 67 - 2. 92 μ/ml, 1. 69 - 3. 65 μ/ml and 0. 61 - 3. 01 μ/ml, occurring at 3. 75 ± 0. 69 hr, 3. 17 ± 1. 03 hr and 3. 17 ± 1. 03 hr post dose with a Cmax of 1. 89 ± 0. 68 μ/ml, 2. 35 ± 0. 70 μ/ml and 1. 94 ± 0. 74 μ/ml, respectively. The area under the serum concentration- time curve for the single dose study (AUC₀₋∞) was 4. 67 ± 0. 88 hr. μ/ml, whilst the AUC₀₋τ. for the fifth, ninth and thirteenth dosing intervals of the multiple dose study were 5. 77 ± 1. 76 hr. μ/ml, 6. 46 ± 1. 33 hr. μ/ml and 5. 97 ± 2. 36 hr. μ/ml respectively, indicating an approximately 33 % increase in AUC on chronic dosing of erythromycin. The observed increase in AUC may be a result of increased bioavailability or a decrease in clearance on chronic dosing. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} erythromycin <b>estolate</b> by liquid chromatography. A C 18 reversed-phase column (25 x 0. 46 cm i. d.) was used with acetonitrile-tetrabutylammonium sulphate (pH 6. 5, 0. 2 M) -phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5, 0. 2 M) -water [x: 5 : 5 :(90 -x), v/v/v/v] as mobile phase. The proportion of acetonitrile (x) has to be adapted {{to the type of}} stationary phase used. For RSil C 18 LL 42. 5 % (v/v) was used. The column was heated at 35 -degrees-C, the flow rate was 1. 5 ml min- 1 and UV detection was performed at 215 nm. The main component, erythromycin A propionate, was separated from all other components which were present in commercial samples. The impurities most frequently observed were the propionate ester of erythromycin C and the amide N-propionyl-N-demethylerythromycin A. Erythromcin A was shown to be present in specialties. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Erythromycin {{is widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of various infections, caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Previous studies indicate that common pathogens (streptococci, pnemuococci), many staphylococci and mycoplasma pneumo-niae are inhibited by erythromycin. Although erythromycin has been widely used in therapy for nearly five decades, there are some disadvantages, such as water insolubi-lity, instability in the gastric pH (1), bitter taste and irregular absorption from the gas-tro-intestinal tract. Various salts and derivatives have been prepared since it was intro-duced for clinical use. However, {{only a few of the}} derivatives, like erythromycin lac-tobionate and erythromycin glucoheptonate (water soluble salts), erythromycin stearate and erythromycin ethyl succinate (water insoluble salts) and erythromycin <b>estolate</b> (wa-ter insoluble ester salt), have been officially recognized by the USP. Large intersubject (2, 3) variability in serum concentration occurs after oral administration even under stan-dardized conditions, whereas intersubject variability in pharmacokinetic parameters af-ter intravenous administration is small (4).

40|$|The {{possibility}} that endotoxin pretreatment could prevent the hepatotoxic effects of erythromycin <b>estolate</b> (EE) was investigated using the isolated perfused rat liver. The addition of E. coli endotoxin (25 micrograms/ml) to the perfusate, 30 min prior to EE administration at 150 or 200 microM, significantly ameliorated the decreases in bile and perfusate flow caused by either concentrations {{of the drug}} in control liver preparations. This phenomenon was also studied using liver isolated from rats pretreated in vivo with endotoxin for three days. In these preparations, EE at both concentrations did not alter bile flow and caused reductions of perfusate flow which were far less than those observed in untreated control livers. Furthermore, in livers from endotoxin-treated rats EE induced less reduction of bile acid excretion and, at 150 microM, it did not increase the bile to perfusate ratio of sucrose seen in control preparations after the drug, which may be an expression of altered hepatocytic membrane permeability. Since {{it is known that}} both endotoxin and EE interact with membranes, it is suggested that the "protective" effects of endotoxin may occur at the membrane level...|$|E

In the 4 -day rat study, EC caused fatty metamorphosis in the liver. ES caused similar, but milder changes at a dose nearly five times higher. The 5 -day dog study revealed markedly increased serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALAT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (S-ASAT), serum alkaline phosphatase (S-APHOS) and serum y-glutamyl transpeptidase (S-y-GT) values in the EC- and EE-groups, and slightly elevated S-ALAT values also in the EA- and ES-groups. Microscopy revealed cholangitis, pericholangitis and phlebitis in the portal areas in the EC-group at all doses. Epithelial hyperplasia was observed also in the bile ducts. EE caused similar but milder changes. The changes in the EA-group were small, but mildly atypical bile duct epithelium was seen in female dogs receiving 2 x 200 mg/kg of EA.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) A {{modified}} double-blind {{method of}} investigation {{was used in}} which the pulps of 52 monkey teeth were surgically exposed and left open to the oral environment {{for a period of}} 24 hours. One-half of the exposed pulps were treated with an antibiotic preparation and one-half with a pure starch control. The antibiotic compound consisted of erythromycin <b>estolate</b> 10 percent, streptomycin sulfate 10 percent, and starch q. s. as the vehicle. The teeth were extracted at 30 and 90 day intervals after treatment and histologically evaluated. Inflammation of a varying degree was observed in all of the teeth treated with either the antibiotic preparation or the starch control. However, those teeth treated with the antibiotic capping material exhibited much less inflammation than did the great majority of teeth treated with the starch control, in which abscess formation and necrosis were frequently observed. The pulps of those teeth treated with the antibiotic capping material demonstrated a decidedly more favorable reaction than did those pulps treated with the starch capping material. Calcific repair at the exposure site was not observed to be complete in any instance. The histologic findings for the antibiotic treated teeth were encouraging and warrant additional investigations of longer duration...|$|E
