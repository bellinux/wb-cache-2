5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, it is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction {{by the lack of}} base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
25|$|The use of two lasers to {{heat the}} sample reduces the axial {{temperature}} gradient, this which allows for thicker samples to be heated more evenly. In order for a double-sided heating system to be successful it is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two lasers are aligned {{so that they are}} both focused on the sample position. For in situ heating in diffraction experiments, the lasers need to be focused to the same point in space where the X-ray beam is focused.|$|E
25|$|Once in the water, the {{occupants}} disembarked {{from the sea}} side down steps into the water. Many machines had doors front and back; those with only one door would be backed into the sea or need to be turned around. It was considered <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> machine blocked any view of the bather from the shore. Some machines were equipped with a canvas tent lowered from the seaside door, sometimes capable of being lowered to the water, giving the bather greater privacy.|$|E

25|$|To {{sort out}} this dilemma became the sole {{responsibility}} of the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) South West Pacific Area. In addition to developing a common means of identifying these aircraft by type, it was <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new unit obtain information to develop drawings and models, as well as acquiring photographs. The unit's responsibility was to discover construction techniques, weaknesses, strengths, and latest camouflage techniques. Gathering performance information in comparison to Allied aircraft was essential for developing combat tactics with which to counter the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{molecules}} {{requires a}} transformation between molecular coordinates (usually, but not always, in Angstrom units) and the screen. Because many molecules are chiral it is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> handedness {{of the system}} (almost always right-handed) is preserved. In molecular graphics the origin (0, 0) is usually at the lower left, while in many computer systems the origin is at top left. If the z-coordinate {{is out of the}} screen (towards the viewer) the molecule will be referred to right-handed axes, while the screen display will be left-handed.|$|E
25|$|The B {{continued}} to prosper but lacked capital and matters {{came to a}} head at when it was reported that the capital was totally expended and borrowing powers had been exceeded by £10,000. It was <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company raise additional funds to double the existing single line out of Belfast, as it was no longer adequate for the current volume of traffic and to replace many of the original wooden stations. It was therefore proposed to make a submission to Parliament as soon as possible.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} L'Indice begins in October 1984, with the {{literary}} critic Cesare Cases’s words {{about what a}} book review is expected to achieve: «The <b>essential</b> is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first moment, <b>that</b> is <b>the</b> description of a book’s contents, shall have the centrality it deserves. Connivance to the reader should not be established ... {{on the basis of}} specialistic interest nor by formal flatteries; contents only can ground it ... <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reader should get from the description of contents a clear idea of what the book is and of the reasons of its importance, those which have induced us to prefer it to others».|$|R

25|$|The use of {{melamine}} as fertilizer for crops {{had been}} envisaged during the 1950s and 1960s {{because of its}} high nitrogen content (2/3). However, melamine is much more expensive to produce than are other common nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea. To be effective as a fertilizer, it is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plant nutrients are released or made available {{in a manner that}} matches the needs of the growing crop. The nitrogen mineralization process for melamine is extremely slow, making this product both economically and scientifically impractical for use as a fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Mary Ainsworth {{developed}} Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scale (AMSS) {{to use as}} {{a measure}} in her Baltimore longitudinal study (1963). The scale is based on naturalistic observations completed by Ainsworth {{over a period of several}} hours and thus has no short procedure outline. Her method uses a nine-point scale (nine being very high and one being very low) in a number of important maternal traits. In order for this measurement to be accurate, it is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> researcher has developed good observations and insight into the behaviour of the caregiver.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{overproduction}} of {{uric acid}} be controlled {{in order to}} reduce the risk of nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, and gouty arthritis. The drug allopurinol is utilized to stop the conversion of oxypurines into uric acid, and prevent the development of subsequent arthritic tophi (produced after having chronic gout), kidney stones, and nephropathy, the resulting kidney disease. Allopurinol is taken orally, at a typical dose of 3–20mg/kg per day. The dose is then adjusted to bring the uric acid level down into the normal range (<3nbsp&mg/dL). Most affected individuals can be treated with allopurinol all through life.|$|E

25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E
25|$|Often {{more than}} one ELS related to some topic can be {{displayed}} simultaneously in an ELS letter array. This is produced by writing out the text in a regular grid, with exactly {{the same number of}} letters in each line, then cutting out a rectangle. In the example below, part of the King James Version of Genesis (26:5–10) is shown with 33 letters per line. ELSs for BIBLE and CODE are shown. Normally only a smaller rectangle would be displayed, such as the rectangle drawn in the figure. In that case there would be letters missing between adjacent lines in the picture, but it is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of missing letters be the same for each line.|$|E
25|$|The Secessionists {{were those}} who had split in the 18th century from the {{established}} Presbyterian church. David Smyton or Smeaton had been 'called' to Kilmaurs, however he developed the belief that in the dispensation of the Sacrament, it was <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bread must be first lifted before being blessed. Such a small point was taken very seriously by Smeaton and he fought hard for in his view Divine Authority would accept no latitude in this matter. The Weston Tavern was formerly Smyton's manse, built in 1740, however it was disposed of in 1789 upon his death. The 'Non-lifter' congregation built a meeting house and manse at Holland Green on the Fenwick Road. Tradition has it that Smyton forgot to 'lift the bread' at his first service following his victory in maintaining the possession of the Secession church in Kilmaurs.|$|E

Since people from different clans are often involved in the performance of a dance, it is considered <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> before <b>the</b> dance is performed or <b>the</b> song sung <b>that</b> a disclaimer be made regarding who permission was obtained from, and with whom the original authorship or ownership rests.|$|R
25|$|Delay might {{endanger the}} outcome of the entire campaign, because it was <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main body of Allied troops be engaged before Army Group A {{established}} bridgeheads. To overcome this difficulty, the Germans resorted to unconventional means in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. In the early hours of 10 May, DFS 230 gliders landed on top of the fort and unloaded assault teams that disabled the main gun cupolas with hollow charges. The bridges over the canal were seized by German paratroopers. The Belgians launched considerable counterattacks which were broken up by the Luftwaffe. Shocked by a breach in its defences just where they had seemed the strongest, the Belgian Supreme Command withdrew its divisions to the KW-line five days earlier than planned. Similar operations against the bridges in the Netherlands, at Maastricht, failed. All were blown up by the Dutch and only one railway bridge was taken. This stalled the German armour on Dutch territory for a time.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{borrowed}} {{many aspects}} of her design (as well as her name) from the Bloodhound, a Dundee-built whaling ship taken into Royal Navy service as HMS Discovery in 1874 for the British Arctic Expedition to the North Pole. By 1900 few yards in the United Kingdom had the capability to build wooden ships of the size needed - only two shipbuilders submitted bids for the contract - but it was deemed <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship be made from wood, both for strength and ease of repair and to reduce the magnetic interference from a steel hull {{that would allow the}} most accurate navigation and surveying. The main compass was mounted perfectly amidships and there were to be no steel or iron fittings within 30feet (9.1 metres) of this point. For the same reason the boiler and engines were mounted towards the stern of the ship, a feature which also provided maximum space for equipment and provisions.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} movements, Mahdism, {{was founded in}} the late nineteenth century. It has been likened to a {{religious}} order, {{but it is not a}} tariqa in the traditional sense. Mahdism and its adherents, the Ansar, sought the regeneration of Islam, and in general were critical of the turuq. Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a faqih, proclaimed himself to be al-Mahdi al-Muntazar ("the awaited guide in the right path"), the messenger of God and representative of the Prophet Muhammad, an assertion that became an article of faith among the Ansar. He was sent, he said, to prepare the way for the second coming of the Prophet Isa (Jesus) and the impending end of the world. In anticipation of Judgment Day, it was <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people return to a simple and rigorous, even puritanical Islam (see Mahdiyah). The idea of the coming of a Mahdi has roots in Sunni Islamic traditions. The issue for Sudanese and other Muslims was whether Muhammad Ahmad was in fact the Mahdi.|$|E

2500|$|Yielding to the {{numerous}} accusations and complaints brought against [...] "Kol Nidrei" [...] {{in the course}} of centuries, the rabbinical conference held at Brunswick in 1844 decided unanimously <b>that</b> <b>the</b> formula was not <b>essential,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> members of the convention should exert their influence toward securing its speedy abolition.|$|R
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E
500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1950s, hatches had wooden covers that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand, rather than opened and closed. [...] Newer vessels have hydraulic-operated metal hatch covers that can often be operated by one person. [...] Hatch covers can slide forwards, backwards, or to the side, lift up or fold up. It is <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hatch covers be watertight: unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding, which has caused many bulkers to sink.|$|E
