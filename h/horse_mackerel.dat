40|$|The {{body size}} of fish is an {{important}} factor in determining their biology and ecology, as predators eat prey smaller than themselves. Predator mouth size restricts the availability of possible prey. In this paper we provide the allometric relationships of eight common, small pelagic fish species in the Bay of Biscay. In addition, we describe the predator-prey size ratios for different species, and we determine changes in their ratio-based trophic-niche breadth with increasing body size. Results suggest that gape size does not totally determine the predator-prey size ratio distribution, but predators use the entire available prey size range, including the smallest. As they grow they simply incorporate larger prey as their increased gape size permits. Accordingly, a large degree of overlap was found in the diet composition in terms of size and predator-prey ratios, even between fish of different sizes.

The false scad is distributed throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Namibia {{in the south to}} Spain and throughout most of the Mediterranean in the north. The species has an atypical body form compared to other species of Caranx, and can be distinguished from these on its elongate 'scad-like' body shape alone. Distinguishing the species from members of Decapterus and Trachurus is more difficult, requiring detailed anatomical analysis. The false scad is known to grow to a length of 60cm and a weight of 1 kg. The species lives both pelagically and demersally in continental shelf waters, ranging from depths of 15 to 200 m. It is a predatory fish, taking small fishes, crustaceans including euphausiids and shrimps, and cephalopods as its main prey, with significant dietary shifts as it ages. The false scad reaches sexual maturity at 2 years of age, with spawning occurring between April and July in shallow inshore waters, where the juveniles remain. The species is of major importance to fisheries throughout its range, but particularly from Morocco to Senegal, with annual catches ranging from 500 to 19000 t. The species is caught using trawls, seine nets and gill nets and sold fresh, frozen or salted.|$|E

Most of the lipids were removed during the process and neutral lipids were lost in higher proportion than polar lipids. As a consequence, total lipids of surimi contained more polyunsaturated fatty acids (338 ± 19 g kg- 1) than total lipids of the minced fillets (220 ± 8 g kg- 1). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was higher in the minced fillets than in the mince because less subcutaneous fat and dark muscle were removed during hand-mincing, indicating that the settings of the skinning-deboning machine can strongly influence the final quality of the product. Concentrations of lipid oxidation products increased significantly during the next stages of surimi processing. The increase was more pronounced for TBARS than hydroperoxides. Concentrations in hydroperoxides were similar in mince and washed mince (15. 3 ± 2. 8 and 16. 6 ± 2. 8 mmoles kg- 1 lipid) and increased in refined mince (29. 6 ± 2. 8 mmoles kg- 1 lipid).

Moreover, they support important fisheries worldwide. Accurate knowledge of their feeding ecology and ecological role is necessary in order to develop realistic quantitative assessments and to exploit and manage these species in a sustainable way. In this review, we synthesize all available information concerning the feeding habits, ecological role and potential predators of seven commercially and ecologically important species of SMPF (Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, Sardinella aurita, Trachurus trachurus, T. mediterraneus, Scomber scombrus, S. colias) in the Mediterranean Sea. Specifically, information gathered from stomach content analyses, stable isotope analyses and ecosystem models (Ecopath) is analyzed to study whether the trophic role and feeding habits vary among Mediterranean regions and ecosystems. We obtain a global view of the importance of these species in different areas of the Mediterranean Sea and identify major information gaps. Several predators are found to prey on SMPF, with important contributions of the species studied to the total diet of apical predators. The results reveal that SMPF are identified as pivotal species of the food web playing important ecological roles such as structuring or keystone species.

The golden trevally is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa in the west to Central America in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species predominantly occupies inshore waters where it inhabits both reef and sandy substrates. The golden trevally is easily distinguished from its relatives by its fleshy, rubbery lips and unique colouration, which ranges from bright yellow with black bars as a juvenile to a golden-silvery colour as an adult. It is known to grow to 120 cm in length and 15 kg in weight. The golden trevally schools as a juvenile, often closely following larger objects including sharks and jellyfish. The species uses its protractile jaws to suck out prey from the sand or reef, and consumes a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Spawning aggregations gather at night at different times of the year throughout its range. The golden trevally is a considerable constituent of several Middle Eastern fisheries and being of minor importance to many others, with a worldwide annual catch of 1187 t to 3475 t recorded between 2000 and 2010. The golden trevally is a popular gamefish, taken by bait, lure, fly and also spear throughout its range. Several Asian countries currently farm the fish in caged aquaculture.

40|$|International audienceIn {{upwelling}} areas, enrichment, {{concentration and}} retention are physical processes that have major consequences for larval fish survival. While these processes generally increase larval survival, strong upwelling can also increase mortality {{due to an}} offshore transport of larvae towards unfavorable habitats. In 2013 a survey was conducted along the Senegalese coast to investigate the upwelling effect with regard to larval fish assemblages and possible larval fish retention. According to water column characteristics two distinct habitats during an upwelling event were discriminated, i. e. the inshore upwelled water and the transition area over the deepest part of the Senegalese shelf. Along the two areas 42, 162 fish larvae were collected representing 133 species within 40 families. Highest larval fish abundances were observed in the inshore area and decreasing abundances towards the transition, indicating that certain fish species {{make use of the}} retentive function of the inner shelf area as spawning grounds. Two larval fish assemblages overlap both habitats, which are sharply delimited by a strong upwelling front. One assemblage inhabited the inshore/upwelling area characterized by majorly neritic and pelagic species (Sparidae spp., Sardinella aurita), that seem to take the advantage of a passive retention on the shelf. The second assemblage consisted of a mix of pelagic and mesopelagic species (Engraulis encrasicolus, Carangidae spp. and Myctophidae spp.). Some species of the second assemblage, e. g. <b>horse</b> <b>mackerels</b> (Trachurus trachurus and Trachurus trecae), large finned-lantern fish (Hygophum macrochir) and foureyed sole (Microchirus ocellatus), revealed larval peak occurrences at intermediate and deep water layers, where the near-ground upwelling layer is able to transport larvae back to the shelf. This indicates active larval retention for species that are dominant in the transition area. Diel vertical migration patterns of S. aurita, E. encrasicolus and M. ocellatus revealed that a larval fish species may adapt its behavior to the local environment and do not necessarily follow a diurnal cycle. Field observations are essential to be integrated in larval drift models, since the vertical and horizontal larval distribution will have major consequences for survival.

40|$|Discarding is {{considered}} globally {{among the most}} important issues for fisheries management. The recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy establishes a landing obligation for the species which are subject to catch limits and, in the Mediterranean, for species which are subject to Minimum Conservation Reference Size (MCRS) as defined in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967 / 2006. Additionally, several other initiatives aim to reduce unwanted catches of target and bycatch species, including species of conservation concern. This raises the need to study discarding patterns of (mainly) these species. In this work we collated a considerable amount of historical published information on discard ratios and lengths at discarding for species caught in EU Mediterranean bottom trawl fisheries. The main aim was to summarize the available historical records and make them more accessible for scientific and managerial needs, as well as to try identifying patterns in discarding. We show discard ratios and lengths at which 50 % of the individuals were discarded (L 50) for 15 species (9 bony fishes, three crustacean decapods, and three elasmobranchs). Discard ratios were usually low for target species such as hake, red mullets and highly commercial shrimps and exemptions from the landing obligation under the de minimis rules could be sought in several cases. Discard ratios were usually higher for commercial bycatch species. Discarding is affected by a combination of factors and for a given species, especially for non-target ones, discards are likely to fluctuate within a fishery, across seasons, years, and regions. For most species considered, L 50 s were lower than the MCRS (when in place) and length at first maturity. L 50 s of target species, such as hake, were very small due to the existence of market demands for small sized individuals. However, for species of low demand, like <b>horse</b> <b>mackerels,</b> a higher retention size was observed, often exceeding MCRS. Lengths at discarding are affected by legal provisions, market demands but also by biological, population, and ecological traits. Understanding the factors that affect discarding constitutes the starting point for designing mitigation measures and management plans to reduce discards and improve the sustainability of the stocksVersión del edito...|$|R
