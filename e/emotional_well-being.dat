40|$|Background and Purpose. Adults with a {{diagnosis}} of cerebral palsy (CP) are living longer lives similar to the general population. Consequently, there is an emerging need for knowledge pertaining {{to the effectiveness of}} medical care for adults with CP. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain insight from adults with CP regarding the priority components of well-being that contribute to their quality of life (QOL). Methods. Sixty adults (N = 60) diagnosed with cerebral palsy aged 22 to 63, participated in a 42 -question survey. Demographics including age, type of CP, education, communication, and level of assistance required were collected. Questions pertaining to physical <b>well-being,</b> <b>emotional</b> and social <b>well-being,</b> environmental support, and prioritization of these items were directly related to the survey hypothesis. Results. Sixty-eight percent (N= 36) of the respondents were able to prioritize the three components of QOL with the following results: 39 % (N=I 4) listed physical well-being, 50 % (N=I 8) listed <b>emotional</b> and social <b>well-being,</b> and 11 % (N= 4) listed environmental support as the most important component in determining a good quality of life. Thirty-two percent of respondents were unable to prioritize the three components of well-being, listing them as equally important in determining their QOL. Conclusion. Healthcare for adults with CP requires comprehensive attention, with an emphasis on <b>emotional</b> and social <b>well-being,</b> in combination with physical well-being and environmental support...|$|R
25|$|School psychologists' {{primary concern}} {{is with the}} academic, social, and <b>emotional</b> <b>well-being</b> of {{children}} within a scholastic environment.

Besides offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, school psychologists also evaluate school programs, provide cognitive assessment, help design prevention programs (e.g. reducing drops outs), and work with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both {{in the classroom and}} systemically.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the stolen generations, Aboriginal {{children}} were removed from their families and placed in institutions where they were punished for speaking their indigenous language. Different, mutually unintelligible language groups were often were mixed together, with Australian Aboriginal English or Australian Kriol language as the only lingua franca. The result was a disruption to the inter-generational transmission of these languages that severely impacted their future use. Today, that same transmission of language between parents and grandparents to their children is a key mechanism for reversing language shift. For children, proficiency in the language of their cultural heritage has a positive influence on their ethnic identity formation, and it is thought to be of particular benefit to the <b>emotional</b> <b>well-being</b> of Indigenous children. There is some evidence to suggest that the reversal of the Indigenous language shift may lead to decreased self-harm and suicide rates among Indigenous youth.|$|E

25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and <b>emotional</b> <b>well-being.</b> Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} has an {{emotional}} and physiological {{impact on the}} individual. Many who have undergone the surgery suffer from depression in the following months {{as a result of}} a change in the role food plays in their <b>emotional</b> <b>well-being.</b> Strict limitations on the diet can place great emotional strain on the patient. Energy levels in the period following the surgery can be low, both due to the restriction of food intake and negative changes in emotional state. It may take as long as three months for emotional levels to rebound. Muscular weakness in the months following surgery is also common. This is caused by a number of factors, including a restriction on protein intake, a resulting loss in muscle mass and decline in energy levels. Muscle weakness may result in balance problems, difficulty climbing stairs or lifting heavy objects, and increased fatigue following simple physical tasks. Many of these issues pass over time as food intake gradually increases. However, the first months following the surgery can be very difficult, an issue not often mentioned by physicians suggesting the surgery. The benefits and risks of this surgery are well established; however, the psychological effects are not well understood.|$|E

They may utilize the dolls {{as a substitute for}} a child. Some owners dress the dolls, wash their hair, and may even take them for walks in strollers and take them shopping. Reborn hobbyists refer to the emotional response to holding their dolls as cuddle therapy. Studies suggest cuddling a baby causes a release of hormones which produce a sense of <b>emotional</b> <b>well-being,</b> and some psychologists believe that this may happen with realistic dolls as well. Consultant psychiatrist Raj Persaud explains that mothering a real newborn baby releases the hormone oxytocin in the mother, and hypothesizes that this may explain why [...] "reborn mothers" [...] become emotionally attached to the reborn baby doll.|$|E

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of CHM use in cancer patients in southwestern China. Cancer patients from eleven comprehensive cancer centers {{were asked to complete}} a structured questionnaire. Of 587 available replies, 53. 0 % used CHM. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that educational level, stage of disease, duration of cancer since diagnosis, marital status, and previous use of CHM were strongly associated with CHM use after cancer diagnosis. The source of information about CHM was mainly from media and friends/family. CHM products were used without any consultation with a TCM practitioner by 67. 5 % of users. The majority used CHM to improve their physical and <b>emotional</b> <b>well-beings</b> and to reduce cancer therapy-induced toxicities. About 4. 5 % patients reported side effects of CHM.
