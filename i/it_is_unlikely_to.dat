5|$|Obesity {{prevention}} {{programs have been}} found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> reduce overall health spending.|$|E
5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution {{and the fact that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E
5000|$|Ajai Sahni, an {{intelligence}} analyst who tracks terrorist groups in South Asia, also said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Hindu group because they [...] "lacked the organisation {{for such an}} attack".|$|R

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's release, new {{multiplayer}} scenarios and a counter-operative mode {{like the one}} found in the original Perfect Dark were said to eventually become freely available as downloadable content. Senior game designer Duncan Botwood later clarified that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> happen due to technical issues. According to him, [...] "It would have required much groundwork to be laid in the core AI code, which meant that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available as downloadable content post-release." [...] He also remarked that the counter-operative mode was planned during {{the development of the}} game, but was eventually rejected due to the pressure to cut planned content.|$|R
5|$|Women with {{endometrial cancer}} {{should not have}} routine {{surveillance}} imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> detect a recurrence or improve survival, and because {{it has its own}} costs and side effects. If a recurrence is suspected, PET/CT scanning is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Asser's Life omits {{any mention}} of {{internal}} strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he {{makes it clear that}} Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
50|$|No {{description}} {{of this film}} <b>was</b> given, but <b>it</b> does mention the name. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered a direct sequel, but is probably based on another L. Frank Baum novel, John Dough and the Cherub.|$|R
50|$|David Norris {{launched}} a petition regarding the Broadcasting Bill 1990. He stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> receive enough signatures, but might convince the President to refer {{the bill to}} the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution.|$|R
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the movement has been questioned. Many reports from both in and outside of Israel indicated that the movement had made very little impact on the Israeli economy, and suggested that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> for the foreseeable future.|$|R
5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow.|$|E
5|$|Stigand {{was later}} accused of simony by monastic chroniclers, but all such accusations date to after 1066, {{and are thus}} suspect owing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify the English Church as corrupt and backward. The medieval chronicler William of Poitiers also claimed that in 1052 Stigand agreed that William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, should succeed King Edward. This claim was used as {{propaganda}} after the Conquest, {{but according to the}} historian David Bates, among others, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be true. The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to good effect by the Normans in their propaganda before, during and after the Conquest.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} African crake on the wintering grounds, {{but can be}} distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern. In flight, it has longer, less rounded wings, and shallower wingbeats than its African relative, and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing. In both the breeding and wintering ranges <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be confused with any other rails, since sympatric species are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. A flying corn crake can resemble a gamebird, but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic.|$|E

5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around âˆ’4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which {{would result in a}} significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} larger size and more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian mammoth also {{differed from the}} woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and the woolly mammoth. Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance {{than that of the}} woolly mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be that of the Columbian mammoth has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where mammoth dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths; however, since this location is so far south <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be woolly mammoth hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense than that of the woolly mammoth due to the warmer habitat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bill was}} {{defeated}} - {{in part due}} to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan.

5|$|The Texian {{bodies were}} stacked and burned. The only {{exception}} was {{the body of}} Gregorio Esparza. His brother Francisco, an officer in Santa Anna's army, received permission to give Gregorio a proper burial. The ashes were left where they fell until February 1837, when Juan SeguÃ­n returned to BÃ©xar to examine the remains. A simple coffin inscribed with the names Travis, Crockett, and Bowie was filled with ashes from the funeral pyres. According to a March 28, 1837, article in the Telegraph and Texas Register, SeguÃ­n buried the coffin under a peach tree grove. The spot was not marked and cannot now be identified. SeguÃ­n later claimed that he had placed the coffin {{in front of the}} altar at the San Fernando Cathedral. In July 1936 a coffin was discovered buried in that location, but according to historian Wallace Chariton, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> actually contain the remains of the Alamo defenders. Fragments of uniforms were found in the coffin, and it is known that the Alamo defenders did not wear uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
