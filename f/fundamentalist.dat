5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a <b>Fundamentalist</b> Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian <b>fundamentalist</b> Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{wrote that}} Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his {{decision}} to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations. They {{also noted that the}} book filled a literary lacuna in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied <b>fundamentalist</b> Christian school.|$|E
25|$|Traditionists who {{account for}} the {{majority}} of clerics keep themselves away from modernity and neither accept nor criticize it. Traditionalists believe in eternal wisdom and are critics of humanism and modernity. Traditionalists believe in a sort of religious pluralism which makes them different from <b>Fundamentalists.</b> <b>Fundamentalists</b> are also against modernity. Contrary to traditionists, <b>fundamentalists</b> openly criticize modernity. Moreover, <b>fundamentalists</b> believe that for reviving the religion in the modern era and for opposing modernity, they need to gain social and political power. This makes <b>fundamentalists</b> different from traditionists and traditionalists who are not interested in gaining political power.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1950s, Mormon <b>fundamentalists</b> {{were largely}} one group, {{but with the}} {{ordination}} in 1951 of Rulon C. Allred by Joseph W. Musser, who then presided over the <b>fundamentalists,</b> the <b>fundamentalists</b> in Colorado City, Arizona (formerly known as Short Creek), became more distant. Within a few years they formed their own group, which is now the FLDS Church.|$|R
50|$|Upon Musser's {{death on}} March 29, 1954, the <b>fundamentalists</b> in Short Creek {{refused to accept}} the {{leadership}} of his appointed successor, Rulon Allred, and instead LeRoy S. Johnson became their leader, while the <b>fundamentalists</b> in Mexico and the Salt Lake City region remained faithful to Allred. Some of those who supported neither group became independent Mormon <b>fundamentalists.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{behavioral}} exchange rate model with chartists and <b>fundamentalists</b> to study cyclical behavior in foreign exchange markets. Within our model, the market impact of <b>fundamentalists</b> {{depends on the}} strength of their belief in fundamental analysis. Estimation of a STAR GARCH model shows that the more the exchange rate deviates from its fundamental value, the more <b>fundamentalists</b> leave the market. In contrast to previous findings, our paper indicates that due to the nonlinear presence of <b>fundamentalists,</b> market stability decreases with increasing misalignments. A stabilization policy such as central bank interventions may help to deflate bubbles. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzed the}} influence of the differences in the forecast accuracy of fundamental values on the financial market. As a result of intensive experiments in the market, we made the following interesting findings: (1) improvements in forecast accuracy of <b>fundamentalists</b> can contribute to {{an increase in the number}} of fundamentalists; (2) certain situations might occur, according to the level of forecast accuracy of <b>fundamentalists,</b> in which <b>fundamentalists</b> and passive management coexist, or in which <b>fundamentalists</b> die out of the market, and furthermore; (3) where a variety of investors exist in the market, improvements in the forecast accuracy could increase the number of <b>fundamentalists</b> more than the number of investors that employ passive investment strategy. These results contribute to clarifying the mechanism of price fluctuations in financial markets and also indicate one of the factors for the low ratio of passive investors in asset management business...|$|R
5|$|Hensley's theology, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his snake handling, was typical of other <b>fundamentalist</b> Pentecostal churches. His teachings on personal holiness bore a resemblance to doctrines of the Wesleyan Holiness tradition. In his sermons he condemned a number of practices as sinful, including gambling, consuming alcohol, wearing lipstick, and playing baseball.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn a simple, {{forward looking}} {{univariate}} model of price determination we investigate {{the evolution of}} expectations dynamics in presence of two types of agents: <b>fundamentalists</b> and chartists. In particular, we combine evolutionary selection among heterogeneous classes of models through predictor choice dynamics based on a logit model, with adaptive learning {{in the form of}} parameters updating within each class of rules. We find that, for different parameterizations, it can happen that <b>fundamentalists</b> drive chartists completely out of the market or vice-versa, and also that heterogeneous equilibria in which <b>fundamentalists</b> and chartists coexist are possible. Interestingly, though, only equilibria in which <b>fundamentalists</b> outperform chartists turn out to be adaptively learnable by agents...|$|R

40|$|Democratization in {{developing}} countries gets a challenge from Islamic <b>fundamentalists.</b> ICT provides an important opportunity for the rise of subversion against a democratic government. This article deals with construction of <b>fundamentalists</b> of Islamic groups in Indonesia towards democracy via the Internet. The goal {{of this study is}} to know their construction in the discourse of democracy. This research was using the method of discourse analysis with the model introduced by Leeuwen (2008). This research shows that the <b>fundamentalists</b> construct democracy on the basis of theology arguments (i. e. : democracy is a kufr system, idolatry, forbidden, and Islam-based invalid system) and bad effects of democracy. Democracy is a colonization tool of Western countries. It creates accompliceship between the rich and the powerful. <b>Fundamentalists</b> regard democracy as a “religion”. The Indonesian government is represented as “kafir (non-believer) /murtad(apostate) ”, “colonialist’s accomplice”, “pharaoh”. <b>Fundamentalist’s</b> internet use becomes a challenge for the government with the subversion discourse emergence...|$|R

Its most common expression is the Tijaniyah, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more <b>fundamentalist</b> practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi movements.|$|E

She originally intended to produce the film on a $25,000-budget and hire her family and friends to work on the cast and crew, but when the budget was raised to $1million she was able to hire professional actors. Filming took place over 25 days in Utah and Nevada in late 2011.|$|E

The series centers on a fictional <b>fundamentalist</b> Mormon family, in which Seyfried plays Sarah Henrickson, Bill and Barb's first daughter, who struggles with her family's polygamous faith. Big Love premiered in the United States on March 12, 2006. In December 2009, HBO confirmed that Seyfried would return for the show's fourth season, but that it would be her last, as Seyfried wished to concentrate on her film career and upcoming projects.|$|E

40|$|The study {{reported}} herein tested the following hypothesis: Religious fundamentalism can serve a protective function against existential anxiety, {{such that the}} need to engage in secular worldview defense when mortality is made salient is reduced for high <b>fundamentalists.</b> The results showed that high <b>fundamentalists</b> engaged in less worldview defense after thinking about their own death versus a control topic. Low <b>fundamentalists,</b> however, engaged in more worldview defense after thinking about their deaths versus a control topic. Exploratory analyses revealed that high fundamentalists' writings about death had a more positive emotional tone and that reactions to the death salience manipulation moderated the impact of fundamentalism on worldview defense. <b>Fundamentalists</b> who saw their deaths in terms of peace and acceptance appeared most protected against terror management concerns...|$|R
50|$|The social {{tensions}} and prejudices {{created by the}} Fundamentalist-Modernist split would remain very active within American Christianity into the twenty-first century, with modernists seeing <b>fundamentalists</b> as intolerant, and <b>fundamentalists</b> seeing modernists as overly willing to compromise with the forces of secularism, abandoning authentic Christianity in the process.|$|R
5|$|Sunday was a {{conservative}} evangelical who accepted <b>fundamentalist</b> doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, {{the doctrine of}} substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by {{the vast majority of the}} Protestant churches and their clergy.|$|E
5|$|Unrest {{then broke}} out across eastern Bolivia, as radicalized autonomist activists {{established}} blockades, occupied airports, clashing with pro-government demonstrations, police, and armed forces. Some formed paramilitaries, bombing state companies, indigenous NGOs, {{and human rights}} organisations, also launching armed racist attacks on indigenous communities, culminating in the Pando Massacre of MAS activists. The autonomists gained support from some high-ranking politicians; Santa Cruz Governor Rubén Costas lambasted Morales and his supporters with racist epithets, accusing the president of being an Aymara <b>fundamentalist</b> and a totalitarian dictator responsible for state terrorism. Amid the unrest, foreign commentators began speculating {{on the possibility of}} civil war.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New World Order conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of <b>fundamentalist</b> Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} central bank interventions (CBI) in a noise trading model with chartists and <b>fundamentalists.</b> We first estimate a model in which chartists extrapolate past returns and <b>fundamentalists</b> forecast a mean reverting dynamics of the exchange rate towards a fundamental value. Then, we investigate the role of central bank interventions in explaining the switching properties between {{the two types of}} agents. We find evidence that in the medium run, interventions increase the proportion of <b>fundamentalists</b> and therefore exert some stabilizing influence on the exchange rate. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} novel {{evidence on}} exchange rate expectations of both chartists and <b>fundamentalists</b> separately. These groups indeed form expectations differently. Chartists change their expectations more often; however, all professionals 4 expectations vary considerably as they generally follow strong exchange rate trends. In line with non-linear exchange rate-modeling, professionals expect mean reversion only if exchange rates deviate strongly from PPP. Chartists survive in currency markets since they forecast just as accurately as <b>fundamentalists.</b> Unexpectedly from an efficient market viewpoint, chartists even outperform <b>fundamentalists</b> at short horizons. Overall, these findings clearly support the chartist-fundamentalist approach...|$|R
5000|$|For public {{relations}} reasons, the LDS Church has sought vigorously to disassociate itself from Mormon <b>fundamentalists</b> {{and the practice}} of plural marriage. Although the LDS Church has requested that journalists not refer to Mormon <b>fundamentalists</b> using the term [...] "Mormon", journalists generally have not complied, and [...] "Mormon fundamentalist" [...] has become standard terminology. Mormon <b>fundamentalists</b> themselves embrace the term [...] "Mormon" [...] and share a religious heritage and beliefs with the LDS Church, including canonization of the Book of Mormon and a claim that Joseph Smith is the founder of their religion.|$|R
5|$|From 1955 to 1994, The King's College, a {{strictly}} <b>Fundamentalist</b> coeducational liberal arts college, relocated to the Briarcliff Lodge property. The school used the lodge building and built dormitories and academic buildings. During that time, in 1985, the Lodge and the Briarcliff library were among 60 sites given historical markers by Westchester County Tricentennial Commission. The New York State Board of Regents closed {{the school in}} 1994 due to financial difficulties and a deficiency of qualified faculty. After it closed, the nonprofit Tara Circle planned to build an Irish-American cultural, education, and athletic center, which {{was approved by the}} village in November 1994.

5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon <b>fundamentalist</b> or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, a number of senior U.S. {{intelligence}} officials met {{with the leaders of}} the KLA, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in Kosovo and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside Kosovo, not to continue participating in the drug trade, and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, the KLA ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave Kosovo. Though few Kosovo Albanians sympathized with the Islamists, some argued that the KLA should have accepted assistance from any source, <b>fundamentalist</b> or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered the mujahideen to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within the KLA ranks as what was to be done with them.|$|E
40|$|The author {{explains}} {{that in its}} origin the term fundamentalism has no direct negative or violent connotation. However, this term has often been applied to those who resort to violence based on the ideological or religious adherence. Historically, most of <b>fundamentalists</b> have been moderate and apply passive and peaceful methods in their activities. Only active <b>fundamentalists</b> use extreme measures to achieve their religious ideals. The heightening existence of the active fundamentalism, and the disruption caused by it, leads to the projection that all <b>fundamentalists</b> are inherently violent in nature. This stereotype has been imposed on Islam particularly in the post-September 11, 2001 period. Investigating the relationship between Islam and fundamentalism the author asserts that, even though fundamentalism can exist in Islam, not all Muslim <b>fundamentalists</b> are active and violent...|$|R
