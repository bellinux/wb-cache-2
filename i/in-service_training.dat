40|$|Improving {{the quality}} of <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training</b> is a very topical issue in {{educational}} policies {{of a number of}} countries. This segment of the system was also subject to considerable changes in Serbia in the past ten years. The changes brought about certain improvements, but also opened up numerous dilemmas and issues. This paper is aimed at acquiring an insight into the opinions of different participants on the ways of improving {{the quality of}} <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training.</b> The sample included three groups of respondents: the employees in education bureaucracy and experts in the field of education (N= 34), principals (N= 50) and expert associates from primary schools (N= 93). We developed a questionnaire {{for the purposes of this}} research, using open-ended questions to collect respondents’ suggestions on improving the quality of <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training.</b> The content analysis method was used to process the collected data. Research results point to three directions of the necessary changes: (1) better governing of the system of <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training,</b> (2) providing funding and other forms of support, and (3) higher flexibility of <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training</b> and implementation of the acquired knowledge. The range and quality of respondents’ suggestions demonstrate the need to take into account different perspectives in overcoming the difficulties in the system and practice of <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training.</b> Consequently, the obtained results should be observed as a contribution to creating a more purposeful and efficient system of <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>in-service</b> {{management}} <b>training</b> {{of school}} managers, especially heads of departments in these constantly changing times, {{is an issue}} which is long overdue in South Africa. Numerous initiatives, such as the Canada - South Africa Education Management Programme, the Whole School Improvement Workshop and the Workshop for School Management Teams are <b>in-service</b> management <b>training</b> programmes in the Mpumalanga Province which are aimed at the upgrading of management skills of school managers such as principals, deputy principals and heads of department.

25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{shortage}} of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school teachers should be graduates with two years' training in professional institutes and that primary-school teachers should be graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 {{percent of the time}} to subject teaching, 6 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 10 percent to teaching methods. <b>In-service</b> <b>training</b> for primary-school teachers was designed to raise them to a level of approximately two years' postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula was devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.|$|E

25|$|In their favour, it {{has been}} pointed out that private schools cover the entire {{curriculum}} and offer extra-curricular activities such as science fairs, general knowledge, sports, music and drama. The pupil teacher ratios are much better in private schools (1:31 to 1:37 for government schools) and more teachers in private schools are female. There is some disagreement over which system has better educated teachers. According to the latest DISE survey, the percentage of untrained teachers (para-teachers) is 54.91% in private, compared to 44.88% in government schools and only 2.32% teachers in unaided schools receive <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> compared to 43.44% for government schools.
