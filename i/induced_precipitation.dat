5000|$|Lightning-induced {{electron}} precipitation (also {{referred to}} as LEP) occurs when lightning strikes the Earth. When {{a bolt of lightning}} strikes the ground, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is released which can hit the trapped electrons in the radiation belt.

50|$|The mineralogic {{composition}} of carbonate platforms may be either calcitic or aragonitic. Seawater is oversaturated in carbonate, so {{under certain conditions}} CaCO3 precipitation is possible. Carbonate precipitation is thermodynamically favoured at high temperature and low pressure. Three types of carbonate precipitation are possible: biotically controlled, biotically induced and abiotic. Carbonate precipitation is biotically controlled when organisms (such as corals) are present that exploit carbonate dissolved in seawater to build their calcitic or aragonitic skeletons. Thus they may develop hard reef structures. Biotically <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> takes place outside the cell of the organism, thus carbonate is not directly produced by organisms, but precipitates because of their metabolism. Abiotic precipitation involves little or no biological influence.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of strain rate on the subsequent softening kinetics {{has been investigated}} for a Nb-containing steel using stress relaxation. It was found that strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> during static recrystallisation was enhanced {{with an increase in}} strain rate, resulting in an obvious plateau in the stress relaxation curve and a marked retarded softening. At the higher strain rate, since dynamic precipitation is suppressed during deformation, more solute Nb is left for the subsequent strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> after deformation. The stress relaxation data were supported by grain size measurements and TEM observations. A significant {{influence of}} strain rate on the recrystallised grain size was not observed for longer annealing times after deformation, indicating that strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> lost its retarding effect due to coarsening of precipitates.

40|$|A rapid {{method has}} been {{developed}} to determine recrystallization kinetics of Nb microalloyed steels by interrupted hot torsion test. The softening behaviour was achieved {{as a function of}} different processing parameters. The method clearly identified three regions, where the strain dependency of the recrystallization rate varied. Firstly, at large strains the rate of recrystallization was not a function of strain; this is generally ascribed to metadynamic recrystallization. At lower strains the time to 50 % recrystallization showed a power low relationship with strain, characteristic of static recrystallization. A further break point exists on the time for 50 % softening curve when strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> occurs in the material. The onset of strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> was at strains below the strain to the peak stress at temperatures below 900 °C.

40|$|There is {{currently}} an extensive {{effort to develop}} new steels with a better combination of strength and ductility, the so-called Ultra-High Strength Steels (UHSS) and Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS).

40|$|Strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> of {{microalloy}} elements during {{hot deformation}} of steels {{has been an}} area of Interest for several decades. Several researchers have produced models for strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> phenomena that gave reasonably good predictions of precipitate evolution during hot deformation. These models were however, applicable only for single pass deformation. The present work aims {{to develop a new}} model that could be extended to prediction of precipitate evolution during multi-pass hot deformation during rolling. In this work, a new approach has been adopted in modelling strain <b>induced</b> <b>precipitation</b> of niobium carbonitrides during hot deformation. A dislocation geometry is proposed for a typical microband, which is considered as a key factor In the model. This microband geometry enables one to obtain the local solute concentration gradients in the regions between the microbands. Diffusion of solute atoms towards the microbands is considered to govern the growth rate of the precipitates on the dislocation nodes in the microbands; i. e., the solute atoms reaching the microbands are immediately consumed in either nucleating a new precipitate or growing an existing precipitate. Depending on the considerations of how precipitates nucleate on the microbands, different models have been proposed and their results analysed. Extending this model to a multipass model depends on the location of the next generation microbands after a second/subsequent deformation. The local solute concentration, already obtained after the first pass, will govern the precipitation potential of the nodes on the second generation microband. Plane strain compression tests were conducted on Fe- 30 wt. %Ni-Nb alloys at different temperatures and deformation conditions. The test samples were subjected to thin foil transmission electron microscopy to obtain the particle size distribution of the niobium carbonitride particles. The experimental results were then correlated with the model results and found to be in reasonably good agreement. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
