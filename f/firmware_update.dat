Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated on the console. The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 Synergistic Processing Elements; Sony implemented a hypervisor restricting access to the RSX. The feature to install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a <b>firmware</b> <b>update</b> released in 2010.|$|E

The Sixaxis was the first official controller for the PlayStation 3, {{and is based on}} the same design as the DualShock series (but lacking the vibration motors of the DualShock series of controllers).|$|E

5|$|Prior to release, {{the game}} had been playtested {{multiple}} {{times by the}} general public. An alpha version of Evolve, called the 'Big Alpha' was released for Xbox One on October 31, 2014, The alpha version of Evolve was originally set to be released for the PlayStation 4 a day later on October 31, 2014, but was delayed to November 3, 2014 due to technical issues related to PS4's <b>firmware</b> <b>update.</b> As compensation, {{the duration of the}} demo was extended by a day, and ended on November 4, 2014 for all platforms. Players can play as the four classes of Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the alpha version. Turtle Rock expected 100,000 people to participate in the alpha. The team hoped that through the alpha testing, they could test the functionality of the game's servers, and make adjustments to the game's balance. Open beta trials of Evolve on Xbox One were held January 14–19, 2015. A limited test for the PlayStation 4 and PC was held January 16–19, 2015. Players could play as the first eight Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the beta. The Evacuation mode was also added to the beta on January 17, 2015.|$|E

25|$|The 'OtherOS' {{functionality}} was {{not present}} in the updated PS Slim models, and the feature was subsequently removed from previous versions of the PS3 {{as part of the}} machine's <b>firmware</b> <b>update</b> version 3.21 which was released on April 1, 2010; Sony cited security concerns as the rationale. The <b>firmware</b> <b>update</b> 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network. The removal caused some controversy; as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products, and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation.|$|E
