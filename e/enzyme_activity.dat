40|$|Serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> were {{measured}} in 41 type 1 diabetics (16. 4 +/- 4. 0 U/ml), in 40 type 2 diabetics (15. 0 +/- 5. 2 U/ml) and in 52 controls (13. 0 +/- 2. 7 U/ml, mean +/- SD). Twenty six (32 %) of 81 patients presented with serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> above the normal range. No relation between serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> {{and the presence}} or lack of diabetic vascular diseases in type 1 and type 2 diabetics could be detected. No significant differences in serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> were found when comparing various types of diabetic vascular disease (retinopathy, neuropathy, renal failure, arterial vascular disease, diabetic vascular disease, coronary artery disease). However, mean serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> were significantly increased in diabetics with retinopathy when compared with controls (p less than 0. 0005). Correlation between metabolic long term control as determined by measuring glycohaemoglobin (HbA 1) concentrations and serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> could not be established. Serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> did not show any correlations with duration of diabetes, age or sex of patients. A representative number of diabetics (32 %) showed elevated serum angiotensin-converting <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities,</b> but a correlation with diabetic vascular disease, metabolic control or type of disease could not be established...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that distinct genetic factors may concur, {{in association with}} diabetes, to increase susceptibility to vascular morbidity, including hypertension, has been evaluated in ninety-four normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients by testing both the frequency and prevalence of hypertension in parents and by measuring membrane red blood cell <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities.</b> Parental hypertension was present in a significantly higher proportion of diabetic compared to control subjects. A significant decrease in basal membrane red blood cell (Na(+) -K+), (Mg 2 +) and (Ca 2 +) ATPase activities was also related to the disease and was apparently uninfluenced by short [...] or long term metabolic control. In contrast with what was observed in the control group, sex caused in diabetic subjects significant variations in red blood cell <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities,</b> with women showing the lowest mean basal values of all <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities.</b> Parental hypertension {{turned out to be}} an independent risk factor in significantly reducing red blood cell <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> both in diabetic and control subjects. However, whereas in diabetic subjects sex interacted strongly with parental hypertension in causing reduction of <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities,</b> in controls the effect of parental hypertension was sex-independent and significantly reduced basal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities,</b> thus rendering subjects similar to diabetics. It is concluded that both sex and parental hypertension in association with diabetes, are predictors of further damage to red blood cell <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities,</b> which may thus be linked to increased risk of susceptibility towards vascular complications...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a biochemical {{study on the}} patient with mucolipidosis III (ML-III, pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) in Korea. Confluent fibroblasts from the patient and from normal controls were cultured for 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr, respectively. Lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> in culture media after different incubation times and in plasma, leuko-cytes, and fibroblasts were determined. Most of the leukocyte lysosomal enzymes were within normal limits or slightly lowered; however, plasma lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> {{such as those of}} hexosaminidase and arylsulfatase A were markedly increased. Numerous phase-dense inclusions were present in the cytoplasm of cultured fibroblasts. Lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> of fibroblasts were markedly decreased except for beta-glucosidase. The rates of increase of the lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> with incubation time were greater in the culture medium of the patient than in normal control, whereas no difference in the beta-glucosidase activity of the culture media of the patient and the control was found. This study describes the first case of ML-III in Korea, with its typical biochemical characteristics, i. e., a problem with targeting and transporting of lysosomal enzymes which results in a marked increase in plasma lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> and a high ratio of extracellular to intracellular lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> in cultured fibroblasts...|$|R
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E

5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. <b>Enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity,</b> and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of reclaimed scenarios on soil <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> and microbial community in a reclaimed surface coal mine on the Northwest Loess Plateau of China. Soil samples were collected from a bare land (CK), and a plantation (PL) and four mixed forests (MF 1 - 4). Soil physicochemical characteristics, four <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> and microbial abundance and T-RFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) profiles were measured. Effects of reclaimed scenarios on soil nutrients content, <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> and microbial community were pronounced. Soil organic carbon could be well used to predict the major differences in <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities,</b> and microbial abundance and composition. Soil <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities</b> were more significantly correlated with fungal abundance than bacterial and archaeal ones. The higher soil nutrient content, <b>enzyme</b> <b>activities,</b> and microbial abundance and diversity were from mixed forests and the lowest ones were from CK, which suggested mixed forests would be feasible scenarios in semi-arid Loess Plateau. Soil bacteria, archaea and fungi evolved with reclaimed process, but the influences of reclaimed scenarios on each domain of microbial abundance, diversity and composition were different. These findings suggested that soil bacteria, archaea and fungi play different ecological roles during restoration process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, and is therefore {{no longer able to}} act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> or gene regulation.|$|E
5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and {{inflammation of the}} skin, intervertebral discs, or inner layer of the heart. Identifying S.iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species.

5|$|The {{most common}} uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} {{pathological}} condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated {{to the type of}} enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> {{have been linked}} to disease of the adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E

5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|The flavour {{has been}} {{described}} as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. Fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity,</b> and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several {{studies have shown that the}} fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium.

25|$|Attaching ionic ligands to {{nanoparticles}} allows {{control over}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity.</b> An example of enzyme inhibition {{is given by}} binding of a-chymotrypsin (ChT), an enzyme with a largely cationic active site. When a-chymotrypsin is incubated with anionic (negatively charged) nanoparticles, ChT activity is inhibited as anionic nanoparticles bind to the active site. <b>Enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> can be restored {{by the addition of}} cationic surfactants. Alkyl surfactants form a bilayer around ChT, whereas thiol and alcohol surfactants alter the surface of ChT such that interactions with nanoparticles are interrupted.

25|$|Red {{blood cell}} {{transketolase}} activity is reduced in deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1), {{and may be}} used in the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy and other B1-deficiency syndromes if the diagnosis is in doubt. Apart from the baseline <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> (which may be normal even in deficiency states), acceleration of <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate may be diagnostic of thiamine deficiency (0-15% normal, 15-25% deficiency, >25% severe deficiency).|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous {{carriers}} (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> but manifest no disease symptoms. This {{phenomenon is}} called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles' dominance over nonfunctional mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used {{up in the}} process, so only small enzyme quantities are required {{to carry out a}} reaction. Someone homozygous for a nonfunctional mutation in the enzyme-encoding gene has little or no <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity,</b> so will manifest the abnormal phenotype. A heterozygote (heterozygous individual) has {{at least half of the}} normal <b>enzyme</b> <b>activity</b> level, due to expression of the wild-type allele.
