40|$|Different {{approaches}} to estimate organic sampling artifacts {{have been adopted}} by US long-term air quality monitoring networks. This study documents field blank (bQF) and backup filter (quartz-fiber behind quartz-fiber filter; QBQ) carbon levels for the: 1) Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE); 2) Speciation Trends Network (STN; part of the Chemical Speciation Network [CSN]; and 3) Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) networks. Filter pack sample handling procedures and blank correction methods are examined. Due to a relatively short (1 – 15 min) passive exposure period, STN/CSN and SEARCH network bQF organic carbon (OC; 0. 8 – 1 &mu;g/cm 2 ) may underestimate positive and negative OC artifacts, respectively, resulting from passive adsorption or volatilization of volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds on quartz-fiber filters while {{they are in the}} sampler. This is evidenced by a lack of temporal or spatial variability and low bQF levels. With ~ 7 d of ambient passive exposure, average IMPROVE bQF and QBQ OC are comparable (2. 4 &plusmn; 0. 5 and 3. 1 &plusmn; 0. 8 &mu;g/cm 2 ) and more than twice those found in the STN/CSN and SEARCH networks. Lower STN/CSN flow rates and larger <b>filter</b> <b>deposit</b> areas result in 9 – 20 % of the areal density (&mu;g/cm 2 ) compared to IMPROVE areal deposits. STN/CSN bQF values are 11 – 34 % lower than linear regression intercepts derived from collocated IMPROVE-STN/CSN data pairs.

Compared to monoculture, L. monocytogenes growth rate in co-culture was not reduced but the growth of the pathogen stopped as soon as BM entered the stationary phase.

40|$|Field blanks (bQF) and backup filters (quartz-fiber behind quartz-fiber filter; QBQ) {{have been}} adopted by US {{long-term}} air quality monitoring networks to estimate PM 2. 5 organic carbon (OC) sampling artifacts. This study documents bQF and QBQ carbon levels for the: 1) Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE); 2) Speciation Trends Network (STN; part of the Chemical Speciation Network [CSN]); and 3) Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) networks and examines the similarities/differences associated with network-specific sampling protocols. A higher IMPROVE sample volume and smaller <b>filter</b> <b>deposit</b> area results in PM 2. 5 areal density (μg/cm 2 on filter) 3 – 11 times those of STN/CSN and SEARCH samples for the same ambient PM 2. 5 concentrations, thus reducing the relative contribution of sampling artifacts from passive OC adsorption. A relatively short (1 – 15 min) passive exposure period of STN/CSN and SEARCH bQF OC (0. 8 – 1 μg/cm 2) underestimates positive and negative OC artifacts resulting from passive adsorption or evaporation of semi-volatile organic compounds on quartz-fiber filters. This is supported by low STN/CSN and SEARCH bQF levels and lack of temporal or spatial variability among the sites within the networks. With a much longer period, ~ 7 days of ambient passive exposure, average IMPROVE bQF and QBQ OC are comparable (2. 4 ± 0. 5 and 3. 1 ± 0. 8 μg/cm 2, respectively) and more than twice levels found in the STN/CSN and SEARCH networks. Sampling artifacts in STN/CSN were estimated from collocated IMPROVE samples based on linear regression. At six of the eight collocated sites in this study, STN/CSN bQFs underestimated OC artifacts by 11 – 34 %.

40|$|TThe {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to investigate the backwashing behavior of granular media filters used in water treatment under realistic conditions and to develop better models of the backwash process based on both fundamental and practical considerations. The focus of this study was on water only backwash but the applicability of the results to auxiliary backwash systems is discussed. The effects of filter backwash rate, coagulant used, degree of filter clogging and age of <b>filter</b> <b>deposits</b> on backwash behavior and efficiency were investigated in a pilot scale in-line filtration plant treating low turbidity raw water from a large dam. The results of these experiments and their implications both for modeling and managing filter backwash are discussed. The initial stages of backwashing are shown to be dominated by mixing and flow localization effects not accounted for in existing models of backwash. These effects appear to be dependent on both the equipment and the experimental conditions making the development of an accurate model of transient backwash behavior extremely difficult. However, it is shown that the overall efficiency of backwash can be predicted based on data about the filter and backwash design and operation that should be available at any treatment plant. This is an important first step in the development of modeling tool for the design and optimization of the complete filter cycle. A significant finding of this study was that the average age of <b>filter</b> <b>deposits</b> {{is one of the most}} important factors determining the ease with which they are detached during backwashing. Deposits become more difficult to remove the longer they remain in the filter. This has important implications for the robust design and operation of filters in applications where optimal backwash cannot be guaranteed. The rate of accumulation of mud in a filter over multiple filter cycles was determined experimentally for one set of backwash conditions and a procedure for estimating the useful life of a filter bed with sub-optimal backwash is proposed.

40|$|This paper concludes a {{five year}} program on {{research}} into {{the use of a}} portable X ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer for analyzing lead in air sampling filters from different industrial environments, including mining, manufacturing and recycling. The results from four of these environments have already been reported. The results from two additional metal processes are presented here. At both of these sites, lead was a minor component of the total airborne metals and interferences from other elements were minimal. Nevertheless, only results from the three sites where lead was the most abundant metal were used in the overall calculation of method accuracy. The XRF analyzer was used to interrogate the filters, which were then subjected to acid digestion and analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP OES). The filter samples were collected using different filter holders or "samplers" where the size (diameter), depth and homogeneity of aerosol deposit varied from sampler to sampler. The aerosol collection efficiencies of the samplers were expected to differ, especially for larger particles. The distribution of particles once having entered the sampler was also expected to differ between samplers. Samplers were paired to allow the between sampler variability to be addressed, and, in some cases, internal sampler wall deposits were evaluated and compared to the filter catch. It was found, rather surprisingly, that analysis of the <b>filter</b> <b>deposits</b> (by ICP OES) of all the samplers gave equivalent results. It was also found that deposits on some of the sampler walls, which in some protocols are considered part of the sample, could be significant in comparison to the <b>filter</b> <b>deposit.</b> If it is concluded that wall deposits should be analyzed, then XRF analysis of the filter can only give a minimum estimate of the concentration. Techniques for the statistical analysis of field data were also developed as part of this program and have been reported elsewhere. The results, based on data from the three workplaces where lead was the major element present in the samples, are summarized here. A limit of detection and a limit of quantitation are provided. Analysis of some samples using a second analyzer with a different X ray source technology indicated reasonable agreement for some metals (but this was not evaluated for lead). Provided it is only necessary to analyze the filters, most personal samplers will provide acceptable results when used with portable XRF analysis for lead around applicable limit values...|$|R

The test engine was typical of types used to power underground coal min-ing equipment. Test parameters consisted of baseline measurements without additive, three fuel additive concentrations, and five steady-state engine loads, all at 1, 200 r/min. Additive effects on soot mass concen-tration, opacity, particle size distribution, volatile fraction, and NOx emissions were determined. Important findings are as follows: Using the manufacturer's recom-mended additive concentration increased the gravimetrically measured mass of particulate by 30 to 80 pct at four of the five steady-state load conditions. Soot measurements by optical methods did not agree with those by gravimetric techniques, for additive-treated fuels.
