40|$|Abstract — A forced {{convection}} with desiccant integrated solar dryer {{has been built}} and tested. The main parts are: two flat plate solar air collectors, a drying chamber, desiccant bed and a centrifugal blower. The system is operated in two modes, sunshine hours and off sunshine hours. During sun shine hours the hot air from the flat plate collectors is forced to the drying chamber for drying the product and simultaneously the desiccant bed receives solar radiation directly and through the reflected mirror. In the off sunshine hours, the dryer is operated by circulating the air inside the drying chamber through the desiccant bed by a reversible fan. The dryer is used to dry 20 kg of green peas and pineapple slices. Drying experiments were conducted with and without the integration of <b>desiccant</b> <b>unit.</b> The effect of reflective mirror on the drying potential of <b>desiccant</b> <b>unit</b> was also investigated. With the inclusion of reflective mirror, the drying potential of the desiccant material is increased by 25 % and the drying time is reduced. The drying efficiency of the system varies between 48 % and 59 % and the pick-up efficiency varies between 25 % and 60 %, respectively. Approximately in all the drying experiments 68 % of moisture is removed by air heated using solar energy and the remainder by the desiccant. The inclusion of reflective mirror on the desiccant bed makes faster regeneration of the desiccant material.

40|$|Desiccant {{dehumidification}} {{has been}} given increasing interest in the air conditioning industry. Compared with conventional vapor compression air conditioning systems, desiccant dehumidification saves energy by separating humidity control from temperature control and also improves the indoor air quality as a good filter. This research explores the potential of applying desiccant dehumidification systems in buildings with less energy consumption. As the first step, the adsorption mechanism is explored and desiccant material properties are obtained based on a literature review. The heat and mass transfer in the desiccant - moist air system is well understood and modeled using both pseudo-gas-side controlled (PGC) transfer coefficients and semi-infinite transfer coefficients. Compared with experimental data, the model well predicts single processes while the prediction for cyclic processes is acceptable for practical applications. This model provides {{a useful tool for}} two purposes: analysis of <b>desiccant</b> <b>unit</b> 's performances and optimization of the design and operations of a unit. Based on the semi-infinite body theory, the semi-infinite model provides a way to simplify the solid-side diffusion resistance. A temperature control strategy is proposed to improve the mass transfer efficiency. A design in which the desiccant temperature is controlled in sections is tested using the model developed before. Simulations show that temperature control enhances mass transfer. Using the model, parametric analysis is conducted on a temperature-control led packed-bed <b>desiccant</b> <b>unit.</b> The effects on dehumidification performances of processing air mass flow rate, regeneration temperature and cycle time are studied.

In this paper, the inherent loose RH control of conventional air-conditioning system design is numerically investigated using annual energy simulation programs DOE- 2. 1 E and DesiCalcTM. Two technology design options, which include wrap-around heat pipes, and desiccant-outdoor air dehumidification, are simulated.

The main advantages of radiant {{heating and cooling}} are low operational noise and reduced fan power cost. Radiant heating and cooling has been supplied in several forms, including floor heating, ceiling heating and cooling, radiant panels and fa?ade heating and cooling. Among them, fa?ade heating and cooling is the most recently developed system. This dissertation provides a comprehensive study of several technical issues relative to radiant heating and cooling systems that have received little attention in previous research. The following aspects are covered in this dissertation: First, a heat transfer model of mullion radiators, one type of fa?ade heating and cooling, is developed and verified by measured performance data. The simulation demonstrates that the heating or cooling capacity of mullion radiators is a semi-linear function of supply water temperature and {{is affected by the}} thermal conductive resistance of mullion tubes, the room air temperature, the supply water flow rate, and the outside air temperature. Second, the impact of the positions of radiators on energy consumption and thermal comfort is studied. This dissertation compares the heating load and comfort level as measured by uniformity of operative temperature for two different layouts of radiators in the same geometric space. The air exchange rate has been identified as an important factor which affects energy saving benefits of the radiant heating systems. Third, the infiltration and the interaction of infiltration and mechanical ventilation air to produce moisture condensation in a radiantly cooled office are examined. The infiltration of the studied office is also explored by on-site blower door measurement, by analyzing measured CO 2 concentration data, and through modeling.

Compared to the energy demand for the sensible cooling of air the high humidity (in the order of 20 g water per kg dry air) in the tropics results in a significantly high air-dehumidification load. Handling the dehumidification load and sensible cooling load separately can reduce the electricity demand for air-conditioning considerably if the dehumidification is driven by heat energy (e. g. solar thermal or waste heat) instead of electricity. At the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), an experimental two-stage air-dehumidification system consisting of a membrane unit and an adsorption based <b>desiccant</b> <b>unit,</b> has been installed and analysed.

Measurements during the commissioning phase in Spain (public library) and in Germany (production hall) {{showed that the}} dehumidification efficiency of the sorption rotors was 80 % and the humidification efficiency of the contact evaporators was 85 - 86 %. Only in a two-stage desiccant system monitored in China (laboratory building), a dehumidification efficiency of 88 % was reached. The rotary heat exchangers only had 62 - 68 % measured heat recovery efficiency, which is lower than specified. Seasonal performance monitoring {{carried out in the}} German installation showed that average seasonal COP's were close to 1. 0, when related to all operation hours. COP's increase if low regeneration temperatures are used with low dehumidification rates, which is often sufficient for moderate German climatic conditions, but much less so in the humid Chinese climate. Electrical COP's for the German system including air distribution were between 1. 7 and 4. 6 and reach values of 7. 4, when only additional pressure drops of the <b>desiccant</b> <b>unit</b> are considered. It could be shown that conventional control strategies lead to high auxiliary energy consumption, for example if fixed heating setpoint temperatures are used. Furthermore the solar air collector energy yield was very low in the German system, as regeneration was only used when all other options such as humidification at high air volume flows did not reduce the room air temperature enough. The studies showed that the measured auxiliary energy consumption could be reduced to near zero, if regeneration temperature setpoints were not fixed to constant values. The solar air collector efficiency was good at about 50 % both for the flat plate collectors used in Spain and Germany and the Chinese vacuum tube solution.

Corresponding average thermal COP is about 0. 83 under Shanghai weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the performance of a proposed hybrid desiccant based air conditioning system referred as HDBAC is introduced in this paper. HDBAC is mainly consisted of a liquid <b>desiccant</b> dehumidification <b>unit</b> integrated with a vapor compression system (VCS). The VCS unit has a cooling capacity of 5. 27  kW and uses 134 a as refrigerant. Calcium chloride (CaCl 2) solution is used as the working desiccant material. HDBAC system is used to serve low sensible heat factor applications. The effect of different parameters such as, process air flow rate, desiccant solution flow rate, evaporator box and condenser box solution temperatures, strong solution concentration and regeneration temperature {{on the performance}} of the system is studied. The performance of the system is evaluated using some parameters such as: the coefficient of performance (COPa), specific moisture removal and energy saving percentage. A remarkable increase of about 54 % in the coefficient of performance of the proposed system over VCS with reheat is achieved. A maximum overall energy saving of about 46 % is observed which emphasizes the use of the proposed system as an energy efficient air conditioning system...|$|R

As {{a part of that}} program the use of a water cooled photovoltaic system evolved. The thermal energy would be utilized in homes with a district heating and desiccant cooling system. Thermal powered desiccant cooling was selected because it required water with relatively moderate temperatures, 140 - 1600 F, that could be easily transported in insulated low-cost plastic pipe. Three ASK Corp. <b>desiccant</b> cooling/heating <b>units</b> have been successfully operated in the Phoenix area on a 5000 sq ft solar-powered residence since October, 1985. There also are photovoltaic/water cooled intermediate concentrators commercially available that have been thoroughly tested through different Department of Energy programs. This study describes the use of a computer to design a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal system providing heat to a district heating and desiccant cooling system for a 24 home subdivision in the Phoenix area of Arizona. Excess thermal energy is stored in an insulated pond. The gunite coated foam cover of the pond served as a tracking base for the concentrating solar collectors...|$|R
40|$|Dehydration of Natural Gas to {{controlled}} {{water content}} {{is necessary in}} order to avoid gas hydrates and minimize corrosion. This study describes the dehydration on liquid <b>desiccant</b> dehydration <b>unit.</b> The key task was to identify the optimum parameters used in Triethylene Glycol dehydration unit. Absorption dehydration involves the use of Triethylene Glycol to remove water vapor from the gas stream. Water was removed to meet a water dew point requirement of sale gas contract specification range from 32. 8 to 117 kg/ 106 standard m 3. The evaluation of effectiveness parameters on gas dehydration plant was carried out by using ASPEN HYSYS simulation. ASPEN HYSYS was used for steady state simulation, design, performance monitoring and optimization of oil and gas production,gas processing and petroleum refining industries. Peng-Robinson equation of state was chosen in the system. The simulation was carried out to determine the effect of important parameters such as column operating pressure, number of theoretical stages of column and gas flow rate. A technically optimized dehydration process has been proposed based on the simulated data. Results showed that, when the gas flow rate increases, the water absorption rate will decrease. Same condition obtained as increasing pressure. However,water absorption rate increases with the increasing number of theoretical stages. The optimum condition of gas dehydration was at 2000 kPa with 1000 m 3 /h gas flow rate and 4 column theoretical stages...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to remove water content in {{untreated}} natural gas using solid <b>desiccant</b> dehydration <b>unit.</b> Dehydration of natural gas is needed to remove the water that is associated with natural gases in vapor form. The natural gas industry has recognized that dehydration is necessary to ensure smooth operation of gas transmission lines. Dehydration prevents the formation of gas hydrates and reduces corrosion. Unless gases are dehydrated, liquid water may condense in pipelines and accumulate at low points along the line and reducing its flow capacity. Several methods have been developed to dehydrate gases on an industrial scale. The three major methods of dehydration are direct cooling, adsorption, and absorption. In this experiment, the adsorption process was choosing. Silica gel was the desiccants used in adsorption processes. The desiccant dehydration is a very simple process, ideal for remote locations with limited utilities, environment benefit, easy to install and operate and it also suitable in laboratory scale. In this study, it focuses on designing, fabrication, hydrostatic test and experimental part. On the experimental part, the quality of the desiccant and the temperature is constant because it only focuses on operating pressure. At a constant temperature the water content of the gas decreases with increasing pressure, thus less water must be removed if the gas is dehydrated at a high pressure...|$|R
40|$|The solar {{desiccant}} {{cooling system}} performance {{depends on the}} interaction of various components {{under the influence of}} changing ambient air conditions and cooling load. Design point calculations provide preliminary estimates of performance but can be scarcely applied for the potential viability assessment of a particular system concept. The competitiveness of a solar desiccant cooling system depends on its seasonal operation, which is not assessable from the design point data alone. Computer simulations of seasonal performance provide a more accurate estimate of system viability and the potential impact on the consumer in terms of energy and costs. Furthermore, system simulations are a tool for investigating control strategies that maximise the thermal performance and minimise the parasitic power requirements. Solar desiccant systems have been extensively studied in the past decades, but few works were in regards to their simplified mathematical modelling for seasonal system performance assessment through computer simulations. In this paper an original set of models of solar desiccant cooling system components and control are presented. The algorithms, implementing the latter models, are meant to be used for yearly solar desiccant cooling system simulations based on one hour time-steps. Moreover, the tools, the procedure and the results of a set of yearly simulations are described. The models implemented for the TRNSYS platform include a <b>desiccant</b> air-handling <b>unit</b> (called type 275) and a control unit (type 276). A service library where all the mathematical models describing the physical processes through each component has been implemented.

40|$|Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) based {{systems have}} {{recently}} received increasing attention {{as a viable}} alternative for meeting the residential electrical and thermal demands. However, as the intermittent demand profiles of a building can only be addressed by a tri-generative unit which can operate at partial loads, the variation of performance of the system at partial loads might affect its corresponding potential benefits significantly. Nonetheless, no previous study {{has been carried out}} on assessing the performance of this type of tri-generative systems in such conditions. The present paper is the first of a two part study dedicated to the investigation of the performance of a tri-generative system in which a PEMFC based system is coupled with a <b>desiccant</b> wheel <b>unit.</b> This study is focused on evaluating the performance of the PEMFC subsystem while operating at partial loads. Accordingly, a detailed mathematical model of the fuel cell subsystem is first developed and validated using the experimental data obtained from the plant’s and the fuel cell stack’s manufacturer. Next, in order to increase the performance of the plant, two modifications have been proposed and the resulting performance at partial load have been determined. The obtained results demonstrate that applying both modifications results in increasing the electrical efficiency of the plant by 5. 5 %. It is also shown that, while operating at partial loads, the electrical efficiency of the plant does not significantly change; the fact which corresponds to the trade-off between the increment in the gross electrical efficiency and the lower slope of decrement in the auxiliary losses. The obtained results are suitable to be employed to assess the performance of the overall tri-generative system, conducted {{in the second part of}} the study, while meeting intermittent load profiles...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{desiccant}} HVAC {{systems have}} shown several advantages, compared to conventional cooling and dehumidification systems. Therefore, their use is also spreading for tertiary and residential buildings, {{especially when the}} regeneration of the desiccant {{can be obtained by}} using available waste heat. In this paper, an experimental analysis is presented on the performances of a silica-gel desiccant wheel, inserted in a test facility characterized by an advanced <b>desiccant</b> air handling <b>unit,</b> coupled to an electric chiller, a natural gas-fired boiler and a small scale cogenerator. The desiccant wheel is regenerated by using low temperature thermal energy recovered from the microcogenerator. The effects of the main thermal-hygrometric parameters (outdoor air humidity ratio and temperature, regeneration air temperature) on the desiccant wheel performances have been experimentally evaluated; in particular, the thermal-hygrometric properties of the process air exiting the rotor and the desiccant wheel effectiveness values have been obtained. Finally, fixing the regeneration temperature at its maximum available value (65 °C), ventilation and internal latent loads that the desiccant wheel can handle have been evaluated and compared to the required values, both for a set of cities {{all over the world and}} as a function of the thermal-hygrometric outdoor conditions...|$|R
