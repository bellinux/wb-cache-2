5|$|The {{throwing}} {{became more}} intense as kick-off approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved up against the wall, it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. At {{the other end of}} the ground, Juventus fans began to riot in retaliation for the events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E

Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E

The UNRWA shelter facilities were overflowing {{and many of the}} residents <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> According to Israeli sources the area had been designed by Hamas, houses had underground tunnels to hide weapons and combatants and that 10% of rocket attacks had been done from within Shuja'iyya. The assault on Shuja'iyya, involving a combination of F-16, tank and mortar fire, began at 11 pm on 19 July. After midnight, on Sunday, 20 July, Israeli forces entered the neighbourhood, stating that over 140 rockets had been fired at Israel from the neighborhood since 8 July. Flyers had been dropped over the neighbourhood, urging residents to flee.|$|E

His friend Sammy Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a weeklong gig in Reading, Pennsylvania, that would pay $19, more money than Gleason could imagine. The booking agent advanced him bus fare for the trip against his salary. This was Gleason's first job as a professional comedian; henceforth, he would always have regular work in small clubs.|$|E

25|$|By April {{the public}} debate in Britain was {{becoming}} so damaging that the government decided that the best option was to back down as gracefully as it could. The government's resolve was stiffened by the refusal of the Soviet government to provide any evidence for the trial. Further medical reports were commissioned, with varying results. A team of British Army doctors eventually reported that Rundstedt and Strauss were unfit to stand trial, and the government used this as a pretext to abandon the trial. On 28 April Cabinet considered the medical reports, and asked the Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, to prepare a report for its next meeting. On 5 May Cabinet accepted his recommendation that Rundstedt and Strauss be released, but that Manstein's trial should go ahead. Rundstedt was formally advised of his release on 19 May, but since he <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{he stayed in the}} hospital until 26 May, when he finally left British custody and went to the home of his brother Udo at Ratzeburg in Schleswig-Holstein.|$|E
25|$|While the {{embankments}} {{prevented the}} tide entering the area, they also prevented the fresh {{water from the}} north from leaving it, and drainage channels were cut to channel it to sluices through the main flood banks. Some of the early channels were cut by the monks of Meaux Abbey, but their primary function was probably navigation rather than drainage, since they ran east-west rather than north-south. Land drainage in England became more organised after {{the passing of the}} Statute of Sewers in 1532. This established Commissioners of Sewers for the main marshland areas of the country, with powers to inspect banks, to assign the work of maintenance, and to impose fines on those who did not comply. By the early seventeenth century, the salt marshes to the south were generally free from flooding, although in 1646 a severe storm resulted in a breach near Drypool, which resulted in Stoneferry being flooded for 26 weeks. The protection of the salt marshes had been achieved by erecting a large flood bank at Sutton, which prevented water from the carr lands to the north from entering the marshes, but as it then <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> the carrs remained waterlogged. Various plans for a new outlet to the south were suggested from the 1660s, but were met with opposition. In 1675, a local landowner called Sir Joseph Ashe cut a drain from Wawne carrs to the Hull, using windmills to pump the water into the Hull, and others followed his example.|$|E

Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville's column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe's force directly. [...] Had he waited, the British would have been entirely cut off—they <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> but back down the Foulon, {{and would have been}} under fire the entire way. To an artillery officer named Montbelliard, Montcalm explained his decision thus: [...] "We cannot avoid action; the enemy is entrenching, he already has two pieces of cannon. If we give him time to establish himself, we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have." ...|$|E

Across {{the remainder of the}} state, especially in coastal counties, most schools and government buildings were closed. In Escambia County, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for zones A, B, and C. Many shelters were opened for those who <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> and all county schools were shut down. At Naval Air Station Pensacola, many planes were either evacuated from the base or placed into secure hangars. Farther east in Santa Rosa County, a mandatory evacuation was also ordered for zones A, B, and C, including all mobile home parks, campgrounds, low-lying areas, and RV parks. In Walton County, special needs and general shelters were opened to the public, and all schools and government offices were to be shut down throughout the duration of the storm. The Clyde B. Wells Bridge was also shut down in anticipation of tropical storm-force winds.|$|E

In the absence of proper military objectives, the antagonists carried out their attacks on non-combatant targets, subjecting civilians of both sides to deprivation, intimidation and harassment.

Contrary to the Jews who built their [...] "State in the Making" [...] during the mandate period, the Palestinians had not created in time substitutes for the government services that vanished with the British withdrawal.

In practice its purpose was to punish political opponents. The UN estimates 700,000 people have been left without jobs or homes as a result.

2500|$|On 16 July, Israeli forces {{dropped by}} means of leaflets, {{loudspeaker}} announcements, telephone calls, text messages and radio messages, told the residents to leave and relocate in central Gaza City until further notice.
