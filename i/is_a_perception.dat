In Australia {{it was the}} highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's earnings were the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people read these themes {{in the news media}} already, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that Hollywood films are biased.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> {{that women}} in Madagascar should focus on cooking, with farming handled by the men. As such, poorer Malagasy women {{are not allowed to}} assist in the farming on other people's land.|$|E
25|$|Portions of {{the populations}} may {{perceive}} {{the police to}} be oppressors. In addition, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that victims of police brutality often belonging to relatively powerless groups, such as minorities, the disabled, the young, and the poor.|$|E

5000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> amongst anti-{{devolution}}ists that devolution {{was some}} sort of plot by the establishment, by the crachach. Their anti-devolutionists’ idea that they were standing up for ‘the people’ was reinforced by 1979.|$|R
50|$|Professor Akhil Amar of Yale Law School {{claimed that}} there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> {{on the part of}} those {{drafting}} the constitution that a member of the European aristocracy could immigrate and buy his way into power.|$|R

25|$|A hallucination, in the {{broadest}} sense of the word, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> {{in the absence of a}} stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.|$|E
25|$|The {{border between}} {{mainland}} China and Hong Kong runs along Chung Ying Street. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> {{of it being}} a notorious point of goods trafficking. When the checkpoint opened a flow of Chinese nationals enter Chung Ying Street with visiting permits. Some may make several trips a day acquiring goods and abusing the custom tariff limits on goods. These traffickers then unload their burden to collect their pay inside mainland Shatoujiao. Although {{there are a lot}} of goods leaving Hong Kong from Sha Tau Kok via Chung Ying Street there is also an inflow of foodstuffs and other commodities that come through from China into Hong Kong throughout the day, and only limited by the closure of the Chinese custom post.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding Miss Pross's {{denial of}} her own imagination, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her {{repetition}} of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing.|$|R
50|$|Voss {{entered the}} 2007 season {{struggling}} with injury, and {{was unable to}} hold a place in the side. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that he had lost some pace, and Voss did not reach his previous standards in his 11 matches for the year.|$|R
25|$|In recent years, {{there has}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> amongst locals that {{commercial}} fishers have damaged fisheries in the Kaipara. Locals have been frustrated {{in their attempts}} to gain government support. The veteran filmmaker Barry Barclay has examined this in his 2005 documentary, The Kaipara affair.|$|R
500|$|Allardyce {{also has}} a {{reputation}} for using long ball tactics, though has said that this reputation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that is [...] "totally and utterly wrong". Former Newcastle player Lee Clark defended Allardyce from criticism of his tactics and said that Allardyce was right to work hard on set-plays and on the organisation of his team.|$|E
500|$|While there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that grunge bands were [...] "overwhelmingly male", women [...] "were totally represented" [...] in grunge bands such as L7, Lunachicks, Dickless, 7 Year Bitch, The Gits, Courtney Love's band Hole (and Love's other 1990s groups), and Babes in Toyland, {{the latter}} an [...] "...all-female Minneapolis band", and grunge was closely [...] "linked with Riot Grrrl", an {{underground}} feminist punk movement.

500|$|These {{traditions and}} ways of Indian life have been in effect {{for so long that}} this type of {{lifestyle}} is what women have become accustomed to and expect. [...] Indian women often do not take full advantage of their constitutional rights because they are not properly aware or informed of them. [...] Women also tend to have poor utilisation of voting rights because they possess low levels of political awareness and sense of political efficacy. [...] Women are not often encouraged to become informed about issues. Due to this, political parties do not invest much time in female candidates because there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that they are a [...] "wasted investment." ...|$|E
5000|$|An Army staff {{sergeant}} received an unfavorable Non-Commissioned Officer Evaluation Report in reprisal for reporting {{to members of}} her chain of command that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> of favoritism and a possible inappropriate relationship between two non-commissioned officers. The evaluation report was rescinded. In addition, responsible management officials were counseled.|$|R

50|$|The Australian Institute of Crime's 2014 Northern Territory Safe Streets Audit {{found that}} factors {{that contributed to}} a {{heightened}} fear of crime in the Northern Territory <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that crime <b>is</b> more frequent and serious than it actually is, lower levels {{of confidence in the}} police and the impact sensationalist media coverage.|$|R
2500|$|Although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that {{sharecropping}} was exploitative, [...] "evidence {{from around}} the world suggests that sharecropping is often a way for differently endowed enterprises to pool resources to mutual benefit, overcoming credit restraints and helping to manage risk." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{defining}} qualia is as [...] "raw feels". A raw feel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> {{in and of}} itself, considered entirely in isolation from any effect it might have on behavior and behavioral disposition. In contrast, a cooked feel is that perception seen as existing {{in terms of its}} effects. For example, the perception of the taste of wine is an ineffable, raw feel, while the experience of warmth or bitterness caused by that taste of wine would be a cooked feel. [...] Cooked feels are not qualia.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that Singapore {{society is}} highly {{regulated}} through the criminalization of many activities which are considered as fairly harmless in other countries. These include failing to flush toilets after use, littering, jaywalking, {{the possession of}} pornography, the sale of chewing gum, and sexual activity; such as oral and anal sex between men. It has been claimed {{that one of the}} results of such heavy regulation is that Singapore has one of the lowest incidences of violent crimes in the world. A catchphrase recently used in a police anti-crime campaign was [...] "Low crime does not mean no crime".|$|E
50|$|In late 2009 there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> broad <b>perception</b> {{that the}} United States economy was {{beginning}} {{to recover from the}} Late-2000s recession. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> broad <b>perception</b> that government spending authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 had contributed to the recovery, and some desire for the government to do more to encourage job growth and a faster recovery.|$|R
5000|$|Lastly, {{boundary}} turbulence {{can also}} occur when there {{have not been}} pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, {{with the emergence of}} social media and, in particular, Facebook, boundary rules had not <b>been</b> established. <b>As</b> parents began to join Facebook and [...] "friend" [...] their children, the children felt turbulence. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.|$|R
25|$|Viññāa has two {{components:}} {{the awareness}} itself, {{and the object}} of that awareness (which might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception,</b> <b>a</b> feeling etc.). Thus, in this way, these viññāas are not considered as ultimate (underived) phenomena as {{they are based on}} mental factors (cetasika). For example, jhānic (meditative) states are described as based on the five ultimate mental factors of applied thought (vitakka), sustained thought (vicara), rapture (piti), serenity (sukha) and one-pointedness (ekaggatā).|$|R
2500|$|A {{hallucination}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> in {{the absence}} of external stimulus that has qualities of real perception. Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space. They are distinguishable from these related phenomena: dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness; illusion, which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; imagery, which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control; and pseudohallucination, which does not mimic real perception, but is not under voluntary control. Hallucinations also differ from [...] "delusional perceptions", in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e., a real perception) is given some additional (and typically absurd) significance.|$|E
2500|$|Touch or somatosensation (adjectival form: somatic), {{also called}} tactition [...] (adjectival form: tactile) or mechanoreception, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> {{resulting}} from activation of neural receptors, generally {{in the skin}} including hair follicles, {{but also in the}} tongue, throat, and mucosa. A variety of pressure receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of itching caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord. The loss or impairment of the ability to feel anything touched is called tactile anesthesia. [...] Paresthesia is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is little}} {{data on the}} {{percentage}} of people with bulimia in general populations. Most studies conducted thus far have been on convenience samples from hospital patients, high school or university students. These have yielded a wide range of results: between 0.1% and 1.4% of males, and between 0.3% and 9.4% of females. [...] Studies on time trends in the prevalence of bulimia nervosa have also yielded inconsistent results. According to Gelder, Mayou and Geddes (2005) bulimia nervosa is prevalent between 1 and 2 percent of women aged 15–40 years. Bulimia nervosa occurs more frequently in developed countries and in cities, with one study finding that bulimia is five times more prevalent in cities than in rural areas. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that bulimia is most prevalent amongst girls from middle-class families; however, in a 2009 study girls from families in the lowest income bracket studied were 153 percent more likely to be bulimic than girls from the highest income bracket.|$|E
50|$|Aboriginal {{deaths in}} custody {{became an issue}} of {{community}} concern in Australia because of <b>a</b> widespread <b>perception</b> that <b>a</b> disproportionate number of Indigenous Australians had died in jail after being arrested by police or otherwise convicted of offences. This concern was particularly acute in the 1980s, when there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> amongst some sections of the community that these deaths were being caused, either directly or indirectly, {{by the police and}} prison authorities.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to reducing demand, ENV are {{heavily involved in}} ensuring law enforcement agencies prosecute wildlife crime offenders to {{the full extent of}} the law. In recent years there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that the authorities are not taking wildlife crime as seriously as they should and are reluctant to prosecute anyone other than low level players involved in wildlife trafficking.|$|R
2500|$|In retrospect, {{aside from}} being a {{collection}} of songs, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> among some that the album tells a story; that its structure consists of a beginning, middle and end. One critic opined: [...] "There is a proper introduction, a rousing orchestral finale, and arguably a coherent narrative of love, sex, drugs and loss." [...] Anderson was highly influenced by the silver screen and admitted that during the recording of Suede's debut album, he watched Performance every night. Critics have noted the album's cinematic influence, with Simon Price writing that Anderson used {{the city as a}} [...] "cinematic backdrop to the tragic heroism of his own life." [...] Likewise, on the subject of Suede's familiar lyrical themes, the Radio Times wrote that [...] "He [...] would replace it with something deeper and timeless, drawing on old Hollywood and tragic, quotidian love stories." [...] Critics have likened the album to having an aura of claustrophobia. While SPIN, summarised the album as [...] "the work of a man cautiously opening the bedroom door and reeling from the discovery that other people have lives." [...] Other themes the album explores are solitude, paranoia and self-loathing. On the darker side the album depicts tragedy, failed relationships and doomed romances; however, within this dark setting, Anderson allowed positive statements of ambition and social mobility, reflected in [...] "The Power".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the early-to-mid-17th century [...] "continental rationalism" [...] John Locke (1632–1704) proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) a very influential view wherein the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori, i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding {{the proposition that the}} human mind is a tabula rasa, a [...] "blank tablet", in Locke's words [...] "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which {{is very different from the}} quest for certainty of Descartes.|$|E
60|$|We thus {{see that}} it is {{impossible}} to express in words any result of observation, without performing an act possessing what Dr. Whewell considers to be characteristic of Induction. There is always something introduced which was not included in the observation itself; some conception common to the phenomenon with other phenomena to which it is compared. An observation can not be spoken of in language at all without declaring more than that one observation; without assimilating it to other phenomena already observed and classified. But this identification of an object—this recognition of it as possessing certain known characteristics—has never been confounded with Induction. It is an operation which precedes all induction, and supplies it with its materials. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> of resemblances, obtained by comparison.|$|E
50|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> that WPA {{employees}} were not diligent workers, {{and that they}} had little incentive to give up their busy work in favor of productive jobs. Some employers said that the WPA instilled poor work habits and encouraged inefficiency. Some job applicants found that a WPA work history was viewed negatively by employers, who said they had formed poor work habits.|$|R
5000|$|Fundamental to this {{movement}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perception</b> of U.S. complicity in Chun's rise to power, and, more particularly, in the Gwangju Uprising itself. These matters remain controversial. It is clear, for example, that the U.S. authorized the ROK Army's 20th Division to re-take Gwangju - as acknowledged in a 1982 {{letter to the}} New York Times by then-Ambassador William H.
