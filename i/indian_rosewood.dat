25|$|Tamburs {{are made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood. The shell (Tekne) is {{assembled}} from strips of hardwood called ribs joined edge to edge to form a semi-spherical body for the instrument. The number of ribs traditionally amounts to 17, 21 or 23, yet examples with slightly wider and consequently fewer ribs (7, 9 or 11) {{can also be found}} among older specimens. Traditionally, thinner strips called fileto are inserted between the ribs for ornamental purposes, but are not obligatory. The most common tonewood veneers used for rib-making are mahogany, flame maple, Persian walnut, Mecca balsam wood (Commiphora gileadensis), Spanish chestnut, Greek juniper, mulberry, Oriental plane, <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> and apricot. Ribs are assembled on the bottom wedge (tail) and the heel on which the fingerboard is mounted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe {{tried his}} hand at making an {{instrument}} for Garcia. After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay. The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, {{had been taken from}} a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers. Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to [...] "wing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|North Indian {{vegetation}} {{is predominantly}} deciduous and coniferous. Of the deciduous trees, sal, teak, walnut, sheesham (<b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood)</b> and poplar are some which are important commercially.

The birch, especially, has historical significance in Indian culture {{due to the}} extensive use of birch paper (...) as parchment for many ancient Indian texts. The Eastern Himalayan region consists of oaks, laurels, maples, rhododendrons, alder, birch and dwarf willows. Reflecting the diverse climatic zones and terrain contained in the region, the floral variety is extensive and ranges from Alpine to temperate thorn, coniferous to evergreen, and thick tropical jungles to cool temperate woods.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, many musicians, {{including}} Clarence White and Eric Thompson preferred Martin guitars {{built before}} World War II to more recent guitars {{of the same}} model. The prewar guitars had a different internal bracing pattern consisting of scalloped braces (the later ones were tapered rather than scalloped), with the x-brace forward-shifted to about an inch of the soundhole, producing better resonance, and tops made from Adirondack red spruce rather than Sitka spruce. After 1969, the rosewood components, including the backs and sides of some models, were changed from Brazilian rosewood to <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood,</b> due to restrictions {{on the sale of}} Brazilian rosewood. The D-28s and D-35s (introduced in the mid-1960s {{to make use of the}} more narrow pieces of wood, by using a three-piece back design) are now very sought-after on the vintage guitar market, fetching sums in the neighborhood of $5,000-$6,000.
