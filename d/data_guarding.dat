40|$|Oracle <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> is the management, monitoring, and {{automation}} {{software infrastructure}} that creates, maintains, and monitors {{one or more}} standby databases to protect enterprise data from failures, disasters, errors, and <b>data</b> corruptions. <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> maintains standby databases as consistent copies of the production database as far as transactions are concerned. These standby databases can be located at remote disaster recovery sites {{thousands of miles away}} from the production data center, or they may be located in the same city, same campus, or even in the same building. If the production database becomes unavailable because of a planned or an unplanned outage, <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> can switch any standby database to the production role, thus minimizing the downtime associated with the outage, andpreventing any data loss. The document explains the structure of a physical standby database with Oracle <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> in an SAP environment. It indicates all the steps needed to successfully install and configure an Oracle <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> system with a physical standby database and the logical order in which they must be carried out. To enable you to operate the standby database (Oracle DataGuard), a description of how to configure the <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> Brokeris also provided.

40|$|Attestation {{has become}} a {{promising}} approach for ensuring software integrity in wireless sensor networks. However, current attestation either focuses on static system properties, e. g., code integrity, or requires hardware support such as Trusted Platform Module (TPM). However, there are attacks exploiting vulnerabilities that do not violate static system properties, and sensor platforms may not have hardware-based security support. This paper presents asoftwareattestationschemefordynamicdataintegrity based on data boundary integrity. It automatically transforms the source code and inserts <b>data</b> <b>guards</b> to track runtime program <b>data.</b> A <b>data</b> <b>guard</b> is unrecoverable once it is corrupted by an attacker, even if the attacker fully controls the system later. The corruption of any <b>data</b> <b>guard</b> at runtime can be remotely detected. A corruption either indicates a software attack or a bug in the software that needs immediate attention. The benefits of the proposed attestation scheme are as follows. First, it does not rely on any additional hardware support, making it suitable for lowcost sensor nodes. Second, it introduces minimal communication cost and has adjustable runtime memory overhead. Third, it works even if sensor nodes use different hardware platforms, {{as long as they}} run the same software. The prototype implementation and the experiments on TelosB motes show that the proposed technique is both effective and efficient for sensor networks. ...|$|R

Nonuniform communication architectures (NUCAs), for example CC-NUMAs built from a few large nodes or from chip multiprocessors (CMPs), have a lower penalty for reading data from a neighbor's cache than from a remote cache.

50|$|Users of Oracle {{databases}} {{refer to}} the server-side memory-structure as the SGA (System Global Area). The SGA typically holds cache information such as data-buffers, SQL commands, and user information. In addition to storage, the database consists of online redo logs (or logs), which hold transactional history. Processes can in turn archive the online redo logs into archive logs (offline redo logs), which {{provide the basis for}} data recovery and for the physical-standby forms of data replication using Oracle <b>Data</b> <b>Guard.</b>|$|R

Physical standby databases can function either in managed-recovery mode or in read-only mode, but not in both modes at the same time (unless the databases are at Oracle Database 11.1 or higher and the Active <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> option is licensed - see below).

50|$|Having a redo log {{makes it}} {{possible}} to replay SQL statements. Before an Oracle database changes data in a datafile it writes changes to the redo log. If something happens to one of the datafiles, a recovery procedure can restore a backed-up datafile and then replay the redo written since backup-time; this brings the datafile to the state it had before it became unavailable. Standby databases in an Oracle <b>Data</b> <b>Guard</b> environment use the same technique: one database (the primary database) records all changes and sends them to the standby database(s). Each standby database applies (replays) the arrived redo, resulting in synchronization with the primary database.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Workflow {{management}} systems (WfMSs) frequently use data {{to coordinate the}} execution of workflow instances. A WfMS evaluates conditions defined on data to make the control flow decisions i. e. selecting the next activity or deciding on an actor. However, data- within and outside of a running workflow instance- may change dynamically. Modifications of data needed for past control flow decisions may invalidate these decisions. We analyze the desired synchronization policies, and propose a mechanism called <b>data</b> <b>guard</b> to selectively guarantee that significant changes in data are recognized and handled by the data management system to ensure correctness of workflow execution in face of asynchronous updates. ...|$|R
