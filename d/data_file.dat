5|$|An f-deck is a <b>data</b> <b>file</b> that {{contains}} {{a record of the}} fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location fix is any position estimate of the storm center. An intensity fix is any estimate of the storm's intensity. Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low-level penetrations through the storm center. Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E

5|$|Data {{for most}} of the storms were {{provided}} through the World Wide Consolidated Tropical Cyclone <b>data</b> <b>file</b> known as TD-9636. The document utilized several sources to indicate where storms were located, and as a result there were duplications. During the season, the Philippine Weather Bureau issued monthly bulletins, which later provided info for tropical cyclone tracks. The agency used weather stations that were established by Spain and the United States after each country ruled over the archipelago. The weather data ceased in August 1940, which were later rebuilt in 1945. Also in 1940, meteorology records were disrupted in Hong Kong, which were later restored in 1947, due to World War II.|$|E

40|$|Imagine a {{situation}} in which you are sent dozens of new <b>data</b> <b>files,</b> by a varying number of users, which must be processed on a daily basis. Perhaps the users are at other locations and are FTP-ing the <b>data</b> <b>files</b> to a designated “data directory. ” Perhaps the users are within your organization and are writing the <b>data</b> <b>files</b> from other operating systems to a data directory allocated via a Samba share drive. Perhaps the users are all on a shared server within your organization and are writing new <b>data</b> <b>files</b> to a <b>data</b> directory on the same system. Whatever the case, this scenario usually generates a lot of maintenance to the SAS program that processes the <b>data</b> <b>files.</b> When new users are added, you must modify your program to allocate and process their specific files. When users are removed, you must modify your program so that it does not attempt to allocate and process their <b>data</b> <b>files.</b> And, when a given file is not present for one reason or another, you must add logic so that your program does not abend.

An executable file might consist only of resources (including code segments) with an empty data fork, while a <b>data</b> <b>file</b> might have only a data fork with no resource fork.
