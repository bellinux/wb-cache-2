40|$|This project {{presents}} {{the study of}} electric field stress along {{the surface of a}} 132 kV ceramic post insulator. Insulators are among the important devices of the electric power transmission systems. They are used to support and separate conductors at high voltage. Different insulator shapes have been obtained by varying several parameters, which defines the shape of the post insulator. For each insulator shape, the maximum electric field stress occurring on the insulator surface has been determined under clean and dry environment. The COMSOL Multiphysics software has been employed to investigate the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. The full detailed model of a dry and clean ceramic 132 kV post insulator with 25 sheds has been developed for the base model calculation. The maximum value of electric field stress was found to be at the junction between the porcelain and the <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> <b>End</b> <b>fittings</b> with round edges tend to reduce the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. With smaller first shed’s outer corner radius, the electric field stress slightly decreases. The electric field stress of the 25 th shed near the top <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> tends to reduce as the shed’s inclination angle is increased. Furthermore, as the shed’s diameter increases, the electric field stress increases except at the shed’s outer corner where the electric field stress decreases.

The <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> design was found to be significantly affecting the electric field stress along the surface of the post insulator.

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised {{to enable the}} {{fabrication}} of lightweight pressure vessels from multilayer composite materials. This method is related to, but not the same as, the method described in gMaking a Metal- Lined Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel h (MFS- 31814), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 3 (March 2005), page 59. The method is flexible in that it poses no major impediment to changes in tank design and is applicable {{to a wide range}} of tank sizes. The figure depicts a finished tank fabricated by this method, showing layers added at various stages of the fabrication process. In the first step of the process, a mandrel that defines the size and shape of the interior of the tank is machined from a polyurethane foam or other suitable lightweight tooling material. The mandrel is outfitted with metallic <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> on a shaft. Each <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> includes an outer flange that has a small step to accommodate a thin layer of graphite/epoxy or other suitable composite material. The outer surface of the mandrel (but not the fittings) is covered with a suitable release material. The composite material is filament- wound so as to cover the entire surface of the mandrel from the step on one <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> to the step on the other <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> The composite material is then cured in place. The entire workpiece is cut in half in a plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry at its mid-length point, yielding two composite-material half shells, each containing half of the foam mandrel. The halves of the mandrel are removed from within the composite shells, then the shells are reassembled and bonded together with a belly band of cured composite material. The resulting composite shell becomes a mandrel for the subsequent steps of the fabrication process and remains inside the final tank. The outer surface of the composite shell is covered with a layer of material designed to be impermeable by the pressurized fluid to be contained in the tank. A second step on the outer flange of each <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> accommodates this layer. Depending on the application, this layer could be, for example, a layer of rubber, a polymer film, or an electrodeposited layer of metal. If the fluid to be contained in the tank is a gas, then the best permeation barrier is electrodeposited metal (typically copper or nickel), which can be effective at a thickness of as little as 0. 005 in (. 0. 13 mm). The electrodeposited metal becomes molecularly bonded to the second step on each metallic <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> The permeation-barrier layer is covered with many layers of filament-wound composite material, which could be the same as, or different from, the composite material of the inner shell. Finally, the filament-wound composite material is cured in an o...|$|R

40|$|The term tape setback method denotes {{a method}} of {{designing}} and fabricating bonded joints between (1) box beams or other structural members made of laminated composite (matrix/ fiber) materials and (2) metal <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> used to fasten these structural members to other structural members. The basic idea of the tape setback method is to mask the bonded interface between the metallic <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> and composite member such that the bond does not extend out to the free edges of the composite member. The purpose served by the tape setback method is to strengthen the joints by decoupling stress concentrations from edge defects, which can cause premature failures. A related prior method that serves a similar purpose, involving the use of tapered adherends at the joints, can be too difficult and costly to be acceptable in some applications. The tape setback method offers an easier, less costly alternative. The structural members to which the method was originally applied were box beams {{in the form of}} composite tubes having flat faces with rounded corners. The <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> were plugs made of a low-thermal- expansion nickel/iron alloy (see figure). In computational-simulation studies of tensile and compressive loading of members without tape setback, stresses were found to be concentrated at the free end edges of the composite tubes, and inspection of members that had been subjected to real tension and compression tests showed that cracks started at the free end edges. As applied to these members, the tape setback method makes them less vulnerable to initiation of failure at edge defects produced during fabrication. In real tension tests of comparable members without and with tape setback, the average mean tensile strength of the members with tape setback was found to be 1. 9 times that of the members without tape setback...|$|R
