5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E

5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke <b>in</b> <b>through</b> a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation {{and then turned}} to pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise and Salt Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men and threatened to blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed <b>in</b> <b>through</b> rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E

5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} <b>in</b> <b>through</b> direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of {{that goes into the}} bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.|$|E

These auctions raised just under $11,000 for the relief effort. Members of the community also chipped <b>in</b> <b>through</b> personal means; one member held a charity Xbox live night and raised $139. In 2003, following news that community member Brian Morden's cancer had returned, the community decided to set up a donation fund to support him.

5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken <b>in</b> <b>through</b> openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E
5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library {{to ask him about}} his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel make their way into the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E

5|$|Supplies {{had been}} brought <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the air and via the Mexican navy {{containing}} food, blankets, and medicine early on October2. However, additional bad weather initially prevented further supplies from coming in. Around that time, President Echeverria ordered emergency aid to be sent La Paz, Los Mochis, and Ciudad Obregon, as well as three coastal Sonoran ports. In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000homeless persons. Meanwhile, city officials appealed for additional food, medicine, and construction materials. Gerald Ford, {{who was then the}} U.S. president, agreed to provide aid for victims of Hurricane Liza; the first of which arrived late on October2, containing food and construction materials. The next day, power had been restored to hospitals, government centers, and gas stations.
