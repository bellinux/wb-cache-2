40|$|Purpose: This article {{describes}} {{performance of the}} experimental 90 -ton <b>forging</b> <b>ingot</b> casting, the way of cutting, the methodology of chemical analysis {{and the results of}} that investigation. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental ingot 8 K 91 SF weighing almost 90 tons was cast due the performance a detailed analysis of the current state of casting and solidification. The ingot was cut and macrostructure and chemical heterogeneity of the ingot was evaluated in detail. The standard method used in metallurgical analytics - analyses using optical emission spectrometers - was not applicable due to the large number of required analyzes. Thus, the mobile optical spectrometer SPECRTOTEST was used. Sulfur prints and fluid penetration tests were performed due to detect macroscopic distribution of sulfur and to locate surface-breaking defects. Findings: Current level of segregations of selected elements in real 90 -ton steel ingot was detected. Also mutual mixing of two heats needed for the production of this ingot was verified. Research limitations/implications: Future research is focused on determination of inclusion content in selected parts of experimental ingot and on the level of micro-segregations. We are limited by the accuracy of chosen analytical method, which is also discussed in the paper. Practical implications: The gained knowledge is used to specification of the setting of boundary conditions of the numerical simulations, which should help to optimize the production technology of casting heavy forging ingots and minimize the level of segregation in ingots. Originality/value: New knowledge concerning mutual mixing of two heats needed for bottom casting of heavy <b>forging</b> <b>ingot</b> are presented in this paper. Distribution of segregation in so heavy ingot was detected. Results are the base for further investigations in macro-segregations and for the improving the accuracy of results of numerical simulations...|$|E

Hot ductility testing is performed in a manner that approximates industrial conditions experienced by large cross-section <b>forging</b> <b>ingots.</b> A computer model for precipitation of aluminum nitride and vanadium nitride in austenite is presented.

The work describes the effect of silicon and aluminium on the morphology, type and amount of sulphides and on the degree of development of cords. A mechanism of influence of the oxygen activity on the formation of sulphides is proposed. The work deals with the development of a new procedure for modelling the process of development of the cords, according to which an investigation was made in relation to the conditions of formation and rate of development of the cords, and to the effect of thermophysical, structural and chemical factors on these processes.

The improvement of such macrosegregation is a central problem in the solidification process.

Dilatometry analyses demonstrated that tempering behavior varied significantly from bainitic to martensitic microstructures. Retained austenite, which exists between bainitic ferrite sheaves, decomposes to lower bainite causing a remarkable volume increase. It was found that this decomposition finishes below 386 °C.

40|$|The {{main problem}} in the {{production}} of forgings from tool steels, especially thick plates, blocks, pulleys and rods which are used for special machine components for demanding applications, it is the inhomogeneous structure with segregations, cracks in segregations or complex type of non-metallic inclusions MnS and TiCN. These forgings are actually produced from conventional <b>forging</b> <b>ingots.</b> Due to the size of forgings, it would be interesting the production of these forgings from slab ingots. It is possible that the production of forgings from slab ingots (which are distinguished by a characteristic aspect ratio A/B), it would reduce the occurrence of segregations. The paper presents the verification of the production process of slab steel ingots in particular by means of numerical modelling using finite element method. The paper describes the pre-processing, processing and post-processing phases of numerical modelling.

Research limitations/implications: It was concluded that all stages of ultra-pure steel production must be conducted conscientiously and meticulously. It is also necessary to improve the conditions of vacuum steel refining process by equipping steelworks with a new vacuum device, e. g. of VOD type.

Originality/value: The simulation results concerning the production of refining slag show that the use of bauxite as a slag forming material leads to an increase in the share of liquid phase. Refining steel under a heating layer contributes to the improvement of steel purity – which is measured by analysing the share of surface nonmetallic inclusions. Refining steel under refining slag with a basic character and physical properties adapted to the temperature close to the liquidus temperature of steel contributes to a decrease in the amount of non-metallic inclusions, a decrease in their size. It can aslo affect the shape of inclusions - making them almost spherical in shape.

40|$|<b>Forging</b> <b>ingots</b> are hot {{worked to}} {{consolidate}} structural imperfections and refine the microstructure. Possible imperfections are segregations, porosities, cracks, and inclusions. In this thesis, techniques and methods for the characterisation of behaviour and properties of ingots and forgings. The root causes for quality issues in open-die forgings are {{shown to be}} numerous. Ingot structure in cast tool steel was analyzed, and the main imperfections were centre macrosegregation, and mid radius A-segregations. For overheated steel forgings and low reductions after reheating, a high ultrasonic attenuation and low Charpy-V toughness was found. It {{could be related to}} the coarse grain structure found. Only a high forging reduction after reheating will break down the coarse structure. Shorter reheating times and lower forging temperatures gave higher toughness and lower ultrasonic attenuation. Some reduction in toughness was also found from the inclusion field {{from the bottom of the}} ingot. Accurate attenuation measurements require a lathe turned surface, complicating in-between-measurements in heat treatment sequences. But on carefully surface prepared forgings, attenuation measurement can be used to determine the success of grain refinement in the heat treatment.

40|$|In the {{metallurgical}} industry, {{ultrasonic inspection}} is routinely {{used for the}} detection of defects. For the nondestructive inspection of small high strength steel parts, the material can be considered isotropic. However, when the size of the parts under inspection is large, the isotropic material hypothesis does not necessarily hold. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of the variation in mechanical properties such as grain size, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, chemical composition on longitudinal and transversal ultrasonic wave velocities. A 2 cm thick slice cut from a 40 -ton bainitic steel <b>ingot</b> that was <b>forged</b> and heat treated was divided into 875 parallelepiped samples of 2 x 4 x 7 cm 3. A metallurgical study has been performed to identify the phase and measure the grain size. Ultrasonic velocity measurements at 2. 25 MHz for longitudinal and transversal waves were performed. The original location of the parallelepiped samples in the large <b>forged</b> <b>ingot</b> and the measured velocities were used to produce an ultrasonic velocity map. Using a local isotropy assumption as well as the local density of the parallelepiped samples calculated from the chemical composition of the ingot provided by a previously published study [1], Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio were calculated from the longitudinal and transversal wave velocities.

In this paper, using the Moiré method, a newly developed 1200 °C high-temperature Moiré modelling technique and apparatus for measuring the critical closing reduction of artificial cavities, the single reduction of the FM heavy free-forging process has been investigated systematically, the critical closing reduction rate curve of artificial cavities and the internal strain/stress distribution having been obtained. The Moiré analysis shows that when the anvil width ratio (AWR) W/H 0 = 0. 6, the maximum deformation penetrates into the core of the specimen and, a nearly symmetrical deformation distribution is obtained in the use of an unsymmetric anvil arrangement, where W/H 0 = 0. 5 is the transition anvil width ratio of the central axial stress (from tension to compression). Experiments on porous material also show that W/H 0 = 0. 6 has the strongest forging effect. The author thus conclude that W/H 0 = 0. 6 is the optimum anvil width ratio for the FM forging process. The Moiré patterns obtained after the 1200 °C forgings process are very successful. The development of this technique affords a powerful tool in research into hot-forming processes, especially useful in the integration of plasticity theory with materials science. Finally, some suggestions are made for the improvement of the FM process...|$|R

ESR ingots with high (0. 14 to 0. 50 wt%) carbon content were successfully forged at 1000 degrees C. At high (60 % or more) forging reductions the cast columnar structute of ESR alloys was transformed into recrystallized grain structure. The room temperature mechanical properties did not improve significantly after forging.

2500|$|Colonial silversmiths used {{many of the}} {{techniques}} developed by those in Europe. Casting was frequently {{the first step in}} manufacturing silver pieces, as silver workers would melt down sterling silver into easily manageable ingots. Occasionally, they would create small components (e.g. teapot legs) by casting silver into iron or graphite molds, but it was rare for an entire piece to be fabricated via casting. Next, silversmiths would <b>forge</b> the <b>ingots</b> into the shapes they desired, often hammering the thinned silver against specially shaped dies to [...] "mass produce" [...] simple shapes like the oval end of a spoon. This process occurred at room temperature, and thus is called “cold-working”. The repeated strikes of the hammer work hardened (sterling) silver, causing it to become brittle and difficult to manipulate. To combat work-hardening, silversmiths would anneal their piecesheat it to a dull red and then quench it in water—to relieve the stresses in the material and return it to a more ductile state. Hammering required more time than all other silver manufacturing processes, and therefore accounted for the majority of labor costs. Silversmiths would then seam parts together to create incredibly complex and artistic items, sealing the gaps with a solder of 80 wt% silver and 20 wt% bronze. Finally, they would file and polish their work to remove all seams, finishing off with engraving and a maker’s mark.|$|R
40|$|Some {{properties}} of the ingot and especially of the steel <b>forging</b> <b>ingots</b> depend on the ratio of a columnar structure area to an equiaxed structure area created during solidification. The C-E transition is fundamental phenomenon {{that can be applied}} to characterize massive cast steel ingots produced by the casting house. The mentioned ratio is created spontaneously due to the rate of heat transfer towards the ceramic mould and then to the environment. The ceramic mould operates as an isolator. So that the thickness of the mould together with a growing solid fraction control the heat transfer and finally the ratio of the columnar structure area to the equiaxed structure area. At first the increase of heat accumulation within the ceramic mould is observed. Next the stationary state for heat transfer is created and finally a gentle abatement of the mould temperature associated with the heat output to the environment is expected. The steep thermal gradients correspond to the increase of heat accumulation in the ceramic mould. The steep thermal gradients are required to promote the columnar structure formation. The full heat accumulation in the mould corresponds well with the C-E transformation while the appearance of the moderate thermal gradients is referred to the gentle temperature abatement within the ceramic mould. The equiaxed structure is expected within this period of heat transfer behavior. The steep thermal gradients involve the activity of viscosity gradient in the liquid. As the result a sedimentary cones are formed {{at the bottom of the}} ingot. The C-E transformation is associated with competition between columnar and equaixed structure formation. At the end of competition a fully equiaxed structure is formed. The viscosity gradient is replaced by the thermophoresis which is the driving force for the deposition of some equiaxed grain layers onto the surface of C+E zone. The convection together with the gravity allow the layers to be uniform along the whole height of the ingot. Some equiaxed grain layers are also deposited at the bottom of ingot onto the surface of sedimentary cones due to activity of the gravity. Additionally, some macro-segregation effects are observed in the ingot. There are “A” – type macro-segregation phenomenon and „V” – type macro-segregation phenomenon. Both mentioned phenomena result from the so-called canal micro-segregation which appears due to the deposition of the equiaxed grains onto the bottom of ingot. Micro-fissures, porosity and micro-shrinkage are the result of the segregation phenomena occurring during the ingot solidification. Three ranges within the temperature filed created in the ceramic mould are to be distinguished:a/ for the formation of columnar structure (the C – zone) : (0 T and steep thermal gradients in the liquid),b/ for the EC transition (columnar to fully equiaxed structure) : (0 T and the so-called critical thermal gradient in the liquid),c/ for the formation of fully equiaxed structure (the E – zone) : (0 T and moderate thermal gradients in the liquid) ...|$|R

However, since J. Sato et al discovered gamma-prime in the Co-Al-W alloy system in 2006, the focus in the literature has been on characterizing the structure and properties of these alloys and measuring and assessing the thermodynamics of the alloy system primarily for application as castings for turbine blade applications. To date the author is not aware of any publications describing the microstructure of vacuum induction melted, vacuum arc remelted ingots of a size more than about 2 kg. Most work has been performed using small, laboratory-scale, cast-and-hot-rolled samples or samples cast as single crystals. This paper presents ATI's experience in assessing the feasibility of manufacturing a cast-and-wrought billet product in the Co-Al-W-X alloy system. Three 22 [*]kg heats were produced to examine a small range of alloy compositions of potential commercial interest: Co- 9 Al- 9 W, Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti, and Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti- 0. 02 B, respectively. Each heat was vacuum-induction-melted and vacuum-arc-remelted then open-die <b>forged.</b> The <b>ingot</b> microstructure has been characterized. Hot workability during billetizing will be described and microstructure and hardness of hot worked and heat treated product will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} results of work on melting, pouring, forging and heat {{treatment}} of 415 -ton 45 H 3 M 1 F steel ingots as semiproducts for manufacturing large backup rolls at the request of  «Severstal» Company. For the production of rollers, a new grade of steel based on 0. 45 %С and 3 %Cr, additionally alloyed by Mo and V, was developed in PJSC «Energomashspetsstal» and applied in industry. Steel of bainite class provides the best combination of strength and plasticity properties. Metal was prepared by melting 7 heats in arc steel-melting furnaces with the capacity of 100 and 50 tons with subsequent out-of-furnace treatment on ladle – furnace and ladle – degassing units. The pouring of steel was carried out from four steel-pouring ladles into a vertical mould under vacuum through a tundish ladle with the protection of stream by argon. The <b>forging</b> of <b>ingots</b> {{was conducted on the}} automated 150 MN forging system. The obtained billets were exposed to primary heat treatment which consisted of heating for recrystallization, isothermal soaking, in order to provide the removal of residual stresses, additional dehydrogenization to give the material lower hardness and controlled cooling for the prevention of snowflake formation. Heating of <b>ingots</b> for <b>forging</b> and preliminary heat treatment was carried out in heat treatment furnaces with the carrying capacity of up to 500 tons. For the heat treatment of the backup roll, a horizontal sprayer unit was applied. The tooling of the backup roll was executed on a lathe with one pace-plate and the final mechanical treatment was conducted on the machine-tool of Hercules NWD 1500 × 18000 CNC. Finished products with 225 -ton mass of the following dimensions: a barrel with a diameter and a length of 2, 360 mm and 4, 800 mm, respectively, at a general length of 10, 650 mm were obtained.    </p...|$|R
40|$|Some {{metallographic}} studies {{performed on}} the basis of the massive <b>forging</b> steel static <b>ingot,</b> on its cross-section, allowed to reveal the following morphological zones: a/ columnar grains (treated as the austenite single crystals), b/ columnar into equiaxed grains transformation, c/ equiaxed grains at the ingot axis. These zones are reproduced theoretically by the numerical simulation. The simulation was based on the calculation of both temperature field in the solidifying large steel ingot and thermal gradient field obtained for the same boundary conditions. The detailed analysis of the velocity of the liquidus isotherm movement shows that the zone of columnar grains begins to disappear at the first point of inflection and the equiaxed grains are formed exclusively at the second point of inflection of the analyzed curve. In the case of the continuously cast brass ingots three different morphologies are revealed: a/ columnar structure, b/ columnar and equiaxed structure with the CET, and c/ columnar structure with the single crystal formation at the ingot axis. Some forecasts of the temperature field are proposed for these three revealed morphologies. An analysis / forecast of the behavior of the operating point in the mold is delivered for the continuously cast ingot. A characteristic delay between some points of breakage of the temperature profile recorded at the operating point and analogous phenomena in the solidifying alloy is postulated...|$|R
5000|$|Colonial silversmiths used {{many of the}} {{techniques}} developed by those in Europe. Casting was frequently {{the first step in}} manufacturing silver pieces, as silver workers would melt down sterling silver into easily manageable ingots. Occasionally, they would create small components (e.g. teapot legs) by casting silver into iron or graphite molds, but it was rare for an entire piece to be fabricated via casting. Next, silversmiths would <b>forge</b> the <b>ingots</b> into the shapes they desired, often hammering the thinned silver against specially shaped dies to [...] "mass produce" [...] simple shapes like the oval end of a spoon. This process occurred at room temperature, and thus is called “cold-working”. The repeated strikes of the hammer work hardened (sterling) silver, causing it to become brittle and difficult to manipulate. To combat work-hardening, silversmiths would anneal their pieces - heat it to a dull red and then quench it in water—to relieve the stresses in the material and return it to a more ductile state. Hammering required more time than all other silver manufacturing processes, and therefore accounted for the majority of labor costs. Silversmiths would then seam parts together to create incredibly complex and artistic items, sealing the gaps with a solder of 80 wt% silver and 20 wt% bronze. Finally, they would file and polish their work to remove all seams, finishing off with engraving and a maker’s mark. The American revolutionary Paul Revere was {{regarded as one of the}} best silversmiths from this “Golden Age of American Silver.” Following the Revolutionary War, Revere acquired and made use of a silver rolling mill from England. Not only did the rolling mill increase his rate of production - hammering and flattening silver took most of a silversmith’s time - he was able to roll and sell silver of appropriate, uniform thickness to other silversmiths. He retired a wealthy artisan, his success partly due to this strategic investment. Although he is celebrated for his beautiful hollowware, Revere made his fortune primarily on low-end goods produced by the mill, such as flatware. With the onset of the first Industrial Revolution, silversmithing declined as an artistic occupation.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} into the behaviour of short fatigue cracks in the β-processed titanium alloy, Ti 6 Ss. The effect on the material {{of a number of}} different variables was studied, particularly microstructure, as well as stress level, specimen design and specimen size. Initiation of cracks was found to occur at similar microstructural features in smooth specimens, regardless of a-platelet morphology. Cracks initiated from slip bands across small bundles of α-platelets, despite the presence of longer, more intense slip bands across α-colonies. α-platelet morphology was found to {{have a significant effect on}} short crack propagation rates when crack length was of the order of, or less than, the α-colony size - the more aligned the α-platelets, the greater the short crack propagation rates at equivalent ΔKs. Increasing the prior β-grain size (and hence the a-colony size) led to higher short crack propagation rates at equivalent ΔKs. Specimen design appeared to have an effect on short crack growth rates a uniaxial tension specimen design gave slightly higher growth rates than a four point bend specimen design. Variation in specimen size had no effect on short crack growth rates for the same microstructural condition, but a larger specimen size was found to reduce the scatter in specimen lives observed in smaller specimens. Short crack growth rates were apparently insensitive to stress level when compared at the same nominal ΔK values. Crack shape was found to vary considerably at crack depths below approximately 0. 75 mm. At crack depths greater than this value, cracks took an approximately semi-circular form. In keeping with many recent studies of short crack behaviour, short cracks were found to grow faster than long cracks at the same nominal ΔKs and at ΔKs below the long crack threshold value, ΔKth· A case study was carried out to determine the behaviour of short cracks in a cheese <b>forged</b> from an <b>ingot</b> slice of IMI 685. Crack growth behaviour was found to be the same as that of Ti 65 s, but initiation behaviour was affected by the presence of pores in the IMI 68 S, leading to a significant reduction in fatigue life...|$|R
40|$|In the {{introduction}} substantiate the actuality {{of the topic}} of the dissertation, formulated purpose and objectives of the study, are shown scientific novelty, the practical significance of the work, reflects the main provisions for the defense, confidence and personal contribution of the author. In the first chapter reviewed domestic and foreign literature sources, discusses the physical causes of low coefficient of linear expansion of Invar alloys. Examples of various chemical compositions of Invar alloys are given and their use is considered. Analyzed the shortcomings of classical Invars and defined prerequisites for improving the mechanical properties of them. Considered the effect of chemical composition on the structure, mechanical and special properties of Invar alloys. It is shown that without the heat treatment is not possible to obtain simultaneously low values of coefficient of linear expansion and increased strength properties. Analysis of literature sources shows that {{there are only a few}} scattered data on the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties of high strength Invar alloys with a low coefficient of linear expansion. There is no consensus about the effect of temperature and time of heat treatment parameters. Formulated the purpose of the work and supplied the research problem. The second chapter describes the materials and experimental techniques. To investigate were selected Invar alloys based on Fe-Ni system, alloyed with carbon and carbide forming elements, which from the literature should ensure the hardening of these alloys due to the dispersed carbide phase. Doping cobalt is used to reduce the coefficient of expansion. The alloys were melted in a vacuum induction furnace at 60 kg <b>ingots,</b> <b>forged</b> and then rolled into rods. Heat treatment of the samples was carried out in a laboratory electric furnace PL- 20 with thermo-control unit and made the following modes: - Quenching from temperature 1200 and 1250 °C with cooled in water and oil; - Heating the quenched samples at temperatures of 300, 500, 600, 650, 700 and 800 °C, soaking for 1 hour and air cooling; - Heating the samples at 80 °C and soaking for 48 hours. The microstructure was investigated under an optical microscope Meiji Techno and scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM- 6490 LV with microprobe analysis system INCA Energy 450. The quantitative analysis was performed using Thixomet PRO – computer image analysis system. The amount of the statistical sample consisted of 150 to 300 units.
