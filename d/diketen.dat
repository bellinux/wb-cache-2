40|$|Insulin {{was treated}} with <b>diketen</b> at pH 6 · 9. The {{reaction}} mixture was resolved into four components by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The first component was unchanged insulin. The second and third components were shown by end-group analysis to be substituted on phenylalanine B- 1 and glycine A- 1 respectively. The fourth component was disubstituted on both phenylalanine B- 1 and glycine A- 1. The ∈-amino group of lysine B- 29 {{was not involved in}} the reaction at low reagent concentrations. The purity of these derivatives was checked by their electrophoretic behaviour and by measurement of the rate of their reaction with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid. The hormonal activity of the derivatives was determined. The effect of the modifications on the hormonal activity and the tertiary structure of insulin is discussed...|$|E
