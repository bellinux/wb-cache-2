50|$|Foreman {{is meeting}} with some donors when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> some flowers he {{received}} a week ago that are still fresh. He excuses himself. He goes to House in triumph - it's Reye's syndrome. House says it's rare in adults and the wife kept all the medicine under lock and key. However, Foreman has realized that Natalie was an ex-florist who most likely used aspirin to {{extend the life of}} flowers for the few orders she still worked on. The patient probably had flu, which presented with a sore throat. He saw aspirin and started taking them and, because he forgot he took them, he probably took several. Foreman has already started the patient on steroids.|$|E
50|$|As Scott {{prepares to}} call for the hike, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> his girlfriend, then looks out into the band bleachers, where he sees Macey. The clock runs down and Scott calls an audible, a running play where he {{maneuvers}} himself close enough {{to jump into the}} end zone. As he crosses, Scott is hammered by two defensive players, and his leg is shattered at the knee. Coldwater wins the Ohio State High School Championship game over the heavily favored Chiefs. Scott demonstrated that he is an intensely talented football player, as he basically; for the most part single handedly, beat a high school team that had eight players on defense already signed to NCAA Division I scholarships.|$|E
50|$|Immediately three fish appear {{floating}} {{a bit of}} seaweed {{ahead of}} them, and on the seaweed rests the King's ring. Astonished, the King agrees to the marriage of his daughter to the young man. However, the daughter sets him upon another task of refilling sacks of grain that she has spilled in the grass. The young man is discouraged because he believes it impossible to gather all of the grain {{from the ground and}} he lies down and falls asleep shortly. When he wakes, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the sacks that were empty the night before. To his surprise, they are now filled with grain with not one grain missing. The Ant King had all of the ants working the entire night to fill them.|$|E
60|$|He yawned, {{his eyes}} closing. How sleepy <b>he</b> was! <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the bed. Then {{he sat down}} on the edge of it and took his shoes off. So much to do, the next day.|$|R
6000|$|The {{captain said}} nothing to Alan, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> me with an ugly look. [...] "David," [...] said he, [...] "I'll mind this"; {{and the sound of}} his voice went through me with a jar.|$|R
50|$|He {{was down}} to a few cards. He was {{exhausted}} and didn’t {{know what else to}} do to stall. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the wings and saw the surprised manager. Herrmann scaled his last card and bowed. The applause was deafening.|$|R
5000|$|Inside Scout's [...] "motor home" [...] {{are frozen}} {{bodies of the}} dog, the deer and other animals. Scout, at a control panel, and in an alien language, reports that he is {{prepared}} to return with his specimens. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Danny, also frozen in a compartment. Then Scout asks about how his family is and that he misses them. Meanwhile, Mrs. Wilkins is frantically searching in the dark for Danny when she comes upon an odd shape which becomes surrounded by blinding light and then goes up into space. She begins crying thinking Danny might be in there, when she hears cries and mumbling from the grass. It's Danny, who, when asked by his mom if he's all right, says [...] "just cold".|$|E
50|$|Pink's {{mother is}} seen praying {{in a church}} {{after the death of}} her husband overseas. Pink, however, is, at this point, {{oblivious}} of his death, and can be seen playing with a toy aeroplane. The song continues with Pink playing in a public park after his mother leaves him to go shopping. He sees a man who he takes a liking to in the absence of his own father. The man gives Pink a lift onto a ride, and it's clear Pink feels as if this man is his real father. Pink follows the man's son around, copying him, but doesn't understand why the other boy's father isn't paying attention to him. He grabs the man's hand but is shooed away, only to grab the man's hand again. The man pushes Pink away again, and dejectedly he sits on a swing (which is too far off the ground for him to swing himself). <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the other parents swinging their kids, feeling even more alone.|$|E
50|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colin Tilley and was released on September 30, 2010. It opens with Shontelle walking alone next to an old building before cutting to {{a black and white}} scene of her singing in darkness. A man is shown working out in a gym and footage is shown of Shontelle interacting with him after he is finished. In the next scene, Shontelle can be seen standing in front of bright yellow lights and four other woman, who begin to dance as the song's beat picks up. Between takes of Shontelle singing in front of these women, the man can again be seen working out but this time with a different woman. Next, Shontelle is shown entering the gym and crouching in front of a row of lockers, flailing around as she sings. In the final scene, a fight is taking place between the man and another boxer as the other woman watches. Shontelle is shown {{standing in front of a}} wall that separates the boxing ring from the locker room, and finally steps around the wall entering into plain sight of the man. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> her, concerned, and as he does his opponent punches him in the head, knocking him down.|$|E
6000|$|Whitefoot hurriedly ran {{a little}} farther away, and Buster Bear chuckled. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Old Mother Nature. [...] "Won't you tell them that I'm the best-natured and most {{harmless}} fellow in all the Great World?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, Pig-wig, <b>he</b> will <b>look</b> back." [...] The grocer did so; {{he saw the}} two pigs stock-still in {{the middle}} of the road. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hardy went on {{with his}} work. There was a pile of {{it in front of}} him and an {{accumulation}} in his drawers. For some time he wrote assiduously, but work was dry after the subject they had been discussing. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> his partner and, seeing that that gentleman was gravely busy, reopened the matter with a jeer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't," [...] said Mr. Nugent, truthfully. The {{situation}} had developed {{so rapidly that}} it had caught him at a disadvantage. He had a dim feeling that, having been the cause of Miss Kybird's losing one young man, the most elementary notions of chivalry demanded that he should furnish her with another. And this idea was clearly uppermost {{in the minds of}} her parents. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Amelia and with characteristic philosophy accepted the position.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> {{the black}} fox and the lust of greed glittered in his eyes. The animal was of unusual size, and the fur was extra prime. Assuredly {{it would bring}} a great sum. After all, it was but a boy {{with whom he had}} to deal and by the looks of him a novice in the woods. He stuffed the money bag back in his shirt and rose, his axe in hand. Then without warning he leaped forward, axe upraised, his face contorted with rage like that of a demon.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> coldly <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Hardy as {{he spoke}} to see the effect of his words. Their eyes met, {{and the young man}} was on his feet as soon as his rival.|$|R
6000|$|He didn't like it; and, {{clapping}} on his hat, he {{went out}} to learn what the matter was. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the house, up at the sky, down at the ground, and through the street; but nothing funny appeared, for Poppy and dolly were hidden again, and the old gentleman was puzzled. He went in and sat down to watch, feeling rather disturbed. Presently the fun began again: the children clapped their hands, the people laughed, and every one <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the house, in what he thought a very impertinent way. This made him angry; and out he rushed a second time, saying, as he marched across the street: ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{five minutes}} later Blacky saw {{something}} that made him, oh, so glad he had kept watch. It was a swiftly moving black line just above the water far down the Big River, and it was coming up. He knew what that black line was. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the hunter hiding behind some bushes {{close to the edge}} of the water. The hunter was crouching with his terrible gun in his hands and was peeping over the bushes, watching that black line. He, too, knew what it was. It was a flock of Ducks flying.|$|R
5000|$|From that point, Alphin's career took off, {{both as a}} {{songwriter}} {{and as part of}} the duo Big & Rich. Several years after the incident, he played some of his songs for McGraw. [...] "I'll never forget the day I played him the song," [...] Alphin said. [...] "We were at Blackbird Studio and Tim was making a new album. As we sat together in my truck, I played him a couple of the songs that I was recording. The second song I played was [...] "Last Dollar." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> me and said, [...] "Are you gonna let me record that?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Groove metal group Five Finger Death Punch had an {{incident}} when, during the song [...] "White Knuckles" [...] {{at a concert}} in Hartford Connecticut, a young man received a compound fracture on his ankle in a mosh pit. Ivan L. Moody, the band's lead singer, stopped the show, leaped into the crowd with Zoltan Bathory, the band's rhythm guitarist, and carried the injured fan onto the stage, where {{he was taken to}} the hospital. Moody has been quoted as saying: [...] "I looked him square in the face and asked him if he was okay, or if there was anything I could do for him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> me, still in shock, and said 'You guys fucking rock!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "We'll kill {{the time as}} our cabin-passengers used to kill it <b>at</b> sea." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> Mr. Bishopriggs. [...] "Waiter! bring a pack of cards." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned a}} shade paler, {{but he did}} not {{sacrifice}} his dignity, as I hoped that he would, by answering me with anger. He did not even answer me <b>at</b> all. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> my head <b>at</b> my lover.|$|R
60|$|Hiram was {{standing}} in front of the fire with his hands clasped behind his back. He had not touched the supper on the table. Levi was eating with an appetite. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his plate <b>at</b> his stepbrother.|$|R
6000|$|As the cab started <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> Anne {{through the front}} window. [...] "Well worth trying," [...] he said to himself. [...] "It's the way to be even with her. And it's the way to be free." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{whole room}} {{would come to}} life with his conductingthe way <b>he</b> would <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the drummer and with just a flick of his finger, things could happen. Once the groove was {{happening}} in the room, forget it; there was nothing like it. And everything, including the strings, responded to the kind of body movement that Burt had. He brings an incredible amount of life to the studio. He's {{probably one of the most}} amazing musicians in the world. —Record producer Phil Ramone ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All right." [...] Whitwell {{pulled his}} axe {{out of the}} carf, and struck it in again with a force that made a wide, square chip leap out. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> Westover, who was moving away. [...] "Say, stop in some time you're passin'. I live in that wood-colored house {{at the foot of}} the Durgins' lane." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> last, and seeing {{that he was}} not pursued, faced about. He was astonished. From the moment of the rising of the cephalopods out of the water he had been acting too swiftly to fully comprehend his actions. Now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped out of an evil dream.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} lone fisherman in a dory who has caught several halibut but now sees fog blowing up, {{threatening to cut}} him off as he rows back to his ship. His face is turned in profile to the viewer as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> the streamers of fog in the background. The Boston Fine Art Museum gives this description: ...|$|R
60|$|A maid ushered {{him into}} the {{presence}} of a venerable old man who did not look at all, even in Ken's distorted sight, like a crab or a dragon. His ponderous brow seemed as if it had all the thought in the world behind it. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> huge spectacles <b>at</b> Ken's card and then spoke in a dry, quavering voice.|$|R
6000|$|Dorian said nothing, but {{rose from}} the table and, passing into the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, <b>he</b> stopped, and, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Lord Henry, said, [...] "Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Davidson!" [...] cried I. [...] "What's {{the matter}} with you?" [...] He turned round in my {{direction}} and looked about for me. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> me and <b>at</b> me and {{on either side of}} me, without the slightest sign of seeing me. [...] "Waves," [...] he said; [...] "and a remarkably neat schooner. I'd swear that was Bellows' voice. Hullo!" [...] He shouted suddenly {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|R
60|$|He was haggard to the glance {{she stole}} at him, {{when they had}} taken their places in the dory, and he confronted her, pulling hard at the oars. He did not lift his eyes to hers, but {{from time to time}} <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the boat's prow, and he rowed from one point to another for a good landing. A dreamy pity for him filled her; through the memories of her own suffering, she divined the soreness of his heart.|$|R
5000|$|After {{winning the}} title of Miss India USA, Pooja Kumar started her global career as an American actress, producer, and model. The most famous actor in India Amitabh Bachchan chose her {{as one of the}} bright new stars where <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>over</b> 60,000 contestants {{fighting}} for that recognition. He introduced her to Priyadarshan and they gave her the opportunity to host the International Miss World Competition which was broadcast live in over 50 countries! ...|$|R
40|$|Susan {{packed up}} her laptop, {{stuffing}} {{all of the}} papers she had been reading into the case. She looked around her. The library was nearly empty—typical for a Saturday evening. Still, she was happy to have made so much progress on her paper, which was due the following week. She picked up her belongings and began walking toward {{the steps to the}} main floor of the library. As she descended the staircase, she saw her friend Steve sitting at his usual table. She paused a moment {{at the foot of the}} stairs. Steve looked up from his computer just as Susan walked over to his table. “Hi, Steve, what are you working on? ” she asked quietly as she sat down at his table. “Oh, it’s that research paper we have to write for Seminar, ” he replied, shaking his head. “There is just so much information to write about; I’m having trouble getting it organized. I think I’m getting tired, too. ” <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> her. “What about you? Have you made much progress on yours?” Susan smiled. “Yes, I think I have a pretty good draft, but I have to let it rest for a while. I’ll work on editing it tomorrow. ” “Yeah, I think it’s time for a break. Want to go check out the basketball game for a bit? ” Steve asked. “That sounds great! A basketball game is just what I need to clear my head. ” The two friends headed off to the field house to see the game. When they got there, the Biology Clu...|$|R
60|$|Arthur Townsend fell to Catherine's portion, {{while his}} {{companion}} placed {{himself on the}} sofa, beside Mrs. Penniman. Catherine had hitherto not been a harsh critic; she was easy to please--she liked to talk with young men. But Marian's betrothed, this evening, made her feel vaguely fastidious; <b>he</b> sat <b>looking</b> at the fire and rubbing his knees with his hands. As for Catherine, she scarcely even pretended {{to keep up the}} conversation; her attention had fixed itself {{on the other side of}} the room; she was listening to what went on between the other Mr. Townsend and her aunt. Every now and then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Catherine herself and smiled, as if to show that what he said was for her benefit too. Catherine would have liked to change her place, to go and sit near them, where she might see and hear him better. But she was afraid of seeming bold--of looking eager; and, besides, it would not have been polite to Marian's little suitor. She wondered why the other gentleman had picked out her aunt--how he came to have so much to say to Mrs. Penniman, to whom, usually, young men were not especially devoted. She was not at all jealous of Aunt Lavinia, but she was a little envious, and above all she wondered; for Morris Townsend was an object on which she found that her imagination could exercise itself indefinitely. His cousin had been describing a house that he had taken in view of his union with Marian, and the domestic conveniences he meant to introduce into it; how Marian wanted a larger one, and Mrs. Almond recommended a smaller one, and how he himself was convinced that he had got the neatest house in New York.|$|R
60|$|His stroke was long, vigorous, and steady. Now {{and then}} <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the Great Isabel, presenting its low cliff to his anxious gaze like an impenetrable face. At last the stem touched the strand. He flung rather than dragged the boat up the little beach. At once, {{turning his back}} upon the sunset, he plunged with long strides into the ravine, making {{the water of the}} stream spurt and fly upwards at every step, as if spurning its shallow, clear, murmuring spirit with his feet. He wanted to save every moment of daylight.|$|R
