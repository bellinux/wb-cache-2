50|$|Heat {{recovery}} {{makes it}} possible to save energy in the ventilation of a building. In particular, kitchen air is hotter than the air in most other rooms, and therefore a large amount of energy can potentially be saved. However, {{when it comes to the}} ventilation of a kitchen, if the correct kind of filter is not used, heat recovery can be very difficult or even impossible, because of the presence of <b>grease</b> <b>particles</b> in the air. <b>Grease</b> <b>particles</b> accumulate at the heat exchanger, rendering it useless very quickly.|$|E
50|$|Turboswing filters {{can remove}} <b>grease</b> <b>particles</b> {{starting}} from 4μm, {{as opposed to}} 8μm for common filters. This is because the filtering medium is moving, and this increases the probability of collision between the filter and the particle.|$|E
50|$|Turboswing {{is a type}} {{of grease}} filter used in kitchen {{ventilation}} to remove <b>grease</b> <b>particles</b> from the air. It is typically installed inside the extractor hoods of restaurant kitchens. Its operation is based on a rotating filtering medium.|$|E
5000|$|To begin with, a {{cleaning}} agent is applied {{directly to the}} surface by spraying, brushing, or wiping. This process removes oil, <b>grease,</b> dirt, loose <b>particles,</b> and any other contaminants that may exist {{on the surface of}} the material.|$|R
5000|$|Greywater, {{recycled}} water {{unsuitable for}} drinking, is used within the Earthship primarily for flushing toilets. Before the greywater can be reused, it is channeled through a <b>grease</b> and <b>particle</b> filter/digester {{and into a}} 30"-60" [...] deep rubber-lined botanical cell, a miniature living machine, within the Earthship. Here the water is oxygenated and filtered using bacteria and plants to reduce the nutrient load. Water from {{the low end of}} the botanical cell is directed through a peat moss filter and collected in a reservoir or well. The reclaimed water is passed once more through a greywater board and used to flush conventional toilets.|$|R
5000|$|... {{cleaning}} {{has found}} application in many industries and technical areas, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, medical, manufacturing, basic and applied research, and optics. The different carbon dioxide cleaning methods can remove gross contamination, paint, overlayers, <b>grease,</b> fingerprints, <b>particles</b> down to nanometers in size, hydrocarbon and organic residues, and radioactive residues. Materials cleaned include metals, polymers, ceramics, glasses, wafers, hard drives, and optics. The key limitation {{is that the}} contamination must be on the surface, not buried within the material. Porous materials are not good candidates for pellets or snow, but can be cleaned using liquid or supercritical CO2.|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between turboswing and most common filters {{is that in}} turboswing filters the filtering medium is not static. There is a perforated disk rotating at high speed. When the <b>grease</b> <b>particles</b> go through the rotating disk they are separated from the air.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} have heat {{recovery}} in a kitchen, the air must be completely clear of grease, in other words, {{both large and small}} <b>grease</b> <b>particles</b> must be removed from the air. Static filters cannot adequately deal with small particles, therefore making it impossible to recover heat. Turboswing filters exhibit high performance in dealing with small particles, and this is why they enable heat recovery to be done with kitchen air.|$|E
40|$|Lakes and {{reservoirs}} {{are important}} sources of water supply, generate electricity and to irrigate fields. Since, lakes act as catchment basins {{for close to}} 40 % of the landscape so serve as recreational, sporting and fishing activities. Varsity Lake University of Malaya (UM) is beautiful landscape {{at the front of}} the UM main entrance. It is used mainly for recreational and sporting (canoeing) activities. Study has been carried out in order to analyze water quality, nutrients and metals load starting from water inlets into the lake basin. It was found that there is high concentration of oil and <b>grease</b> <b>particles</b> in water due to water flow from cafeteria of college 2, engineering and built environment faculties which cause BOD and TSS value to be higher then normal in the lake. It was one of the main factors that caused the death of fish in the lake in recent months. Mercury and nitrate concentration is also high in the lake. A body contact is involved due to sporting and recreational activities so parameters are compared with Malaysian Interim water quality standards and it was concluded that lake water quality is not fulfilling the recreational spot criteria and is hazardous to human and fish life in the lake. Recommendations are proposed for immediate action. Best management practices is also discussed for prevention of oil and <b>grease</b> <b>particles</b> from entry into lake water to protect this valuable water resource from being polluted...|$|E
30|$|<b>Grease,</b> dirt <b>particles</b> {{and other}} {{staining}} materials are easily {{attached to a}} surface of a solar panel. In the ‘photocatalytic’ process of TiO 2 coating, the coating reacts with ultraviolet light {{to break down the}} organic dirt on the glass and to reduce the adherence of inorganic dirt. In an earlier study, performed by Chabas et al. (2007), on the behaviors of self-cleaning glass in an urban atmosphere, self-cleaning glass is found to have an evident self-cleaning effect, even when it is not subjected to water. The field study shows that particulate organic matter (POM) was destroyed by a percentage of 44 – 48  % on the self-cleaning surface.|$|R

40|$|Effluent {{produced}} by the wool scouring process is highly polluted with emulsified <b>grease,</b> dirt <b>particles,</b> salts, and detergent. The major problem in treating this waste stream is the wool grease which is resistance to biodegradation. The removal of grease from the effluent {{would lead to a}} more readily degradable waste stream, and therefore suitable for further biological treatment processes. This study aimed to investigate anaerobic destabilisation (flocculation), rather than degradation, of wool grease emulsion from wool scouring effluent (WSE). The process therefore can serve as a pretreatment step, prior to a conventional biological process. The results from this study show that emulsified wool grease in WSE could be removed by bioflocculation under anaerobic conditions. After 110 days of continuous operation, a two-stage anaerobic process treating a high grease (> 10 g/L) effluent removed 70 to 90...|$|R
40|$|In {{a number}} of cases the {{contaminant}} does not penetrate into the substrate body and remains on the surface as a soil. It can be <b>grease,</b> dirt, <b>particles,</b> etc. At these conditions the decontamination is reduced to the deposit removal with no surface modification and with no escape of off-products. Our study shows that the ice-air stream is suitable for such a treatment. It was demonstrated that this jet enables us to remove a deposit from a highly sensitive surface with no surface damage. The off-stream can be completely contained and air and water recycled. In this paper we discuss design of the systems used for water freezing and generation of ice jets as well as results of the cleaning applications of the ice jets. The performed exp eriments demonstrated the feasibility of surface decontamination using ice particles. 1. 0 INTRODUCTION In our previous works the formation and application of icewaterjet (IWJ) was investigated (1 - 5). Several systems for icejet formation were tested, a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{particle}} deposition in industrial duct bends is presented. Particle deposition by size {{was measured by}} comparing particle size distributions upstream and downstream of bends that had geometries and flow conditions {{similar to those used}} in industrial ventilation. As the interior surface of the duct bend was <b>greased</b> to prevent <b>particle</b> bounce, the results are applic-able to liquid drops and solid particles where duct walls are sticky. Factors investigated were: (i) flow Reynolds number (Re = 203 000, 36 000); (ii) particle Reynolds number (10 20 µm, deposition was slightly greater in the horizontal-to-horizontal orientation than in the horizontal-to-vertical orientation due to gravitational settling.

30|$|Meanwhile, {{as far as}} we know, the {{enhanced}} thermal conductivity of thermal <b>grease</b> with CuO <b>particles</b> has not been reported. Thermal grease is a commonly used thermal interfacial material for heat removal from electronic devices [21]. It is utilized to bond the contact surfaces of heat sink and devices and to replace the air in the gaps at the interface, thus establishing an effective thermal path between a heat-generating component and a heat sink attached to it [22, 23]. Therefore, in this study, three kinds of CuO with different shapes, namely, CuO microdisks, CuO nanoblocks, and CuO microspheres, were synthesized by solution-based synthetic methods. They were used to prepare silicone-based thermal greases, and influences of their shape and size on thermal conductivity improvement were investigated. The obtained results were also compared with theoretical prediction model.|$|R
40|$|Glass sheets {{investigated}} {{regarding their}} Po- 210 signal originating from indoor radon exposure {{will have a}} depth distribution down to about 100 nm. The geometrical probability of implantation into glass of glass-attached radon daughter activity in one alpha recoil event is 50 %. A particulate layer on the glass sheet (dust, <b>grease</b> or other <b>particles)</b> will stop the alpha recoil nucleus partly or totally, and the alpha-recoiled Po- 210 nucleus will be implanted into the glass surface at a lesser depth. Clean glass sheets were pre-exposed to different types of nonradioactive aerosol particles and then exposed to radon-laden air. After a build-up period, the surface activity of Po- 210 was determined by alpha spectrometry. The implanted fraction of (210) po for these sheets of glass, with respect to mass load and type of particulate surface layer, {{was determined to be}} between 30 and 80 % depending on the mass load (mu g cm(- 2)) ...|$|R
40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are common}} in any rotating machinery. The rolling element bearings subjected to failure under continuous running. Therefore they have received great attention {{in the field of}} condition monitoring. Different methods are detection and diagnosis of the bearing defects. Among them the commonly used technique is vibration signature analysis. The information obtained from the system vibration can be used for identifying its response subjected to various conditions. In rolling element bearing, contamination of lubricant <b>grease</b> by solid <b>particles</b> is one among the several reasons for early bearing failure. The main objective of this project is to investigate the effect of lubricant contamination by solid particles on rolling element bearing. This work is carried out to determine the vibrations on good and defective bearing in healthy grease and contaminant grease conditions. Obtained the vibration characteristics of healthy grease tested ball bearings are compared with those of contaminant grease tested ball bearings. Vibration signals are acquired from the ball bearings assembled in an experimental rig. The radial load was applied to the outer ring of the test bearing. An accelerometer placed on bearing housing measures radial vibration both in vertical and horizontal. The SKF-LGWA type of lubricants is used in this test, and also different types of solid particles are used as contaminants. The effect of contaminant concentration and particle size on vibration is to be studied. A way of monitorin...|$|R
40|$|The multidimensional {{problems}} facing buildings in Nigeria have reached an endemic proportion. They manifest in quantitative, qualitative {{and also in}} maintenance terms. The climate across the country aids the deterioration of building materials particularly those used in the facades as there is need to extend the lifespan of these external building finishes because of the economic, health, aesthetic and structural problems being experienced by the occupants of the buildings. An increasing {{number of cases of}} poor maintenance of plastered and painted facades characterized by early and unexpected onset of defects and damage to the surface have been noticed in the study areas which has culminated into spending huge amounts of money for such maintenance activities; This paper identifies the different nature and influence of these factors in order to arrive at cost effective ways of preventing and dealing with such defects. Also it establishes the planning horizon over which the various costs that arise during the intended lifetime of the finishes are incurred. Buildings raging from residential (bungalows and multi-storey apartment) to institutional and commercial including those with mixed used that exhibited the external finishes under the changing climatic challenges were carefully observed and analysed through the use of structured questionnaires. The paper concludes by recommending continuous and regular inspection of external surfaces every ten years, provision of a thick porous coating which will give the best weather-proofing and durability results on solid walls and achievement of good and physical adhesion of rendering to the rigid substrate free from dirt, oil, <b>grease</b> and loose <b>particles...</b>|$|R
