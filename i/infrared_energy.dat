25|$|Initially, {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} special devices with high-gain amplification for detecting reflected infrared from an illuminating searchlight. In August 1932, this equipment was used to track a blimp at a distance of over a mile. Further pursuit of active detection techniques was then abandoned because of the limit of <b>infrared</b> <b>energy</b> available from searchlight sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{burning of}} fossil fuels is a major source of {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, especially for power, cement, steel, textile, fertilizer and many other industries which rely on fossil fuels (coal, electricity derived from coal, natural gas and oil). The major greenhouse gases emitted by these industries are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), etc., all of which increase the atmosphere's ability to trap <b>infrared</b> <b>energy</b> and thus affect the climate.|$|E
25|$|The UV lamps {{for water}} {{treatment}} consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a polychromatic output from 200nm to visible and <b>infrared</b> <b>energy.</b> The UV lamp never contacts the water; {{it is either}} housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.|$|E
50|$|Monochromatic <b>infrared</b> photo <b>energy</b> {{treatment}} (MIRE) {{has been}} shown to be an effective therapy in reducing and often eliminating pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. The studied wavelength of 890nm is able to penetrate into the subcutaneous tissue where it acts upon a specialized part of the cell called the cytochrome C. The <b>infrared</b> light <b>energy</b> prompts the cytochrome C to release nitric oxide into the cells. The nitric oxide in turn promotes vasodilation which results in increased blood flow that helps nourish damaged nerve cells. Once the nutrient rich blood is able to reach the affected areas (typically the feet, lower legs and hands) it promotes the regeneration of nerve tissues and helps reduce inflammation thereby reducing and/or eliminating pain in the area.|$|R

25|$|On January 26, 2009, {{the final}} line {{replaceable}} unit (LRU) was installed, completing one of the final major milestones of the NIF construction project and meaning that construction was unofficially completed. On February 26, 2009, {{for the first time}} NIF fired all 192 laser beams into the target chamber. On March 10, 2009, NIF became the first laser to break the megajoule barrier, firing all 192 beams and delivering 1.1 MJ of ultraviolet light, known as 3ω, to the target chamber center in a shaped ignition pulse. The main laser delivered 1.952 MJ of <b>infrared</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{what is seen}} is not {{the black}} hole itself, but {{observations}} that are consistent only {{if there is a}} black hole present near Sgr A*. In the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and <b>infrared</b> <b>energy</b> emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into the black hole. Although other possibilities exist for how these gases emanate energy, such as radiation pressure and interaction with other gas streams, interaction with a massive source of gravity is the simplest explanation. The black hole itself is thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature, on the order of 10−14 kelvin.|$|E
25|$|Although ozone {{was present}} at ground level before the Industrial Revolution, peak {{concentrations}} are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher. Ozone acts as a greenhouse gas, absorbing some of the <b>infrared</b> <b>energy</b> emitted by the earth. Quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult {{because it is not}} present in uniform concentrations across the globe. However, the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to climate change (e.g. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report) suggest that the radiative forcing of tropospheric ozone is about 25% that of carbon dioxide.|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} quantity for thermographic techniques is the transmittance of a material.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that emission of precursor gases for sulfur aerosols is the principal mechanism by which volcanoes cause episodic global cooling. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 regards stratospheric sulfate aerosols as having {{a low level of}} scientific understanding. The aerosol particles form a whitish haze in the sky. This creates a global dimming effect, where less of the sun's radiation is able to reach the surface of the Earth. This leads to a global cooling effect. In essence, they act as the reverse of a greenhouse gas, which tends to allow visible light from the sun through, whilst blocking infrared light emitted from the Earth's surface and its atmosphere. The particles also radiate <b>infrared</b> <b>energy</b> directly, as they lose heat into space.|$|E
25|$|These {{mid-range}} stars ultimately {{reach the}} tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning. They are not sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion, so they contract again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star. The central star then cools to a white dwarf. The expelled gas is relatively rich in heavy elements created within the star and may be particularly oxygen or carbon enriched, {{depending on the type of}} the star. The gas builds up in an expanding shell called a circumstellar envelope and cools as it moves away from the star, allowing dust particles and molecules to form. With the high <b>infrared</b> <b>energy</b> input from the central star, ideal conditions are formed in these circumstellar envelopes for maser excitation.|$|E
500|$|Ground deicing {{technologies}} are also developing, and a newer technology is infrared deicing. This is {{the transmission of}} energy by means of electromagnetic waves or rays. Infrared is invisible and travels in straight lines from the heat source to surfaces and objects without significantly heating the space (air) it passes through. When infrared waves strike an object, they release their energy as heat. This heat is either absorbed or reflected by the cooler surface. <b>Infrared</b> <b>energy</b> is continually exchanged between [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cold" [...] surfaces until all surfaces have reached the same temperature (equilibrium). The colder the surfaces, the more effective the infrared transfer from the emitter. This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional deicing (convection and conduction) due to the cooling effect of the air on the deicing fluid spray.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{increase}} in temperature of the soil, CO2 levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as forest clearing, soil denuding, developments that destroy autotrophic processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the <b>infrared</b> <b>energy</b> penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased turbidity of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more autotrophic organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover.|$|E
