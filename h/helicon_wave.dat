40|$|The uncommonly high RF {{absorption}} {{efficiency of}} helicon discharges has been {{thought to be}} caused by Landau damping of <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> and the concomitant acceleration of primary electrons. By constructing an energy analyzer that accounts for RF fluctuations in plasma potential, it is shown that Landau-accelerated electrons are too sparse to explain the ionization effi-ciency. Instead, RF absorption and ionization are found to be consistent with the mechanism of mode coupling to Trivelpiece-Gould modes at the plasma boundary. Ever since Boswell 1 reported the high densities produced by helicon discharges, the reason for the efficiency of these discharges in converting RF power into plasma density has been a conundrum. In 1991, Chen 2 proposed the Landau damping hypothesis, in which electrons are accelerated by “surfing ” on the <b>helicon</b> <b>waves,</b> which have the proper phase velocity to bring electrons to the peak of the ionization cross section.

Measurements of the radial and axial {{profiles}} {{of both the}} plasma parameters and the wave properties in a long, thin helicon discharge show {{that most of the}} RF power is deposited near the antenna and that a dense, cool (Te < 2 eV) plasma can be obtained in the downstream region.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the simple theory of <b>helicon</b> <b>waves,</b> in which the {{electron}} mass me is neglected, is valid only if Ez also vanishes, a condition which is not satisfied in experiment. Exact solutions of cold plasma theory with finite me and Ez predict the existence of additional highly damped Trivelpiece-Gould (TG) modes, which can greatly modify the nature of helicon discharges. However, most experiments have been explained using only the simple theory for which the <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> are undamped. In that case, antenna-plasma-coupling calculations predict infinite resonances. To avoid this problem theorists have set Ez = 0 and included finite me effects (the TE-H theory). By comparing the TE-H theory with exact (i. e., closed form) solutions for uniform density, the role of TG modes has been clarified. To do so for non-uniform density, a new algorithm is developed to treat the case of high magnetic fields, when the wave equation becomes singular. The results show that, though the wave patterns are not greatly affected by TG modes except at low magnetic fields or near the radial boundary, the kz-spectrum and radial profile of the energy deposition are greatly modified. In particular, the peaks in the TE-H-mode spectrum, which lead to predictions of erroneously high antenna loading, are suppressed and broadened by the TG modes which also predict high edge absorption. Both the TE-H and exact theories give maximum antenna loading for me(ω / k) 2 ≈ 10 - 100 eV, in contrast to several hundred eV predicted by the simple theory. 1 I...|$|R
