50|$|In {{very dry}} climates, {{evaporative}} coolers, {{sometimes referred to}} as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a <b>dry</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.|$|E

Voysey {{was attached to the}} trigonometrical survey and travelled with the triangulations that proceeded from Madras through the Nizam's dominion towards the Deccan Trap region. He collected mineral samples along the route and maintained notes. He did not publish them but some of the extracts from his journals were published posthumously in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. These included notes on native steel manufacture and on Gond language. His ideas on geology were based on Werner, based on Neptunism, that rocks were formed under the oceans. He however decided that dykes or veins were produced by volcanic intrusion from below. He called laterite as [...] "iron-clay". He observed amethystine quartz veins at Mulkapur but did not follow them into the jungle for fear of tigers. He used Secunderabad as a base and worked with George Everest during this part of the survey. In 1819 he and Everest returned to the region and during free time in the rainy season would indulge in rolling granite boulders down the hills. The trip however resulted in both suffering from malaria. Voysey's knowledge of French allowed him to interact with Duvaucel when he was in Calcutta. He was also in touch with French research and when Everest wanted to measure humidity, it was Voysey who suggested the wet and <b>dry</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer</b> approach invented by the French.|$|E

This study, thus, studied the evaporative cooling efficiency and pressure drop of recycled High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and rice husk as a wetted pad in evaporative cooling system. Approach: The study was done by establishing the tested wetted pad with 25. 4 and 50. 8 mm of thickness. The velocity air flow through wetted pad was controlled at 1, 2 and 3 m sec− 1 respectively. In addition, the <b>dry</b> <b>bulb</b> and wet bulb temperatures of inlet air were controlled at 30. 1 ± 1. 0 °C and 23. 2 ± 1. 1 °C, respectively. The commercial wetted pad was also tested in order to compare results with rice husk and recycled HDPE. Results: It was found that rice husk wetted pad gave the average saturation efficiency of 55. 9 %, while HDPE gave the average saturation efficiency of 29. 1 %. However, the pressure drop across wetted pad of rice husk and recycled HDPE {{was significantly higher than}} that of commercial wetted pad. For the effect of air velocity on saturation efficiency and pressure drop, it was found that higher air velocity decreased saturation efficiency and increased pressure drop across wetted pad. Conclusion: Finally, the rice husk has a potential as wetted pad material. However, further study about optimum point between operation cost and materials cost of using rice husk wetted pad is needed.

The weight of these hives were reduced (by partial harvesting) to an average initial weight of 2. 76 kg the night preceding the experiment (30 th of April, 2007) for seasons A. On the night of the last day of October the hives were weighed with the average weight gain for the hives standing at 6. 27 kg.

The average weight of the beehives {{at the end of the}} season was 17. 26 kg. The average daily weight gain for each season was determined by dividing the weight gain for each season by the number of days (the observation lasted for).

The covered area floor space was 1. 5 × 1 m (excluding manger) for each animal and open paddock was 2 × 1 m. Height of shed at eaves was 2 meter.

Materials and Methods: A total of 40 lactating Murrah buffaloes were selected having similar body weight, parity, and milk yield. They were divided into four groups of 10 each. Three groups of buffaloes were provided with microclimate alteration using supplemental cooling like foggers, fans and foggers plus fans, and the fourth group (control) was without any cooling system. The daily THI was measured using <b>dry</b> and wet <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The physiological responses viz. rectal temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate were measured by a clinical thermometer, measuring the flank movements a minute and observing the pulsation of the middle coccygeal artery at the base of tail with the help of finger. Milk samples were analyzed for chemical composition viz., fat, solids-not-fat (SNF), total solids (TS), specific gravity. Results: In the present study, significant (p< 0. 001) decrease in the average THI values were observed in experimental Murrah buffalo houses of GroupII (foggers), GroupIII (fans), and GroupIV (foggers and fans) compared to GroupI (control). Significant (p< 0. 001) decrease in average rectal temperature (°F), respiration rate (breaths/min) and pulse rate (beats/min) values were recorded in Murrah buffaloes of Groups II, III and IV compared to Group I. Significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the average milk yield (kg/day) was recorded in Murrah buffaloes of Groups II, III, and IV compared with Group I. Significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the average milk fat, SNF, and TS percent were recorded in Murrah buffalo Groups of II, III, and IV compared with Group I. Conclusion: Microclimate alteration by the provision of foggers and air circulators in the buffalo houses increased feed intake in buffaloes resulting increased milk production, fat and SNF yield which was due to decreased heat stress in buffaloes...|$|R
