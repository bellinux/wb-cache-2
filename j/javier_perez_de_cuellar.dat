5000|$|As <b>Javier</b> <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar's</b> {{first term}} {{came to a}} close in 1986, the United Nations faced {{mounting}} financial difficulties. After the United States Congress cut the U.S. contribution to the U.N., Pérez said that he would only serve another term if the Reagan administration would agree to pay the U.S. dues. Pérez, who had undergone quadruple-bypass surgery in August 1986, said, [...] "I don't have to make a sacrifice and die with my ship." [...] If he could live his life over again, he said he would have become a concert pianist instead of Secretary-General, [...] "but in my country, that was only for girls." ...|$|R

25|$|She did, however, greet {{a number}} of Canadian Royal Family members, {{including}} the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother; and the Duke and Duchess of York. Prince Edward met with Sauvé at Rideau Hall on June 4, 1988, to present the Governor General with royal Letters Patent permitting the federal viceroy to exercise the Queen's powers in respect of the granting of heraldic arms in Canada, leading to the eventual creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, of which Sauvé was the first head. Among foreign visitors welcomed by Sauvé were King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Hussein of Jordan, Pope John Paul II, Secretary-General of the United Nations <b>Javier</b> <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> President François Mitterrand of France, Chinese President Li Xiannian, Romanian President Nicolae Ceauşescu, Mother Teresa, and, eventually, President Reagan. A number of these state visits were reciprocated when Sauvé travelled to represent the Queen in Italy, the Vatican, the People's Republic of China, Thailand, France, Uruguay, and Brazil.|$|E
500|$|The Australian {{mission was}} widely {{reported}} as successful. Colonel John Crocker, {{commander of the}} second Australian contingent (2ASC), wrote that the November 1989 election was UNTAG's raison d'être and observed that [...] "the Australian contingent's complete and wide-ranging support was {{critical to the success}} of that election and hence the mission – a fact that has been acknowledged at the highest level in UNTAG". <b>Javier</b> <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> Secretary-General of the United Nations, wrote to Gareth Evans (Australia's Foreign Minister) about the [...] "remarkable contribution made by the Australian military and electoral personnel", saying that their [...] "dedication and professionalism had been widely and deservedly praised". Although a total of 19 UN personnel lost their lives in Namibia, the two Australian contingents achieved their mission without sustaining any fatalities – one of the few military units in UNTAG to do so.|$|E

500|$|Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, [...] "The {{main reason}} {{that there has}} been no {{national}} consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help." [...] Karmal's position became less secure when the Soviet leadership began blaming him for the failures in Afghanistan. Gorbachev, worried over the situation, told the Soviet Politburo [...] "If we don't change approaches , we will be fighting there for another 20 or 30 years." [...] It is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for Karmal's dismissal, but Andrei Gromyko discussed the possibility of Karmal's resignation with <b>Javier</b> <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1982. While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, {{there may have been a}} consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev's own plan was to replace Karmal with Mohammad Najibullah, who had joined the PDPA at its creation. Najibullah was thought highly of by Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev and Dmitriy Ustinov, and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership's only choice for Karmal's succession; a GRU report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support Assadullah Sarwari's ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the Saur Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|President of the United States George H. W. Bush and {{chancellor}} of West Germany Helmut Kohl urged peaceful reforms and criticised the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On 31 August, the Baltic activists issued a joint declaration to <b>Javier</b> <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> Secretary-General of the United Nations. They {{claimed to be}} under threat of aggression and asked for an international commission {{to be sent to}} monitor the situation. Almost immediately after the broadcast the tone in Moscow began to soften [...] and the Soviet authorities failed to follow up on any of their threats. Eventually, according to historian Alfred Erich Senn, the pronouncement became a source of embarrassment. On 19-20 September, the Central Committee of the Communist Party convened to discuss the nationality question – something Mikhail Gorbachev had been postponing since early 1988. The plenum did not specifically address the situation in the Baltic states and reaffirmed old principles regarding the centralised Soviet Union and the dominant role of the Russian language. It did promise some increase in autonomy, but was contradictory and failed to address the underlying reasons for the conflict.|$|E
2500|$|President George H. W. Bush resumed the {{tradition}} of lighting the National Christmas Tree from a platform on The Ellipse in 1989. In 1991, President Bush presided over the tree-lighting ceremony with five Americans who had recently been released by their kidnappers in Lebanon: journalist Terry A. Anderson, university employee Joseph Cicippio, professor Alann Steen, professor Thomas Sutherland, and professor Jesse Turner. Also in attendance was Secretary-General of the United Nations <b>Javier</b> <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> who had helped negotiate {{the release of the}} hostages. Anderson attempted to light the tree twice, but failed. Bush tried to the light the tree, and after several seconds the lights finally came on. In 1992, the National Park Service permitted the first National Christmas Tree ornament to be produced. [...] The designer was Peggy Henkel, president of Georgetown Marketing Company (formerly American Marketing), and to avoid rules against commercialization the ornament was distributed without charge. 1992 was also the year that the National Christmas Tree and Pageant of Peace was featured on the official White House House Christmas card.

2500|$|According to The Washington Post, [...] "some UN {{employees}} and delegates" [...] expressed resentment at Ban's perceived favoritism in {{the appointment of}} South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous UN chiefs such as Kurt Waldheim (Austria), <b>Javier</b> <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar</b> (Peru), and Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry, and South Korean nationals have been historically underrepresented at the United Nations. Nonetheless, according to [...] "some officials" [...] in the Post story, Ban had allegedly gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in UN ranks by more than 20 percent during {{his first year in}} office. In response, Ban and his aides stated that the allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of racism. He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed—including Choi Young-jin, who had already served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said that the complaints were driven by envy: [...] "I think being from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. If he brings along talented people who he knows very well, I think that's also a plus." [...] UN records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had only 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top UN post. By contrast, the Philippines, a significantly poorer country, had 759 nationals in its mission.|$|E
