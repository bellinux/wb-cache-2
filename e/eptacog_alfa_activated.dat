5000|$|Factor VII ( [...] , blood-{{coagulation factor}} VIIa, {{activated}} blood coagulation factor VII, {{formerly known as}} proconvertin) {{is one of the}} proteins that causes blood to clot in the coagulation cascade. It is an enzyme of the serine protease class. A recombinant form of human factor VIIa (<b>eptacog</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated,</b> NovoSeven) has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for uncontrolled bleeding in hemophilia patients. It is sometimes used unlicensed in severe uncontrollable bleeding, although there have been safety concerns. A biosimilar form of recombinant activated factor VII (AryoSeven) is also available, but does not play any considerable role in the market.|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, <b>eptacog</b> <b>alfa</b> <b>activated)</b> has greatly advanced {{the care of}} patients with haemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors against the infused replacement factor. Recombinant FVIIa is licensed for the on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes and the prevention of bleeding in surgery or invasive procedures in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors. This article attempts to review in detail the extensive evidence of rFVIIa in congenital haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Patients with acute bleeding episodes are best treated on demand at home, to achieve the short- and long-term benefits of rapid bleed control. Key prospective {{studies have shown that}} rFVIIa achieves consistently high efficacy rates in the management of acute (including joint) bleeds in inhibitor patients in the home treatment setting. Substantial post-approval data from key registries also support the on-demand efficacy profile of rFVIIa established by the prospective clinical trials. The {{availability of}} rFVIIa has allowed major surgery to become a reality for inhibitor patients. Studies in key surgery, including orthopaedic procedures, have found that rFVIIa provides consistently high efficacy rates. Importantly, the wealth of data does not raise any unexpected safety concerns surrounding rFVIIa use; this is likely because rFVIIa is a recombinant product with a localised mechanism of action at the site of vascular injury. In summary, rFVIIa is established as an effective and well-tolerated first-line treatment for on-demand bleeding control and bleed prevention during minor and major (including elective orthopaedic) surgery in inhibitor patients. Use of rFVIIa has been a major step towards narrowing the gap in outcomes between inhibitor patients and non-inhibitor patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Background: Drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated),</b> or {{recombinant}} human activated protein C, has antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties. In a previous study, drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> produced dose-dependent {{reductions in the}} levels of markers of coagulation and inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. In this phase 3 trial, we assessed whether treatment with drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> reduced the rate of death from any cause among patients with severe sepsis. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients with systemic inflammation and organ failure due to acute infection were enrolled and assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either placebo or drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> (24 microg per kilogram of body weight per hour) for a total duration of 96 hours. The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days {{after the start of}} the infusion. Patients were monitored for adverse events; changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and the results of microbiologic cultures; and the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C. Results: A total of 1690 randomized patients were treated (840 in the placebo group and 850 in the drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> group). The mortality rate was 30. 8 percent in the placebo group and 24. 7 percent in the drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> group. On the basis of the prospectively defined primary analysis, treatment with drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19. 4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6. 6 to 30. 5) and an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6. 1 percent (P = 0. 005). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> group than in the placebo group (3. 5 percent vs. 2. 0 percent, P = 0. 06). Conclusions: Treatment with drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> <b>activated</b> significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

40|$|Systemic haemostatic agents play an {{important}} role in the management of blood loss during major surgery where significant blood loss is likely and their use has increased in recent times as a consequence of demand for blood products outstripping supply and the risks associated with transfusions. Their main application is as prophylaxis to reduce bleeding in major surgery, including cardiac and orthopaedic surgery and orthotopic liver transplantation. Aprotinin has been the predominant agent used in this setting; of the other antifibrinolytic agents that have been studied, tranexamic acid is the most effective and epsilon-aminocaproic acid may also have a role. <b>Eptacog</b> <b>alfa</b> (recombinant factor VIIa) has also shown promise. Tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid and <b>eptacog</b> <b>alfa</b> are generally well tolerated; however, when considering the methods to reduce or prevent blood loss intra- and postoperatively, the benefits of these agents need to be weighed against the risk of adverse events. Recently, concerns have been raised about the safety of aprotinin after an association between increased renal dysfunction and mortality was shown in retrospective observational studies and an increase in all-cause mortality with aprotinin relative to tranexamic acid or F-aminocaproic acid was seen after a pre-planned periodic analysis of the large BART (Blood conservation using Antifibrinolytics in a Randomized Trial) study. The latter finding resulted in the trial being halted, and aprotinin has subsequently been withdrawn from the market pending detailed analysis of efficacy and safety results from the study.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effects of drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> therapy, a {{recombinant}} human activated protein C, across clinically relevant subpopulations in a randomized, phase 3, placebo-controlled study of patients with severe sepsis (recombinant human activated protein C worldwide evaluation in severe sepsis [PROWESS]). Design: Univariate and multivariable analysis of prospectively defined subgroups from the PROWESS study. Setting. A total of 164 medical centers in 11 countries. Patients. A total of 1, 690 patients with severe sepsis. Measurements and Main Results., We report observed 28 -day mortality rates for drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> and placebo patients for subgroups prospectively defined by demographic data, surgical status, type and site of infection, and clinical and biochemical measures of disease severity. We performed subgroup analyses to explore {{the consistency of the}} mortality benefit observed in the overall population and performed tests for both quantitative and qualitative interactions. To examine the magnitude of the treatment benefit with drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> across the underlying predicted risk of mortality spectrum, we used stepwise logistic regression on PROWESS placebo patients to generate a predicted risk of mortality model that simultaneously included many clinical and biochemical markers of mortality risk. Because drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> has anticoagulant properties, we also present analyses of bleeding and thrombotic events. Actual mortality rates were lower with drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> compared with placebo for nearly all prospectively defined subgroups. Both univariate and multivariable regression analyses showed a consistent relative risk reduction in 28 -day mortality rates for drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated).</b> Larger absolute risk reductions were found with drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> in patients with a higher baseline predicted risk of mortality, and actual mortality rates were lower with drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> in all subgroups defined by disease severity measures where a {{greater than or equal to}} 20 % placebo mortality was observed. Although discriminatory power was limited by few observed events, the increased absolute risk of experiencing a serious bleeding event with treatment did not seem to vary according to the baseline predicted risk of mortality. Conclusions. The administration of drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> to patients with severe sepsis was associated with a significant survival benefit that tended to increase with higher baseline likelihood of death.

Advances in our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and in the important link between the inflammatory response to sepsis and activation of coagulation led to the development and licensing of the first ever, specific, immunomodulatory anti-sepsis drug. Drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated),</b> a recombinant version of activated protein C, was shown in a large randomized controlled clinical trial to reduce mortality rates from 30. 8 % in the placebo group to 24. 7 % in the treatment group, which equated to one additional life saved for every 16 patients treated. Vasopressor requirements and duration of mechanical ventilation were also reduced.

40|$|Introduction In a study {{conducted}} by Annane, patients with septic shock and unresponsive to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation receiving low-dose steroid therapy had prolonged survival but not significantly improved 28 -day mortality. The present study examines intravenous steroid use in PROWESS (Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis) patients meeting the Annane enrollment criteria (AEC). Methods Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests were not done in PROWESS. Steroids were allowed but their use was not directed. Patients were identified using AEC (all of: randomization to study drug treatment within 8 hours of shock onset; infection, fever, or hypothermia; tachycardia; systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg on vasopressors; mechanical ventilation; and one of urine < 0. 5 ml/kg per hour, lactic acidosis, or arterial oxygen tension/ inspired fractional oxygen < 280). We examined steroid use and mortality data; additional analyses were done outside the 8 -hour window. Results Steroid-treated patients were older, had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores and more organ dysfunctions, and were more commonly receiving mechanical ventilation. Among patients meeting AEC, regardless of steroid treatment (n = 97), mortality in the placebo and drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> groups was 38 % (19 / 50) and 28 % (13 / 47), respectively (relative risk [RR] = 0. 73, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 41 - 1. 30). When using AEC but excluding the requirement for randomization within 8 hours of shock onset (n = 612), placebo mortality was 38 % (118 / 313) and drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> mortality was 29 % (88 / 299; RR = 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 62 - 0. 98). Using AEC but excluding the 8 -hour window and with steroids initiated at baseline and/or infusion (n = 228) resulted in mortality for placebo and drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated)</b> groups of 43 % (51 / 118) and 33 % (36 / 110), respectively (RR = 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 54 - 1. 06). Conclusion Patients with severe sepsis from the PROWESS trial who were likely to respond to low-dose steroids according to the AEC were those patients at a high risk for death.

When 28 -day mortality data from these trials {{for patients with}} severe sepsis and {{at high risk of}} death are pooled using a standard random-effects meta-analysis technique, there is no statistically significant survival benefit (for patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores of 25 or more), or a borderline significant benefit (for patients with multi-organ failure). We argue that two important methodological issues might explain the disparate results between the two trials. These issues centre on early trial stopping, which exaggerates treatment effects, and reliance on subgroup analyses, which for DrotAA yields inconsistent results across different definitions of high risk.

40|$|Sepsis, the infl ammatory {{response}} to infection, {{is perhaps the}} most common disease encountered by the critical care physician, complicating some 30 % to 40 % of ICU admissions and accounting for considerable morbidity and mortality. Septic shock affects some 10 % to 15 % of intensive care unit patients and carries mortality rates of 50 % to 60 %. Recent years have seen major advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and, as a result, new treatments and approaches to management have become available. The search to fi nd effective therapies for sepsis, {{one of the most common}} disease processes on the intensive care unit, has been rewarded in recent years with the development and licensing of drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated),</b> the fi rst of the so-called immunomodulatory drugs to be shown to improve outcomes in patients with severe sepsis. This milestone in the history of sepsis research has added new impetus to the ongoing quest for strategies to help decrease the still high mortality rates associated with this condition. This chapter presents some of the recent advances in sepsis management, including corticosteroids and drotrecogin <b>alfa</b> (<b>activated),</b> before refl ecting on some of the possible interventions and drugs of the future.

Despite this, the study failed to show any significant differences in outcome between the treatment and placebo groups. The results raise questions about how we should perform meaningful clinical trials in relatively rare conditions such as paediatric sepsis, where the easily measurable endpoints (such as death) are infrequent. A radical rethink of the design of such studies is urgently needed...|$|R
