5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; {{he was forced to}} anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5|$|Governor Desha's {{reputation}} was further tarnished {{because of a}} pardon issued to his son. On November 2, 1824, Isaac B. Desha had brutally murdered Francis Baker, a Mississippian who was visiting Kentucky. On November 24, 1824, John Rowan, one of the governor's allies in the General Assembly, introduced legislation ordering the Fleming County Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17, 1825, for Isaac Desha's trial and providing that the accused should {{have the option to}} request a change of venue to Harrison County at that time. Miles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the murder, Harrison County was the governor's home county, and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there. Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it favorably to the full legislature. This was done, and the bill was approved on December 4, 1824.|$|E

25|$|At about 3:00a.m. on April 17, 1977, Alexander Esau, 20, and Valentina Suriani, 18, {{were sitting}} in Suriani's car near {{her home in the}} Bronx, only a few blocks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the Lauria–Valenti shooting, when each was shot twice.

25|$|Although {{he had no}} {{military}} training, Medwin was gazetted as a cornet in June 1812, joining his regiment at Cawnpore in Uttar Pradesh in northern India shortly thereafter.

On 18 February 1973, Catholic postmen Anthony Coleman and David McAleese were gunned down and killed by a passing car. Rea was tried in a Diplock Court where he had protested his innocence to no avail. Despite his association with the Red Hand Commando, he joined Spence in the UVF section of Long Kesh.|$|E

The presenters often have expertise in the story they are sent to cover, for example channel presenters and former reporters Ben Brown and Clive Myrie were dispatched to Cairo and Tripoli during the Middle East uprisings.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{that matched}} that {{of one of}} Eddowes' descendants was extracted from a shawl said to have come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> her murder. The DNA match was based on one of seven small segments taken from the hypervariable regions. The segment contained a sequence variation described as 314.1C, and claimed to be uncommon, with a frequency of only 1 in 290,000 worldwide. However, Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys and others pointed out this was in fact an error in nomenclature for the common sequence variation 315.1C, which is present in more than 99% of the sequences in the EMPOP database.|$|E
25|$|On Friday October 15, 2010, Mayor Albert Y.M. Huang {{was arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of battery, robbery and assault, two felonies and a misdemeanor. He was released on $100,000 bail. He resigned {{from the office of}} Mayor and from the council on October 19, 2010, at the city council meeting that evening. He declared his innocence even though he was observed driving away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the altercation at approximately 45mph, with a woman clinging to his car. According to the police, a security guard from a nearby business saw Huang and the female subject fighting and detained them until police could arrive.|$|E
25|$|In April 1993, in the New York State Police Troop C scandal, Craig D. Harvey, a New York State Police trooper, {{was charged}} with {{fabricating}} evidence. Harvey admitted he and another trooper lifted fingerprints from items the suspect, John Spencer, touched while in Troop C headquarters during booking. He attached the fingerprints to evidence cards and later claimed that he had pulled the fingerprints <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the murder. The forged evidence was presented during John Spencer's trial and his subsequent conviction resulted in a term of 50 years {{to life in prison}} at his sentencing. Three state troopers were found guilty of fabricating fingerprint evidence and served prison sentences.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{attempts}} to use K9s in Policing was in 1889 by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police of London, Sir Charles Warren. Warren's repeated failures at identifying and apprehending the serial killer Jack the Ripper had earned him much vilification from the press, including being denounced for not using bloodhounds to track the killer. He soon had two bloodhounds trained {{for the performance of}} a simple tracking test <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> another of the killer's crimes. The results were far from satisfactory, with one of the hounds biting the Commissioner and both dogs later running off, requiring a police search to find them.|$|E
25|$|Dando's BBC {{colleague}} Nick Ross stated on Newsnight on {{the night}} of her death that retaliatory attacks by criminals against police, lawyers and judges were almost unknown in Britain. Finally, forensic examination of the cartridge case and bullet recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the attack suggested that the weapon used had been the result of a workshop conversion of a replica or decommissioned gun. It was argued that a professional assassin would not use such a poor quality weapon. The police therefore soon began to favour the idea that the killing had been carried out by a crazed individual acting on an opportunist basis. This assumed profile of the perpetrator led to the focus on Barry George.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} the shootout {{that killed the}} perpetrators, investigators in armored vehicles at the perpetrators' townhouse considered ordering an evacuation, but instead ordered the neighborhood to shelter in place and cordoned off the area. From 4:00p.m. to 5:30p.m., police asked residents of the area {{to stay in their}} homes with doors locked and secure after residents reported a person jumping fences. No one was found; the reports may have been from officers at the scene. A person detained after running away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the shootout was thought to be a possible third suspect, but police determined that he was not connected to the shooting; the person was booked on an unrelated outstanding misdemeanor warrant.|$|E
