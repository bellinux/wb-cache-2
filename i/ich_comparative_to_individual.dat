50|$|With {{any of the}} concepts, whether {{considering}} the intrinsic value of education or the externally perceived value, each unit of educational attainment requires forgone earnings to attain. Insomuch as an <b>individual</b> would have <b>to</b> sacrifice wages {{in order to gain}} an additional unit of education. Outside of forgone monetary earnings, there are also direct expenses such as tuition, supplies, books, etc. one must consider when acquiring education, as well as less direct psychic costs. With this there is an economic consideration and tradeoff an individual must consider in their further education aspirations. One who has resources and the desire to continue education has a significant <b>comparative</b> advantage <b>to</b> an <b>individual</b> who by comparison does not. This financial aspect of educational acquirement proves as yet another consideration in the reproductive nature of education.|$|R
40|$|There are {{concerns}} {{that too many}} young people, from disadvantaged backgrounds, are moving into secondary education in the UK, and elsewhere, without the necessary literacy skills to make progress with the wider secondary school curriculum. A large number of interventions have been proposed to reduce this poverty gradient. This paper summarises the evidence from randomised controlled trials of seven popular interventions, giving a different <b>comparative</b> perspective <b>to</b> <b>individual</b> reports, and permitting more detail than a wider review. Of these, it shows that Switch-on Reading (Reading Recovery) and Accelerated Reader, for example, are currently the most promising. And that summer schools {{and the use of}} generic literacy software are the least successful and may even harm pupil progress. The way in which the evidence is assessed in this paper suggests a way forward for practitioners and policy-makers navigating the evidence in their areas of interest. There is also evidence that practitioners should be able to conduct robust evaluations of their own with only minimal support, which could lead to a revolution in school improvement. The combined results suggest that ‘soft’ evaluations may be worse than just {{a waste of time and}} money, and that theoretical explanations might appear satisfying to readers but are largely unnecessary when assessing ‘what works’ in education...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a qualitative, comparative {{case study}} focusing on fundraising strategies used to increase alumni giving among {{the majority and}} the minority populations at a Historically Black Institution (HBI) and a Historically White Institution (HWI). For this study, the minority population at the HBI {{is defined as the}} Caucasian alumni and at the HWI the minority population is defined as the African American alumni. Both institutions are four year comprehensive Catholic institutions. When comparing both institutional types, the rate of alumni giving at historically white institutions is higher than within the black college context. ^ Scholars have conducted research on alumni giving based on the majority population, but limited research is available about black colleges and the strategies they use to increase alumni giving. Some researchers argue that fundraising strategies are not race-specific and can be applied to any culture while others suggest that fundraising success is dependent upon understanding the giving behavior within a specific community. Other researchers indicate that race-related motivations, unique educational experiences, and issues of trust are large factors that reflect giving in the black community. ^ This study provided <b>comparative</b> insight <b>to</b> <b>individuals</b> affiliated with institutional advancement and alumni giving strategies. Specifically, results discussed herein will provide new strategies to increase alumni giving among institutional minority populations. In addition, this dissertation will help development professionals become more aware of the culture of giving within the African American community and it will add to the limited research on alumni giving at black colleges. ^ I found that the strategies used to increase alumni giving within these two institutional types were consistent. Additionally, the strategies used to increase alumni giving among the minority population were consistent with the majority population at both institutions. Ironically, when institutions used the same strategies with the minority population as they did with the majority population at both institutions, these strategies were not effective. Therefore, I concluded that development professionals should use culturally-sensitive strategies when soliciting the minority populations to increase alumni giving. ...|$|R

Many courts and judges lean more towards the maternal figure when there is a trial for custody of a child. According to Family Change and Time Allocation in American Families study done at UCLA, women allocate about 13.9 hours a week to child care while men allocate about 7 hours a week. Additionally, according to the Current Population Survey, in 2013, custodial mothers were more likely to have child support agreements (52.3 percent) <b>comparative</b> <b>to</b> custodial fathers (31.4 percent).|$|R

Whilst both hyporesponsivity and hyperresponsivity have been established in ASD <b>comparative</b> <b>to</b> typically developing controls, it has been proposed that hyporesponsivity may distinguish the sensory profile of ASD from other neurodevelopmental conditions. This paper aimed to systematically evaluate evidence for a syndrome-specific profile of hyporesponsivity in individuals with ASD when compared <b>to</b> <b>individuals</b> from clinical comparison groups, evaluating 10 eligible papers. Support was cautiously identified for a syndrome-specific sensory profile of hyporesponsivity. Four factors that reduced variability in findings were as follows: chronological age, type of comparison group, sensory measure and quality of study. Whilst hyporesponsivity in ASD was identified, the use of poorly defined comparison groups, over-representation of children with ASD and intellectual disabilities, and younger age ranges complicate generalisation of this body of work.
