5|$|The Faraway Trees Dame Slap, {{who made}} regular use of {{corporal}} punishment, {{was changed to}} Dame Snap who no longer did so, {{and the names of}} Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a boy were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal. Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
25|$|In the 1997 film Deconstructing Harry, Woody Allen's {{character}} {{claims to}} have fallen out of love with his first wife when lighting made <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Max Schmeling, rendering him impotent.|$|E

60|$|I {{may as well}} say at {{once that}} it came from Janee who, awaking suddenly, had {{perceived}} {{against the background of}} the sky, Hans standing over <b>her,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> a yellow devil with a long knife in his hand, which she thought was about to be used to murder her.|$|R

25|$|Since the {{creative}} team {{did not want}} the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor Roy Thomas suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group. Cockrum liked the idea, and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm’s white hair would make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.|$|E
25|$|Sachsen {{was later}} renamed Hermann. On 22 August 1942 she sailed from Tromsø to operate off {{the east coast}} of Greenland, {{arriving}} at Shannon Island on 27 August. The ship was disguised in an attempt to make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> sea ice. In the spring of 1943, the Germans were discovered by the Slædepatruljen Sirius, but they later managed to capture its leader, and ordered him to help them find a new site for a weather station. He took Kapitän Ritter to Scoresbysund, where Ritter was captured by the Allies and made a prisoner of war. Hermann was scuttled on 17 June 1943 in Hansa Bay. Her crew were evacuated by a Dornier Do 26 flying boat.|$|E
25|$|Donna, whom Kathy still {{refuses to}} accept, sinks into {{depression}} and overdoses on heroin and dies, leaving Kathy wrestling with guilt. Kathy attempts {{to move on}} and begins a relationship with market trader Laurie Bates (Gary Powell). Their relationship manages to survive the interference of Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), who tries but fails to claim Laurie for herself. However, when Laurie begins buying Kathy extravagant clothing and jewellery, she questions his motives, thinking he's trying to make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> his late wife, and loses interest. Laurie takes her rejection badly and some tactless comments regarding her sexual abstinence makes Kathy believe he has deceived her of his true nature. She ends the relationship. Later in the year, Kathy begins dating Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). He patiently pursues her, but after a few dates, she becomes hesitant and after she sees him kissing Eibhlin O'Donnell (Mary Conlon) - his former girlfriend visiting from Ireland - their lukewarm romance ends.|$|E

25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and her hair was strewn with gems, making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Emma's {{style and}} costuming, Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich has explained: [...] "We {{wanted to make}} <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> everything’s so neat—perfectly ironed and tucked-in shirts with matching belts, shoes and pins. We wanted to make her {{stand out from the}} other teachers. She’s always so happy and excited, so we wanted her outfits to represent that sunny disposition. In the pilot, we made her look much more teacher-y. Now we're having more fun with her character, keeping her bright and unusual. Quirky is the word. Emma’s also always in stacked Mary Janes or T-strap heels. It takes the outfit down from being too stylish or too sexy. It makes her look prim and almost old-fashioned." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} further popularized and embellished in Journey Into Darkness: Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans (1998) by Kalila Katherina Smith, the {{operator}} of a New Orleans ghost tour business. Smith's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire, including a [...] "victim [...] obviously had her arms amputated {{and her skin}} peeled off in a circular pattern, making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a human caterpillar," [...] and another who had had her limbs broken and reset [...] "at odd angles so she resembled a human crab". [...] Many of the new details in Smith's book were unsourced, while others were {{not supported by the}} sources given.|$|E

500|$|Akihiko Yoshida {{has stated}} that Ashe's {{physical}} features were designed {{with the intent of}} making her look vaguely French, stating that [...] "the base of her bone structure is a French person's. We were given orders from the start to not make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an Asian. But we modified her a bit to look more like a Japanese {{for the sake of the}} Japanese audience, and also since a character that looks completely French makes some of the CG expressions difficult." [...] Ashe was voiced by Kari Wahlgren in English and by Mie Sonozaki in Japanese. Despite having been created for Final Fantasy XII, she was first introduced in the 2004 crossover board game Itadaki Street Special. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable, and was set to appear in Fortress, as revealed in concept art for the game.|$|E
500|$|May {{was delighted}} that Lima [...] "went for {{something}} more fashion-forward" [...] with Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa. She decided to make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "runway lady", wearing something that is [...] "still Disney" [...] but also [...] "high fashion, like something John Galliano or Thierry Mugler might design". Since Narissa appears in three media: hand drawn animation, live-action, and computer animation, May {{had to make sure}} that the costume would be the same throughout in terms of [...] "color, shape, and texture". The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked [...] "reptilian", as well as a cape. Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the dragon's form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like wings, the [...] of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) employs {{method acting}} for her {{upcoming}} role as singer Janis Joplin, thus allowing Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) {{to take advantage}} of her. He tells her to do her research on Joplin on English Wikipedia, then edits the page contents with nonsense when Jenna goes off to read it. Jenna, however, believes what she reads and proceeds to imitate all the [...] "facts" [...] on the page to the amusement of everyone. When she finally confronts Frank, they end up having sex and Jenna is affronted when Frank wants to keep it a secret from their co-workers. She reveals their fling {{in front of the other}} TGS with Tracy Jordan writers to the dismay of Frank. At hearing this, Katie (Elizabeth Rouse), the show's hair dresser and Frank's girlfriend, ruins Jenna's hair and face making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a witch.|$|E
60|$|The {{front and}} back drawing-rooms of the house were thrown into one. Mrs. Eyrecourt was being gently moved {{backward}} and forward in a chair on wheels, propelled by her maid; two gentlemen being present, visitors like myself. In spite of rouge and loosely folded lace and flowing draperies, she presented a deplorable spectacle. The bodily part of <b>her</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a dead woman, painted and revived--while the moral part, in the strongest contrast, was just as lively as ever.|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} Joan {{gave me a}} shock. Why, she was but a shadow! It was {{difficult}} for me to realize that this frail little creature with the sad face and drooping form was the same Joan of Arc that I had so often seen, all fire and enthusiasm, charging through a hail of death and the lightning and thunder of the guns at the head of her battalions. It wrung my heart to see <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> this.|$|R

500|$|She also {{performed}} the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 18, 2014. The performance was the restart of Gaga's emergence under media spotlight, following a self-imposed sabbatical due to depression and stories about betrayal surrounding {{the release of}} Artpop. The singer wore a white dress and sported a platinum blond wig; the ensemble made <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> fashion designer Donatella Versace. Starting the song as an acoustic version, Gaga played a crystal piano placed atop a ramp {{at the end of}} the stage. By the second chorus, the electronic beats of the song started and she descended to the front of the stage to complete the performance with a dance. Carl Williot from Idolator complimented the performance, saying that it made him appreciate the track more. It was praised by Melinda Newman from HitFix who said that [...] "Gaga excels when it is just her at a piano performing the songs with the barest of accompaniment." ...|$|E
500|$|The limited series Infinite Crisis (2005), {{written as}} {{a sequel to}} the 1985 maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths, altered DC Comics continuity. Subsequently, all comic book titles {{published}} by DC Comics skip forward one year and a new maxi-series entitled 52 retroactively chronicles the 52 weeks which directly followed Infinite Crisis. When DC editors called for a redesign of Batwoman, comic book artist Alex Ross drew inspiration from the modified Batgirl costume he designed for Barbara Gordon, seven years prior to Kate Kane's debut in the limited comic book series 52. Ross and comic book author Paul Dini initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using {{an updated version of}} the character's original costume, with red accents in place of the traditional yellow. However, since Gordon served as one of {{a very small number of}} disabled superheroes of DC Comics as Oracle, DC's editorial staff decided to revitalize the original Batwoman instead. In an interview with Newsarama, Ross states [...] "They had me change the mask and hair to make it a bit more Batwoman, rather than Batgirl...I pointed out to them that the mask makes <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the Huntress a little overall—but there weren't many options. The original mask that I had in there when it was to be a Batgirl design was the complete head cover that we've seen, so they did need something different from that." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties air about it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair made <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks. Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.|$|E

500|$|Kaoru's Reflection OVA series {{version was}} criticized; Efrain Diaz, Jr. of IGN wrote that {{although}} some of Kenshin and Kaoru's private moments are touching, others are depressing. According to Anime News Network's Mike Crandol, Kaoru is the least visually successful character redesign in the Reflection OVA. Citing the manga version's [...] "distinctive girlish charm", Crandol said that the staff members tried too hard to make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Yukishiro Tomoe. [...] Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating Reflection as canon due to how tragic the life of Kaoru and Kenshin's family became. About.com's Serdar Yegulalp felt the romance between Kaoru and Kenshin was entertaining to watch {{but at the same}} time criticized they often acted out of character, commenting on how Kaoru lets her husband leave the house in contrast to how in the original series, Kenshin left Tokyo while still not married with her. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe praised the romance between Kaoru and Kenshin, feeling it was well developed in the OVAs and served as a fitting finale to the series. ABC CBN's Karen Flores praised Emi Takei's portrayal of the character in the first live-action film, stating the actress played her character just like the one from the manga and anime. However, she was criticized for lacking her tomboyish traits when interacting with the young Myojin Yahiko. The lack of the love triangle between Kaoru, Kenshin and Takani Megumi was crticized by Ko Ransom from Anime News Network, as the writer noted the first film covered too many subplots. David West from Neo lamented Kaoru had few appearances in the final film, citing her role in the previous ones appealing.|$|E
