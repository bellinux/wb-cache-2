40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{complete}} the development and structural analysis of the rail system {{to be used in}} the experiment Muons-to-Electrons (mu 2 e) planned at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Various components in the particle physics are to be transported, aligned, and installed inside a vacuum chamber called the Detector Solenoid Cryostat. To accomplish these tasks simultaneously, a rail system will be utilized. Developing a successful design requires consideration for manufacturability as well as the cost of production. To satisfy the design, the project is broken into four phases. The first phase is to define all known constraints and parameters. The second phase is to develop a preliminary design that designates rail sizes and support stand locations. Once this is completed, the rail system and its components are simulated to ensure adequate structural support and safety factor. The third phase is to present the design to my faculty mentor, Fermilab management, and project <b>engineers</b> <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> review.

By July 1993, seventeen structural engineers and thirty-eight architects applied as candidates for the preliminary studies.

40|$|MATLAB {{has emerged}} as one of the {{languages}} most commonly used by scientists and <b>engineers</b> <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> computing, with ~ 1, 000, 000 users worldwide. The compute intensive nature of technical computing means that many MATLAB users have codes that can significantly benefit from the increased performance offered by parallel computing. pMatlab (www. ll. mit. edu/pMatlab) provides this capability by implementing Parallel Global Array Semantics (PGAS) using standard operator overloading techniques. The core data structure in pMatlab is a distributed numerical array whose distribution onto multiple processors is specified with a map construct. Communication operations between distributed arrays are abstracted away from the user and pMatlab transparently supports redistribution between any block-cyclic-overlapped distributions up to four dimensions. pMatlab is built on top of the MatlabMPI communication library (www. ll. mit. edu/MatlabMPI) and runs on any combination of heterogeneous systems that support MATLAB, which includes Windows, Linux, MacOSX, and SunOS. Performance is validated by implementing the HPC Challenge benchmark suite and comparing pMatlab performance with the equivalent C+MPI codes. These results indicate that pMatlab can often achieve comparable performance to C+MPI at usually 1 / 10 th the code size. Finally, we present implementation data collected from a sample of 10 real pMatlab applications drawn from the ~ 100 users at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. These data indicate that users are typically able to go from a serial code to a well performing pMatlab code in about 3 hours while changing less than 1 % of their code.

Modern models tend to focus on a constant feedback and conversation between users, designers, and <b>engineers</b> and push <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> systems to be wrapped around the types of experiences users want to have, rather than wrapping user experience around a completed system.|$|R

40|$|For {{the goal}} of {{designing}} a wearable low vision aid, aspects of both head-mounted display (HMD) design and performance evaluation were integrated into a single study of scanning ability. A head-mounted version of a novel retinal light scanning display known as the virtual retinal display was fabricated for this study. A remote head CCD (charge coupled device) attached approximately at the user’s line of sight {{was used as the}} input source. Scanning ability was quantified as the time to identify a target in a wide field of distractors while using the HMD design in four different display interface modes (DIMs). Each DIM was tested with respect to their corresponding controls: A (augmented, see-through) and CO (center occluded) DIMs were compared to the augmented control (augmented, retinal display turned off), and CPO (center and periphery occluded) and PO (periphery occluded) DIMs were compared to the periphery occluded control (periphery obstructed, retinal display turned off). Each DIM was tested at high, medium, and low contrast levels. Five subjects were tested without optical correction (visual acuity worse than 20 / 200), which accurately represented low vision subjects. Results showed that for each DIM, scanning performance decreased as the contrast level decreased.

The C–V loops reveal the ferroelectric nature of both Al/Si/SiOx/BTO/Au and Al/Si/SiOx/MoSe 2 /BTO/Au structures and the high quality of the SiOx/MoSe 2 interface in the Al/Si/SiOx/MoSe 2 /Au structure. Al/Si/SiOx/MoSe 2 /BTO/Au hybrid structures show electroforming free resistive switching that is explained {{on the basis of}} the modulation of the potential distribution at the MoSe 2 /BTO interface via ferroelectric polarization flipping. This structure shows promising resistive switching characteristics with a switching ratio of ≈ 102 and a stable memory window, which are highly required for memory applications.

The interface polarization coupling becomes more efficient and causes a remarkable change in heterostructure properties with decrease in ZnO layer thickness. The heterostructure with ZnO thickness of 25 [*]nm displays the enhanced resistive switching characteristics with switching ratio ≈ 106 and good stability in low and high resistance states. Moreover, the photoluminescence spectrum exhibits two additional blue emissions when ZnO thickness is ≤ 50 [*]nm and their mechanism is highlighted based on interface band offset and interface polarization coupling effect.
