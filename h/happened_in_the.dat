Therefore, Betances and the Puerto Rican revolutionaries ceded their caches of firearms hidden in Saint Thomas, Curaçao and Haiti to the Cuban rebels in October 1871, since their struggle was deemed as a priority.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of a state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, L. Sprague de Camp {{considered}} Morris's fantasies {{to be not}} wholly successful, partly because Morris eschewed many literary techniques from later eras. In particular, De Camp argued the plots of the novels are heavily driven by coincidence; while many things just <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> romances, the novels are still weakened by the dependence on it. Nevertheless, large subgenres {{of the field of}} fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, but indirectly, through their writers' imitation of William Morris.|$|E

Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E

If the Germans had won the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe {{would have been able to}} strike anywhere in southern England and with the prospect of an invasion, the British government would have come under pressure to come to terms: the extensive anti-invasion preparations demonstrated to Germany and to the people of Britain that whatever <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, the United Kingdom was both able and willing to defend itself.|$|E

5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish what had <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were {{to have an impact}} in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is because of what <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
