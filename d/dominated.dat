40|$|Abstract. A pair of {{vertices}} of a graph {{is called}} a <b>dominating</b> pair if the vertex set of every path between these two vertices is a <b>dominating</b> set of the graph. A graph is a weak <b>dominating</b> pair graph {{if it has a}} <b>dominating</b> pair. Further, a graph {{is called a}} <b>dominating</b> pair graph if each of its connected induced subgraphs is a weak <b>dominating</b> pair graph. <b>Dominating</b> pair graphs form a class of graphs containing interval, permutation, cocomparability, and asteroidal triple-free graphs. Our purpose is to study the structural properties of <b>dominating</b> pair graphs. Our main results are a polar theorem for the <b>dominating</b> pairs in weak <b>dominating</b> pair graphs and an existence theorem for minimum cardinality connected <b>dominating</b> sets that induce a simple path in connected <b>dominating</b> pair graphs of diameter not equal to three. Furthermore, we present a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of chordal <b>dominating</b> pair graphs...|$|R

40|$|A vertex {{subset of}} a graph is a <b>dominating</b> set if every vertex of the graph {{belongs to the}} set or has a {{neighbor}} in it. A connected <b>dominating</b> set is a <b>dominating</b> set such that the induced subgraph of the set is a connected graph. A graph is called distance-hereditary if every induced path is a shortest path. In this note, we give a complete description of the (inclusionwise) minimal connected <b>dominating</b> sets of connected distance-hereditary graphs in the following sense: If G is a connected distance-hereditary graph that has a <b>dominating</b> vertex, any minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set is a single vertex or a pair of two adjacent vertices. If G {{does not have a}} <b>dominating</b> vertex, the subgraphs induced by any two minimal connected <b>dominating</b> sets are isomorphic. In particular, any inclusionwise minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set of a connected distance-hereditary graph without <b>dominating</b> vertex has minimal size. In other words, connected distance-hereditary graphs without <b>dominating</b> vertex are connected well-dominated. Furthermore, we show that if G is a distance-hereditary graph that has a minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set X of size at least 2, then for any connected induced subgraph H it holds that the subgraph induced by any minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set of H is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of G[X]...|$|R
