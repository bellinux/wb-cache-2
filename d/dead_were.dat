5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|At least 164 victims (civilians and {{security}} personnel) and nine attackers {{were killed in}} the attacks. Among the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> 28 foreign nationals from 10 countries. One attacker was captured. The bodies of many of the dead hostages showed signs of torture or disfigurement. A number of those killed were notable figures in business, media, {{and security}} services.|$|E
5|$|By dawn, the Japanese attack had subsided. Over 750Japanese <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> {{counted in}} and around the American positions. No prisoners were taken. American {{casualties}} were 61dead, and 244wounded, including nine dead and 38wounded Seabees. The 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry and the 40th Naval Construction Battalion received Presidential Unit Citations. General Chase called for an airdrop of ammunition, prodigious quantities of which had been expended during the night, and had Warramunga fire on the native skidway.|$|E
50|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, the Absoute (or {{absolution}} of the <b>dead)</b> <b>is</b> {{a symbolic}} ablution of the deceased's body following the Requiem Mass. While specific prayers are said, the coffin is incensed and sprinkled with holy water. The absolution of the <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> only performed in {{context of the}} Tridentine Mass. Following the Second Vatican Council, the absolution of the <b>dead</b> <b>was</b> removed from the funeral liturgy of the Mass of Paul VI.|$|R

5|$|Examinations of {{the burial}} grounds, of which even the largest used {{continuously}} over periods {{of up to}} several centuries, contains no more than several hundreds graves, shows that the overall population density was low. The <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> cremated and the ashes sometimes placed in urns, which had the mid-part {{in the form of}} an engraved bulge. In the 1st century AD this was replaced with a sharp-profiled (with a horizontal ridge around the circumference) shape.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{records that}} 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield, {{and it is}} unknown how many more perished in the swamps. He also {{reported}} that the Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11. Among the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> the war archon Callimachus and the general Stesilaos.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{evacuations}} continued {{from other}} area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the Methodist Hospital indicated {{that people were}} dying of dehydration and exhaustion while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The {{first floor of the}} hospital flooded and the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{as part of}} Remembrance Week observances for the Canadian Senate, five {{family members}} of the {{soldiers}} who died in the crash were presented with Memorial Crosses. Other family members were due to receive them at a later date. The <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> not given posthumous Canadian Volunteer Service Medals as they never reached the Korean theatre; Tom Boutillier, a survivor of the crash, considers that an injustice and has campaigned for medals to be awarded.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the battle}} {{was treated as a}} great victory and {{afterward}} no fewer than eight men were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The German <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> gathered together and buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem, but after the war they were reburied in Ysselsteyn.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Gallipoli dead have {{no known}} grave. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery, {{constructed}} {{on the site}} where the Turks buried Allied war dead after the evacuation, has 632 graves. Only ten of the men there have been identified. At the nearby Hill 60 Cemetery, which has another 788 graves, only seventy-six of the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> identified.|$|E

5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects {{had to be}} cut back or altered {{due to lack of}} money. The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> shelved due to lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|Not {{including}} the attacker, nine {{people were killed}} and six others were seriously wounded in the attack. Seven of the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> Americans working for the CIA.

5|$|On 15 April 1986, the US {{launched}} bombing raids from British bases against Tripoli and Benghazi, killing around 100, {{in retaliation}} for the bombing of a Berlin nightclub used by US service personnel.

5|$|Owing to the Allied withdrawal, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of their dead had to be left on the battlefield. Here they were buried in simple field graves (some little more than their own slit trenches) or in small mass graves dug by the Germans. Kate Ter Horst, whose house was used as a first aid post during the battle, found the graves of 57 men in her garden when she returned after the war. After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead. A small field north of Oosterbeek was offered on perpetual loan by the Netherlands government to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) in June 1945 and the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> reburied there. Many of those killed during Arnhem's liberation were also buried at the same site. The cemetery was completed in February 1946, originally with the graves marked by metal crosses, although these were replaced by headstones in 1952. Most of the German <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem after the battle, but reburied in Ysselsteyn German war cemetery after the war.|$|E
5|$|Six of the <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> {{not wearing}} seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely {{would not have}} saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits {{the fact that his}} son, Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been thrown to the floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Memorial stands upon {{a raised}} mound ringed by five boxwoods within the {{original}} section of Indian Mound Cemetery, {{not far from}} the cemetery's entrance. Several family interment plots surround the memorial and its circular raised lawn.
