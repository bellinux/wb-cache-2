5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host tree and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, the Spanish Crown reorganised {{the area}} of Honduras into the Provincia de Higueras e Cabo de Honduras ("Province of Higueras and Cape of Honduras"). The western portion, from the Golfo Dulce, now in Guatemala, to the Ulúa valley and Naco, was defined as Higueras; the eastern portion was Honduras, {{including}} Trujillo, the Valley of Olancho, and extending as far as Cape Camarón. Although organised as two territories, <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> comprised one province, {{often referred to as}} Honduras-Higueras. In 1534, Honduras-Higueras was removed from the jurisdiction of New Spain, where it had been since the late 1520s, and returned to that of the audiencia of Santo Domingo.|$|E

5|$|The Indiana National Guard was federalized during WWI; many {{units were}} sent to Europe. A {{separate}} organization, the Liberty Guard, had been formed in 1910, primarily for social purposes: members marched in parades and at patriotic events. Governor Samuel Ralston had to call out the Liberty Guard in November 1913 to put down a growing workers strike in Indianapolis. By 1920, the state decided to formalize this group, renaming it the Indiana Civil Defense Force and supplying it with equipment and training. In 1941, the unit was named the Indiana Guard Reserve; <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> became a state militia. During World War II, it was again federalized and members were called up by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> {{invisible}} to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E

The rail begins with a diagonal line which intersects the chimera at {{what appears to be the}} creature's shoulder. The horizontal angular geometrical shape is sketched in white and grey in the mid-ground, and represents an early form of a spatial device Bacon was to develop and perfect during the 1950s, when <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> became a cage used to frame the anguished figures portrayed in Bacon's foregrounds.

5|$|The season officially {{began on}} June1, 2005, and lasted until November30, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> persisted into January2006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, a record-tying seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category5 storms were hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, respectively the second costliest and the most intense (by lowest pressure) Atlantic hurricanes on record. This season was also notable because the list of storm names was used up and six Greek letter names had to be used.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth of Australia {{was founded}} on 1 January 1901. On 1 March, 29,010 colonial soldiers, {{consisting}} of 1,544 professional soldiers, 16,105 paid militia and 11,361 unpaid volunteers, were transferred to the new Australian Army. However, the units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts. Major General Sir Edward Hutton, a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces, was appointed as the first commander of the Commonwealth Forces, assuming command in early 1902 with Army Headquarters subsequently formed at Victoria Barracks in Melbourne. The Defence Act 1903 brought all of the state units under one piece of legislation; although more significantly, it prevented the raising of standing infantry units, only allowing the establishment of permanent administrative and instructional staff for headquarters, garrison artillery, fortress engineers, submarine mining engineers, and service, medical and ordnance units. It also stipulated that the force could only be maintained by voluntary enlistment {{and that it could}} not serve outside Australia. In this <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> established the pre-eminence of the Citizen Forces, ensuring that the Australian Army would primarily consist of part-time militia and volunteer forces, which would be supported by a small permanent force limited to filling staff, training and garrison roles. It equally ensured that any force sent overseas could only be done so on a voluntary basis.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a re-appointment as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance. Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E
5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a {{specific}} case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate {{the separation of powers}} in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. §8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that §8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because <b>it</b> <b>effectively</b> directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of §8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E
