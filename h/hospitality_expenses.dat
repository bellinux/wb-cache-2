50|$|Federally, {{the purpose}} is said to improve the role of Parliament and allow Canadians to hold both elected {{officials}} and public sector officials accountable. This is done through three main sections; travel and <b>hospitality</b> <b>expenses,</b> contracts and position reclassification.|$|E
50|$|For instance, {{they have}} to {{disclose}} financial resources within departments such as travel expenses and human resource material, and allow this information to be available on the department websites. This means that the department is more easily monitored by the body in power, as well as citizens. The three things that must be published are the travel and <b>hospitality</b> <b>expenses</b> of specific government officials, contracts over $10,000 and when positions are reclassified.|$|E
50|$|An example within Canada is {{the travel}} and {{hospitality}} reimbursement for government employees. The government {{has provided a}} web page to showcase the travel and <b>hospitality</b> <b>expenses</b> that occurred under the Treasury Board Secretariat by the President, Parliamentary Secretary and their exempt staff and senior level employees, such as deputy ministers and other equal levels. The proactive disclosure of this information is meant to highlight the agreements made under the National Joint Council {{in regards to the}} reimbursement of officials.|$|E

60|$|One {{hundred and}} forty peaceable Indians yet remain in this government. They have, by Christian missionaries, been brought {{over to a}} liking, at least, of our religion; some of them lately left their nation, which is now at war with us, {{because they did not}} choose to join in their depredations; and to show their {{confidence}} in us, and to give us an equal confidence in them, they have brought and put into our hands their wives and children. Others have lived long among us in Northampton county, and most of their children have been born there. These are all now trembling for their lives. They have been hurried from place to place for safety, now concealed in corners, then sent out of the province, refused a passage through a neighbouring colony, and returned, not unkindly, perhaps, but disgracefully, on our hands. Oh Pennsylvania! Once renowned for kindness to strangers, shall the clamours of a few mean niggards about the expense of this public <b>hospitality,</b> an <b>expense</b> that will not cost the noisy wretches sixpence a piece (and what is the expense of the poor maintenance we afford them, compared to the expense they might occasion if in arms against us?), shall so senseless a clamour, I say, force you to turn out of your own doors these unhappy guests, who have offended their own countryfolks by their affection for you; who, confiding in your goodness, have put themselves under your protection? Those whom you have disarmed to satisfy groundless suspicions, will you leave them exposed to the armed madmen of your country? Unmanly men! who are not ashamed to come with weapons against the unarmed, to use the sword against women, and the bayonet against your children, and who have already given such bloody proofs of their inhumanity and cruelty.|$|R
5000|$|Radwanski {{resigned}} in June 2003, {{less than half}} way into his seven-year term, while under attack by a parliamentary committee for lavish spending. An investigation by the parliamentary committee charged that he racked up $500,000 in travel and <b>hospitality</b> <b>expenses</b> and misled the Canadian House of Commons over lax spending practices in his office. The committee also accused Radwanski of falsifying a document sent to it. On November 6, 2003, Radwanski apologized to Parliament [...] "without reservation" [...] for showing lack of respect, and expressed remorse for [...] "errors in judgment with regard to administrative and financial matters" [...] during his tenure. MPs later voted unanimously to find him in contempt of Parliament for providing misleading information about his spending.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1906, {{with his}} cousin Nolinikanta Kar, Atul had been frequenting Jatindranath Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) who was their {{neighbour}} in Kushtia Sub-division. They both entered the local Anushilan Samiti. W. Sealy in his Report will note [...] "Atul Ghosh and Nolini Kanta Kar, two dangerous and important absconders of the gun-running conspiracy." [...] (p23). At Kolkata, thanks to Jatin, they both {{came very close}} to Sri Aurobindo. Whereas Nolini practised wrestling with Kikkar Singh, Atul became an expert trainer in self-defence at the Pataldanga branch of the Anushilan Samiti: Atul Krishna Ghosh & Jatindranath Mukherjee founded PATHURIAGHATA BYAM SAMITY which was an important centre of armed revolution of Indian National Movement. Here he came across a number of revolutionaries, including Sachin Sanyal’s Benares group and Biren Datta Gupta whom he recommended to Jatindranath. Biren received from the latter, in January 1910, the mandate to assassinate Samsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was man-handling the under-trial prisoners of the Alipore Bomb case. In connection with Biren’s successful mission, Jatindranath with forty-six associates were placed on trial in the Howrah conspiracy case. Inside the prison, Jatindranath learnt from his emissaries abroad that Germany was preparing for war against Great Britain. After his release in 1911, Jatindranath suspended all extremist activities, left Kolkata under the responsibility of Atul, himself forging a grand federation of regional units in the districts. A relentless organiser, Atul sheltered revolutionaries from various units as much in his parents’ house at Jaduboyra, [...] as at the Kolkata residence of Meghamala and K.P. Basu, at 11 Mahendra Gossain’s Lane, where there was a free dormitory with homely meals. Even leaders of rival parties like Pratul Ganguli of Dhaka admit having enjoyed this <b>hospitality,</b> at great <b>expense</b> and risk on Atul’s side: [...] "We became great friends with Atulkrishna and had confidence in him. I have very often been to his Darjipara residence and spent nights there. He had grown intimate with several of our members, almost close friends. We considered him to be, somewhat, our own colleague and he sincerely hoped to unite our parties so that we could all work together. Frankly speaking, it was thanks to his wish that I met Jatin Mukherjee…". Disappointed by the duplicity of the Dhaka branch, [...] "some of its important workers, however, like Sachin Sanyal and Nagen (Girija) Datta, severed their connection with it and, introduced by Atulkrishna, worked with Rasbehari Bose in Upper India." [...] Atul’s elder brother Aghorenath, a civil surgeon, often looked after the bullet wounds received by the patriots.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a system {{dynamics}} (SD) model for studying the ‎interconnections among human being weight, eating habit, exercise, body fat, take-in medication, drugs-uses, and the health problems in general. Due to the fact that all of these factors have direct and indirect impacts on the expenses that insurance company have to pay this author is proposing a systems thinking approach for determining the interconnections among the factors and uses the concept of system dynamics to simulate and determine the behavior of the system. To do so, key points about systems thinking, related theories, and system dynamics are reviewed. A model presenting the interconnections between weight factor ‎and health problems are developed and discussed. Expense rates are classified into operational expenses (OE), treatment expenses (TE), Medication expenses (ME), <b>Hospitality</b> <b>expenses</b> (HE), and Drug treatment expenses (DE). This article makes a significant contribution to the health ‎study issues due to the fact that it shows how a factor such as weight can have ‎impacts on hearth attack, blood pressure, and blood sugar, to mention a few, and how relate all these to the overall expenses that an insurance company have to pay at last...|$|E
