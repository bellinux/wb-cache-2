This paper presents a whole new design of concept for on-board geo-data management system in future intelligent earth observing satellite system. The concept design is based on the idea of using satellite imagery, supported by geo-data database associated with attributes and DEM database, as data sources to describe the real world of AOI, where the users specifically query through uplink to satellite from ground. The query results will directly be downlinked to users with a form of geo-image-map. Thus, the new data model, data structure and database management system has to be designed and developed for this purpose.

We combine insights {{from the literature}} on economic geography and spatial interdependence in foreign direct investment (FDI) activity, to provide a comparative analysis using both sectoral regression results and maps that illustrate patterns in the data. We use a unique sample of publicly traded U. S. firms who announced expansion of operations into China between 1980 and 2005.

This model provides a natural index of social interactions which can compare the degree of social interaction across crimes, across geographic 1 units and across time. Our index gives similar results for different data samples and suggests that the amount of social interactions are highest in petty crimes (such as larceny and auto theft), moderate in more serious crimes (assault, burglary and robbery) and almost negligible in murder and rape. The index of social interactions is also applied to non-criminal choices and we find that there is substantial interaction in schooling choice. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} relative importance of firm-specific and geographic characteristics for export behavior in the Chilean primary and processed food industries. The first essay develops a new method for measuring geographic characteristics to account for economic activity in adjacent, but separate spatial units. In the application to the Chilean manufacturing industry, the proposed index better identifies the presence of locational forces (e. g., technological spillovers or natural advantages) than do traditional indexes. Results suggest a higher geographic concentration of Chilean manufacturing firms through technological spillovers in highly populated areas, and access to natural resources in areas that are farther from large cities. The second essay analyzes the determinants of Chilean farms’ decision to produce exportables, i. e., export participation. An export behavior model is estimated using farm-level data from the Chilean Census of Agriculture and a two-stage conditional maximum likelihood procedure. Results show that a farm’s efficiency or productivity is more important than its location for its export participation. When a high-productivity farm locates in a region with better geographic characteristics, its likelihood of producing for export markets is higher. On the other hand, an opposite result is obtained when a low-productivity farm locates in regions with better <b>geographic</b> <b>attributes.</b> The latter suggests that farms must achieve a minimum level of efficiency for geographic characteristics to positively affect their export participation. The third essay investigates firms’ decision to export as well as that on how much to export (intensity) in the Chilean processed food industries. Results show {{the relative importance}} of sunk costs, foreign ownership and firm size in the Chilean firms’ export decision. Productivity and geography play a more prominent role in firms’ export-intensity decision in selected industries. In general, firm-specific characteristics appear to be more important than <b>geographic</b> <b>attributes</b> for export behavior. The three essays contribute {{to a better understanding of}} firms’ export behavior, in particular those in the Chilean agriculture and processed food industries. By providing insights into factors affecting export behavior, these three essays have implications for public policies to encourage firms’ participation in global markets...|$|R

By analyz-ing the news feeds, {{we want to find}} out which topics are important in different countries and what is the general polarity of the articles within these topics. To assess the polarity of a news article, automatic techniques for polarity analysis are employed and the results are represented using Literature Fingerprinting for visualization. In the spatial description of the news feeds, every article can be represented by two <b>geographic</b> <b>attributes,</b> the news origin and the location of the event itself. In order to assess these spatial properties of news articles, we conducted our geo-analysis, which is able to cope with the size and spatial distribution of the data. Within this application framework, we show opportunities how real-time news feed data can be analyzed efficiently. ...|$|R
40|$|Efforts to {{estimate}} the effects of international trade on a country's real income have been hampered by the failure {{to account for the}} endogeneity of trade. Frankel and Romer recently use a country's <b>geographic</b> <b>attributes</b> - notably its distance from potential trading partners - as an instrument to identify the effects of trade on income in 1985. Using data from the pre- World War I, the interwar, and the post-war periods, this paper finds that the Frankel-Romer result is robust to different time periods, i. e., that instrumenting for trade with geographic characteristics raises the estimated positive effect of trade on income by a substantial margin and, in most of our cases, the precision of those estimates. These results suggest that the downward bias of OLS estimates is systematic and may be due to measurement error, a potential source of which is that trade is an imperfect proxy for a host of economically beneficial interactions between countries. However, the results are not robust to the inclusion of another geographic variable, latitude (distance from the equator). ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for emerging methods Machine Learning and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) {{to be applied to}} transport modelling at the origin-destination (OD) level.

This makes their analysis an interesting geocomputational challenge, seldom tackled by geographers. The application of Machine Learning and DAG methods, developed in other fields, to this geographical data holds great potential to improve the ability to infer causality in mode split from OD data. However, there are also pitfalls to using these methods which can be black boxes, even if the code is open source, if the analyst does not understand what they are doing with the data. Based on the work we discuss ways to ensure new methods in the field are used wisely and set-out next steps for our own research...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{a population that}} is cross-classified with respect to demographic and <b>geographic</b> <b>attributes</b> is considered. A census is conducted in which individuals are “captured” with probabilities that {{are believed to be}} relatively constant within demographic categories. The census is followed by a random sample in which individuals are “recaptured” independently of the census. Using the two counts, capture-recapture estimates of the demographic category populations are obtained. A synthetic estimate of population size for a geographic entity is obtained by summing the corresponding adjustment factors (capture-recapture estimates divided by census counts) across all individuals captured by the census in the entity. The use of generalized raking is considered as a method for smoothing adjustment factors. It is found that generalized raking differs little from a class of weighted least squares regression models. This suggests that generalized raking does not offer an improvement over regression for smoothing adjustment factors. The efficiency loss of generalized raking relative to the best regression-based procedures can be substantial. raking, smoothing, regression, census adjustment, synthetic estimation, post-stratification,...|$|R

Analyses were conducted using morphological distance matrices reflecting dental and mandibular form for the same 292 individuals across 21 archaeological popula-tions. Thereafter, statistical analyses were undertaken on four sample aggregates defined on the basis of their subsistence strategy, geography, and chronology to test for potential differences in dental and mandibular form across and within groups. Results show a clear separation based on mandibular morphology between European hunter-gatherers, Europe-an farmers, and Near Eastern transitional farmers and semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers. In contrast, the dental dimensions show no such pattern and no clear association between the position of samples and their temporal or <b>geographic</b> <b>attributes.</b> Although later farmin...|$|R
