The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners, Ron Hire and John Coletta, and the three of them founded Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises.|$|E

There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E

5|$|Born in Enfield, London, Morison joined Northampton Town {{as part of}} the club's youth system after a {{successful}} trial period with the club, having also spent time on trial at Leicester City. When Morison turned 18, he signed a two-year professional contract with Northampton. He impressed manager Kevan Broadhurst and subsequently made his debut {{at the end of the}} 2001–02 season in a 2–2 draw against Cambridge United. The following season, Morison featured regularly as a substitute, playing a total of 15 games, scoring his first goal for the Northamptonshire side in a 2–2 draw against Plymouth Argyle. However, the 2003–04 season witnessed Morison feature in only 5 games, <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> the scoresheet once. In June 2004, he was offered a new six-month contract at the club, and told by manager Colin Calderwood that he had to prove his worth at the club.|$|E

5|$|In 1938 {{he played}} eight games for England, {{starting}} with defeat to a Scotland team containing a young Bill Shankly. He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with Münzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the Führer when his motorcade drove past a café the England team were dining in. The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team {{that they had}} to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6–3 with Matthews himself <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> the scoreboard having got the better of Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4–2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England's 3–0 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4–0 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7–0 win over Ireland at Old Trafford.|$|E

5|$|In April 1982, Mandela was {{transferred}} to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they {{believed that they were}} being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. <b>Getting</b> <b>on</b> well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was never}} in {{contention}} during the game, as Michigan's offense was shut {{out in the first}} half, while Wisconsin's offense dominated Michigan's defense and jumped out to a 24–0 halftime lead. Wisconsin's only score of the first quarter was a 1-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball. In the second quarter, they added to their lead with a 25-yard field goal by Philip Welch, a 27-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball, and a 61-yard run by James White.

Wisconsin responded with a 23-yard run by James White. Michigan replied with an 11-yard run by Denard Robinson. The Badgers added to their lead on the opening play of the fourth quarter with a 3-yard run by Montee Ball. Wisconsin then more added points with a 40-yard field goal. Michigan's only score of the quarter was a 28-yard catch by Roy Roundtree. Wisconsin sealed its win with a 4-yard run by Montee Ball.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March Feyenoord played Ajax at home, {{where they}} lost 1-2 despite taking a first-half lead. On 3 March, the club {{announced}} Fred Rutten would succeed Ronald Koeman as manager per 1 July 2014 for the 2014–15 season. Feyenoord played FC Groningen away the following Sunday.

50|$|In Arkansas, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that part of AR-51 will become part of US-270. On I-30's current concurrency with US-270, going east, drivers can take exit 99 and make a right on US-270 East. If drivers make a left when they take exit 99, they must make a left to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> I-30 West/US-270 West because there is currently no outlet past that. That road has been proposed to be extended to AR-51. This will form the future northern terminus of AR-51. This means that drivers can make a left to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> AR-51 South {{and will have to}} make a right to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> US-270 West. Then, US-270 will meet the current US-270. Drivers can make a left to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the future US-270 Business East and must make a right to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> US-270 West, just like AR-51 did. From east to west, the future US-270 will go through the cities of Rockport, Butterfield, and Magnet Cove.|$|R

5|$|The prize, a 24-gun {{corvette}} named Utile, {{was taken}} into service with the Royal Navy as HMS Utile and Lydiard was promoted and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796. Macnamara's later service with Nelson included the capture of Portoferraio, the evacuations of Caprera and Corsica, and expeditions against Piombino and Castiglione. Macnamara had already developed a reputation for intrepidity bordering on recklessness, and he displayed these qualities again in {{an attack on the}} 18-gun Spanish brig Corso in a strong gale under enemy shore batteries. The first attempt to capture her failed, with only one man, the coxswain, <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> board. Macnamara tried again, managing to place 30 men aboard the Spanish ship, at which she surrendered. Having done so the weather prevented any further attempt to make contact with the prize. One of Macnamara's last acts in support of the Mediterranean Fleet was {{to take part in the}} Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, in which Southampton formed part of the centre of the line as a repeating frigate.|$|E
5|$|Kate tells Erin about Rhys' plan, but he convinces Erin that Kate is {{a jealous}} ex-girlfriend who is lying. Erin {{believes}} {{him and they}} have dinner together. Rhys pours wine on her shirt sleeve and at the hospital, he implies to Karl that Erin has a drinking problem. She quits the surgical program and Rhys asks Jessica if he can take her place. Karl realises he has been used and Rhys takes him to visit Elaine, {{to try to make}} him understand what <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> the program means to him. Elaine reveals she has spinal degeneration and Karl remarks that Rhys cannot help her. Rhys explains that he wants to help the next person to develop the condition. Rhys sits an exam on the material he has missed and Jessica allows him join the surgical program. Rhys makes a bet with Kate that he can seduce Jade, but when he goes to kiss her, Jade rejects him. Rhys' mother asks if she can visit him and Rhys tells her he is working over Easter. When they run into Jade and Kyle, Rhys does not introduce them to Elaine and she accuses him of being ashamed of her. Rhys then takes Elaine to meet Martin, who reveals he failed his surgical program interview. Elaine accuses him of lying to her and being like his father. Rhys denies this and Elaine tells him to fix things with the people he has hurt.|$|E
5|$|The Cimarron Turnpike, {{carrying}} US-412, {{passes through}} Noble, Payne, and Pawnee Counties. The highway heads east from I-35 {{to its first}} interchange, Exit 3, which provides access to US-77. The first mainline toll plaza is just west of Exit 15, a cloverleaf interchange with no straight-line ramps (forcing all traffic <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> or off {{to pass through the}} toll plaza) connecting the turnpike to US-177. East of the US-177 interchange, the highway curves to the south, crossing Black Bear Creek. US-412 then meets US-64 once again, interchanging with it at Exit 23 east of Morrison. The turnpike then turns back east, with a spur route (accessible only from the westbound turnpike) branching off to the southwest toward Stillwater. The Lone Chimney service plaza, a twenty-four-hour concession area, is located in the median of the turnpike east of the interchange with the spur. South of Pawnee lies an interchange (Exit 37) with SH-18. Just south of Hallett, a second mainline toll plaza sits just west of the SH-99 interchange; again, this interchange is a cloverleaf interchange with only loop ramps. The turnpike's final exit is Exit 60, a partial interchange with SH-48 southeast of Cleveland. The missing movements are provided by US-64, the northern terminus of SH-48, which merges with US-412 as the Cimarron Turnpike ends. The two routes continue east as a freeway.|$|E
