5|$|Following the Polish campaign, Hitler {{approved}} {{the expansion of}} the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned invasion of France and the Low Countries, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the SS-Verfügungs-Division (later given the name Reich and then Das Reich) commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser; the SS-Division-Totenkopf commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, SS-Gruppenführer Theodor Eicke; and the Polizei-Division, commanded by SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch.

5|$|François de Vergy, {{a member}} of the House of Vergy, had been {{informed}} of this attack by the townspeople, and he arrived in Besançon at dawn.

After several <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> gunfire, the battle moved to the high street where the Protestants were armed with two pieces of artillery near the Battant. Two hours after the battle moved to the high street, de Vergy led a group of monks and priests to the battle, equipped with three cannons. The first two cannons did not fire, which caused doubt in the Catholic ranks, despite having over 300 men, many more than the Protestant forces. However, the third cannon fired, successfully causing panic among the Protestants. The Protestants continued their fight regardless, using cannons, firearms, and knives in an attempt to stop the Catholic forces and Claude de La Baume, their leader. The Protestant leader was severely injured and his horse was hit, causing disorder in the ranks of Huguenot troops, ultimately resulting in them attempting to retreat from the city.|$|E
