5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said it is amazing being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{financial}} backing he had enjoyed {{during his time}} in Formula Ford, Webber and his team struggled to find the money to fund their 1997 championship campaign. He was almost forced to quit halfway through the season, but was able to obtain significant financial and personal support from Australian rugby union legend David Campese, which helped him to complete the year. Mark has since stated <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pay back the money Campese gave him.|$|E

25|$|Historian Lawrence E. Babits has {{demonstrated}} that Morgan's official report of 73 casualties appears to have only included his Continental troops. From surviving records, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> identify by name 128 Colonial soldiers who were either killed or wounded at Cowpens. He also presents an entry in the North Carolina State Records that shows 68 Continental and 80 Militia casualties. It would appear that both the number of Morgan's casualties and the total strength of his force were about double what he officially reported.|$|E
500|$|... {{the latest}} update was version 0.43.05, with it {{completing}} 14 years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams {{and his brother}} have a to-do list of features the game should have before version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. He says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> maintain focus by shifting his attention to {{different aspects of the}} game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting his own bed. The other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put them {{in the back of his}} mind when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E

2500|$|De Burgh {{has said}} that he is [...] "certainly a believer in Christ" [...] but he has always had a deep {{distrust}} of organized religion. De Burgh believes in the power of spiritual healing as an alternative therapy to reduce pain. He states that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> heal people with his own hands and he gained an all-encompassing strength that was contacted through prayer.|$|E
2500|$|Phil wakes to [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] again, but finds Rita {{is still}} in bed with him, and Punxsutawney covered in a fresh blanket of snow; it is February 3 and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> escape the time loop. As they walk out {{together}} and marvel at the peaceful, beautiful town, Phil comments to Rita that they should live there—but will rent to start.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, he {{was born}} with the toes of that foot fused. An {{operation}} was performed to separate the toes so that he could use them as fingers to grab, turn a page, or perform other functions. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use his foot to operate an electric wheelchair, a computer and a mobile phone. Vujicic attempted suicide but notes that he had an [...] "amazingly normal childhood".|$|E

2500|$|His {{earliest}} {{recognition in}} the Dominican Republic came from Rafael Díaz Niese, {{on the occasion of}} a show of self-portraits in 1943 at the Galería Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santo Domingo. Díaz Niese’s essay established Canepa, Darío Suro and Jaime Colson as the trinity of Dominican artists who led the second generation of high modernism (1930s and 1940s). Of Canepa's now lost 1943 self-portrait, Díaz Niese wrote: [...] An intense inner life animated this small-sized work. All its elements indicated that its author was more than a mere painter, but rather a true artist: The strength of the lines, the realization of the volumes in a perfect succession of planes and the exquisite restraint with which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> shape his youthful expressiveness while using a rather cool tonality – all of this makes it plain that the author possesses an exceptional artistic temperament.|$|E
2500|$|Forrest is {{very quick}} {{and also has}} very good ball control and {{dribbling}} skills. This gives him the capability of beating his man and going down the wing, or coming inside and beating several players. His then manager, Neil Lennon, has said how over his first few seasons at Celtic <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> extend the distance of his [...] "explosive runs" [...] from 15 or 20 yards up to 30 or 40 yards. Forrest {{is also a very}} good finisher and, although predominantly right footed, also capable with his left. Forrest has great fitness levels and is generally able to keep playing at a very high intensity throughout the whole of a match. He {{has been described as a}} very enthusiastic player who has an incredible hunger and desire for the game and shows great bravery and vision in his play. Former Rangers winger, and Scotland under-21 teammate, Gregg Wylde described him as being the kind of player who never hides from his responsibility during a match.|$|E
2500|$|Hutton {{responded to}} these criticisms in a 2010 paper {{entitled}} [...] "Writing the History of Witchcraft: A Personal View", published in [...] Hutton {{was critical of}} Whitmore's work, characterising it {{as an attempt to}} [...] "destroy my reputation as an authority upon the history of Paganism and witchcraft, at least among Pagans, and especially belief in the arguments of Triumph." [...] Noting that Whitmore [...] "makes no attempt to construct an alternate history" [...] to that presented in Triumph, Hutton accuses Whitmore of carrying out [...] "very little research" [...] into primary source material, instead basing his arguments on [...] "secondary texts of varying quality". Contesting some of Whitmore's claims, Hutton then criticises Whitmore's final chapter, which he calls a [...] "meanspirited" [...] collection of [...] "every criticism that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find of anything that I have written." [...] He went on to challenge Whitmore on this, asking why his work in Triumph of the Moon had not been criticised by [...] "leading figures of British and American Paganism" [...] and by [...] "professional historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, classicists, and literary experts" [...] if it had been as flawed as Whitmore claims.|$|E

2500|$|Writing in Melody Maker, Michael Watts {{described}} Living in the Material World as [...] "Harrison's personal statement" [...] documenting {{his journey}} towards [...] "a spiritual goal {{which for the}} first time <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> define". Watts continued: [...] "now he stands as something more than an entertainer. Now he's being honest. When you've been through all the bullshit and come out the other side, that's {{the only thing you can}} be." [...] In his review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden praised the album's [...] "inspirationally, opulently, romantic" [...] qualities, and he wrote of [...] "That Is All" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round" [...] as [...] "two devotional prayers whose solemn mantra-influenced melodies are barely able to sustain their lush orchestration. Yet they do, so that at the end we are left suspended in ethereality..." [...] Holden added that [...] "a close listening from start to finish is roughly equivalent to participating in a mass spectacle of religious re-dedication – one that does not end with rousing anthems but in heavenly choirs." [...] Some reviewers objected to the preponderance of ballads on the album, however, as well as the overt religiosity of many of its songs.|$|E

50|$|He {{was a very}} eloquent speaker. He {{supported}} Horace Plunkett's {{efforts to}} establish agricultural co-operatives by addressing local meetings, but died of heart disease before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to attend more than three or four.|$|R

60|$|He {{will also}} run {{back on his}} own track, and employ many other means of the kind to deceive the dogs, showing most {{conclusively}} that he understands the theory of scent, and the dogs' power of perceiving it; and also that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> devise the very best plans to elude his pursuers.|$|E
