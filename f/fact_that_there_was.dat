5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to one corner of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|In August and October1955, NY344 and the Taconic State Park {{south of}} the road was {{inundated}} with floods damaging the blacktop surface highway. The reconstruction of NY344 was the center point of debate came in late February1956, where Paul Winslow, the executive secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission, who felt it was unimportant if the road was rebuilt. Local officials {{in the town of}} Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956USD) to reconstruct the road. In April1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield that the road was barricaded in Copake Falls for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no residences {{and the fact that the}} Massachusetts side was wiped out by the flooding. In November1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY344 was nearly complete by March1957.|$|E

5|$|The Gardens are {{believed}} to have opened just before the Restoration of 1660, on property formerly owned by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow, in 1615. Whereas John Nichols in his History of Lambeth Parish conjectures that she was the widow of Guy Fawkes, executed in 1606, John Timbs in his 1867 Curiosities of London states for a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one Falkes de Breaut√©, a mercenary working for King John who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner. Perhaps the earliest record is Samuel Pepys' description of a visit he made to the New Spring Gardens on 29 May 1662. The then name distinguished the gardens from the Old Spring Gardens at Charing Cross; however Pepys implies that there were both Old and New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall; and indeed Spring Gardens {{appears to have been a}} longstanding appellation for a variety of entertainment enterprises.|$|E

25|$|With {{the fall}} of Rangoon, a British {{evacuation}} of Burma became inevitable. Supplies could not be moved to maintain fighting forces in Burma on a large scale, since the ground communications were dreadful, sea communications risky in the extreme (along with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only one other port of any size in Burma besides Rangoon) and air communications {{out of the question}} due to lack of transport aircraft.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Northampton {{had become}} a major centre of {{footwear}} and leather manufacture. In 1801, the population was 7,020; it more than doubled to 15,351 in 1831, attributed to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> great demand for footwear caused by the Napoleonic Wars of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A third of the adult males alone were shoemakers at the time. Northampton grew beyond the old town walls and industry grew rapidly with the mechanisation of factories {{by the middle of the}} 19th century.|$|E

In front of a sold-out crowd, the Kangaroos won the test-match with another eight point victory. There was no tournament this year due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a World Cup next year for the teams to prepare for.|$|E

25|$|The Cappella Maggiore derived its name, the Greater Chapel, {{from the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> another chapel also in {{use by the}} Pope and his retinue for daily worship.

25|$|The Chinese dominions {{stretched}} {{into the heart}} of Central Asia and included the Khanate of Kokand, which paid tribute to Beijing. Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang did not become provinces of the Chinese empire, but rather were directly administered by the Qing dynasty. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no provincial governor meant that the local rulers retained most of their powers and this special status also prevented emigration from the rest of China into the region. Persia also began to expand north, especially under the rule of Nadir Shah, who extended Persian dominion well past the Oxus. After his death, however, the Persian empire rapidly crumbled.|$|E
25|$|The Wrythe {{lies between}} Carshalton village {{to the south}} and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word rithe which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a small spring was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, just a couple of miles away, and a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The spring has since disappeared under ground and the culvert it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s City {{struggled}} with the costs of being a Football League club and were forced to sell some of their best players, such as Harold Blackmore and Dick Pym. The latter's ¬£5,000 transfer fee allowed City to purchase St James Park. Youngster Cliff Bastin was also sold to Arsenal, where he would later become their top goalscorer and play for England, after just 17 games for the Grecians. City played in the Third Division South for 18 seasons, until the 1939‚Äì40 season was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. City achieved their highest ever league position in this period, finishing runners-up in 1933, but the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only one promotion place at the time meant the club remained in the division. Fred Whitlow scored 33 goals that season.|$|E
25|$|As {{the use of}} {{the long}} drum began to spread across Europe, many composers and musicians started looking for even deeper tones {{that could be used in}} compositions. As a result of this demand, a narrow-shelled, {{single-headed}} drum called the gong drum was introduced in Britain during the 19th century. This drum, which was 70-100 centimeters in diameter and deep-shelled, was similar to the long drum in both size and construction. When struck, the gong drum produced a deep sound with a rich resonance. However, the immense size of the drum, coupled with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not a second head to help balance the sound, meant that gong drums tended to produce a sound with a definite pitch. As a result, they fell out of favor with many composers, as it became nearly impossible to incorporate them in an orchestra in any meaningful way.|$|E

25|$|Although Gallovidians clearly {{took part}} in David's campaigning, there is no {{specific}} evidence connecting Fergus to the operations until after operations ceased. It is possible that Fergus' attestation of 1136 could have had bearing on Gallovidian participation in the king's campaigning. If Fergus' wife was indeed a bastard of Henry I, Fergus himself had {{a stake in the}} unfolding English succession crisis, as she would have been a half-sister of Stephen's opponent, Matilda, whom Henry I had nominated as his royal successor. Explicit confirmation of Fergus' involvement may exist in the terms of the subsequent peace treaty, as Richard Hexham recorded that one of the hostages that was handed over to the English for surety was the son of an earl named Fergus. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no Scottish earl of that name suggests that, unless Richard Hexham was mistaken, it was Fergus himself who was referred to. Whatever the case, after this date there is no further evidence of Fergus' involvement in Anglo-Scottish affairs.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} other dominions, the Irish Free State had a status of {{association}} with the UK rather than being completely legally independent from it. However the meaning of 'Dominion status' changed radically during the 1920s, starting with the Chanak crisis in 1922 and quickly followed by the directly negotiated Halibut Treaty of 1923. A reform of the King's title following an Imperial Conference decision and given effect by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, changed the King's royal title so that it took account of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no longer a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The King adopted the following style by which he would be known {{in all of his}} Empire: By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India. That was the King's title in Ireland just as elsewhere in his Empire.|$|E
25|$|The NEP is also criticised for {{not dealing}} {{directly}} {{with issues of}} wealth distribution and economic inequality; {{that it no longer}} helps the poor but is instead an institutionalised system of handouts for the largest ethnic community in Malaysia as the NEP does not discriminate based on economic class. Bumiputras of high and low economic standing are entitled to the same benefits. The statistical problems of categorising wealthy and disadvantaged Bumiputras in one group also meant that the NEP's goal of having 30% of the national wealth held by Bumiputras was not indicative of a median 60% of Bumiputras holding 28% of the national wealth, but could theoretically translate into one Bumiputra holding 29% of the national wealth, with the remaining Bumiputras sharing 1%. Some have alleged that because of this imbalance, some Malays remain economically marginalised. Criticisms also arose from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no planned assistance for Malaysian Chinese and Indian communities to achieve their 40% goal during the actual implementation of the NEP.|$|E
