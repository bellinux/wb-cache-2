25|$|The pubic {{symphysis}} widens slightly {{when the}} legs are stretched far apart. In sports where these movements are often performed, {{the risk of}} a pubic symphysis blockage is high, in which case, after completion of the movement, the bones at the symphysis do not realign correctly and can <b>get</b> <b>jammed</b> in a dislocated position. The resulting pain can be severe, especially when further strain is put upon the affected joint. In most cases, the joint can only be successfully reduced into its normal position by a trained medical professional.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{and parking}} {{are the most}} serious issues for the areas in the urban areas, as the borough struggles {{to keep up with}} the demand but also keep areas such as Tlalpan Centro at least {{somewhat}} provincial. Parking problems are greatest in Ajusco Medio, Padiernoa, Pedregales and Colonia Miguel Hidalgo. Traffic problems are worst in Tlalpan center where the narrow streets <b>get</b> <b>jammed</b> by the vehicles of both residents and visitors, especially around the main plaza. The increasing popularity of this area with visitors makes the situation worse on weekends. In the urban areas, problems are similar to that in other parts of Mexico City and include carjacking, illegal firearms, muggings, graffiti, deterioration of infrastructure. Most crime is reported in the Villa Coapa with Tlalpan center coming in second.|$|E

6000|$|The longed-for hour came at last. The cabin tables {{having been}} removed, {{and rows of}} seats {{placed in front of}} the stage, the men were {{admitted}} from the deck, to which they had been expelled an hour previous in order not to impede preliminary arrangements. There was great joking, of course, as they took their seats and criticised the fittings up. David Mizzle was of opinion that the foot-lights [...] "wos oncommon grand", which was an unquestionable fact, for they consisted of six tin lamps filled with seal-oil, from the wicks of which rose a compound of yellow flame and smoke that had a singularly luminous effect. Amos Parr guessed that the curtain would be certain sure to <b>get</b> <b>jammed</b> at the first haul, and several of the others were convinced that O'Riley would stick his part in one way or another. However, an end was put to all remarks, and expectation raised on tiptoe by the ringing of a small hand-bell, and immediately thereafter a violent pulling at the curtain which concealed the stage; but the curtain remained immovable (they always do on such occasions), and a loud whispering was heard behind the scenes.|$|E

50|$|In {{materials}} science, fragile {{matter is}} a granular {{material that is}} jammed solid.

The jamming thus described can be unjammed by mechanical means, such as tapping or shaking the container, or poking it with a stick.|$|R

As soot is carcinogenic, and as the boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed, they were prone to Chimney Sweeps Cancer. From 1775 onwards there was increasing concern {{for the welfare of}} the boys, and Acts of Parliament were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage.

50|$|In 1890, {{while the}} city's streetcars {{switched}} to electric and mechanical power, the Metropolitan experimented with batteries but found them unsatisfactory. On August 2, 1894, Congress ordered the Metropolitan {{to switch to}} underground electrical power. It complied, installing the underground sliding shoe on the north-south line in January 1895. It was the first successful installation of such a system in the Western Hemisphere (having previously been installed in Budapest, Hungary). Though mostly a success, the underground power conduits had drawbacks. In the winter, the plow would <b>get</b> <b>jammed</b> by snow and ice and in the summer the conduits swelled shut.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{required}} that the documents or objects being scanned {{make contact with the}} document camera, therefore increasing flexibility of the types of documents which are able to be scanned.

Other objects include books, magazines, receipts, letters, tickets etc. No moving parts can also remove the need for maintenance, a consideration in the Total cost of ownership, which includes the continuing operational costs of scanners.|$|E
