25|$|Upon her release, Bradley confesses his {{feelings}} for Stacey and they reconcile. Then Stacey discovers she is 3 months pregnant, so Bradley {{could not be}} the father. She tells Bradley that Archie raped her and must be the father. Archie is murdered that night by an unknown assailant. Stacey and Bradley agree to pretend the baby <b>is</b> <b>theirs,</b> and remarry on 18 February 2010. A jealous Becca reveals the rape to Archie's daughter Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), who tells Stacey that Archie was infertile. Becca informs the police that Bradley had a motive to kill Archie. He and Stacey attempt to flee Walford, but Bradley is caught {{by the police and}} falls to his death while trying to escape. A distraught Stacey confesses to Max that she killed Archie while her world falls apart.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{guarding}} behaviour {{in males}} {{is much more}} likely to be elicited by the threat of sexual infidelity in a female partner, in comparison to emotional involvement outside the mateship. This is primarily due to the risk female infidelity poses for male paternity, or 'genetic cuckoldry'. In other words, as fertilisation takes place within females, males do not have paternal certainty in the way that females do (females can always be certain that the offspring <b>is</b> <b>theirs,</b> whilst a male cannot). There is supporting evidence for this cross-culturally in a varied range of countries such as China, Germany, Japan and Sweden. Moreover, in physiological tests such as skin conductance and heart rate, men show greater levels of distress when asked to imagine a partner having sexual intercourse with another person. It is also worth noting that mate guarding tactics are more likely to be used if the partner is of high reproductive value e.g. if the female displays signs of high fertility such as youth and physical attractiveness.|$|E

[...] The track's lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, [...] "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating.

This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre.

In the mid-1970s land was cleared south of Hidden Lake for the construction of Shoreview High School. Funding failed and the school was never built. The cleared and terraced site has become infested with invasive species such as Scotch broom and Himalayan blackberry. In 1977 King County purchased the land from the Shoreline School District and established Shoreview Park. The City of Shoreline assumed ownership of Shoreview Park and adjoining Boeing Creek Park in 1997. Trails in these parks allow access to the middle portion of Boeing Creek. A few trails are official and maintained, including one that runs along the creek to Hidden Lake. There are a large number of [...] "social trails" [...] as well, which often climb steep, unstable slopes, increasing erosion and overall stream degradation.
