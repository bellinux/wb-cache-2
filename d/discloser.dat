60|$|The {{verses of}} Ghurab {{came on the}} public {{at a moment when}} a comfortable, {{slightly}} quizzical philosophy was certain to be welcome, and their reception was enthusiastic. Elderly colonels, who had outlived the love of truth, wrote to the papers to say that they had been familiar with the works of Ghurab in Afghanistan, and Aden, and other suitable localities {{a quarter of a century}} ago. A Ghurab-of-Karmanshah Club sprang into existence, the members of which alluded to each other as Brother Ghurabians on the slightest provocation. And to the flood of inquiries, criticisms, and requests for information, which naturally poured in on the discoverer, or rather the <b>discloser,</b> of this long-hidden poet, the Rev. Wilfrid made one effectual reply: Military considerations forbade any disclosures which might throw unnecessary light on his nephew’s movements.|$|E
60|$|Directly on {{the first}} perusal, almost {{on the first}} {{deliberate}} inspection, {{it became apparent that}} here a quite new Branch of Philosophy, leading to as yet undescried ulterior results, was disclosed; farther, what seemed scarcely less interesting, a quite new human Individuality, an almost unexampled personal character, that, namely, of Professor Teufelsdrockh the <b>Discloser.</b> Of both which novelties, as far as might be possible, we resolved to master the significance. But as man is emphatically a proselytizing creature, no sooner was such mastery even fairly attempted, than the new question arose: How might this acquired good be imparted to others, perhaps in equal need thereof; how could the Philosophy of Clothes, and the Author of such Philosophy, be brought home, in any measure, to the business and bosoms of our own English Nation?

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "grace" [...] period, under which early {{disclosure}} does not prevent the <b>discloser</b> from later filing and obtaining a patent, must be distinguished here from the FTI system. [...] Germany and the UK formerly had a concept of grace period. Both FTI and grace period systems afforded the early <b>discloser</b> protection against later filers. The FTI system allowed non-disclosers to overturn established parties, whereas the grace system only protects early disclosers. The US moved to a grace system on 16 March 2013, which has been termed [...] "first-to-disclose" [...] by some writers.|$|E

5000|$|A {{disclosure}} {{event is}} defined by Chaudoir and Fisher as [...] "the verbal communication that occurs between a <b>discloser</b> and a interaction partner regarding the discloser's possession of a concealable stigmatized identity".

50|$|Social {{media can}} also help those who are lonely. Many social {{networking}} sites give access to profiles, pictures {{and the ability to}} comment and message others which helps people to feel less lonely. It also aids them in gaining social capital like emotional satisfaction and access to information. These sites can facilitate disclosure because they make it easier to access others who can provide social support for someone to disclose personal information. Social support is extremely important in disclosure as it makes the <b>discloser</b> feel validated and cared for. Social support is also positively related to well-being. It has also been shown that having this social support and forming close relationships online decreases loneliness overtime.|$|E
50|$|While {{many with}} low {{self-esteem}} do view social media {{as a safe}} outlet for disclosure, many do not receive positive feedback for their disclosures. People with low self-esteem tend to post more negative thoughts on social media which {{has been shown to}} make them less liked by readers. Negative posts {{are also more likely to}} be ignored by readers in hopes that the <b>discloser</b> will stop and begin to post more positively. When someone who frequently shares negative thoughts posts something positive they do receive more positive feedback from readers. In contrast, someone with high self-esteem is more liked by readers and tends to post more positively. If they do post something negative they tend to get more responses than those with low self-esteem do.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fundamental}} change in social information occurs after disclosing as people and their disclosure interaction partners now share or [...] "co-own" [...] information about the concealable stigma. The disclosure can then dramatically impact subsequent individual behavior, specific interactions between the <b>discloser</b> and confidant, and interactions within the broader social context. For instance, after employees disclosure, they may raise awareness of their identities and, as a consequence, effectively reduce the related stigma throughout the organization. Moreover, the model makes a suggestion {{on the role of}} goals among the three mediation processes. Specifically, in terms of predicting positive outcomes, goals may not play as a significant role in Changes in Social Information as in the other two processes. This is probably because Changes in Social Information result from the objective informational content of the identity whereas the Alleviation of Inhibition and Social Support result from self-regulatory effects of disclosure goals.|$|E

40|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) {{experience}} significant discrimination within American society. As a result of discrimination, MSM are at elevated risk for a number of health problems, such as substance use. MSM do not always <b>disclose</b> sexual identity/behavior to health care providers. Non-disclosure to medical providers can negatively impact health for MSM, such as elevated risk for contracting HIV. Reasons for non-disclosure include fear of provider rejection and perceived provider discomfort with discussing sexuality. The purpose of the present study is to examine factors that influence disclosure to medical providers. Eighty-seven participants were recruited through social media and LGBT-friendly organizations. These participants completed a quasi-experimental study of factors that influence disclosure/non-disclosure. These participants endorsed <b>disclosing</b> to primary care physicians and not <b>disclosing</b> to dentists most frequently. In addition, participants who <b>disclose</b> to providers in general endorsed more reasons to <b>disclose</b> than not to <b>disclose.</b> However, participants who did not <b>disclose</b> in general did not report more reasons to not <b>disclose</b> than to <b>disclose.</b> Across different types of providers, the majority of participants indicated they <b>disclosed</b> due to perceived need for the provider to know sexual orientation/same-sex behavior. These findings provide insight into multiple factors that influence disclosure and non-disclosure to different types of health care providers...|$|R
50|$|According to the theory, human {{interaction}} {{is like an}} economic transaction, in that you may seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs. You will reveal information about yourself when the cost-rewards ratio is acceptable to you. As long as rewards continue to outweigh costs, a couple will become increasingly intimate by sharing more and more personal information. The constructs of this theory include <b>discloser,</b> relational expectations, and perceived rewards or costs in the relationship. Levinger (1965, 1976) discussed marital success as dependent on all the rewarding things within the relationship, such as emotional security and sexual fulfillment. He also argued that marriages either succeed or fail based on the barriers to leave the relationship, like financial hardships, {{and the presence of}} alternative attractions, like infidelity. Levinger stated that marriages will fail when the attractions of the partners lessen, the barriers to leave the spouse are weak, and the alternatives outside of the relationship are appealing.|$|E

5000|$|Computers {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of everyday life, and research has shown that individuals may subconsciously treat interactions with computers as they would treat a social situation. This finding combined with what is known about the self-serving bias in interpersonal relations indicates that consumers that use a computer to buy products will take personal credit for successful purchases but blame the computer for negative purchase experiences. It was also found, however, that consumers are more willing to attribute successful purchases to the computer and not ascribe blame to the computer for failed purchases if they have [...] "intimate self-disclosure" [...] with the computer, which Moon describes as revelation of personal information that makes the <b>discloser</b> feel vulnerable. Another reason is that people are so used to bad functionality, counterintuitive features, bugs, and sudden crashes of most contemporary software applications that they tend not to complain about computer problems. Instead, they believe it is their personal responsibility to predict possible issues and to find solutions to computer problems. This unique phenomenon has been recently observed in several human-computer interaction investigations.|$|E
