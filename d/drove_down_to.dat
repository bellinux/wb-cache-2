5|$|The Giants {{received}} the second-half kickoff and mounted a record-setting drive. The opening drive ran for over nine minutes (a Super Bowl record) and {{culminated in a}} 1-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson, giving the Giants a 17–12 lead. On the first play of the 4th quarter, the Bills' Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard touchdown that put Buffalo back in front, 19–17.

5|$|The game {{kicked off}} in the afternoon; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before, causing a slight delay. The first quarter was scoreless, but Navy scored a {{touchdown}} on the first play of the second quarter. Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive. Near {{the end of the}} second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run, giving them a 147 halftime lead. The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored. Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter. Four plays afterward, Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Navy threw an interception at midfield, and Washington <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Navy 20-yard line before attempting a game-winning field goal. The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|That {{was good}} for {{first place in the}} AFC Central and a trip to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1972. The Browns began their playoff run against the Oakland Raiders on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The game started slowly: each team scored only a {{touchdown}} in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra point because of a bad snap. In the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12–7 on a pair of Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14–12. The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 on the clock, Cleveland had a final shot to win the game. Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds on the clock.|$|E

5|$|The Falcons {{forced the}} Vikings to punt {{on the opening}} drive of the second half, and two long plays by wide {{receiver}} Tim Dwight set up a 27-yard field goal by Morten Andersen, which cut the Falcons' deficit to three points. The Vikings answered the score on their ensuing possession, driving 82 yards in 15 plays to score a touchdown on a five-yard Matthew Hatchette reception, which made the score 27–17 with just over 13 {{minutes left in the}} fourth quarter. The Falcons responded with a 70-yard completion to Tony Martin, which set up a 24-yard field goal by Morten Andersen to make the score 27–20. On the ensuing Vikings drive, Cunningham fumbled a snap and the Falcons recovered the ball on the Vikings' 30-yard line; the Falcons failed to score after an incomplete pass turned the ball over on downs with six minutes left in the game. The Vikings then <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Falcons' 22-yard line, where an incomplete pass on 3rd down set up a field goal attempt by Gary Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the start}} of the second quarter, Appalachian State ran another six plays, ending the drive with a nine-yard {{touchdown}} pass by Edwards to Hans Batichon. The extra point again evened the score, this time at 14–14. Michigan was forced into a three-and-out and had to punt the ball, with Appalachian State starting their next drive at the Michigan 37. On the fifth play of the next drive, the Mountaineers scored a touchdown on a 20-yard pass from Edwards to Jackson. The Mountaineers converted the extra point attempt, giving them the lead at 21–14. Michigan began their next drive at their 20-yard line, and <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Appalachian State 40-yard line in four plays. Their next play, a Brandon Minor run for five yards, was followed by a Minor run for no yards and an incomplete pass. The Wolverines opted to go for it on fourth down but failed to convert, turning the ball over to Appalachian State. The following Mountaineer drive featured nine running plays in a row, the last a six-yard run by Edwards for a touchdown. The extra point was successful, increasing the Mountaineer lead and making the score 28–14. Michigan returned the next kickoff to their 32-yard line, with 2:15 left on the clock. The Wolverines drove to the Appalachian five-yard line, ultimately settling for a field goal with 23seconds left, cutting Appalachian State's lead to eleven points.|$|E

On Saturday, 16 December, Holt rose early and ate a light breakfast. He did some gardening, and made phone calls to Tony Eggleton (his press secretary) and Nicholas (his stepson), inviting the latter down to Portsea. He played tennis in the afternoon, and then {{spent some time with}} Nicholas and his family. In the evening, Holt attended a neighbour's cocktail party for about an hour, and then returned home to host a dinner party with about a dozen guests.|$|E
25|$|As Bryant <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Seascape, he {{shot at a}} red Ford Falcon coming {{the other}} way, smashing its front windscreen. Upon {{arriving}} at Seascape, {{he got out of}} his car. A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E

25|$|The Tigers {{had their}} first shutout {{of the season in}} week four, when they {{traveled}} to the Orange Bowl and defeated the Miami Hurricanes, 41–0. On its first possession LSU <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Miami 49-yard line, where a pass from Rabb was intercepted and ran back to the LSU 42-yard line. The Hurricanes went three-and-out on their offensive possession and attempted a field goal, but the kick was short. After punts by both teams, the Tigers scored their first touchdown of the game on a 51-yard run by Don Purvis. Miami was forced to punt on the first play of the second quarter and it was downed at the LSU 5-yard line. LSU was also forced to punt, but the Hurricanes fumbled on the return and the Tigers recovered it at Miami's 27-yard line. After a first down run by Cannon, Rabb threw a touchdown pass to Billy Hendrix to make the score 13–0 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys had {{a chance}} to score in the third quarter with the ball on LSU's one-yard line on first down. However, the Tigers came up with another {{goal-line}} stand, this time by the White Team with a fumble recovery. In the fourth quarter, Hardin-Simmons had another chance as it <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the LSU 14-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after an incomplete pass on fourth down. The game featured much more passing than LSU had seen in the previous two games. Hardin-Simmons, whose head coach Baugh was a former star quarterback in the National Football League, was a passing-minded team. While LSU rushed for 204 yards, Hardin-Simmons passed for 201 yards on 19 completions. Warren Rabb, who was playing despite {{the death of his father}} that morning, completed six passes for 88 yards. For the third game in a row, Cannon was the leading rusher with 83 yards and a touchdown on eleven carries.|$|E
25|$|November 1, 2008: Georgia Tech 31, #16 Florida State 28 Prior to the November 1 {{meeting between}} FSU and Georgia Tech, Bobby Bowden was un{{defeated}} against Georgia Tech. Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden had never lost to Georgia Tech in 12 meetings. The last time Georgia Tech defeated Florida State in football was in 1975. During Paul Johnson's {{first year as}} head coach, Georgia Tech had a 6-2 record going into the game. Georgia Tech fell behind by a touchdown twice in the first quarter, but pulled ahead in the 2nd quarter to finish the first half leading 24-20. A third-quarter touchdown put Tech up 31-20, but Florida State rallied, scoring a touchdown and converting on the two-point attempt to come within three points. On their final drive Florida State <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> inside the five-yard line. Florida State running back Marcus Sims received the handoff and was headed for the end zone, but was met by Georgia Tech freshman, Cooper Taylor, son of former Tech QB Jim Bob Taylor. The football was knocked loose {{into the end zone}} and recovered by Tech freshman Rashaad Reid to secure the victory for the Jackets. Fans swarmed the field after witnessing their team snap a 12-game losing streak to the Seminoles, Tech's longest to any modern team.|$|E

25|$|The {{agricultural}} sector faces {{a number of}} challenges in Iran, {{the two most important}} being low rainfall and the impact of fluctuations in oil revenues. Unsurprisingly, agricultural production is directly correlated to the amount of rainfall. The relatively dry climate of most of Iran’s regions makes water availability a vital factor in production. For instance, a drought in 2007 damaged agricultural output and <b>drove</b> it <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 9.3% of GDP.|$|R

25|$|The torrid scoring pace slowed {{during much}} of the third quarter, as both teams began to assert {{themselves}} on the defensive side of the ball. But late in the quarter, a 12-yard punt return by Cowboys receiver Butch Johnson gave Dallas good field position on their 42-yard line. The Cowboys subsequently <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Steelers 10-yard line, mostly with Dorsett's rushing. Then on third down with less than three minutes remaining in the period, Staubach spotted 38-year-old reserve tight end Jackie Smith wide open in the end zone and threw him the ball. Head coach Tom Landry said Staubach tried to throw the ball soft when he saw how wide open Smith was and that it came in low, and that when Smith tried to stop, his feet seemed to come out from under him. Jackie Smith states that it was still a catchable ball and that he should have made the play. Instead, Smith dropped the pass and the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal from kicker Rafael Septién, cutting their deficit to 21–17. Though Smith played 16 years in the league and is now enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he is perhaps best known for this dropped touchdown, particularly in a championship game that was ultimately decided by four points.|$|E
25|$|Penn State {{came out}} on the opening drive and scored on the fourth play of the game with a 68-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Adam Breneman from QB Christian Hackenberg. Wisconsin's first drive would result in a three–and–out. On the Nittany Lions next drive, they <b>drove</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Badgers 17-yard line but would have to settle for a field goal attempt. The 34-yard field goal attempt by K Sam Ficken was blocked by the Badgers. Wisconsin would take over but after one first down, they would again punt. Penn State would punt they ball back to Wisconsin after their own three–and–out. The Badgers then were driving into Penn State territory as the first quarter came to an end. The Badgers continued their drive and would score on a 4-yard touchdown pass to TE Brian Wozniak from QB Joel Stave. Another three–and–out for the Nittany Lions would lead to another scoring drive for the Badgers. This was after an 11–play drive for the Badgers which was capped with a 20-yard touchdown pass to WR Jeff Duckworth from Joel Stave. Penn State answered on their next drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to WR Eugene Lewis from Christian Hackenberg. Wisconsin then got to about midfield but were forced to punt. Penn State then ran one final play before halftime. The game was tied 14–14 at the half.|$|E
