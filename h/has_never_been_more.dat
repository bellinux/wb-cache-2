500|$|Critics have {{identified}} various major themes in Tenebrae. In interviews {{conducted during the}} film's production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his candid views on the thematic content of the film. As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento, [...] "...Argento <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> articulate and/or analytical than {{he was on the}} subject of Tenebrae." [...] Film scholar William Hope considers the film to be devoid of classical narrative progression, and states that the characters [...] "lack a narrative function or purpose, existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion, their death hardly moving the narrative on at all. Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored". According to James Gracey, author of a book about Argento's work, with Tenebrae Argento [...] "explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations, such as Freudian psychology, sexual deviancy, repressed trauma, voyeurism, audience spectatorship and the fetishisation of violence and death." [...] Water is often associated visually with Neal; in almost all his scenes his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water. Later, this device is used repeatedly as a clue to the ultimate killer's identity – Neal himself.|$|E

Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E

2500|$|Dave Heaton of PopMatters {{rated the}} album 8/10, stating [...] "Critics often {{use the word}} “cinematic” to {{describe}} the Wu-Tang sound. That word <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> appropriate than with 8 Diagrams. RZA taps into his Ghost Dog and Kill Bill experiences to create imaginary film music, moody would-be scores to Westerns, martial arts, sci-fi and gangster films." [...] Blenders Jonah Weiner from commended RZA's production, stating [...] "RZA has always been hip-hop’s reigning minimalist, but his work scoring Kill Bill, most recently, seems to have strengthened his ear for ambiance and texture." [...] Weiner also complimented Method Man's delivery and rhymes on the album, stating that he sounds [...] "rejuvenated." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nate Patrin complimented the group members' lyricism. Sam Richards of Uncut gave 8 Diagrams 4 out of 5 stars, and stated [...] "RZA’s lurching beats and raw, spectral productions, peppered with kung-fu film samples, are back to their thrillingly weird best. RZA’s dictatorial rule has ostracised Ghost and Raekwon, but you can’t argue with the results. On record at least, Wu-Tang have made the comeback of the decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that Smart's work {{comments}} on modern urban alienation, a post-industrial landscape that has fallen from human control. Others have cast him as a realist, hyper-realist, 'off-beat classicalist' and a metaphysical painter. Some critics have even referred to Smart's paintings as portraying 'Orwellian gloom' – a statement referring, in particular, to George Orwell's literary political masterpiece, Nineteen Eighty-Four. James Gleeson believes that Smart's paintings are [...] "too real to be real"; and believes that his realist portrayals of 20th century life {{are nothing more than}} superb geometrical compositions and bold colour, of man in his naturalistic, man-made environment. It is true, for instance, that trees are rarely seen in Jeffrey Smart's artworks, and the only grass is that growing between concrete stones, but as Smart claimed: [...] "an artist has to be moved to move his viewers", and Smart was moved by man in nature – man-made nature – not concerned with your typical Australian landscape. [...] "I like living in the 20th century – to me the world <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> beautiful. I am trying to paint the real world I live in, as beautifully as I can with my own eyes... It's obvious a bunch of flowers or a billabong is beautiful, and I love natural beauty, but I am not moved by it.... to me composition is everything". Smart believed that people should view art with their eyes and not their head.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing {{the whole}} series, SFX Ian Berriman was more critical, giving it {{three and a}} half out of five stars. He heavily criticised the story arc, finding it too {{complicated}} and the solution unsatisfying, and noted that it lacked [...] "emotional impact". Anders felt that the story arc, especially the finale, suffered from Amy and River not being portrayed as believable characters. Digital Spy named Doctor Who the eighth best show of 2011, feeling that the series was [...] "something of a mixed bag" [...] with episodes of varying quality but generally praised the acting of the cast [...] "Matt Smith was firing on all cylinders – there's a confidence that comes with knowing you're a hit with viewers – while Arthur Darvill's Rory excelled in his first year as a series regular" [...] Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph wrote that [...] "The Wedding of River Song" [...] was [...] "an uneven ending to a slightly uneven series which at times has been in danger of overcomplicating itself, but still {{has been one of the}} most creative and distinctive series on television". The series was also criticised by viewers and the press for being [...] "too scary" [...] for young children, [...] "too complicated", and running the risk of alienating casual viewers. Arnold T. Blumburg of IGN stated that the sixth series [...] "inspired seriously divided reactions in fandom" [...] and, in his opinion, [...] "the show <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> unevenly written or emotionally distant".|$|E
2500|$|One Day International day/night cricket {{has been}} played in England since 2000 however its {{development}} in England and Wales {{has been very}} limited because until 2005 none of England’s One Day Grounds had paramount floodlights and so temporary lights had to be used. The very first One Day International to be played under floodlights in England was on 6 July 2000 between Zimababwe and the West Indies in front of 7,000 people at Gloucestershire’s County Ground at Bristol, a match which the West Indies won by six wickets. England played their first home match under lights a week later at Trent Bridge, a match in which they romped to victory against Zimababwe and the match was over at 7.30pm and the lights were barely needed. In 2006 Glamorgan’s County Ground in Cardiff staged the first ODI Day/Night match to be played in Wales and also became the first ODI in England and Wales to be played under paramount floodlights. Since 2000 there <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than three ODI’s played under lights in England and Wales {{in the same year}} however in 2009 England will host four-day/night ODI's against Australia [...] which marks the first {{increase in the number of}} ODI's to be played in England under floodlights due to Trent Bridge installing paramount floodlights. As of May 2008 only two of England one day grounds have paramount floodlights, the Rose Bowl and Cardiff however Trent Bridge will become the third in August 2008 and when day/night matches are held away from these grounds temporary lights have to be used.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Jay Cocks hailed Into the Music as a daring [...] "record of splendid peace" [...] and [...] "vastly ambitious attempt to reconcile {{various states of}} grace: physical, spiritual and artistic". [...] "That's what this album is about, proudly and stunningly and with no apologies", Cocks wrote. [...] "Resurrection. Real Hope." [...] Tom Bentkowski from New York found Morrison's spirituality casually but confidently expressed in songs that are [...] "introspective, impressionistic", and [...] "charged by the author's overwhelming belief in them". High Fidelity was impressed by Morrison's ability to explore a diversity of universal emotions and called the album [...] "the full-circle complement to his most cosmic, allegorical work", veering from gospel-rooted R and Gaelic songs to rock and roll blended with [...] "heartfelt religious fervor". [...] "There's a general sense of happiness and clarity here", the magazine wrote, [...] "as if Morrison has finally distilled his feelings down to their most essential musical level." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau deemed Into the Music his best record since 1970's Moondance while writing that like Bob Dylan, Morrison had [...] "abandoned metaphorical pretensions, but only because he loves the world". Morrison's simple odes to rural life, he believed, were made vivid and deeper by backing musicians such as Marcus and [...] "by his own excursions into a vocalise that <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> various or apt." [...] Christgau viewed [...] "It's All in the Game" [...] as the album's only great song, however, and was somewhat critical of the [...] "lightweight rockers" [...] and [...] "You Know What They're Writing About", which he felt sounded tedious halfway through.|$|E

[...] The colleges are landowners: they must suffer with other owners of real property in the present depression; they will soon need all their savings. That is one reason why they should be chary of building; another is, that the fellows of a college at any given moment are not necessarily endowed with architectural knowledge and taste. They should think twice, or even thrice, before leaving on Oxford for many centuries the uncomely mark of an unfortunate judgment.|$|E
60|$|In Mr. Horrock {{there was}} {{certainly}} an apparent unfathomableness which offered play to the imagination.

This <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> strongly felt than at present, after a war in which the Church failed grossly in the courage of its profession, and sold its lilies for the laurels of the soldiers of the Victoria Cross.

Let the Church take it on authority, even my authority (as a professional legend maker) if it cannot see the truth by its own light: no dogma can be a legend. A legend can pass an ethnical frontier as a legend, but not as a truth; whilst the only frontier to the currency of a sound dogma as such is the frontier of capacity for understanding it.|$|E
