25|$|The {{independence}} of India and Pakistan from British rule bore more {{importance for the}} people of then Bengal. Since then the Bengali speaking community were divided into two parts – the East and the West Bengal. It turns into the smashing of the millennium-old culture and unity of Bengali nation. Moreover, the existence of language became a <b>great</b> <b>question</b> just after the creation of Pakistan. The West-Pakistan ruling government tried to impose Urdu as the principal language on the Bengali people. But the whole society reacted strongly. This leaves a permanent impression on Bengali literature. In this tumultuous era, Syed Waliullah's Lalsalu (1948) was published. It was the foremost successful novel, both from art and reality points of view. Later Syed Waliullah translated it in English by the name Tree Without Roots. Mahbub-ul Alam wrote Mofijon, also published in 1948.|$|E
25|$|As for... the <b>great</b> <b>question</b> of {{the power}} of sovereigns and the {{obedience}} their peoples owe them, I usually say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{suggested}} that the film draws upon many existing religious and mythological motifs. [...] Vern Barnet of the Charlotte Observer opined that Avatar poses a <b>great</b> <b>question</b> of faith—should the creation be seen and governed hierarchically, from above, or ecologically, through mutual interdependence? He {{also noted that the}} film borrows concepts from other religions and compared its Tree of Souls with the Norse story of the tree Yggdrasil, also called axis mundi or the center of the world, whose destruction signals the collapse of the universe. [...] Malinda Liu in Newsweek likened the Na'vi respect for life and belief in reincarnation with Tibetan religious beliefs and practices, but Reihan Salam of Forbes called the species [...] "perhaps the most sanctimonious humanoids ever portrayed on film." ...|$|E

After the pause, Beyoncé answers, [...] "My aspiration in life would be to be happy". The chorus then restarts with Beyoncé wrecking a shelf containing her personal trophies. She is also shown backstage, smearing her make-up, and vomiting in the bathroom. Another contestant is pictured eating cotton.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1890 Caine {{published}} a magazine serial called Drink: A Love Story on a <b>Great</b> <b>Question.</b> This {{was about the}} same time as Bram Stoker began his notes for his Dracula novel. Stoker and Caine were lifetime literary friends. They shared an interest in mesmerism. Drink contains a number of similarities to Stoker’s novel. [...] In 1906 Drink was published by George Newnes, and illustrated by expatriate Italian American illustrator and painter Cyrus Cuneo. It was described in the Manchester Guardian as ‘a rather gruesome love story’. The story is of a girl who inherits a taste for alcohol from her father and is put on the road to recovery by hypnotic influence. Two hundred thousand copies of the book had been sold in England by the time the American edition was published by Appleton in 1907.|$|E
