25|$|A more-sophisticated probe {{includes}} a magnetic flux sensor (<b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensor)</b> in the magnetic circuit. The probe connects to an amplifier, which feeds (low frequency) current into the coil {{to cancel the}} sensed field; the magnitude of that current provides the low-frequency part of the current waveform, right down to DC. The coil still picks up high frequencies. There is a combining network akin to a loudspeaker crossover network.|$|E
25|$|Speed sensors: A {{speed sensor}} {{is used to}} {{determine}} the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensor,</b> or a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the sensor. The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in the sensor. Since the voltage induced in the sensor {{is a result of the}} rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensor,</b> which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensors</b> {{provide much}} lower {{measuring}} accuracy than fluxgate magnetometers or magnetoresistance-based <b>sensors.</b> Moreover, <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensors</b> drift significantly, requiring compensation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensors</b> with linear {{transducers}} {{are commonly}} integrated with digital electronics. This enables advanced corrections to the sensor's characteristics (e.g. temperature coefficient corrections) and digital interfacing to microprocessor systems. In some solutions of IC <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensors</b> a DSP is used, which provides for more choices among processing techniques.|$|R
50|$|Sensing the {{presence}} of magnetic objects (connected with the position sensing) {{is the most common}} industrial application of <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensors,</b> especially those operating in the switch mode (on/off mode). The <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensors</b> are also used in the brushless DC motor to sense the position of the rotor and to switch the transistors in the right sequence.|$|R
25|$|The Kindle Paperwhite (1st generation) was {{announced}} on September 6, 2012, and released on October 1. It has a 6in, 212PPI E Ink Pearl display (758Ã—1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs {{to illuminate the}} screen. It was available in Wi-Fi ($120 ad-supported, $140 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($180 ad-supported, $200 no ads) models, with the ad-supported options only intended to {{be available in the}} United States. The light {{is one of the main}} features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. The 3G access restrictions are the same as the Kindle Touch, and usage of the 3G data is limited to 50 MB per month and only on Amazon and Wikipedia's websites; additional data may be purchased. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. The official leather cover for the Paperwhite uses the <b>hall</b> <b>effect</b> <b>sensor</b> in the device that detects when the cover is closed/opened to turn the screen off/on respectively. This device was the first Kindle to track one's reading speed to estimate when one will finish a chapter or book; this feature was later included with updates to the other Kindles and Kindle Fire tablets. The Kindle Paperwhite lacks physical buttons for page turning and does not perform auto-hyphenation. Except for the lock screen/power button at its bottom, it relies solely on the touchscreen interface. In November 2012, Amazon released the 5.3.0 update that allowed users to turn off recommended content on the home screen in Grid View (allowing two rows of user content) and included general bug fixes. In March 2014, the Paperwhite 5.4.4 update was released that added Goodreads integration, Kindle FreeTime to restrict usage for children, Cloud Collections for organization and Page Flip for scanning content without losing your place, which closely matched the Paperwhite 2's software features.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{controller}} implements the traditional brushes functionality it needs the rotor's orientation/position (relative to the stator coils).
