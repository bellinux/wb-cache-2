5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the <b>General</b> <b>Control</b> Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The <b>General</b> <b>Control</b> Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for <b>general</b> <b>control</b> of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E

As mentioned, charitable trustees have significantly more freedom to act than normal trustees, but the 1993 Act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee. Section 72 excludes people convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, bankrupts, people previously removed from charity trusteeship, and people struck off as directors of companies. Those trustees appointed have many duties when administering the trust, including informing the Commission of changes to the charity or its dissolution, registering the charity and keeping proper accounts and records, to be submitted annually to the Commission.|$|E

25|$|In January 1946 Beria {{resigned}} {{as chief of}} the NKVD while retaining <b>general</b> <b>control</b> over national security matters as Deputy Prime Minister and Curator of the Organs of State Security under Stalin. However, the new NKVD chief, Sergei Kruglov, was not a Beria man. Also, {{by the summer of}} 1946, Beria's man Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov was replaced as head of the Ministry for State Security (MGB) by Viktor Abakumov. Abakumov had headed SMERSH from 1943 to 1946; his relationship with Beria involved close collaboration (since Abakumov owed his rise to Beria's support and esteem), but also rivalry. Stalin had begun to encourage Abakumov to form his own network inside the MGB to counter Beria's dominance of the power ministries. Kruglov and Abakumov moved expeditiously to replace Beria's men in the security apparatus leadership with new people. Very soon Deputy Minister Stepan Mamulov of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was the only close Beria ally left outside foreign intelligence, on which Beria kept a grip. In the following months, Abakumov started carrying out important operations without consulting Beria, often working in tandem with Zhdanov, and sometimes on Stalin's direct orders. Some observers argue that these operations were aimed – initially tangentially, but with time more directly – at Beria.|$|E

500|$|Effective from 1950, the Constitution of India {{classified}} {{the constituent}} units of India into three classes—Part A, B, and C states.

The only practical difference between the Part A states and the Part B states was that the constitutional heads of the Part B states were the Rajpramukhs appointed {{under the terms of}} the Covenants of Merger, rather than Governors appointed by the central government. In addition, Constitution gave the central government a significant range of powers over the former princely states, providing amongst other things that [...] "their governance shall be under the <b>general</b> <b>control</b> of, and comply with such particular directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by, the President".

500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the Soviet Army began {{development}} of the Shtora-1 electro-optical jammer. [...] It was first mounted on a T-80U in 1989, and later showcased on a T-72B (renamed T-72BM and later T-90). [...] Shtora-1 is designed to jam incoming anti-tank missiles using a one-kilowatt infrared radiator. [...] In 1995, it was fitted on a Ukrainian T-84. [...] The Shtora-1 system consists of an infra-red radiator interface station, composed of the jammer, modulator and control panel, a number of forward-firing grenade discharges capable of producing a smoke screen, a laser-warning system and a <b>general</b> <b>control</b> panel. [...] Shtora offers 360 degree all-around protection, between the elevations of −5 and 25 degrees. [...] The system is activated when the laser warning system alerts the tank commander, who responds by pressing a button on his control panel which automatically orients the turret towards the threat. [...] This triggers the grenade launch, creating a smoke screen to reduce {{the ability of the}} missile to lock-on the vehicle. [...] The jammers are designed to jam the infra-red seekers on the inbound missiles. [...] According to the manufacturers, Shtora decreases the chances of a tank being hit by an anti-tank missile, such as the Dragon, by a factor of 4–5:1.|$|E

Gcn5 has been shown to acetylate substrates when it is part of a complex. Recombinant Gcn5 has been found to be involved in the acetylation of the H3 histones of the nucleosome. [...] To a lesser extent, it has been found to also acetylate H2B and H4 histones when involved with other complexes. [...] PCAF has the ability to act as a HAT protein and acetylate histones, it can acetylate non-histone proteins related to transcription, as well as act as a coactivator in many processes including myogenesis, nuclear-receptor-mediated activation and growth-factor-signaled activation. Elp3 has the ability to acetylate all histone subunits and also shows involvement in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme.|$|E
