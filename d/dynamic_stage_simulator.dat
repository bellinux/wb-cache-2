40|$|Studies of {{nutrient}} cycling {{of tropical}} forests should differentiate between <b>dynamic</b> <b>stages</b> of the forest. We studied the nutrient concentration (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and phytomass of aboveground (living and non living parts) and belowground compartments (soil) in four <b>dynamic</b> <b>stages,</b> namely Building (Bl and B 2), and Mature (Ml and M 2) stages, for a lowland rain forest. Nutrient concentrations in various compartments differed between the <b>dynamic</b> <b>stages.</b> Bark contains higher nutrient concentration than wood parts, both in stems and branches. Leaves contain higher nutrient concentration than wood part s, both in litterfall and litter. The concentration of K in throughfall is the highest, Ca and Mg perform similar value. Throughfall exhibits lower nutrient concentration than open area rain water. The nutrient concentration of 10 - 20 cm {{is higher than}} in the 0 - 10 cm soil depth. The phytomass values are highly variable among tree parts, diameter classes and <b>dynamic</b> <b>stages.</b> The phytomass is generally the highest in M 2 an d significantly different from B l, Ml and B 2. The phytomass of leaves in litterfall and litter is higher than wood parts. More litterfall and litter are accumulated in mature than building phases...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Stage</b> <b>simulator</b> is a 2D multiple-robot {{simulation}} environment {{built on}} top of FLTK. Stage provides a basic simulation environment that can be scaled to model one to hundreds of robots at a time. Stage can be used alone to simulate robot behaviors via user-defined control programs.

40|$|The {{structural}} analyses {{described in}} the present report were performed in support of the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) Critical Initial Flaw Size (CIFS) assessment for the Ares I-X Upper <b>Stage</b> <b>Simulator</b> (USS) common shell segment. An independent assessment was conducted to determine the critical initial flaw size (CIFS) for the flange-to-skin weld in the Ares I-X Upper <b>Stage</b> <b>Simulator</b> (USS). The Ares system of space launch vehicles is the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration s plan for replacement of the aging space shuttle. The new Ares space launch system is somewhat of a combination of the space shuttle system and the Saturn launch vehicles used prior to the shuttle. Here, a series of weld analyses are performed to determine the residual stresses in a critical region of the USS. Weld residual stresses both increase constraint and mean stress thereby having an important effect on fatigue and fracture life. The results of this effort served as one of the critical load inputs required to perform a CIFS assessment of the same segment...|$|R

To explore these ideas, {{we have developed}} environments and materials to support the programming of robots to do interesting tasks in a fundamentally concurrent manner.

50|$|The {{unpowered}} Upper <b>Stage</b> <b>Simulator</b> (USS), {{which was}} not meant to be retrieved, impacted further out into the Atlantic Ocean. The USS began to tumble, in a flat, counterclockwise spin almost immediately after staging. After initial concerns that the motion might have been caused by a collision between the USS and the first stage, further analysis showed that no actual recontact happened and that the tumble {{had been one of the}} possible behaviours predicted by pre-flight simulations.|$|R

40|$|Predictions of {{internal}} compartment pressures are {{necessary in the}} design of interstage regions, systems tunnels, and protuberance covers of launch vehicles to assess potential burst and crush loading of the structure. History has proven that unexpected differential pressure loads can lead to catastrophic failure. Pressures measured in the Upper <b>Stage</b> <b>Simulator</b> (USS) compartment of Ares I-X during flight were compared to post-flight analytical predictions using the CHCHVENT chamber-to-chamber venting analysis computer program. The measured pressures were enveloped by the analytical predictions for most of the first minute of flight but were outside of the predictions thereafter. This paper summarizes the venting system for the USS, discusses the probable reasons for the discrepancies between the measured and predicted pressures, and provides recommendations for future flight vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The Ares I-X {{flight test}} {{provided}} NASA {{with the opportunity}} to test hardware and gather critical data to ensure the success of future Ares I flights. One of the primary test flight objectives was to evaluate the environment during First Stage separation to better understand the conditions that the J- 2 X second stage engine will experience at ignition [1]. A secondary objective was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the stage separation motors. The Ares I-X flight test vehicle was successfully launched on October 29, 2009, achieving most of its primary and secondary test objectives. Ground based video camera recordings of the separation event appeared to show recontact of the First Stage and the Upper <b>Stage</b> <b>Simulator</b> followed by an unconventional tumbling of the Upper <b>Stage</b> <b>Simulator.</b> Closer inspection of the videos and flight test data showed that recontact did not occur. Also, the motion during staging was as predicted through CFD analysis performed during the Ares I-X development. This paper describes the efforts to reconstruct the vehicle dynamics and loads through the staging event by means of a time integrated simulation developed in TREETOPS, a multi-body dynamics software tool developed at NASA [2]. The simulation was built around vehicle mass and geometry properties at the time of staging and thrust profiles for the first stage solid rocket motor as well as for the booster deceleration motors and booster tumble motors. Aerodynamic forces were determined by models created from a combination of wind tunnel testing and CFD. The initial conditions such as position, velocity, and attitude were obtained from the Best Estimated Trajectory (BET), which is compiled from multiple ground based and vehicle mounted instruments. Dynamic loads were calculated by subtracting the inertial forces from the applied forces. The simulation results were compared to the Best Estimated Trajectory, accelerometer flight data, and to ground based video...|$|R
