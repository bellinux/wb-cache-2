40|$|Abstract — As {{the device}} {{geometries}} are shrinking, {{the impact of}} crosstalk effects increases, which results in a stronger depen-dence of <b>interconnect</b> delay on the input arrival time difference between victim and aggressor inputs (input skew). The increasing process variations lead to statistical input skew which induces sig-nificant <b>interconnect</b> delay variations. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} take input skew variation into account for <b>interconnect</b> delay calculation in the presence of process variations. Existing timing analysis tools evaluate gate and <b>interconnect</b> delays separately. In this paper, we focus on statistical <b>interconnect</b> delay calculation considering crosstalk effects. A piecewise linear delay-change-curve model enables closed-form analytical evaluation of the sta-tistical <b>interconnect</b> delay caused by input skew (SK) variations. This method can handle arbitrarily distributed SK variations. The process-variation (PV) -induced <b>interconnect</b> delay variation is handled in a quadratic delay model which considers coupling effects. The SK- and PV-induced <b>interconnect</b> delay variations are combined together for crosstalk-aware statistical <b>interconnect</b> delay calculation. The experimental results indicate that the pro-posed method can predict the <b>interconnect</b> delay impacted by both input skew variation and process variations with average (maxi-mum) absolute mean error 0. 25 % (0. 75 %) and standard devia-tion error 1. 31 % (3. 53 %) for different types of coupled wires in a 65 nm technology.
