500|$|Mohini {{also has}} an active history in the {{destruction}} of demons throughout Hindu texts. In the Vishnu Purana, Mohini defeats Bhasmasura, the [...] "ash-demon". Bhasmasura invokes the god Shiva by performing severe penances. Shiva, pleased with Bhasmasura, grants him the power to turn anyone into ashes by touching their head. The demon decides to try the power on Shiva himself. Shiva runs terrified. Vishnu, witnessing the unfortunate turn of events, transforms into Mohini and charms Bhasmasura. Bhasmasura is so taken by Mohini that he asks her to marry him. Mohini agrees, but only on the condition that Bhasmasura follows her move for move in a dance. In the course of the dance, she places <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head. Bhasmasura mimics the action, and in turn, reduces himself to ashes. The legend of Bhasmasura is retold in the Buddhist text Satara Dewala Devi Puvata, with a slight variation. In this tale, Vishnu assumes his female form (the name [...] "Mohini" [...] is not used) and charms Bhasmasura. The female Vishnu asks Bhasmasura to promise never to leave her by placing his hand on his head as per the usual practice to swear on one's head. On doing so, Bhasmasura is reduced to ashes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 she {{was elected}} as deputy {{member of the}} Odense city council for the Red-Green Alliance. [...] She then first came to media {{attention}} when she refused to shake a male colleague's hand, instead putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heart in greeting.|$|E
2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats {{time to the}} music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain {{that she was a}} dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas {{helped the}} United States win a second {{consecutive}} {{gold medal in}} the team event, which was also her third Olympic gold medal. When the team final scores were announced, Douglas and her teammates called themselves the [...] "Final Five" [...] in honor of coach Marta Karolyi's retirement and the team size being reduced to four beginning in 2020. During the podium ceremony when the national anthem was played, Douglas received criticism on social media for not placing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heart, which was seen by some as controversial since her role in the 2016 team had diminished compared to the 2012 squad.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{painting}} he sent, in 1840, was The Illness of Antiochus (1840; {{also known}} as Aniochus and Stratonice) a history painting on a theme of love and sacrifice, a theme once painted by David in 1800, when Ingres was in his studio. It was commissioned by the Duc d'Orleans, the son of King [...] Louis Philippe I), and had very elaborate architectural background designed {{by one of the}} Academy students, Victor Baltard, the future architect of the Paris market Les Halles. The central figure was an ethereal woman in white, whose contemplative pose with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> chin recurs in some of Ingres's female portraits.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Sophocles' Tereus {{was influenced by}} Euripides' Medea, and thus must have been produced after 431. [...] However, this is not certain and any influence {{may well have been}} in the opposite direction, with Sophocles' play influencing Euripides. [...] Jenny Marsh believes that Euripides' Medea did come before Sophocles' Tereus, based primarily on a statement in Euripides' chorus [...] "I have heard of only one woman, only one of all that have lived, who put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> own children: Ino." [...] Marsh takes this to imply that as of the time of Medeas production, the myth of Tereus had not yet incorporated the infanticide, as it did in Sophocles' play.|$|E
