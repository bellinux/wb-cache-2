50|$|Diprion pini, {{the common}} pine sawfly, is a sawfly {{species in the}} genus Diprion. It is a serious pest of <b>economic</b> <b>forestry,</b> capable of defoliating large areas of pine forest. Since it feeds {{until late in the}} autumn, {{affected}} trees are weakened and often die in the subsequent winter. The species is found all across Europe, with outliers elsewhere. It affects the Scots, mountain, eastern white, radiata, lodgepole and black pines. Scots pines are not generally killed by a single defoliation, but weakened trees may suffer increased attack by bark beetles, buprestid beetles, and pine weevils, which can kill trees, as can repeated defoliation.|$|E
50|$|Adult sawflies are short-lived, {{with a life}} {{expectancy}} of 7-9 days, though the larval stage can last from months to years, depending on the species. Parthenogenetic females, which {{do not need to}} mate to produce fertilised eggs, are common in the suborder, though many species have males. Sawflies go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages - egg, larva, pupa and adult. The female uses her ovipositor to drill into plant material (or, in the case of Orussoidea, other insects) and then lays eggs in groups called rafts or pods. After hatching, larvae feed on plants, often in groups. As they approach adulthood, the larvae seek a protected spot to pupate, typically in bark or the soil. Large populations of species such as the pine sawfly can cause substantial damage to <b>economic</b> <b>forestry,</b> while others such as the iris sawfly are important pests in horticulture. Outbreaks of sawfly larvae can defoliate trees and may cause dieback, stunting or death. Sawflies can be controlled through the use of insecticides, natural predators and parasites, or mechanical methods.|$|E

40|$|Forests of the 30 European Union (EU) {{have been}} intensively managed for decades, {{and they have}} formed a {{significant}} sink for carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the atmosphere over the past 50 years.

40|$|Forests of the European Union (EU) {{have been}} intensively managed for decades, {{and they have}} formed a {{significant}} sink for carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the atmosphere over the past 50 years. The reasons for this behavior are multiple, among them are: forest aging, area expansion, increasing plant productivity due to environmental changes of many kinds, and, most importantly, the growth rates of European foest having been higher than harvest rates. EU countries have agreed to reduce total emissions of GHG by 20 % in 2020 compared to 1990, excluding the forest sink. A relevant question for climate policy is: how long will the current sink of EU forests be maintained in the near future? And could it be affected by other mitigation measures such as bioenergy? In this article we assess tradeoffs of bioenergy use and carbon sequestration at large scale and describe results of the comparison of two advanced forest management models {{that are used to}} project CO 2 emission and removals from EU forests until 2030.

40|$|Bornholm is a Danish island {{located in}} the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Poland. The island covers an area of 588 km 2. The soils are derived mainly from Holocene glacial till {{overlying}} Pre-cambric gneiss or granite and, at some places, Cambro-Silurian sandstone or shale. There are frequent outcrops of bedrock. There are five Sorbus species on Bornholm (Figure 2) : wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis (L.) Crantz), rock whitebeam (Sorbus rupicola (Syme) Hedl.), Swedish whitebeam (Sorbus intermedia (Ehrh.) Pers.), Swedish service tree (Sorbus hybrida L.), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) The botanical, genetic and ecological characteristics of each Sorbus species are briefly outlined. It is argued that wild service tree, Swedish whitebeam and rowan could play {{a larger role in}} silviculture. Rock whitebeam (due to its bushy growth) and Swedish service tree (due to its infrequent occurrence) are considered of little or no interest for silviculture. Wild service tree: A large share of Denmark's natural populations of wild service tree is found on Bornholm, primarily on inaccessible coastal cliffs, but also in the forest. On coastal cliffs wild service tree often only grows {{to the size of a}} bush or a small tree (Figure 1), while in the forest it can grow to timber dimensions (Figure 3). Although there are only few individuals in each population, they collectively represent an important genetic resource. It is suggested to establish a seed orchard based on locally collected scions and to install experiments comparing controlled-pollination offspring to offspring from, for example, the large autochthonous population in Ulvshale Forest on the Danish island of Møn or the superior German populations at Sailershausen. Swedish whitebeam: Swedish whitebeam is found almost exclusively in the open landscape, where it is frequently planted in hedgerows and as a solitary tree. It thrives particularly well on calcareous sites, but clearly has a much wider site potential (as witnessed by its growth when planted on other site types in northern Europe). Swedish whitebeam is healthy and wind firm, tolerates salt-spray deposition and is capable of producing a sizeable stem of timber quality (Figure 4). Due to the species' asexual reproduction through agamospermy or apomixis, offspring will inherit essential mother tree characteristics such as growth potential, stem form and health status. It is suggested that Swedish whitebeam should be tested for forestry use. Rowan: Rowan is one of the commonest tree species in many parts of Europe, including Bornholm. It is not dealt with specifically in this article, but it is suggested that the species should be considered given a more prominent role in forestry. Finally, it is pointed out that Bornholm deserves more attention in Sorbus research. The island's role as a genetic melting pot for Sorbus at species and genus level has not yet been explored. Due to its geographic isolation from other Sorbus populations Bornholm could be an interesting case-study, not only for research, but also for the development and testing of suitable management practices for conservation as well as for <b>economic</b> <b>forestry...</b>|$|E
