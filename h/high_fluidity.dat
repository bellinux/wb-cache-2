Although {{it has been}} suggested that the charge amount, fluidity of membrane and alkyl chain length of lipsome had impact on the DNA condensation and transfection efficiency, the exact mechanisms are not known (Lentz 1993). It is easy to think that the DNA condensation efficiency should firstly depend on the Zeta-potential and size of the liposome, which have been unified in this experiment. And secondly, the micro-property of liposomal membrane, including membrane fluidity, intermolecular interaction, molecular density, etc., should be concerned. According to the discussion mentioned above, we focus on the first two. The difference in DNA condensation between Lipo 1 and Lipo 2 could probably be ascribed to the slightly <b>higher</b> <b>fluidity</b> and weaker molecular interaction of the β- than the α-galacto-liposome (Song et al. 2012), which is unfavourable to condense the DNA strand more efficiently.
