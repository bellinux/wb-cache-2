25|$|Later in the year, {{after his}} return, Stieglitz was {{unanimously}} elected {{as one of}} the first two American members of The Linked Ring. Stieglitz saw this recognition as the impetus he needed to step up his cause of promoting artistic photography in the United States. At the time there were two photographic clubs in New York, the Society of Amateur Photographers and the New York Camera Club. Stieglitz resigned from his position at the Photochrome Company and as <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Amateur Photographer and spent most of 1895 negotiating a merger of the two clubs.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, rumours arose {{that she}} would retire, and be {{replaced}} by French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld. An editor at Russian GQ reportedly introduced Russian Vogue editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Vogue. Condé Nast responded by taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times defending her record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour hadn't lost her touch, the magazine had become [...] "stale and predictable," [...] as a reader had recently complained. [...] "To read Vogue {{in recent years is}} to wonder about the peculiar fascination for the 'villa in Tuscany' story," [...] Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.|$|E
500|$|Isaac Landman, a {{graduate}} of Hebrew Union College, joined Lyons as rabbi of Beth Elohim in 1931. Born in Russia in 1880, Landman {{had come to the}} United States in 1890. In 1911, with the assistance of Jacob Schiff, Julius Rosenwald, and Simon Bamberger, he founded a Jewish farm colony in Utah, and during World War I he was [...] "said to be the first Jewish chaplain in the United States Army to serve on foreign soil". A leader in Jewish–Christian ecumenism, he was <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Hebrew Magazine from 1918, served as the delegate of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now Union for Reform Judaism) to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, and in the late 1930s and early 1940s was editor of the new ten volume Universal Jewish Encyclopedia.|$|E
500|$|S. T. Karnick, <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Culture, {{wrote an}} article for the National Review {{detailing}} the impact Friday the 13th has had on the slasher genre and noting that the reasons critics have deplored the films are the same reasons why the franchise has had such a strong influence. Karnick explained that Friday the 13th did not try and recreate the same [...] "clever" [...] film that John Carpenter made in 1978, but instead [...] " [...] the formula" [...] of Halloween, and [...] " [...] it down to its essentials" [...] {{so that it could}} be copied by other filmmakers. In his assessment, Friday the 13th changed the horror genre by purposefully not providing back‑stories for characters so that when the audience witnessed a character's death, they are [...] "strangely unaffected". Instead, Friday the 13th focuses on the history and motivations of the killer, who would exact revenge not on the people directly responsible, but on innocent people—a formula Karnick notes was replicated in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Saw, the Hannibal Lecter films, and the Halloween sequels. As Karnick sees it, [...] "these films spoke directly to fears of increasing crime and social dislocation [...] provided audiences with ways to detach from these worries and conquer their fears of violence by laughing at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{film critic}} Stephen Hunter, a {{historian}} of the era, said: [...] "Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, {{and that is something}} that I am afraid has been lost to history....he presence of the Loyalists (colonists who did not want to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties." [...] The historian Richard F. Snow, <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Heritage magazine, said of the church-burning scene: [...] "Of course it never happened—if it had do you think Americans would have forgotten it? It could have kept us out of World War I." ...|$|E

He said the No. 22 had a five-cylinder 40hp kerosene motor of his own design, weighing 120lbs. He said ignition was [...] "accomplished by its own heat and compression."

2500|$|At {{some point}} in 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy had seen Gloria Schiff, the twin sister of the Rome-based fashion <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Vogue and Valentino's friend Consuelo Crespi, wearing a two-piece {{ensemble}} in black organza at a gathering. It made such an impression that Kennedy contacted Ms. Schiff to learn {{the name of the}} ensemble's designer, which was Valentino. In September 1964, Valentino was to be in the United States to present a collection of his work at a charity ball at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Mrs. Kennedy wanted to view the collection but could not attend the event, so Valentino decided to send a model, sales representative and a selection of key pieces from his collection to Mrs. Kennedy's apartment on Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Kennedy ordered six of his haute couture dresses, all in black and white, and wore them during her year of mourning following President John F. Kennedy's assassination. From then on, she was a devoted client and would become a friend. Valentino would later design the white [...] worn by Kennedy at her wedding to Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis. In 1966 he moved his shows from Florence to Rome where two years later he produced an all-white collection that became famous for the [...] "V" [...] logo he designed.|$|E
