40|$|ABSTRACTConsidering that {{a driver}} decides to exit a highway upon seeing the guide sign {{upstream}} of an exit, subsequently the driver in an inside lane or the middle lanes must move onto the outside lane prior to exiting. The concern {{is whether the}} driver can accomplish this task safely and smoothly. It is apparent that an upstream exit sign cannot be placed too close to an exit or too far beyond several exits upstream. The MUTCD recommends that the sign should be placed 1 mile and 2 miles upstream of an exit without explaining the reasons for selecting the 1 mile distance. By integrating driver decisions, vehicle acceleration characteristics, tire-road traction into a single analytic framework, the location upstream of an exit where an exit sign should be installed is determined for a driver to get off at the right exit successfully. Practitioners can easily apply these user friendly formulae and equations derived from the framework to compute the required distance ‘D’ between a highway exit and an upstream exit sign for guiding drivers to exit the highway safely. Additionally, parameters for these formulae can be adjusted to resemble various <b>exiting</b> <b>scenarios...</b>|$|R

In Part I, for a class of initial data close to the soliton, we prove that only three scenario can occur: (BLOW UP) the solution blows up in finite time $T$ in a universal regime with speed $ 1 /(T-t) $; (SOLITON) the solution is global and converges to a soliton in large time; (EXIT) the solution leaves any small neighborhood of the modulated family of solitons in the scale invariant $L^ 2 $ norm. Regimes (BLOW UP) and (EXIT) are proved to be stable. We also show in this class that any nonpositive energy initial data (except solitons) yields finite time blow up, thus obtaining the classification of the solitary wave at zero energy. In Part II, we classify minimal mass blow up by proving existence and uniqueness (up to invariances of the equation) of a minimal mass blow up solution $S(t) $. We also completely describe the blow up behavior of $S(t) $. Second, we prove that $S(t) $ is the universal attractor in the (EXIT) case, i. e. any solution as above in the (EXIT) case is close to $S$ (up to invariances) in $L^ 2 $ at the exit time.

Highlights Exit strategies used by four grantmakers Learning from spend down foundations When you're the one who's exiting Breaking the ice with new funders What's in the Guide? Exiting Is Normal: Saying goodbye to grantees is an inescapable part of the grantmaker's role. To do it well, our contributors told us, it's important to think upfront about an <b>exit</b> <b>scenario</b> that advances the aims of the grantee, the foundation, and the larger field. Put the exit on the table from the start, they said, and keep it there as a predictable phase in the funding relationship. Communicating Clearly with Grantees: For a grantee, the exit of a funder is always bad news, even when it's planned in advance. A grantmaker can set a positive tone by communicating consistently [...] over the course of the grant and as the end approaches. When everyone at the foundation sends the same message, that's even better. Strengthening Grantees' Organizational Capacity: Grantmakers often find themselves thinking hard about the future of a grantee organization as an exit approaches, especially if the grantee is relatively new, small, or unstable. Here are some ways to help: talk regularly with grantees about their organizational capacity, suggest using consultants for business planning and other services, and provide grants to pay for those services. Helping Grantees Find New Funding: Ah, the bottom line. What grantees really want and need is help with fundraising. A matching or challenge grant can work well in the right situation, grantmakers said. Yet even without special funding, there are simple, powerful things you can do to put your grantees in touch with new funding prospects on a regular basis. Maximizing the Impact of the Grant: An exit can be an occasion to look back on what was accomplished, distill lessons, and disseminate what was learned. To let grantees do those things, some funders offer special support through transition or tie-off grants. Grantmakers' own efforts to strengthen the field can also extend the value of a foundation's investment. Special Cases: When the Exit Isn't Normal: And then there's the exit where thinking upfront just doesn't apply: the exit where something goes seriously wrong or the funder's own situation changes dramatically.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{advanced}} driver assistance systems always aims at enabling {{the driver to}} master today’s traffic in a more safe and comfortable way. For future assistance systems, the assisting system {{must be aware of}} the current overall traffic situation. In order to judge the risks in a situation, the assistance system must be able to predict the behavior of the traffic participants around. Taking into account all possible future situations for the next few seconds is a task which quickly produces a complexity that can hardly be handled. Taking the human driver as a role model for its software-counterpart, we propose a new concept which aims at modeling anticipation by taking the motivations of drivers as a basis. Starting with a set of motivations typical for highway traffic, for example the navigation motivation of taking an exit or of changing lanes to keep a constant speed, concrete situation specific goals are derived. A planning component generates the possible and fulfillable plans for all vehicles in the scenario with respect to the set of goals. Then, the observed actions of the vehicles around are compared to these plans in order to derive a plausibility for the underlying intentions. Eventually, prediction is performed for plausible behaviors of vehicles, which are always based on a motivation that can be taken as an explanation for it. First results are shown in simulation for highway <b>exit</b> <b>scenarios.</b> In the situations shown, a prediction for an upcoming lane change of a vehicle can be made just by the knowledge of pre-defined motivations and the observation of a sequence of actions. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{published}} in the August 2015 issue of THE GLOBAL ANALYST (magazine), the author provides {{a detailed analysis of}} the unfolding of the Greek crisis since it sparked off the Eurozone crisis in 2010 when it revised its early deficit prediction from 3. 7 per cent and estimated to be 13. 6 per cent. This article aims to explore, through granular economic data, how the high debt-stricken country has failed to assure a clear path to real long-term economic growth and sovereign debt sustainability, despite the implementation of tough austerity measures (i. e. internal adjustments’ program) over a period of five years (“The Great Recession” in the Euro zone) and major sacrifices for the Greek people. The article also has been written {{in one of the most}} acute phases of the Greek crisis (mid-July 2015), just a few days after the date when the country failed to make its € 1. 6 billion payment to the IMF, thus becoming the first developed country to go into arrears with the International Monetary Fund. Those were the days when Prime Minister Alex Tsipras unexpectedly called a referendum on the country’s latest bailout offer that international creditors have proposed to keep the debt-stricken country afloat, and when a new potential bailout program (a third bailout of would cost € 82 billion-€ 86 billion) was discussed by its major creditors (European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) to avoid the country’s potential exit from the Eurozone and default on the ECB payment due on July 20 th, 2015. Given the level of uncertainty on the potential future outcome of the new bailout decision at the time of writing, the author has explored in this article the pros and cons of a potential “Grexit” scenario (i. e. an exit of Greece from the Eurozone). The article aims to contribute to the debate about the changes needed to the Eurozone rules and treaties in order to avoid in the future other similar crises through a closer political and fiscal integration, and a strengthened financial, capital markets, and banking union, adequate solidarity mechanisms, permanent or at least temporary fiscal transfers, co-funded public mechanisms to support job flexibility in countries with high unemployment, and timely and effective “burden sharing” (fiscal backstop) crisis resolution mechanisms. and economic sustainability. Conclusion The new dramatic Greek crisis of 2015 and the political tensions that followed between the country’s government and its creditors concerning a potential “Grexit” scenario, the decision to grant a potential third bailout in five years, and the feasibility of potential debt relief to assure the country’s debt sustainability, have certainly contributed to increase uncertainty and volatility in the markets, while the Eurozone is still facing a phase of fragile economic recovery. Nevertheless, in spite of the painful tensions between the Greek government and the creditors and the dramatic resurgence of the Greek crisis, probably one positive outcome of this new crisis could be related to the sense of urgency experienced by a number of Eurozone leaders in the search of sustainable long-term solutions to such crises. Thus, this new dramatic event might represent a painful but necessary step towards a more integrated and unified Eurozone. The lesson learned from this new Greek crisis could lead to a new framework of the European rules and governance that might strengthen its resilience in the future to potential systemic shocks (economic, financial, banking, political or social crises). Yet, the ability and speed of the European political leaders and authorities to envision and implement, with the consensus of their citizens, new and effective institutional frameworks and rules to avoid in the future other potential member states' <b>exit</b> <b>scenarios,</b> will determine whether this new crisis has been useful to strengthen the Eurozone and its geopolitical, economic, social scope, otherwise, the currency area will remain incomplete, fragile, and fragmented and new potential crises might just be around the corner...|$|E

40|$|The {{present state}} {{of the global economy}} is characterised by {{persistent}} and increasingly polarised current account imbalances, in a context of historically low long-term interest rates, which stand below the equilibrium levels proxied by potential growth and trend inflation. A comprehensive analysis by Ben Bernanke 1 attributes those two phenomena to one common cause: a global saving glut outside the United States. The approach below is more pessimistic than the global saving glut theory as far as the diagnosis is concerned, as the most striking feature of the {{present state of}} the global economy {{is not so much a}} saving glut as an investment strike, in spite of low long-term interest rates. This also affects the US economy where corporate investment remains subdued relative to profi ts, adding to the gradual loss in its tradable productive capacity, possibly to the benefi t of large foreign direct investment outflows. So far, such a model could be seen as sustainable. Indeed, in spite of an increasingly large deterioration in the US net international investment position, the balance of income has remained positive owing to a favourable yield spread between assets and liabilities. However, the tipping point, beyond which net investment income turns negative and therefore becomes a levy on domestic resources, seems to be near. This may lead to serious foreign debt sustainability issues and reinforces the “steep exchange rate adjustment” <b>exit</b> <b>scenario</b> with all its potentially harmful side effects. Recently, some optimistic assessments of exchange-rate-led adjustment have focused on valuation effects, through which a large amount of the US net foreign debt could be wiped out by a US dollar depreciation. We suggest that such an exchange rate shock would be likely to trigger an increase in US interest rates, which makes an exchange rate shock not as painless as it seems for the US economy. Besides, such a shock could be potentially more harmful than previous episodes of sharp US dollar adjustment from the perspective of the global economy, as the ratio of foreign-owned assets in the United States to the world GDP has tripled since the mid- 1980 s. However, as far as the other exit strategies are concerned, the approach below is more optimistic: since economic policies had a significant influence on the run-up to the current situation of low interest rates/global imbalances, reorienting economic policies may successfully address the issues at stake, leading to a gradual policy-driven resolution process which could be less disruptive than a market-led adjustment. The note is organised as follows: section 1 provides a brief summary of the mechanisms and implications of the “saving glut hypothesis”; section 2 discusses the accuracy of the saving glut hypothesis by looking at savings and investment behaviour in various economic regions; section 3 focuses on the saving/investment balance in the corporate sector, particularly in the United States, and the shift to the rent economy hypothesis and finally section 4 outlines various possible adjustment mechanisms of the global imbalances/low interest rates combination. ...|$|R

The evaluation involves the evaluation of a design fire scenario that accounts for an increased occupant load and the elimination of an <b>exit.</b> This <b>scenario</b> is modeled using Pathfinder, Pyrosim, and Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The tenability results of the simulation are compared to the established tenability thresholds to determine the available safe egress time (ASET) for each scenario. This time is compared to the required safe egress time (RSET) defined by a pathfinder simulation for the increased occupant load to egress from the floor in the design fire scenario. The fire scenario evaluated an upholstered couch fire in a small room. RSET was calculated as 500 seconds and ASET was determined to be 160 when the visibility tenability criteria is exceeded. However, this result does not necessarily confirm that ASE...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure the {{physiological}} demands and air requirements during simulated firefighting tasks while wearing full personal protective ensemble (PPE) and positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) has been a difficult process based on undeveloped technology. The capability of integrating a portable Cosmed K 4 b 2 breath by breath gas collection system with a standard SCBA has permitted a novel approach to investigate metabolic demands and ventilatory requirements while breathing through the same system {{that would be used}} in an actual fire scene. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the physiological demands and air requirements during three large structure firefighting scenarios: (1) maximal high rise stair climb, (2) 5 th floor high rise scenario, and (3) subway system scenario. The hypotheses were that (a) the 5 th floor high rise scenario would be the most physically demanding and that (b) the years of service as a firefighter would result in decreased total air consumption during the three scenarios. Thirty-three male and three female healthy firefighters performed each of the three tasks at an equivalent pace similar to what would be expected at a fire scene. Scenario (1) consisted of stair climbing until consuming 55 % of a typical SCBA air cylinder and then descending to a safe <b>exit.</b> <b>Scenario</b> (2) comprised a 5 floor stair climb, hose drag and room search, forcible entry, victim rescue drag, and 5 floor descent. Scenario (3) involved a stair descent, tunnel walk, portable ladder walk, ladder setup, victim rescue drag, tunnel walk, and stair ascent. Average maximum floors climbed for scenario (1) and mean completion times for scenarios (2) and (3) were 20 ± 2. 5 floors, 5 min 3 s ± 57 s, and 12 min 5 s ± 1 min 10 s, respectively. Mean VO 2 during each of the scenarios were 3168 ± 878 ml/min, 2947 ± 461 ml/min, 2217 ± 371 ml/min, corresponding to a relative VO 2 of 35. 5 ± 9. 1 ml/kg/min, 33. 1 ± 4. 6 ml/kg/min, and 25. 2 ± 4. 6 ml/kg/min. In relation to the peak treadmill oxygen uptake, the three scenarios revealed that firefighters were working at 70 ± 10 %, 65 ± 10 %, and 49 ± 8 % of VO 2 peak, respectively. Average heart rate values for the three scenarios were 170 ± 13 bpm, 160 ± 14 bpm, and 139 ± 17 bpm, corresponding to 88 ± 4 %, 88 ± 6 %, and 76 ± 7 % of HRpeak, respectively. These results indicate that the most physiologically demanding scenario was the maximal stair climb, followed by the 5 th floor high rise and subway system scenarios. Respiratory exchange ratio was consistently greater than 1. 0 during the maximal stair climb and 5 th floor high rise scenarios indicating that a considerable amount of energy was derived from anaerobic metabolism. With regards to the air requirements for each of the scenarios, total air consumption revealed averaged values of 74. 9 ± 6 %, 48. 0 ± 7. 0 %, and 59. 9 ± 5. 6 %, of the air in a typical 30 -min cylinder, respectively. These data also revealed that increasing age of the firefighter as well as increasing years of experience as a firefighter result in significant correlations with greater air consumption to complete the given task (p < 0. 05). Contrary to the hypotheses, the maximal stair climb scenario appeared to be the most physically demanding while increased years of service as a firefighter resulted in greater air consumption. Furthermore, it appears that firefighters who are able to produce more power per kg of body mass have greater performance times and more efficient air consumption. These data are instrumental in quantifying the physiological demands and air requirements during simulated firefighting tasks while breathing on a positive pressure SCBA...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{financial}} stability issues, we currently need to focus upon, relates to risk premia dynamics. Recent market turbulences have indeed, once more, shown that such dynamics can change quickly. True, the well known long term interest rates conundrum, highlighted by M. Greenspan, might appear less crucial an issue in 2006 than in 2004 / 2005. But several other market configurations appear puzzling. First, long term interest rates remain relatively low {{at this stage of}} the cycle. However, the jury is still out regarding the question, whether low term premia will be permanent. Second, credit markets remain buoyant, with very aggressive pricing. Low credit spreads often only match average historical rates of default without providing additional risk premium. A benign scenario can obviously account for such a configuration, but this is only one scenario among many other more risky ones. Third, the contrast with high equity risk premia is puzzling. In the past, at the specific time when excesses from previous bubbles had to be wiped out without too much damage to economic growth, the decrease in credit spreads in the face of high equity risk premia might have served financial stability. But, currently and for the longer term, these advantages seem less clear. Higher credit risk premia premia might indeed bode better for future financial stability. Fourth, recent market tensions have highlighted some vulnerabilities. This should lead us i) to remain cautious in our assessment of potential future short term market dynamics and ii) put on top of our agenda an enhancement of the resilience in face of longer term vulnerabilities. Risk premia move constantly because of changes in fundamental factors as well as in risk appetite. This often smoothly contributes to financial stability. However some characteristics of the present environment could make such adjustments challenging in the future. First, less accommodative global liquidity makes financial market dynamics more complex to predict. Second, bank lending standards might be looser than in a steady state. If credit standards are finally tightened more strongly, this would benefit financial stability in the medium term. But the transition includes challenges for borrowers which have relied on cheap credit in recent years. Third, cyclical lows on financial market volatility might be behind us. Fourth, financial institutions risk management often relies on fragile diversification related assumptions. This makes sense in a stable environment, when correlations do not change quickly. However, diversification might not protect as expected in time of stress. And a quick unwinding of positions is not always possible. Fifth, model risk remains a field where improvements are needed in order to strengthen financial stability over a full financial cycle. The main market related risks, in a context of less ample global liquidity, include changes in risk aversion and risk premia, with the potential for a breakdown in traditional correlations. If significant portfolio reallocation flows take place, market liquidity issues have the potential to transform vulnerabilities into financial instability. These risks might not be perfectly captured by some risk models currently used by financial institutions (including stress-tests). The main financial system related risks include the scenario in which financial institutions would not decrease sufficiently their search for yield in the future, in an environment where higher expected returns could be subject to increased risks. We can certainly envisage an ideal <b>exit</b> <b>scenario</b> in term of financial stability. However, risk premia are not controlled by any single institution and are subject to complex and uncertain dynamics. In fact, financial market dynamics might be more challenging in the future than in recent years. Financial institutions should therefore continuously enhance their resiliency in face of the variety of potential scenarii. The various conditions which can prevail during a full economic and financial cycle need to be seriously taken into account. This means that financial institutions should continue to ensure to avail of sharp risk management practices, emphasising the cases when risks (unfortunately) materialise over the short term, even for those risks which are often relegated to long term scenarii. They should also increase their sensitivity to the potential difficulty of a quick unwinding of some positions in difficult market conditions. The risks, that we highlighted, certainly warrant i), at the micro level, a monitoring of financial institutions risk management and ii), at the macro level, of the dynamics behind potential crowded trades. It is the role of central banks and all public authorities, individually and in co-operation, to foster a risk cycle management oriented attitude, which allows combining the advantages of real and financial innovation with financial stability and sustainable growth. ...|$|R
40|$|This article investigates how French {{farmers in}} two regions, Centre and Midi-Pyrénées, could react if the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) were fully removed, {{based on a}} survey of {{intentions}} of 291 farmers carried out in 2009. The farmers surveyed were mostly specialised in field cropping, dairy and beef. Respondents had to indicate their intentions in two CAP scenarios: firstly in a ‘CAP continuation scenario’; and secondly in a ‘No CAP scenario’ where the CAP would be fully removed from 2014 onwards. ‘Intentions’ relates to their intended ten-year strategy regarding exit and, for those intending to remain, to their use of production factors and diversification activities. The determinants of farm exits induced by the CAP removal were investigated using Probit models. In addition to descriptive statistics on intentions, a cluster analysis was performed to highlight the different effects of the CAP removal on the farmers' intentions, {{both in terms of}} exit and in terms of production factors and diversification activities. For the majority of respondents CAP removal would not change their intentions. However, around 21 percent who would remain in farming if the CAP were continued, would exit if the CAP were removed. The Probit models showed that farmers located in the Centre region and in less favoured areas were more likely to exit {{in the absence of the}} CAP while they would remain if the CAP continued, a result which contrasts with the determinants of ‘natural exits’, that is to say of <b>exits</b> whatever the <b>scenario.</b> The cluster analysis highlighted the fact that responses to the removal of the CAP varied across farm systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} is a Fire and Life Safety Report on the Taylor Place Dormitory located in Phoenix, Arizona {{as part of}} the Arizona State University (ASU) downtown campus. The building was evaluated on a prescriptive basis based on the current City of Phoenix building codes and further evaluated on using performance based methods from the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) Handbook and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 101 Life Safety Code®. These building features and systems were evaluated using prescriptive methods: General construction, fire resistive construction and fire resistive separations Occupancy, Life safety features and building egress Smoke management systems and features Fire protection systems, fire sprinkler, suppression systems, fire alarm Emergency and standby power, elevators, communication systems, and lighting A performance-based analysis of the South Tower and Ground Floor Cafeteria and Assembly space using NFPA 101 Life Safety Code® Chapter 5 as a guide. The analysis of the South Tower was based on NFPA 5. 5. 3. 1 and a typical fire for the occupancy accounting for occupants, number and location, room sizes, contents, fuel properties, ventilations, and identifying the location of the item ignited. The analysis of the Ground Floor Cafeteria and Assembly Area was based on NFPA 5. 5. 3. 2 and an ultra-fast fire in the primary means of egress reducing the overall means of egress by two double door <b>exits.</b> These <b>scenarios</b> are analyzed using tenability criteria to determine if with the given the design fire, all occupants can exit safely. Taylor Place generally meets or exceeds the prescriptive requirements for the system described above provided in the building code. Two specific areas were identified requiring further analysis: the corridor and two-story vertical opening separation is not provided in the South Tower per PBC Section 712, and the reduction in the door size of the south egress corridor on the ground floor. Both of these issues were addressed in conjunction with the performance based analysis and found to be acceptable with the current set of performance based recommendations. The performance-based analysis was largely successful. The analysis of the ground floor egress given an ultrafast fire located near the southwest corner of the assembly space found occupants Required Safe Egress Time (RSET) was greater than the Available Safe Egress Time (ASET) meaning all occupants egressed safely. The visibility was lost in the cafeteria which caused the failure of the tenability criteria and the determination of the ASET. The second analysis of the two-story vertical common area in the south tower failed the tenability criteria for visibility during the first two evaluations. It was determined that the two furniture standards {{as part of the}} ASU design guidelines varied greatly in fire behavior and smoke production. As a result, the furniture in the common areas meet the recommended requirements, the corridors will not require separation from the common area. As part of the evaluation process, there are additional recommendations in the report including the addition low level egress signage in the corridors to aid egress, a smoke barrier in the entrance lobby, and the reasons are discussed in more detail in the report. Comments and recommendations {{can be found at the}} end of each section providing additional detail in specific areas. The end of the report focuses on Commissioning of fire protection and building systems. A team is needed to effectively test all of the fire protection systems in accordance with their performance requirements. Functional tests performed on each system to ensure each systems were installed correctly. For example, stair pressurization systems can rely on several fans to pressurize each stairwell. A functional test will typically quickly reveal problem areas and you may even find a motor running backwards. Valuable information is provided from this stage in the project to identify maintenance requirements and finalize documentation. Fire fighter operation overviews need to be assembled, operation and maintenance manuals need to be created for building staff, and fire safety plans need to be implemented. It is very much a documentation and punch list phase of the project...|$|R
