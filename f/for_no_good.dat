5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's {{blurring}} of Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most points about its gameplay, positively noting the latter for both its continued {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review were recycled elements, awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{branches}} of Christianity oppose cremation, including some minority Protestant groups and Orthodox. Most notably, the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches forbid cremation, as a custom, but not dogmatically. Exceptions {{are made for}} circumstances where {{it may not be}} avoided (when civil authority demands it, or epidemics) or if it may be sought for good cause, but when a cremation is willfully chosen <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> cause by the one who is deceased, he or she is not permitted a funeral in the church and may also be permanently excluded from liturgical prayers for the departed. In Orthodoxy, cremation is perceived by some a rejection of the dogma of the general resurrection.|$|E

500|$|Other figures {{associated}} with The Simpsons have publicly criticized the episode. In an April 2001 interview, Harry Shearer, {{the voice of}} Principal Skinner, recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed {{it in the trash}} can <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason, for a story we've done before with other characters.

Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason, for a story we've done before with other characters.

500|$|In the California Medical Facility, Kemper was incarcerated in {{the same}} prison block as other notorious criminals such as Herbert Mullin and Charles Manson. Kemper showed {{particular}} disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders {{at the same time}} in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as [...] "just a cold-blooded killer... killing everybody he saw <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason". However, Kemper himself commented on his [...] "self-righteous talking like that , considering what [...] done". Despite this concession, Kemper still manipulated and physically intimidated the diminutive Mullin, who, standing at , was over a foot shorter than Kemper. Kemper stated that [...] " [...] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now." [...] Shearer has also been vocal about [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] (season nine, 1997) {{one of the most controversial}} episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Principal Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong.

[...] Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in The Simpsons Ride, which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In a 2010 interview on The Howard Stern Show, Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it.|$|E

2500|$|The paratroopers disembarked {{and began}} seizing people. There were many claims of paratroopers beating people, {{clubbing}} them with rifle butts, firing rubber bullets {{at them from}} close range, making threats to kill, and hurling abuse.

2500|$|Whatever {{the meaning}} of Laius's oracle, the one {{delivered}} to Oedipus is clearly unconditional. Given our modern conception of fate and fatalism, readers of the play {{have a tendency to}} view Oedipus as a mere puppet controlled by greater forces, a man crushed by the gods and fate <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason. This, however, is not an entirely accurate reading. While it is a mythological truism that oracles exist to be fulfilled, oracles do not cause the events that lead up to the outcome. In his landmark essay [...] "On Misunderstanding the Oedipus Rex", E.R. Dodds draws a comparison with Jesus's prophecy at the Last Supper that Peter would deny him three times. Jesus knows that Peter will do this, but readers would in no way suggest that Peter was a puppet of fate being forced to deny Christ. Free will and predestination are by no means mutually exclusive, and such is the case with Oedipus.|$|E

2500|$|Unionists criticised the decision. Martin Smyth said, [...] "We {{are told}} that the two {{communities}} have to live together. We had a classic illustration of a name that brought the two communities together – Londonderry. 'London' indicates the British tradition and 'Derry' the Irish tradition. But the Government decided {{to do away with}} 'London' {{in the name of the}} Council." [...] William Ross said, [...] "Derry has never been used as the name of the city or of the island of Londonderry except as a shortened version of a longer name. The name was Derry Columbkille for centuries. It was Londonderry for centuries. Before that it was Derry Calgach [...] Those who sought the change sought it <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason. Their aim was to open a door. [...] It is beyond me how the name Derry city council will be separated from the concept of Londonderry city in the public mind. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the Republican elements in Londonderry city will ignore the name as they have always done. They now have a lever to put up Derry city right across the board. [...] People in Northern Ireland see it as an anti-British move by the most extreme Republican movements in Londonderry and the rest of Northern Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|One 1999 case, Re [...] "J" [...] (child's {{religious}} upbringing and circumcision) {{said that}} circumcision in Britain required {{the consent of}} all those with parental responsibility, or {{the permission of the}} court, acting for {{the best interests of the}} child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing Muslim father and non-practicing Christian mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without medical necessity; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a hypothetical case of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason, refuses his agreement. In such a case, a decision in favor of circumcision was said to be likely.|$|E

[...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cole {{was asked}} to address {{the pros and cons}} of the {{building}} war against Iraq in January 2003 for the journal of the University of Michigan International Institute. He warned that any invasion of Iraq would inevitably be rejected by Iraqis and the Arab world as a form of neocolonialism. He wrote, [...] "The Sunnis of Iraq could well turn to groups like al-Qaida, having lost the ideals of the Baath. Iraqi Shi'ites might become easier to recruit into Khomeinism of the Iranian sort, and become a bulwark for the shaky regime in Shi'ite Iran." [...] Considering the problem of ethnic politics, he said, [...] "A post-war Iraq may well be riven with factionalism that impedes the development of a well-ensconced new government." [...] He rejected the argument that Baathist Iraq's [...] "weapons of mass destruction" [...] or backing of terrorism posed threats to the United States. [...] Cole admitted that he had had [...] "mixed feelings" [...] on the issue—i.e., he opposed Saddam Hussein's regime, but feared disaster and opposed international illegality. He was insistent that any war would be illegal without a UN Security Council resolution (which was not obtained by the Bush administration). His position on the war resembled that of the French government, which is generally held to have opposed it. By January 2003, he said he had become [...] "cynical" [...] about the Bush administration motives for the war. On the day of the U.S. invasion Cole wrote that [...] "for all the concerns one might have about the aftermath, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the murderous Baath regime from power will be worth the sacrifices that are about to be made on all sides." [...] He has explained that this posting was not intended to show support for the invasion: [...] "The passage quoted ... was not about whether the war was legal or not. Being from a military family, it mattered to me as an ethical issue whether troops lives were being lost <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason, in an illegal boondoggle. I decided on careful deliberation that even though the war was wrong, the lives lost would not be in vain, since a tyrannical regime would have fallen.
