5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> was feats. Although common feats worked well, with {{a random}} {{chance of success}} or failure, {{uncommon}} ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
25|$|By 1885, Parliament had {{approved}} A₤2,500 {{for the construction}} of Cooper's bridle track, with the work starting at the most <b>difficult</b> <b>area,</b> the Megalong Cleft, where a zig-zag had to be cut, partly in solid rock, to reduce the grade to 1:5.5. The first recorded passage of the completed bridle track from Katoomba to Jenolan was by the Governor, Lord Carrington, in September 1887. Lord Carrington also made the first official visit to the caves at the completion of his journey, accompanied by Wilson.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to remember that unlike, for example, Roman roads, these medieval routes were not essentially physical entities—thin strips of land with physical boundaries; rather they were rights of way, sometimes with legal and traditional status. Routes tended to follow the line of least resistance, twisting and turning to avoid poorly drained areas and land that was easily overlooked. Where there was a hill to climb or a <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> to pass through, multiple tracks would develop, the traveller taking the easiest route. Routes may also have varied seasonally as changing weather affected the condition of the pathway.|$|E
25|$|The CAP {{has always}} been a <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> of EU policy to reform; it is a problem that began in the 1960s and one that has {{continued}} to the present, albeit less severely. Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament have to agree to any changes. The Parliament was involved in the process of change {{for the first time in}} 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP. Outside Brussels proper, the farming lobby's power has been a factor determining EU agricultural policy since the earliest days of integration.|$|E
25|$|Flexural anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} <b>difficult</b> <b>area.</b> It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises {{at the point where}} the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E

25|$|The {{number and}} nature of the post-oral {{segments}} in the insect head have rarely been questioned. A much more <b>difficult</b> <b>area,</b> however, has been the nature of the preoral region. The obvious contradiction between a theory that no-preoral structures are segmental, and evidence, such as for the first antennae of crustaceans, that some such structures clearly are, led workers as long ago as Lankester to posit that there has been forward migration of segments in front of the mouth. Indeed, such a process can be seen in ontogeny of the tritocerebrum, which can be seen to migrate forward as the brain develops; furthermore, although in most insects and crustaceans its ganglia are part of the brain, its commissures still loop behind it, suggesting derivation from a more posterior position.|$|E
25|$|African honeybees abscond (abandon {{the hive}} and any food store {{to start over}} in a new location) more readily than European honeybees. This is not {{necessarily}} a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with insufficient stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the Southern States of the United States, reaching as far north as the Chesapeake Bay in the east. The cold-weather limits of the African bee have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range. This is a more <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> to prepare bees for early pollination placement in, such as is required for the production of almonds. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about Cleveland's early eruptive history as its {{remoteness}} makes it a <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> to investigate, and discrepancies in names have caused confusion between events there and those on nearby Carlisle.

[...] In observed history, Mount Cleveland may have first erupted in 1744; the first confirmed eruption occurred in 1828. The volcano erupted again in 1836 (possibly), 1893, 1897 (possibly), 1929 (possibly), 1932, and 1938 (possibly).|$|E

500|$|Because only bare {{details are}} known of Bosch's life, {{interpretation}} {{of his work}} can be an extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> for academics as it is largely reliant on conjecture. Individual motifs and elements of symbolism may be explained, but so far relating these {{to each other and}} to his work as a whole has remained elusive. The enigmatic scenes depicted on the panels of the inner triptych of The Garden of Earthly Delights have been studied by many scholars, who have often arrived at contradictory interpretations. Analyses based on symbolic systems ranging from the alchemical, astrological, and heretical to the folkloric and subconscious have all attempted to explain the complex objects and ideas presented in the work. Until the early 20th century, Bosch's paintings were generally thought to incorporate attitudes of Medieval didactic literature and sermons. Charles De Tolnay wrote that, ...|$|E

[...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] sees a rivalry between MI5 and MI6. According to the producers, there have been documented rivalries between the two organisations. The episode also based a true story of a man joining a militant group and was paid with a Russian army helicopter, as the group could not afford to pay him in cash. [...] "A Prayer for My Daughter" [...] deals with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Because the topic is controversial, it was a <b>difficult</b> <b>area</b> to work with without offending people from both sides. The producers made the episode as neutral as possible by consulting with experts from both sides of the conflict. Richards also wanted to fairly represent it by addressing the issue as political and not religious.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Tree-based path {{planners}} {{have been shown}} to be well suited to solve various high dimensional motion planning problems. Here we present a variant of the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planning algorithm that is able to explore narrow passages or <b>difficult</b> <b>areas</b> more effectively. We show that both workspace obstacle information and C-space information can be used when deciding which direction to grow. The method includes many ways to grow the tree, some taking into account the obstacles in the environment. This planner works best in <b>difficult</b> <b>areas</b> when planning for free flying rigid or articulated robots. Indeed, whereas the standard RRT can face difficulties planning in a narrow passage, the tree based planner presented here works best in these areas. I...|$|R
