5|$|The State Attorney's Office {{represents}} {{the state in}} legal procedures. As of August 2012, Mladen Bajić is the <b>General</b> <b>State</b> Attorney, and there are twenty-three deputies in the central office and lower-ranking State Attorneys at fifteen county and thirty-three municipal State Attorney's Offices. The <b>General</b> <b>State</b> Attorney is appointed by the parliament.

5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the <b>general</b> <b>state</b> of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|In the low ground {{west of the}} Passchendaele Ridge, {{three months}} of {{constant}} shelling had blocked the watercourses that normally provided drainage. When rain began falling {{on the night of}} 4 October—which continued intermittently for the next three days—the battlefield was once again transformed into a quagmire of mud, making movement extremely difficult. Gough and Plumer told Haig that they favoured ending the campaign on account of the change in the weather and <b>general</b> <b>state</b> of the battlefield, however {{the decision was made to}} continue the offensive to gain more favourable winter positions on higher ground. The Battle of Poelcappelle and First Battle of Passchendaele both resulted in many casualties for both sides and failed to achieve any appreciable advance opposite Passchendaele, although they did provide a slightly better starting line for another attack. The four divisions of the Canadian Corps were transferred from the Lens sector to the Ypres Salient to capture Passchendaele. The Canadian Corps relieved the II Anzac Corps on 18 October, from its position along the valley between Gravenstafel Ridge and the heights at Passchendaele and immediately began planning for the offensive. Interestingly, it was virtually the same front as had been occupied by the 1st Canadian Division back in April 1915.|$|E

25|$|The Wake of Deconstruction (1994) {{approaches}} the <b>general</b> <b>state</b> of deconstruction {{in light of}} the backlash it faced {{over the course of the}} 1980s and early '90s. Through the double lenses of Paul de Man’s posthumous Nazi collaboration scandal and the academic community’s reaction to the murder of feminist legal theorist Mary Joe Frug, Johnson discusses allegory, feminism, and the misinterpretation of deconstruction.|$|E

25|$|Arizona is one {{of seven}} states {{that do not have}} a {{specified}} lieutenant governor. The secretary of state is the first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. The line of succession also includes the attorney <b>general,</b> <b>state</b> treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. Since 1977, four secretaries of state and one attorney general have risen to Arizona's governorship through these means.|$|E

Few users of the E-meter claim that it does anything to the subject. To most, it does no more than suggest to the operator a change of mental, emotional, or parasympathetic nervous state or activity.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully {{independent}} from it {{as a separate}} institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the Supreme People's Assembly. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet {{is not only the}} highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the <b>general</b> <b>State</b> management organ.|$|E
25|$|Cancer can {{be treated}} by surgery, chemotherapy, {{radiation}} therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy (including immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibody therapy) and synthetic lethality. The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and {{the stage of the}} disease, as well as the <b>general</b> <b>state</b> of the patient (performance status). A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development. Under current estimates, two in five people will have cancer {{at some point in their}} lifetime.|$|E
25|$|These {{claims were}} that rates of {{geological}} change are always uniform and gradual {{and that the}} <b>general</b> <b>state</b> of the world also remains uniform (that is, there is no progression or directionality in the long run). Far from using Hutton's field data {{to show that the}} earth has passed through vast epochs of change, Lyell drew on the peculiarly static spirit of Hutton's vision to conceive an earth that, although unimaginably old, had changed hardly at all.|$|E

25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>state</b> {{of health}} care in Myanmar is poor. The {{military}} government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of the public health system in the state, in the fiscal year 2002-2003.|$|E
25|$|In <b>general,</b> <b>state</b> law {{has dealt}} with whether {{and to what extent}} {{government}} can permit or assist the erection and maintenance of boundary demarcations on public property. It has not dealt with the nature of the aggregation agreement or recognized an eruv as having legal effect or as implementing a meaningful change in real property ownership or tenancy. For purposes of accident liability, trespass, insurance, and other secular matters occurring on Shabbat, State law treats the properties within an eruv as continuing to be separate parcels.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} branch {{is headed by}} the elected governor.

The offices of governor and lieutenant governor have four-year terms, which are next up for election in 2020. The governor has a cabinet consisting of appointed leaders of various state government agencies, called commissioners. The other elected constitutional offices are secretary of state, attorney <b>general,</b> <b>state</b> auditor, and state treasurer.|$|E
50|$|On June 7, {{the case}} was officially turned over to SEIDO, the {{organized}} crime division of the federal Attorney <b>General's</b> office, because <b>state</b> investigators had reportedly received threats from organized crime figures that warned them not to dig too deep into the case.

25|$|Largely {{the same}} groups were {{responsible}} for the mass killing operations during the civil war, collectivisation, and the Great Terror. These groups were associated with Yefim Yevdokimov (1891–1939) and operated in the Secret Operational Division within <b>General</b> <b>State</b> Political Administration (OGPU) in 1929–31. Evdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai. He appears to have continued advising Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov on security matters, and the latter relied on Evdokimov's former colleagues to carry out the mass killing operations that are known as the Great Terror in 1937–38.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2008 election, Vanessa Niekamp, an {{employee}} of Ohio's Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS), {{at the behest of}} its director, Helen Jones-Kelley, used state computers to search for information on Joe Wurzelbacher. On November 20, 2008, Niekamp reported the violation to the State Inspector <b>General.</b> <b>State</b> and local officials completed an investigation into Jones-Kelley's order, concluding that the searches were improper. On December 17, 2008, Jones-Kelley resigned. In response to the event, Republican Ohio state representative Shannon Jones sponsored House Bill 648, which mandates civil and criminal penalties for improper access of personal information on state databases. On January 6, 2009, Governor Ted Strickland signed the legislation, which became effective after 90 days.|$|E
