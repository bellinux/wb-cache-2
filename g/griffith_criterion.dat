The refined version implies that the entropy {{production}} inequality should holds locally rather than globally from the thermodynamic point of view. Within the irreversible thermodynamic framework developed by Rice [J. Mech. Phys.

It is further shown that widely-used power laws for crack growth are just certain homogeneous kinetic rate laws, so it is concluded that the power laws directly lead to the refined <b>Griffith</b> <b>criterion.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{modified}} <b>Griffith</b> <b>criterion</b> for {{a two-dimensional}} array of aligned elliptical cracks with a long-range interaction potential is presented. In accordance with observation, {{the pattern of}} cracks {{is assumed to be}} fractal, with a two-point correlation dimension Dc indicating a power-law distribution of crack spacings r, and a power-law exponent D of the crack length distribution. From a simple dislocation theory of the seismic source D is proportional to the seismic 6 -value if an individual earthquake or acoustic emission is produced by displacement on a specific fault or crack in the population. As a result, the theory is applicable to incremental damage rather than the long-term evolution of crack systems with large displace-ments. The long-range interaction between cracks is taken to be elastic, implying a positive interaction potential proportional to r-'. Two models are presented for the spatio-temporal evolution of the resulting seismicity due to: (A) progressive alignment of epicentres along an incipient fault plane; and (B) clustering of epicentres around potential nucleation points on an existing fault trace.

In the latter limit, the fracture toughness K remains close to the classical value K≈ 2 (γE) ^ 1 / 2 with γ the surface tension and E the Young modulus, while in the strong roughness limit it becomes significantly large [> 2 (γE) ^ 1 / 2] following the asymptotic behavior K≈ 2 (γE) ^ 1 / 2 (σ/ξ^H) ^ 1 / 2. ...|$|E
40|$|Both {{energy and}} stress {{criteria}} are necessary conditions for fracture but neither one nor the other are sufficient. Experiments by Parvizi et al. on transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates corroborate this assumption. Thanks to the singularity {{at the tip}} of the notch, the incremental form of the energy criterion gives a lower bound of admissible crack lengths. On the contrary, the stress criterion leads to an upper bound. The consistency between these two conditions provides a general form of a criterion for crack nucleation. It enjoys the desirable property of coinciding with the usual <b>Griffith</b> <b>criterion</b> to study the crack growth and with the stress criterion for the uniform traction along a straight edge.
