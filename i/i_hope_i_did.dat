2500|$|Singer {{and actress}} Bette Midler became {{recognized}} as a gay icon in the 1970s. After performing on Broadway, Midler began performing at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in the city, where she became close to her piano accompanist Barry Manilow, who produced her first major album The Divine Miss M (1973).

6000|$|I hesitated at first, to promise, but on {{thinking}} {{of the state of}} her mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and think too, of how such a story might become distorted, nay, infallibly would, in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right.

Where would have been my duty to my poor lost boy, if I had not tried everything!' ...|$|E

60|$|MISS P.--Oh, how glad I am you are come, Mrs. Bonnington. Have {{you brought}} me that pretty hymn you promised me? You always keep your promises, even to poor governesses.

40|$|Well, {{the theory}} of {{scattering}} of elastic waves is difficult. I don 2 ̆ 7 t want to minimize that, but I thought I might make a few diversionary introductory remarks.

60|$|I heard Mademoiselle asserting {{her right}} {{to one of the}} best seats, and then declaring that she yielded 'as the young must give place to the old,' a little cut at the Princess Dowager of Conde. She bade M. de Fiesque follow with her {{carriage}} and properties, and we were left in the most wonderful confusion in that dark court, the carriages moving away one after another, the mounted servants carrying torches, and the guards trampling and clinking behind them; servants, gentlemen, and ladies running about wildly, some of the women crying and wringing their hands. Among these was Madame de Fiesque, who was of a timid nature, and was frightened out of her wits at the notion of having to follow, whither she did not even know, while I was equally wild, though <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not make quite so much noise, about my son.|$|E
60|$|My Lords, I {{hope this}} was a good and {{reasonable}} ground for me to anticipate the defence which Mr. Hastings would make in this House,--namely, on the known, recognized, infamous character of Nundcomar, with regard to certain proceedings there charged at large, with regard to one forgery for which he suffered and two other forgeries with which Mr. Hastings charged him. I, who found that the Commons of Great Britain had received that very identical charge of Nundcomar, and given it to me in trust to make it good, did naturally, I hope excusably, (for that is the only ground upon which I stand,) endeavor to support that credit upon which the House acted. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so; and I hope that the goodness of that intention may excuse me, if I went a little too far on that occasion. I would have endeavored to support that credit, which it was much Mr. Hastings's interest to shake, and which he had before attempted to shake.|$|E
60|$|Solivet had hinted as much, and the {{protection}} of my child was a powerful engine; but--shall I confess it?--it galled and chafed me terribly to feel myself taken once more into leading-strings. I, who had for three years governed my house as a happy honoured wife, and for three more had been a chatelaine, complimented by the old uncle, and after his death, the sole ruler of my son's domain; I was not at all inclined to return into tutelage, and I could not look on my mother after these six years, as quite the same conclusive authority as I thought her when I left her. The spirit of self-assertion and self-justification was strong within me, and though <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not reply with ingratitude or disrespect, I would make no absolute promise till I had heard what my brother Walwyn said of my position in its secular aspect, and the Abbe Bonchamps in its religious point of view. So I bade my mother good-night, and went to see how Cecile fared in her new quarters, which, to her grief, were in a wing separated from mine by a long corridor.|$|E

I placed an old straw hat of Dick's in a prominent position, called loudly to an imaginary 'John' {{not to go}} without the letters, and then opened it. He {{turned out to be}} the local reporter. I need not have been alarmed. He was much the more nervous of the two, and was so full of excuses that had I not come to his rescue I believe he would have gone away forgetting what he'd come for. Nothing save an overwhelming sense of duty to the Public (with a capital P) could have induced him to inflict himself upon me. Could I give him a few details which would enable him to set rumour right? I immediately saw visions of headlines: 'Domestic Tragedy!' 'Eminent Author blown up by his own Daughter!' 'Once Happy Home now a Mere Wreck!' It seemed to me our only plan was to enlist this amiable young man upon our side; <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not overdo it. My idea was to convey the impression that one glance at him had convinced me he was the best and noblest of mankind; that I felt I could rely upon his wit and courage to save us from a notoriety that, so far as I was concerned, would sadden my whole life; and that if he did so eternal gratitude and admiration would be the least I could lay at his feet. I can be nice when I try. People have said so. We parted with only a pressure of the hand, and I hope he won't get into trouble, but I see The Berkshire Courier is going to be deprived of its prey.
