40|$|This {{master of}} {{economics}} paper discuss that the globalization has lead to increasing internationalization among small Swedish IT- {{companies in the}} service sector. Sweden {{has a long history}} of foreign trade but in the beginning of the industrialization only large companies that produced goods answered for the foreign trade. Before, the Swedish companies begun their operations abroad in fairly nearby markets and only gradually penetrated far-flung countries. Now this is no longer possible. When small companies nowadays seek growth in other countries there is no time internationalize with the same approaches as before, especially when the company offers a service. Services have special characteristics that must be considered while developing establishments plan for the foreign market. Our question at issue is: Which factors are relevant for small Swedish IT companies in the service sector while establishing in foreign markets? And the aim of the investigation is: To map out, analyze and give recommendations for possible approaches when a small Swedish IT- company in the service sector wants to establish in the Spanish market. (The investigation is made for a specific small Swedish IT-company in the service sector that is planning an establishment in Spain. This company is called the case study company.) From the theoretical part, where relevant theories were presented, we picked out the most suitable theories and variables for our investigation. These were; barriers and factors that influence the choice of entry mode, network theories, acquisition, greenfield investment, licensing, franchising, joint ventures and strategic alliances. Furthermore we choose two new establishment theories; offer a generally superior product/service and launch a new marketing innovation. On the basis of these relevant theories, a frame of reference was developed. The whole investigation was based on this frame of reference. The investigation is a case study. We have used the following methods for collecting data; participation study, literature study, interviews and questionnaires. The investigation was made in two different phases. The first phase consisted of the literature study and the questionnaire, the main purpose of this phase was to distinguish external barriers and factors on the Spanish market that are relevant to consider while developing the <b>establishment</b> <b>plan.</b> Phase two consist of interviews with the Swedish trade company but also with other small IT-companies in the service sector that are established in foreign markets. The main purpose with this phase is to get information about all that considerers the establishment of small IT-companies in the service sector, this includes barriers, factors and possible approaches. During these two phases a participation study took place in the case study company. This study gave us information about the culture, structure and way of working in the case study company. We could from this information distinguish internal barriers and factors. The collected data and information is presented in the empirical part. It is furthermore compared and analyzed with the frame of reference. This led to the result that answers the aim of the investigation. The result consists of recommendations to the case study company such as that they have to develop their business plan, but also consider internal and external barriers and factors, for an example their resources and the demand on the Spanish market. The best approach when establishing in Spain is internal development. This means that a local office is established on the foreign market, here should, preferably, local inhabitants work that knows the language and the social and cultural life. The optimum is if this person can start its work in Sweden at the office of the case study company. The reason for this is to integrate the new staff into the company and its culture. Starting a local office gives the case study company a possibility to control and coordinate their internal activities, which are essentials parts of the development of their international business plan. The result of the investigation shows that it is necessary with a well thought-out <b>establishment</b> <b>plan</b> for how the company should proceed when going to foreign markets. This plan has to be adjusted to the branch of trade, the company, the service and the foreign market on matter. Each company has unique characteristics that affect the formulation of the <b>establishment</b> <b>plan.</b> However it is also possible to see similarities between a certain type of company or branch of trade, as within the group, small Swedish IT companies in the service sector...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an early {{evaluation}} of the Swedish Establishment Reform which was enacted in 2010 {{with the goal of}} facilitating and speeding up the integration of refugees and their family into the labor market and the society. From December 1, 2010 the reform transferred the responsibility for the integration of newly-arrived refugees from the municipalities to the government funded Public Employment Service through which those eligible would get an <b>establishment</b> <b>plan</b> and a coach. The reform was motived by concern over the low employment level and slow integration of refugees. Our approach is to compare the outcomes of the treatment group, which took part in establishment activities and arrived between December 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011, to those of the comparison group, which arrived in the eleven months preceding the Reform and participated in municipal introduction programs, controlling for a rich set of observables, including country of birth and date of residence permit. Outcomes are measured in terms of employment and earnings in 2012 for the treatment group and in 2011 for the comparison group. Our data comes from registers held by Statistics Sweden and the Public Employment Service and covers all immigrants. Although there are good reasons to expect positive effects of the Reform we find no significant difference in employment or earnings between the treatment group and the comparison group...|$|E

40|$|Treball Final del Màster Universitari en Llengua Anglesa per al Comerç Internacional. Codi: SAR 016. Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 The title {{might seem}} {{ambiguous}} {{at the very}} first sight. However, let us imagine how to compress in a title {{the whole process of}} the transformation of a company. This project is based on the situation of a local company in Castellón, that is, Juan Serrano International Trade Agency and the aim was to reconvert and create a brand new enterprise from the existing one integrating the theoretical and practical concepts acquired during the formative stage in the ELIT Master. After carrying an extensive analysis and feasibility study showing both strengths and weaknesses, several proposals for improvement are disclosed. Materials for the present study include a mixture of both a marketing and finance plan including a cost-benefit analysis to reverse the current economic situation forcing a slow but effective recovery. Results show what might be the most convenient steps to follow for the company Juan Serrano to increase its benefits, to expand and to become bigger and better among its rivalry. An example of those results is the implementation and optimization of the new technologies to better manage the internal and professional company affairs leading to a change in its corporate image. A more customer-friendly webpage redesign and the application of a CRM strategy are portrayed as the most salient highlights. As for the company, the implementation of a warehouse and a labeling and packaging system would also help to improve the life of the company at the long term, just as the managing system which would also be improved thanks to a balance scorecard and a new staff <b>establishment</b> <b>plan.</b> Other minor changes such as a change in the company‟s organization structure and other promotional and distribution strategies would also be proposed; all the aforementioned, with a detailed cost plan that will indicate the workability of the different proposals. Although it might seem this work is too specific for this specific company; many clues can be taken for any reader wanting to implement all the information and techniques provided. Thanks to the didactic way in which it has been written, this work aims to approach any kind of audience who might want to introduce themselves in the business world or those who already in the business world want to learn more, give another vision to the company or just have an enjoyable reading time while thinking about how to change things, how to get better and how to keep all what has been already achieved...|$|E

40|$|The {{induction}} voltage adder is an accelerator architecture used in recent designs of pulsed-power driven x-ray radiographic {{systems such as}} Sandia National Laboratories’ Radiographic Integrated Test Stand (RITS), the Atomic Weapons <b>Establishment’s</b> <b>planned</b> Hydrus Facility, and the Naval Research Laboratory’s Mercury. Each of these designs relies on magnetic insulation to prevent electron loss across the anode-cathode gap {{in the vicinity of}} the adder as well as in the coaxial transmission line. Particle-in-cell simulations of the RITS adder and transmission line show that, as magnetic insulation is being established during a pulse, some electron loss occurs across the gap. Sufficient delay in the cavity pulse timings provides an opportunity for high-momentum electrons to deeply penetrate the cavities of the adder cells where they can excite radio-frequency resonances. These oscillations may be amplified in subsequent gaps, resulting in oscillations in the output power. The specific modes supported by the RITS- 6 accelerator and details of the mechanism by which they are excited are presented in this paper...|$|R
