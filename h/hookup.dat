5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and <b>hookup</b> on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{contributed to the}} cancellation. The XF-85's {{deficiencies}} revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also {{a factor in the}} cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful <b>hookup.</b> Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago {{writes that the}} Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and <b>hookup</b> culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the electricity production plant (e.g. wind turbine and solar panel), infrastructure for energy storage and power conversion and a hook-up to the regular electricity grid is usually needed and/or foreseen. Although a <b>hookup</b> to the regular electricity grid is not essential, it helps to decrease costs by allowing financial recompensation schemes. In the developing world however, the start-up cost for this equipment is generally too high, thus leaving {{no choice but to}} opt for alternative set-ups.|$|E
25|$|Carrington departs for the Space Centre, {{where he}} aims to unmask the alien ambassadors before {{the eyes of}} the world on an {{international}} TV <b>hookup</b> – and then call on the powers of the Earth to blast their spaceship from the skies. No one else knows what Carrington intends to say on TV: his plan calls for a surprise revelation of the alien nature of the space-suited figures. But the Doctor manages to send a radio message, and the Brigadier and UNIT soldiers rescue he and Liz, and also apprehend Reegan and his thugs. They race to the Space Centre where the Brigadier arrests Carrington before he can make his broadcast. He is taken away, protesting that he was only performing his moral duty. The Doctor arranges for Ralph Cornish and Liz to return the ambassadors to their own people, so that the three human astronauts can be released.|$|E
25|$|Moscow of 1885 had no {{sanitation}} and {{no water}} supply network in present sense: water flowed from Mytishchi {{in the open}} trench of the Rostokino Aqueduct and was distributed to {{a limited number of}} fountains on the central squares. In the 1870s the city built three local water networks of inadequate capacity that were abandoned by 1885. After long disputes between supporters of municipal and private water supply, in 1888 the city settled on building a single pressurized water system. Key element of the system – two tower-like water reservoirs near present-day Rizhsky Rail Terminal – were partially financed with Alekseyev's personal funds. The main distribution pipeline, 108 versts long, was completed during Alekseyev's tenure in 1892. In 1896 the system reached individual houses along the Garden Ring and in 1912 the city was able to require mandatory <b>hookup</b> to running water for all new buildings within the city limits.|$|E

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the redevelopment plan, Marshall Heights residents began to demand in August 1949 that the freeze on improvements be lifted. City officials refused, arguing that with half of all homes in the neighborhood facing condemnation for safety reasons, redevelopment was the only option. The city also argued that it would be too expensive to build water and sewer lines along the existing street plan, and that residents would be unable to afford the <b>hookup</b> and frontage fees. In September 1949, District engineers staked out sewer, water, and natural gas lines along two streets in Marshall Heights to demonstrate the difficulties in construction and prove how costly the effect would be to residents. From this example, the city claimed that laying water and sewer lines in Marshall Heights would cost $1.2 million more than in any other neighborhood, and said that razing all the homes in the area, realigning streets around hills, regrading streets, and filling in valleys was the only feasible and cost-effective option.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after his}} {{experimental}} Washington station signed on, DuMont began experimental coaxial cable hookups between his laboratories in Passaic, New Jersey, {{and his two}} stations. It is {{said that one of}} those broadcasts on the <b>hookup</b> announced that the U.S. had dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. [...] This was later considered to be the official beginning of the DuMont Network by both Thomas T. Goldsmith, the network's chief engineer and DuMont's best friend, and DuMont himself. Regular network service began on August 15, 1946, on WABD and W3XWT. In 1947, W3XWT became WTTG, named after Goldsmith. The pair were joined in 1949 by WDTV (channel 3) in Pittsburgh.|$|E

500|$|In 1967, Ohio {{businessman}} Daniel H. Overmeyer {{looked to}} start his own TV network, and sought a merger with Mutual; the offer was quickly rebuffed, but three Mutual stockholders joined with eleven other investors to buy Overmyer's <b>hookup</b> and rename it the United Network. The net (and its only offering, [...] "The Las Vegas Show") folded after only a month on the air. On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming. While the Spanish-language service would last only six months, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates. It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks. Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from Mutual.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1936, Mutual lost another of its {{founding}} members when WLW departed. The network, however, {{was in the midst}} of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship station, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England. There was good reason for this affiliation: [...] Shepard had been involved with the founding of Mutual, and served on its Board of Directors. Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KWK–St. Louis, Mo.; KSO–Des Moines, Iowa; WMT–Cedar Rapids, Iowa; KOIL–Omaha, Neb.; and KFOR–Lincoln, Neb. The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stations—KHJ–Los Angeles, KFRC–San Francisco, KGB–San Diego, and KDB–Santa Barbara—along with six California affiliates and, via shortwave <b>hookup,</b> two more in Hawaii. Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.|$|E

500|$|Phase One of the Shuttle–Mir Program {{began on}} February 3, 1994, with {{the launch of}} Space Shuttle Discovery on its 18th mission, STS-60. The eight-day mission was the first shuttle flight of that year, the first flight of a Russian Cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, aboard the American shuttle, and marked the start of {{increased}} cooperation in space for the two nations, 37 years after the Space Race began. Part of an international agreement on human space flight, the mission was the second flight of the Spacehab pressurized module and marked the hundredth [...] "Getaway Special" [...] payload to fly in space. The primary payload for the mission was the Wake Shield Facility (or WSF), a device designed to generate new semiconductor films for advanced electronics. The WSF was flown {{at the end of}} Discoverys robotic arm {{over the course of the}} flight. During the mission, the astronauts aboard Discovery also carried out various experiments aboard the Spacehab module in the Orbiter's payload bay, and took part in a live bi-directional audio and downlink video <b>hookup</b> between themselves and the three Cosmonauts on board Mir, Valeri Polyakov, Viktor Afanasyev and Yury Usachev (flying Mir expeditions LD-4 and EO-15).|$|E
500|$|The album's second track [...] "Black Skinhead" [...] has {{alternately}} {{been called}} an industrial hip hop song and [...] "a galloping punk-rap manifesto". [...] "I Am a God" [...] {{was inspired by}} a [...] "diss" [...] from a major fashion designer, who informed West of his invitation to a widely anticipated runway show on the condition he agree to not attend other shows. [...] "I'm in It" [...] began with a different sample and melody, but West removed the sample and Rubin edited the track down from a six-minute arrangement. [...] "Blood on the Leaves," [...] which samples Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of [...] "Strange Fruit" [...] and was the first track in the first incarnation of the track list, is an example of West's signature dichotomy in which he melds the sacred and profane. [...] "Strange Fruit", first recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939, brought the lynchings of black Americans to a [...] "startling poignancy," [...] creating [...] "one of the most towering, important songs of the 20th century." [...] West's anthemic re-telling instead details an MDMA-fueled <b>hookup</b> and the perils of fame.|$|E
500|$|With {{the first}} prototype's repairs completed, it also joined the flight test program, {{completing}} captive flights. While in flight, the Goblin was stable, easy to fly, and recoverable from spins, although initial estimates of a 648mph (1,043km/h) top speed proved optimistic. The first test flights revealed that turbulence during {{approach to the}} B-29 was significant, leading to the addition of upper and lower fins at the extreme rear fuselage, {{as well as two}} wingtip fins to compensate for the increased directional instability in docking. All the initial flights had the hook secured in a fixed position, but when the hook was stowed and later raised, the resulting buffeting added to the difficulty in attempting a <b>hookup.</b> To address the problem, small aerodynamic fairings were added to the hook well that reduced the buffeting when the hook was extended and retracted. [...] When testing resumed, on the 18 March 1948 test flight, Schoch continued to have difficulty in hooking up, striking and damaging the trapeze's nose-stabilizing section, before resorting to another emergency belly landing. After repairs to the trapeze, Schoch flew the first prototype on 8 April 1949, completing a 30-minute free flight test, but after three attempts, abandoned his efforts and resorted to another belly landing at Muroc.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that reducing rape and sexual assault will require dismantling the rape culture {{that exists in the}} U. S. that supports and condones sexual violence against women (e. g., Brownmiller, 1975; Burt, 1980). Sexual media maintain rape culture by frequently portraying rape myths and sexual stereotypes (e. g., Cuklanz, 1999; Ward, 1995), like traditional heterosexual scripts. These portrayals then increase acceptance of these myths and stereotypes in viewers (e. g., Emmers-Sommer, Pauley, Hanzal,& Triplett, 2006; Kahlor & Eastin, 2011). A two-month longitudinal panel survey was conducted to better understand the theoretical mechanisms that may explain how college students' sexual media use may indirectly influence their propensity for engaging in unwanted <b>hookups</b> through their endorsement of traditional heterosexual scripts, sexual self-efficacy, and perceived peer norms. The results were different for men and women. For women, the results suggested that their sexual media diet at Time 1 increased their endorsement of traditional heterosexual scripts at Time 2, their endorsement of traditional heterosexual scripts at Time 1 increased their propensity for engaging in unwanted <b>hookups</b> at Time 2, and their propensity for engaging in unwanted <b>hookups</b> at Time 1 decreased their sexual self-efficacy at Time 2. For men, the results suggested that their sexual media diet at Time 1 decreased their sexual self-efficacy at Time 2 and their perceived peer norms regarding <b>hookups</b> at Time 1 increased their propensity for engaging in unwanted <b>hookups</b> at Time 2. Together the results suggest sexual media may be negatively impacting college students' sexual attitudes and beliefs and their sexual self-efficacy, which may lead them to be {{more likely to engage in}} unwanted <b>hookups.</b> Limitations and future directions are discussed...|$|R
