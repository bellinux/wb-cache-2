30|$|However, after <b>eight</b> <b>time</b> units the {{situation}} is very different, as already observed earlier.

Furthermore, {{the variance in the}} average concentrations is much lower. After one time unit, the difference between the highest and lowest concentrations is 101.1 – 81.6 [*]=[*] 19.5 (which is 19.3 % of the highest concentration). However, after <b>eight</b> <b>time</b> units, this difference is 365.0 – 357.1 [*]=[*] 7.9 (which is only 2.2 % of the highest concentration).
