5|$|The {{supposedly}} higher {{status of}} cavalry in the 4th century is also open to <b>doubt.</b> <b>This</b> view is {{largely based on}} underestimating the importance of cavalry in the 2nd century. Cavalry always had higher status than infantry in the Principate: {{in the time of}} Domitian (r. 81–96), auxiliary cavalry was paid 20–40% more than auxiliary infantry.|$|E
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to <b>doubt</b> <b>this</b> idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} medieval period, {{large-scale}} conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and {{large numbers of}} converts are recorded {{within a year of}} the mission's arrival in Kent. By 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2June 597; {{there is no reason to}} <b>doubt</b> <b>this</b> date, but there is no other evidence for it. A letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598 mentions the number of converts made, but does not mention any baptism of the king in 597, although it is clear that by 601 he had been converted. The royal baptism probably took place at Canterbury but Bede does not mention the location.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>doubt</b> <b>this</b> traditional account, arguing {{instead that}} the monarchy {{evolved into a}} government led by elected magistrates. Remnants of the monarchy, however, were reflected in republican institutions, such as the religious office of rex sacrorum ("king of the sacred") and the interregnum (a period of time presided over by an interrex when the offices of consul, praetor, and dictator were all vacant). There, is, however, certainly evidence that the early Republic {{was a time of}} violent change, with the word rex carrying the same connotations as tyrant and laws which declared forfeit the life and property of any man who plotted to install himself as a king or tyrant.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, <b>doubt</b> <b>this</b> 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
5|$|Augustine was {{accompanied}} by Laurence of Canterbury, his eventual successor to the archbishopric, {{and a group of}} about 40 companions, some of whom were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted {{by the nature of the}} task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere. In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent. They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597. In the early medieval period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent. Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2 June 597; there is no reason to <b>doubt</b> <b>this</b> date, although there is no other evidence for it. Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted. His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, a major fault was {{encountered}} at Haig – with this, {{the future}} of the pit was in <b>doubt.</b> <b>This,</b> combined with the political situation, and the miners' strike in 1984–85, contributed to problems at the colliery. The workforce attempted to open a new face, but a decision had been taken to close, and after two years of recovery work, Haig finally ceased mining on 31 March 1986. Today there is no mining carried out in Whitehaven.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>doubt</b> <b>this</b> biographical {{interpretation}} of Nemean 7 {{since it is}} largely based on marginal comments by scholiasts and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable. The fact that Pindar gave {{different versions of the}} myth may simply reflect the needs of different genres, and does not necessarily indicate a personal dilemma. Nemean 7 in fact is the most controversial and obscure of Pindar's victory odes, and scholars ancient and modern have been ingenious and imaginative in their attempts to explain it, so far with no agreed success.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the military}} intervention by a multi-state coalition acting under the Security Council mandate since 19 March 2011 occasioned an international armed conflict between Libya and the intervening states.

25|$|The {{remaining}} {{evidence for}} Thucydides's life comes from rather less reliable later ancient sources. According to Pausanias, someone named Oenobius {{was able to}} get a law passed allowing Thucydides to return to Athens, presumably sometime shortly after the city's surrender {{and the end of the}} war in 404 BC. Pausanias goes on to say that Thucydides was murdered on his way back to Athens. Many <b>doubt</b> <b>this</b> account, seeing evidence to suggest he lived as late as 397 BC.

With a reduced army and fleet, Hamilcar commenced his operations. Romans had divided their forces, Consul L. Caelius Metellus was near Lilybaeum, while Numerius Fabius Buteo was besieging Drepanum at that time. Hamilcar probably fought an inconclusive battle at Drepanum, but there is cause to <b>doubt</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
25|$|England led 10–6 {{early in}} the second half, with a try to Andy Farrell late in the first and one to {{replacement}} forward Chris Joynt 5 minutes into the second, both coming about through mistakes from Australia's fullback, Tim Brasher. A try to Mark Coyne levelled the score at 10–10. But England's Jason Robinson scored after another Australian handling error by winger John Hopoate with twelve minutes remaining. Another England try, this time from an interception by Paul Newlove put the result beyond <b>doubt.</b> <b>This</b> game attracted 4.2 million viewers.|$|E
25|$|A hadith {{is said to}} be mutawatir if it was {{reported}} by a significant, though unspecified, number of narrators at each level in the chain of narration, thus reaching the succeeding generation through multiple chains of narration leading back to its source.

In contrast, an ahaad hadith is a narration the chain of which has not reached a number sufficient to qualify as mutawatir.|$|E
