25|$|Some anesthetics like {{ketamine}} and <b>etomidate.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{anaesthetist}} or anesthesiologist places intravenous and arterial {{lines and}} injects an analgesic, usually fentanyl, intravenously, followed within minutes by an induction agent (usually propofol or <b>etomidate)</b> {{to render the}} patient unconscious.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also an}} {{increase}} in the number and affinity of glucocorticoid receptors. Levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin, which normally bind cortisol, are decreased, resulting in increased levels of free cortisol. Furthermore, anaesthesia drugs like <b>etomidate</b> could interfere with the HPA axis.|$|E
25|$|In some {{patients}} a specific reason for adrenal insufficiency can be suspected, such as prior intake of corticosteroids that suppressed the HPA axis, {{or use of}} enzyme inducing drugs such as phenytoin. Treatment with imidazole drugs such as <b>etomidate,</b> ketoconazole and miconazole can also suppress the HPA axis, as well as drugs used specifically for this purpose, such as metyrapone.|$|E
25|$|Since then, {{some states}} have used other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, <b>etomidate,</b> or {{fast-acting}} benzodiazepines like midazolam. Many states have since bought lethal injection drugs from foreign furnishers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of furnishers or execution team members. In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Thiopental is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} drug for inducing unconsciousness, since it causes {{loss of consciousness}} upon a single circulation through the brain due to its high lipophilicity. Only a few other drugs, such as methohexital, <b>etomidate,</b> or propofol, {{have the capability to}} induce anesthesia so rapidly. (Narcotics such as fentanyl are inadequate as induction agents for anesthesia.) Supporters argue that since the thiopental is given at a much higher dose than for medically induced coma protocols, it is effectively impossible for the condemned to wake up.|$|E
25|$|Many new {{intravenous}} and inhalational anesthetics {{were developed}} and brought into clinical {{use during the}} second half of the 20th century. Paul Janssen (1926–2003), the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, is credited with the development of over 80 pharmaceutical compounds. Janssen synthesized nearly all of the butyrophenone class of antipsychotic agents, beginning with haloperidol (1958) and droperidol (1961). These agents were rapidly integrated into the practice of anesthesia. In 1960, Janssen's team synthesized fentanyl, the first of the piperidinone-derived opioids. Fentanyl was followed by sufentanil (1974), alfentanil (1976), carfentanil (1976), and lofentanil (1980). Janssen and his team also developed <b>etomidate</b> (1964), a potent intravenous anesthetic induction agent.|$|E
2500|$|Sedatives like midazolam, lorazepam, and <b>etomidate,</b> used {{to reduce}} the {{irritability}} or agitation of patients ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{anesthetic}} {{drugs are}} considered safe [...]These include local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), [...] ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, <b>etomidate,</b> and benzodiazepines.|$|E
2500|$|Benign myoclonic {{movements}} are commonly seen during the induction of general anesthesia with intravenous medications such as <b>etomidate</b> and propofol. These are postulated {{to result from}} decreased inhibitory signaling from cranial neurons. [...] Prolonged oxygen deprivation to the brain, hypoxia, may result in posthypoxic myoclonus. People suffering from benign fasciculation syndrome can often experience myoclonic jerking of limbs, fingers and thumbs.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{prior to}} treatment, {{a patient is}} given a short-acting {{anesthetic}} such as methohexital, <b>etomidate,</b> or thiopental, a muscle relaxant such as suxamethonium (succinylcholine), and occasionally atropine to inhibit salivation. [...] In a minority of countries such as Japan, India, and Nigeria, ECT may be used without anesthesia. The Union Health Ministry of India recommended a ban on ECT without anesthesia in India's Mental Health Care Bill of 2010 and the Mental Health Care Bill of 2013. Some psychiatrists in India argued against the ban on unmodified ECT {{due to a lack}} of trained anesthesiologists available to administer ECT with anesthesia. The practice was abolished in Turkey's largest psychiatric hospital in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{anesthetic}} agents used {{in human}} medicine {{are used in}} veterinary medicine. [...] Alpha-2 receptor agonist drugs such as xylazine, romifidine, detomidine, and medetomidine, are used frequently in veterinary species (particularly large animal), but are rarely used in people. [...] Guaifenesin {{is used as a}} muscle relaxant prior to anesthesia induction in some animals. [...] Propofol is commonly used in small animal anesthesia, however it is rarely used in large animals due to the cost. 'Propoclear' is also commonly used in smaller branches of small animal surgery as it has a longer shelf life once opened than propofol whilst essentially having the same properties. [...] Butorphanol is rarely used in people but is commonly used in all species. [...] Ketamine, used in children for anesthesia, is used extensively in many species to induce anesthesia or cause heavy sedation. [...] Expensive agents, such as <b>etomidate</b> and desflurane are rarely used outside of university hospitals. [...] Different species have different responses to drugs. [...] For example, horses may experience mania with morphine whereas dogs typically become sedated. [...] Rabbits and guinea pigs are well sedated with midazolam, which can occasionally excite dogs and cats.|$|E
2500|$|Paramedics in many jurisdictions {{administer}} {{a variety}} of emergency medications; the individual medications vary widely, based on physician (medical director) direction and local law. These drugs may include Adenocard (Adenosine), which stops and resets a heart that is beating too rapidly, and Atropine, which speeds a heartbeat that is too slow. [...] The list may include sympathomimetics like dopamine for severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and cardiogenic shock. Diabetics often benefit {{from the fact that}} paramedics are able to give D50W (Dextrose 50%) to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). They can treat crisis and anxiety conditions. Some advanced paramedics may also be permitted to perform rapid sequence induction; a rapid way of obtaining an advanced airway with the use of paralytics and sedatives, using such medications as Versed, Ativan, or <b>Etomidate,</b> and paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Paramedics in some jurisdictions may also be permitted to sedate combative patients using antipsychotics like Haldol or Geodon. The use of medications for treating respiratory conditions such as, albuterol, atrovent, and methylprednisolone is common. Paramedics may also be permitted to administer medications such as those that relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting. Nitroglycerin, baby aspirin, and morphine sulfate may be administered for chest pain. Paramedics may also use other medications and antiarrhythmics like amiodarone to treat cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation not responding to defibrillation. Paramedics also treat for severe pain, i.e. burns or fractures, with narcotics like morphine sulfate, pethidine, fentanyl and in some jurisdictions, ketorolac. [...] This list is not representative of all jurisdictions, and EMS jurisdictions may vary greatly in what is permitted. Some jurisdictions may not permit administration of certain classes of drugs, or may use drugs other than the ones listed for the same purposes. For an accurate description of permitted drugs or procedures in a given location, it is necessary to contact that jurisdiction directly.|$|E
50|$|Another use for <b>etomidate</b> is to {{determine}} speech lateralization in people prior to performing lobectomies to remove epileptogenic centres in the brain. This is called the <b>etomidate</b> speech and memory test, or eSAM, and is used at the Montreal Neurological Institute. However, only retrospective cohort studies support the use and safety of <b>etomidate</b> for this test.|$|E
5000|$|Because of etomidate-induced adrenal suppression, its use for {{patients}} with sepsis is controversial. Cortisol levels {{have been reported to}} be suppressed up to 72 hours after a single bolus of <b>etomidate</b> in this population at risk for adrenal insufficiency. For this reason, many authors have suggested that <b>etomidate</b> should never be used for critically ill patients with septic shock because it could increase mortality. However, other authors continue to defend etomidate's use for septic patients because of etomidate's safe hemodynamic profile and lack of clear evidence of harm. A study by Jabre et al. showed that a single dose of <b>etomidate</b> used for Rapid Sequence Induction prior to endrotracheal intubation has no effect on mortality compared to ketamine even though <b>etomidate</b> did cause transient adrenal suppression. In addition, a recent meta-analysis done by Hohl could not conclude that <b>etomidate</b> increased mortality. The authors of this meta-analysis concluded more studies were needed because of lack of statistical power to conclude definitively about the effect of <b>etomidate</b> on mortality. Thus, Hohl suggests a burden to prove <b>etomidate</b> is safe for use in septic patients, and more research is needed before it is used. Other authors [...] advise giving a prophylactic dose of steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone) if <b>etomidate</b> is used, but only one small prospective controlled study in patients undergoing colorectal surgery has verified the safety of giving stress dose corticosteroids to all patients receiving <b>etomidate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Propofol is {{dissolved}} in a lipid emulsion for intravenous use. Sometimes <b>etomidate</b> (the vehicle for <b>etomidate</b> is propylene glycol) is supplied using a lipid emulsion as a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etomidate</b> {{suppresses}} corticosteroid synthesis in the {{adrenal cortex}} by reversibly inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase, an enzyme important in adrenal steroid production; it leads to primary adrenal suppression. Using a continuous <b>etomidate</b> infusion for sedation of critically ill trauma patients in intensive care units {{has been associated with}} increased mortality due to adrenal suppression. Continuous intravenous administration of <b>etomidate</b> leads to adrenocortical dysfunction. The mortality of patients exposed to a continuous infusion of <b>etomidate</b> for more than 5 days increased from 25% to 44%, mainly due to infectious causes such as pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|In a {{retrospective}} review of almost 32,000 people, <b>etomidate,</b> when {{used for the}} induction of anaesthesia, was associated 2.5-fold increase {{in the risk of}} dying compared with those given propofol. People given <b>etomidate</b> also had significantly greater odds of having cardiovascular morbidity and significantly longer hospital stay. These results, especially given the large size of study, strongly suggest that, at the very least, clinicians should use <b>etomidate</b> judiciously.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etomidate</b> {{is usually}} {{presented}} as a clear colourless solution for injection containing 2 mg/ml of <b>etomidate</b> in an aqueous solution of 35% propylene glycol, although a lipid emulsion preparation (of equivalent strength) has also been introduced. <b>Etomidate</b> was originally formulated as a racemic mixture, but the R form is substantially more active than its enantiomer. It was later reformulated as a single-enantiomer drug, becoming the first general anesthetic in that class to be used clinically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etomidate</b> {{is often}} not {{recommended}} as a medication to help with intubation in this situation due to concerns it may lead to poor adrenal function and {{an increased risk of}} death. The small amount of evidence there is, however, has not found a change in the risk of death with <b>etomidate.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{emergency}} settings, <b>etomidate</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently used sedative hypnotic agents. It is used for conscious sedation and as a part of a rapid sequence induction to induce anaesthesia. It is used as an anaesthetic agent since it has a rapid onset of action and a safe cardiovascular risk profile, and therefore is less likely to cause a significant drop in blood pressure than other induction agents. In addition, <b>etomidate</b> is often used because of its easy dosing profile, limited suppression of ventilation, lack of histamine liberation and protection from myocardial and cerebral ischemia. Thus, <b>etomidate</b> is a good induction agent for people who are hemodynamically unstable. <b>Etomidate</b> also has interesting characteristics for people with traumatic brain injury because it {{is one of the}} only anesthetic agents able to decrease intracranial pressure and maintain a normal arterial pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Sedatives like midazolam, lorazepam, and <b>etomidate,</b> used {{to reduce}} the {{irritability}} or agitation of patients ...|$|E
50|$|Sedation {{is usually}} {{required}} for urohydropulsion and {{the placement of}} a urinary catheter due to the associated pain with the procedure. A combination of injectable ketamine and diazepam is a safer option for sedation considering its reduced cardiopulmary depression effects compared to other anesthetics. A combination of <b>etomidate</b> and diazepam would be an even safer anesthetic consideration, but <b>etomidate</b> is not commonly carried by general veterinary practitioners due to its cost.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etomidate</b> {{is highly}} protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to {{inactive}} products. It exhibits a biexponential decline.|$|E
5000|$|Drugs {{for rapid}} {{sequence}} intubation: succinylcholine or another paralytic, and a sedative such as <b>etomidate</b> or midazolam; endotracheal tubes and other intubating equipment ...|$|E

5000|$|Other {{anesthetic}} {{drugs are}} considered safe [...]These include local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, <b>etomidate,</b> and benzodiazepines.|$|E
5000|$|... "Stephanie Stephens" [...] - Stephanie Stephens {{is accused}} of giving her older husband David, a former surgeon, a lethal dose of <b>etomidate</b> and atricurium in May 2001.|$|E
50|$|In {{people with}} {{traumatic}} brain injury, <b>etomidate</b> use {{is associated with}} a blunting of an ACTH stimulation test. The clinical impact of this effect has yet to be determined.|$|E
50|$|Propoxate (INN; R7464) is an {{anesthetic}} {{related to}} <b>etomidate</b> and metomidate {{that was never}} marketed. Though it is not used in humans, {{it has been used}} as an anesthetic in fish.|$|E
50|$|At {{the typical}} dose, {{anesthesia}} is induced for about 5-10 minutes, though the half-life of drug metabolism is about 75 minutes, because <b>etomidate</b> is redistributed from the plasma to other tissues.|$|E
50|$|An {{anaesthetist}} or anesthesiologist places intravenous and arterial {{lines and}} injects an analgesic, usually fentanyl, intravenously, followed within minutes by an induction agent (usually propofol or <b>etomidate)</b> {{to render the}} patient unconscious.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{concurrent}} use of <b>etomidate</b> with opioids and/or benzodiazepines, is hypothesized to exacerbate etomidate-related adrenal insufficiency. However, only retrospective {{evidence of this}} effect exists and prospective {{studies are needed to}} measure the clinical impact of this interaction.|$|E
50|$|Sedation is the {{reduction}} of irritability or agitation by administration of sedative drugs, generally to facilitate a medical procedure or diagnostic procedure. Examples of drugs {{which can be used}} for sedation include propofol, <b>etomidate,</b> ketamine, fentanyl, lorazepam and midazolam.|$|E
5000|$|Positive {{allosteric}} modulators: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, certain carbamates (ex. carisoprodol, meprobamate, lorbamate), thienodiazepines, ethanol (alcohol), <b>etomidate,</b> glutethimide, kavalactones, meprobamate, quinazolinones (ex. methaqualone, etaqualone, diproqualone), neuroactive steroids, niacin/niacinamide, nonbenzodiazepines (ex. zolpidem, eszopiclone), propofol, stiripentol, theanine, valerenic acid, volatile/inhaled anesthetics, and lanthanum.|$|E
