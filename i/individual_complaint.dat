25|$|Drake v New Zealand is a {{case that}} was decided by the Committee in 1997. Drake had been a {{prisoner}} of war in Japan during World War Two and made an <b>individual</b> <b>complaint</b> to the Committee about the actions of the New Zealand Government concerning prisoners of war following the war. One complaint was about the Treaty of San Francisco entered into between the Allies and Japan as Drake felt that his right to a remedy had been removed as a consequence {{of not being able to}} seek reparation from Japan. In addition to this, in 1988 the New Zealand Government issued reparations for those who were prisoners of war in Germany during World War Two and not those in Japan, which Drake alleged was discrimination. In both complaints the events themselves occurred before New Zealand was a party to the First Optional Protocol and so was inadmissible ratione temporis. Even if this were not the case, the claim would have been unsubstantiated as the alleged discrimination was not on any of the listed categories of discrimination of the ICCPR and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the Committee.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The European Convention on Human Rights {{established}} an unprecedented system of protection {{of individual rights}} and freedoms applicable in the present, in almost all European countries. The creation of a Permanent Court in 1988, was motivated essentially by the {{increasing the number of}} <b>individual</b> <b>complaints</b> the settlement of which was not possible under the old procedure. The number of <b>individual</b> <b>complaints</b> continued to increase on an accelerated rhythm and therefore the number of cases in which settlement was required has increased considerably. The growing number of individual applications impose Community Justice System permanent reform and consideration of issues raised in the findings of this paper...|$|R

[...] Generally, investigations should be completed within 180 days of the filing of the <b>individual</b> <b>complaint,</b> unless the parties agree in writing to extend the period an additional 90 days.|$|E
50|$|Immigration New Zealand {{reportedly}} {{looked into}} deporting Wilfred, but {{he applied for}} New Zealand citizenship, and argued that deporting him to the United States would be inhumane. In 2008, he {{filed a complaint with}} the United Nations Human Rights Committee regarding alleged violations of his rights under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights by Canada and the United States in relation to his 2000 extradition. However, the Committee could not act on his complaint: the United States was not a signatory to that Convention's First Optional Protocol, which recognises the competence of the ICCPR's <b>individual</b> <b>complaint</b> mechanism, and the Committee ruled that Wilfred had not provided sufficient evidence to prove his claims against Canada.|$|E

50|$|Reports of {{investigations}} that are laid before the Scottish Parliament {{are sent to}} the complainant, the body complained about and Scottish Ministers.

[...] Equal Pay Act claims, on the other hand, must be filed within two years (or three years for willful violations) of the alleged discrimination, despite their standing in the administrative process.|$|E
