Since 1961 the censuses are conducted in regular ten-year intervals, with the latest one in 2011. The first institution {{set up in the}} country specifically for the purposes of maintaining population statistics was the State Statistical Office, founded in 1875. Since its founding, the office changed its name and structure several times and was alternately subordinated to other institutions and independent, until the most recent changes in 1992, when the institution became the Croatian Bureau of Statistics.

The first census results, containing the number of the population by settlement, were published on 29 June 2011, and the final comprehensive set of data was published in December 2012. The 2011 census and processing of the data gathered by the census was expected to cost 171.9million kuna (23.3million euro). The 2011 census was performed using new methodology: the permanent population was determined as the <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> who lived in the census area for at least 12 months prior to the census, or plans to live in the same area for at least 12 months after the census.

30|$|However, {{a number}} of {{different}} nuances around mobility mean that good data collection on mobile populations {{is not just a matter}} of finding them. Although mobility makes data collection difficult, it also renders the pastoral economy viable. This may mean that more mobile pastoralists are more economically successful but less likely to be captured in any data collection exercise, although some very rich pastoralists do settle, move into politics and delegate herding to highly mobile contract herders. Possibly, those mobile pastoralists who are enumerated in censuses and surveys are the less economically viable, less mobile and therefore the most visible, generating bias in the perceived economic success of the <b>enumerated</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To test an {{evaluation}} framework designed to evaluate {{implementation of the}} North Queensland Indigenous communities between August and December 2005. Setting: Both communities are located in Cape York, North Queensland. Community A has an estimated population of around 600 people; Community B has an <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> of 750, although health centre records indicate a higher number. Participants: Process evaluation involved health centre staff in both communities; clinical audits used random samples from the adult population (each sample n = 30); ethnographic fieldwork was conducted with resident population. Main outcome measures: Health centre scores and qualitative findings using a System Assessment Tool; clinical audits – extent to which scheduled services recorded; selected primary health performance indicators; qualitative ethnographic findings. Results: On almost all indicators, implementation of NQICDS had progressed further in Community A than in Community B; however, some common issues emerged, especially lack of linkages between health centres and other groups, and lack of support for client self-management. Conclusions: The evaluation framework is an effective and acceptable framework for monitoring implementation of the NQICDS at the primary health centre level...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} little recent {{research}} in Europe exploring the relationship between religion and health. In Northern Ireland previous analysis has tended to divide the population dichotomously as Catholic and Protestant, ignoring the diversity inherent in the Protestant community. This study used a census-based longitudinal study of the <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> with five-years follow-up (covering the period 2001 - 2006) to examine variation in overall and cause-specific mortality by religious affiliation within Northern Ireland. Six groups were defined: Catholics; Presbyterians; Church of Ireland; Methodists; Other (mostly fundamentalist) Christians; and 'Other/not-stated'. Catholics had higher mortality than non-Catholics, though this disappeared after adjustment for socio-economic status. Church of Ireland members had the highest overall mortality in the fully adjusted models, due to their higher risk of cardiovascular disease. 'Other Christians' had lowest all-cause mortality and particularly low mortality from alcohol-related deaths and lung cancer. These findings point to an association between religious affiliation, behaviour and lifestyle suggesting that, even in relatively secular societies, it is a population attribute that should be given more consideration in studies of population health.

40|$|The Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP) {{carried out}} two pilot surveillances {{covering}} the <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> to test procedures {{to be used}} in assessing the ability of the program to influence life expectancy in the total population. A rigorously sequenced pilot survey of 2, 611 households was conducted and carefully monitored through two mailings, telephone contacts, home visits, and communication with "contact" persons. The response rates at each stage varied among the 13 centers. Overall, there was a 42. 7 % yield from the first mailing; 42. 5 % of those receiving a second mailing was completed; 78. 0 % for telephone 61. 3 % for the home visits and 55. 2 % from the "contact" persons. Overall, 97. 4 % of all persons had vital status ascertained. The second phase relaxed the rigorous sequential survey requirements and reduced the reporting requirements from every ten days to monthly. Overall, 93. 3 % were successfully ascertained. Reduced survey structure, slightly increased mobility (from 12 % to 13 %), increased workload from 200 to 400 households per center, and a longer time interval between initial enumeration and the mortality ascertainment are among the reasons for performance decline...|$|E
40|$|Background: Low- to middle-income {{countries}} are undergoing a health transition with non-communicable diseases contributing substantially to disease burden, despite persistence of undernutrition and infectious diseases. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} prevalence and patterns of stunting and overweight/obesity, and hence risk for metabolic disease, {{in a group of}} children and adolescents in rural South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional growth survey was conducted involving 3511 children and adolescents 1 - 20 years, selected through stratified random sampling from a previously <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> living in Agincourt subdistrict, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight and waist circumference were taken using standard procedures. Tanner pubertal assessment was conducted among adolescents 9 - 20 years. Growth z-scores were generated using 2006 WHO standards for children up to five years and 1977 NCHS/WHO reference for older children. Overweight and obesity for those < 18 years were determined using International Obesity Task Force BMI cut-offs, while adult cut-offs of BMI ≥ 25 and ≥ 30 kg/m 2 for overweight and obesity respectively were used for those ≥ 18 years. Waist circumference cut-offs of ≥ 94 cm for males and ≥ 80 cm for females and waist-to-height ratio of 0. 5 for both sexes were used to determine metabolic disease risk in adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of vision impairment, unilateral/bilateral blindness, and cataract surgery were estimated {{in a population}} based survey among the elderly in a suburban area of Hong Kong. Methods: 15 public, private, and home ownership scheme housing estates in the Shatin area of Hong Kong were subjected to cluster sampling to randomly select {{a cross section of}} people 60 years of age or older. Visual acuity measurements and ocular examinations were conducted at a community site within each estate. The principal cause of reduced vision was identified for eyes with presenting visual acuity worse than 6 / 18. Results: A total of 3441 subjects from an <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> of 4487 (76. 7 %) completed an eye examination. The {{prevalence of}} presenting visual acuity less than 6 / 18 in at least one eye was 41. 3 %; and 73. 1 % in those 80 years of age or older. Unilateral blindness (acuity < 6 / 60) was found in 7. 9 % of subjects and bilateral blindness in 1. 8 %. Refractive error and cataract were, respectively, the main causes of vision impairment and blindness. Visual impairment with either eye < 6 / 18 increased with advancing age and was more prevalent in males, the less educated, and those living in public housing estates. The prevalence of cataract surgery was 9. 1 % and was associated with advancing age and less education...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Limited {{surveys and}} anecdotal data {{indicate}} that trachoma is endemic in the states of Eastern Equatoria and Upper Nile in southern Sudan. However, its magnitude and geographical distribution are largely unknown. We conducted surveys to ascertain the prevalence and geographical distribution of trachoma, and to identify targets for control interventions. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted in nine sites in southern Sudan between September 2001 and June 2004. Two-stage random cluster sampling with probability proportional to size was used to select the sample. Trachoma grading was done using the WHO simplified grading system. FINDINGS: A total of 17 016 persons were examined, {{a response rate of}} 86. 1 % of the <b>enumerated</b> <b>population.</b> Prevalence of signs of active trachoma in children aged 1 - 9 years was: TF= 53. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 52. 1 - 55. 3); TI= 42. 7 % (95 % CI= 41. 2 - 44. 2); TF and/or TI= 64. 1 % (95 % CI= 62. 5 - 65. 5). Prevalence of trichiasis (TT) in children aged less than 15 years was 1. 2 % (95 % CI= 0. 9 - 1. 4), while TT prevalence in persons aged 15 years and above was 9. 2 % (95 % CI= 8. 6 - 9. 9). Women {{were more likely to have}} trichiasis compared to men (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 57; 95 % CI= 1. 34 - 1. 84). Tentative extrapolation to the states of Eastern Equatoria and Upper Nile estimates that there is a backlog of 178, 250 (lower and upper bounds= 156, 027 - 205, 995) persons requiring surgery and the entire population, estimated to be over 3. 9 million, is in need of the SAFE strategy to control blinding trachoma. CONCLUSION: Trachoma is a public health problem in all nine of the study sites surveyed. The unusually high prevalence of active trachoma and TT in children points to the severity of the problem. There is urgent need to implement trachoma control interventions in trachoma endemic regions of southern Sudan...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This computerised transcription of the census enumerators' books for the 1881 Census for England, Scotland and Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man is a by-product of a project to create a microfiche index {{of the population of}} Great Britain for genealogists. Covering the entire <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> of England, Scotland and Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man in 1881, it is the largest collection of historical source material to be made available in computerised form. The data consists of the name, address, relationship to the head of household, marital status, age, occupation and birthplace of some 26 million individuals, together with information about disabilities. In 1999 the Genealogical Society of Utah published a version of this computerised transcription as a CD-ROM product suitable for genealogical research (Genealogical Society of Utah (1999) 1881 British census and national index. [25 CDs]. Salt Lake City, Utah: GSU). This study is an enriched version of these data. The sample is a 5 per cent random sample of the parishes of Great Britain. The sample was chosen in the simplest manner possible. A list of all the parishes in England, Wales, Scotland and the Islands in the British Seas was created; using a random number generator in Microsoft Excel, a random number between zero and one was allocated to each parish. All those {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05 were selected for the sample. The records relating to the individuals in each of these parishes were then extracted from the data and combined in a database. Tables B 1 and B 3 in Appendix B of the documentation list the 716 parishes in the sample.

Methods A cross-sectional growth survey was conducted involving 3511 children and adolescents 1 - 20 years, selected through stratified random sampling from a previously <b>enumerated</b> <b>population</b> living in Agincourt sub-district, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight and waist circumference were taken using standard procedures. Tanner pubertal assessment was conducted among adolescents 9 - 20 years. Growth z-scores were generated using 2006 WHO standards for children up to five years and 1977 NCHS/WHO reference for older children. Overweight and obesity for those 2 for overweight and obesity respectively were used for those ≥ 18 years. Waist circumference cut-offs of ≥ 94 cm for males and ≥ 80 cm for females and waist-to-height ratio of 0. 5 for both sexes were used to determine metabolic disease risk in adolescents. Results About one in five children aged 1 - 4 years was stunted; one in three of those aged one year. Concurrently, the prevalence of combined overweight and obesity, almost non-existent in boys, was substantial among adolescent girls, increasing with age and reaching approximately 20 - 25 % in late adolescence. Central obesity was prevalent among adolescent girls, increasing with sexual maturation and reaching a peak of 35 % at Tanner Stage 5, indicating increased risk for metabolic disease. Conclusions The study highlights that in transitional societies, early stunting and adolescent obesity may co-exist in the same socio-geographic population. It is likely that this profile relates to changes in nutrition and diet, but variation in factors such as infectious disease burden and physical activity patterns, as well as social influences, need to be investigated. As obesity and adult short stature are risk factors for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes, this combination of early stunting and adolescent obesity may be an explosive combination. </p...|$|E
