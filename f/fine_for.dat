5|$|Bowen and the Spurs {{bounced back}} {{and won the}} NBA title in 2005, {{defeating}} the Detroit Pistons. The Spurs could not win back-to-back titles, however, and bowed out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. As a testament to his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E
5|$|During the 2003-04 NBA season, Webber {{was on the}} {{disabled}} list until February. When he returned, the NBA suspended him for three games for his guilty plea. In September 2005, Judge Edmunds ruled that the conviction should be treated as a misdemeanor and that Webber should pay the maximum <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> such an offense, which was $100,000. This ruling came after Webber served 330 hours of public service and accumulated $78,000 of related out-of-pocket expenses.|$|E

5|$|John Neville's {{marriage}} {{caused a}} dispute with Queen Margaret: even though Isabel was over fourteen years-old (and therefore of legal age), the Queen claimed that Isabel was still her ward. As a result, Queen Margaret insisted that John pay her a <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> his marriage to Isabel: he was bound to pay her £1,000 in ten instalments.|$|E
5|$|Power {{was sentenced}} to eight to twelve {{years in prison for}} the bank robbery, and five years and a $10,000 <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the National Guard armory crimes. Additionally, judge Robert Banks of Suffolk County Superior Court imposed a {{probation}} condition that Power could not profit from her crime. Banks remarked that the sentence negotiated was inadequate.|$|E
50|$|Kyrgios {{has also}} been warned and <b>fined</b> <b>for</b> various other {{instances}} of inappropriate behaviour. He was given three code violations for audible obscenities and racket-smashing at the 2014 US Open (one more would have disqualified him), <b>fined</b> $4,926 <b>for</b> audible obscenities and racket-smashing at the 2015 Australian Open, <b>fined</b> $12,470 <b>for</b> unsportsmanlike conduct and $2,625 for swearing at 2015 Wimbledon, <b>fined</b> $4,370 <b>for</b> swearing at the 2016 Australian Open (he also took a phone call while on court during a mixed doubles match), <b>fined</b> $6,200 <b>for</b> swearing at the 2016 French Open, and <b>fined</b> $8,690 <b>for</b> swearing at the 2016 Wimbledon.|$|R

5|$|Some {{truck drivers}} {{have used the}} pass despite the prohibition. They are {{generally}} either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or aware of it and willing to risk the <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> {{the sake of the}} time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass. CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen officials have suggested the fines be increased as well.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation}} to do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but {{it is not surprising that}} all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|The season {{only saw}} one driver change, which was brought about when Lotus driver Romain Grosjean {{was found by}} race {{stewards}} {{to be responsible for}} causing a multi-car pile-up {{at the start of the}} Belgian Grand Prix.

50|$|Under Mobutu, {{governance}} deteriorated {{and corruption}} flourished in Zaire, {{and he saw}} Katanga only as a cash cow and punished it for its separatist tendencies by neglecting its development. Zairean border officials and police went for months without being paid and turned to petty corruption to survive. At first small bribes were taken from Zambians whose identity cards were not in order, but this escalated to arbitrary <b>fines,</b> <b>for</b> example, a driver might be <b>fined</b> <b>for</b> wearing a hat while his passenger was <b>fined</b> <b>for</b> not wearing a hat.|$|R
5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, {{would need to be}} restored to its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the right to marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid for the right to marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the city and Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for redevelopment, {{the remains of}} the train shed roof had been demolished in 1958, and Barry's hotel (which had been used as offices since 1931) soon followed in 1960. The architect selected to design the new building was John Poulson who was good friends with Graham Tunbridge, a British Rail surveyor whom he had met during the war. Poulson took advantage of this friendship to win contracts for the redevelopment of various British Rail termini. He paid Tunbridge a weekly income of £25 and received in return building contracts, including the rebuilding of Waterloo and East Croydon stations. At his trial in 1974, Poulson admitted that, shortly before receiving the Cannon Street building contract, he had given Tunbridge a cheque for £200 and a suit worth £80. Poulson was later found guilty of corruption charges and was given a seven-year concurrent sentence; Tunbridge received a 15-month suspended sentence and £4,000 <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> his role in the affair.|$|E

5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E

Laurent made her Hollywood debut in 2009 with the starring role as Shosanna Dreyfus in Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster war film Inglourious Basterds. She garnered critical acclaim for her performance and won the Online Film Critics Society and the Austin Film Critics Association Best Actress Awards.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{state parks}} and forests {{prohibit}} the possession or {{consumption of alcohol}}ic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is no state law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> alcohol possession in a state park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.|$|E

Next season, in a spring training game against the Mets on March 12, Mota hit Piazza with a pitch. Piazza charged the mound, starting a brawl, and both players were ejected from the game. After the game, Piazza entered the Dodgers' clubhouse looking for Mota. Informed that Mota had left, Piazza searched the clubhouse before leaving. Mota said that hitting Piazza was not intentional, but both he and Piazza were suspended five games in the regular season and finedMota $1,500 and Piazza $3,000. Mota's suspension was later reduced to four games.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 1996, Jovanovski {{received}} a three-game suspension from the NHL without pay. In {{a game against}} the Dallas Stars the previous night, he illegally left the penalty box ready to fight any opposing players during a break in play. Later in the season, he suffered a knee injury during {{a game against the}} Edmonton Oilers in January 1997, sidelining him for several weeks. The following month, he was involved in an on-ice altercation with San Jose Sharks forward Bernie Nicholls, resulting in a two-game suspension and the maximum $1,000 <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> Nicholls for intent to injure. The accumulated injuries and suspensions caused Jovanovski to miss 21 games in his second NHL season. He scored seven goals and 23 points over 61 contests.|$|E
5|$|Once Stockport {{returned}} to Division 2, they struggled and survived an automatic relegation by one point. The 1923–24 season saw Stockport County finish 13th, one place above Manchester United. This {{is the only}} time in history Stockport has achieved better than Manchester United. During this campaign Stockport goalkeeper Harry Hardy was called up to play for the England national team and kept a clean sheet in a 4–0 win against Belgium. He is the only player to be capped at full level by England while on Stockport's books. Two seasons later (1925–26) Stockport {{returned to}} the bottom division after finishing bottom of the league and only picking up 25 points.
