5000|$|The Tippings had a {{manor house}} {{built in the}} late 16th or early 17th century. It stood just west of St. Andrew's church. In 1637 it had a great parlour, hall, great chamber, <b>drawing</b> <b>chamber,</b> five other {{principal}} chambers, buttery, beer cellar, wine cellar, nine other chambers, and [...] "offices" [...] including a bakehouse and a brewery. In 1662 the house was assessed for hearth tax as having 15 hearths. By 1700 the manor had a dovecote, a hop-garden surrounded by a canal, the house had a T-shaped plan and its surroundings included a flower garden, a fountain and a pond.|$|E

50|$|Each Mega Gem, {{depending}} on the type of game, as already mentioned, is operated by automation. The Mega Gem loads the balls from the loading bays to the draw chamber, after which the blower starts to mix the balls. In the number lottery games (excluding the Power Lotto), the machine draws six numbers one-by-one and is inserted into the inner left loading bay. In machines used in the EZ2 Lotto and the digit lottery games, each number/digit in the combination is drawn from its own chamber. Once a ball is drawn, it is locked into place by slats placed over the pipe leading from the <b>drawing</b> <b>chamber.</b> Once the necessary number of balls has been picked, the Mega Gem is turned off.|$|E
50|$|Apethorpe {{was left}} to Princess Elizabeth by Will from her father. In April 1551 Sir Walter Mildmay {{acquired}} it from Edward VI in exchange for property in Gloucestershire and Berkshire. Queen Elizabeth dined with Mildmay at Apethorpe on her summer progress in 1562 and 1566. He added a stone chimney-piece with her words engraved dated 1562, and after his death it was inherited by his eldest son Sir Anthony Mildmay (c. 1549-1617), from whom Apethorpe passed to his daughter Mary (1581/2-1640) and her husband, Sir Francis Fane (1617), later Earl of Westmorland. In 1622 King James I gave Fane 100 oak trees and permission to buy 100 more 'at reasonable rates' to enlarge Apethorpe 'for the more commodious entertainment of his majesty.' The rebuilding of the south range provided a new suite of state rooms, clearly intended for the entertainment of the king, on the first floor, and, an open gallery all around {{the house on the}} second floor constructed specially for the King to enjoy the carted stag hunt when he could not ride anymore at a later stage in his life. This suite of state rooms consisted of the Dining Chamber, the <b>Drawing</b> <b>Chamber,</b> the King Bedchamber, the Prince of Wales Bedchamber (with the three feathers carved on the fireplace) and the Long Gallery (last complete set of original Jacobean State apartments left in England). The entrance is still now surmounted by a statue of James I dating from that period. The King Bedchamber was embellished with a hunting scene over the fireplace and the royal arms decorated the ceiling. These State rooms contain a notable series of fireplaces incorporating in the carving iconographical statements such as the nature of kingship. Apethorpe remained in the Fane family for nearly three centuries.|$|E

Peterborough United midfielder Daniel Kearns was signed on a one-month loan {{and made his}} debut as a substitute in York's 0–0 home draw with Rotherham. York were knocked out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} after being beaten 4–0 at home by League One team Coventry City. Chambers scored the opening goal for York away to Bradford in the first derby match between the teams in 16 years, but with Bradford scoring through Zavon Hines the match finished a 1–1 <b>draw.</b> <b>Chambers</b> and Blair scored as York beat Dagenham & Redbridge 3–2 at home, which was the team's first win in four league matches. York recorded a second successive victory away to Accrington Stanley, with Walker scoring an 83rd-minute winner in a 1–0 win. Bullock was loaned out to Gateshead of the Conference Premier for a month, with his appearances in the team being limited. A 0–0 draw away to Southend United saw York's run of victories come to an end.|$|R

Elegy, a suite dedicated to Jean Genet, was released in 1992.

40|$|Private {{consumption}} {{is the largest}} component {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP). It has a substantial impact on the speed of recovery from an economic crisis. This paper aims to examine the behavior of consumers, firms, and government in Turkey in response to the recent global economic crisis. Turkey {{was one of the few}} countries that emerged from the economic downturn relatively quickly. The demographics of consumers, the solidity of financial sector, and the government policies led to a speedy recovery from the crisis through an increase in consumption expenditures. During the initial shock, consumers switched to cheaper goods and decreased consumption expenditures in total. The government emphasized that the impact of crisis would be limited. The opening of credit lines, the temporary reduction in value-added tax and special consumption tax on certain commodities, aggressive marketing campaigns, and a rosy future <b>drawn</b> by <b>chambers</b> of commerce and NGOs in specific promotional activities were influential in increasing consumption. This paper discusses the consumer response to and the marketing lessons derived from this experience. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

50|$|A simple device {{can be used}} {{to create}} a salt gradient. Elution buffer is {{consistently}} being <b>drawn</b> from the <b>chamber</b> into the mixing chamber, thereby altering its buffer concentration. Generally, the buffer placed into the chamber is usually of high initial concentration, whereas the buffer placed into the stirred chamber is usually of low concentration. As the high concentration buffer from the left chamber is mixed and drawn into the column, the buffer concentration of the stirred column gradually increase. Altering the shapes of the stirred chamber, {{as well as of the}} limit buffer, allows for the production of concave, linear, or convex gradients of counterion.|$|R
