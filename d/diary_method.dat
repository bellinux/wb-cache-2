50|$|Before the People Meter advances, Nielsen {{used the}} <b>diary</b> <b>method,</b> which {{consisted}} of viewers physically recording the shows they watched. However, there were setbacks with the system. Lower-rated stations claimed the <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> was inaccurate and biased. They argued that because they had lower ratings, those who depended on memory for the <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> may only remember to track their favorite shows. Stations also argued that if it wasn’t low ratings that skewed the <b>diary</b> <b>method,</b> {{it might also be}} the new variety of channels for viewers to choose from. Viewers {{may not be able to}} record everything they watch and there is no way of discovering the truth. Finally in 1986, Nielsen developed an electronic meter, People Meter, to solve the problem. The People Meter is an electronic method of television measurement that moved from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored. The meter also recorded real time simultaneously viewing, reducing memory bias.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, the Arbitron Company was {{developing}} the Portable People Meter, or PPM, technology to replace its self-administered, seven-day radio <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> to collect radio listening data from Arbitron survey participants. The radio diary {{had been the}} most generally accepted method of measuring radio listening since 1964. Rantel became an early evangelist for the new PPM method, because Rantel researchers had performed many audits of Arbitron radio diaries during its early years and were keenly aware of the weaknesses of the seven-day radio <b>diary</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

50|$|Memory can be {{inaccurate}} {{and critical}} {{details of a}} raw experience can be forgotten or re-imagined.

50|$|In work by Bernsten, the <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> {{was also}} {{applied to the}} study of {{involuntary}} memory chaining. The main hypothesis was that chaining would also occur on autobiographical memory tasks. Participants were asked to report the presence of involuntary memories while performing an autobiographical memory task. Results showed that participants did experience involuntary memory recall when they were recalling the past deliberately (also known as voluntary memory). This implies that involuntary memory production occurs as a product of chaining from voluntary memory—deliberate recall of the past.|$|E
30|$|Before {{concluding}} {{we should}} acknowledge {{a number of}} limitations of the current study. First, it should be acknowledged that diary responses reflect relatively coarse measures of attentional disengagements in everyday life. That is, despite the strengths of using <b>diary</b> <b>methods</b> to assess everyday attentional disengagements, there are also clear limitations with these types of studies. For example, given that <b>diary</b> <b>methods</b> require both prospective and retrospective memory and a heavy dependence on meta-awareness {{it is clear that}} not all disengagements will be reported and not all disengagements will be reported entirely accurately or in a timely fashion. Additionally, unlike probe caught <b>methods,</b> <b>diary</b> <b>methods</b> likely underestimate instances of mind-wandering when participants are unaware that they are mind-wandering. As noted by Reason and Lucas (1984) diaries “serve a valuable function as wide-gauge trawl nets, picking up the more salient types of lapse” (p. 56). Furthermore, unlike most probe-caught <b>methods,</b> <b>diaries</b> allow and encourage participants to completely describe each type of disengagements resulting in richer description. Thus, despite limitations, <b>diary</b> <b>methods</b> are particularly useful (especially when combined with laboratory measures and individual differences analyses) in obtaining more naturalistic data.|$|R

50|$|The PPM is an {{electronic}} measurement system that delivers empirical, verifiable audience measurement data. These results are sometimes {{at odds with}} the results generated with the <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> in which listeners were asked to note each change of their radio dial. Some minority diarists may have used their diaries as a way to support and show loyalty for stations that targeted their communities. Around 2008, the Spanish Radio Association in the US (SRA) and a number of politicians challenged Arbitron as to the PPM's accuracy in measuring minority listening.|$|E
50|$|The {{experience}} sampling method, {{also referred}} to as a daily <b>diary</b> <b>method,</b> or ecological momentary assessment (EMA), is a research methodology that asks participants to stop at certain times and make notes of their experience in real time. The point is that participants record temporal things like their feelings while in the moment (right then, not later; right there, not elsewhere). They can be given a journal with many identical pages. Each page can have a psychometric scale, open-ended questions, or anything else used to assess their condition in that place and time. Online ESM studies can also operate fully automatized. The experience sampling method was developed by Larson and Csikszentmihalyi.|$|E
50|$|Mace, {{in one of}} {{his recent}} studies, wanted to test the notion that basic {{cognitive}} activities, such as thinking about the past, may prime involuntary memories. To test this idea, Mace set up a <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> study in which participants recorded involuntary memories they experienced during a two-week period, in a diary. During this two-week period, participants also had to come into a laboratory at intervals, and were instructed to recall memories from certain life periods (e.g., high school, first five years of marriage). Following this, comparing their involuntary memories to a control condition found that a significant number of their involuntary memories related to the time period they were instructed to recall. Such findings suggest that involuntary memories may be primed by even the simplest of cognitive tasks—namely, reminiscing and recalling the past.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>diary</b> <b>methods</b> {{have a long}} {{tradition}} of use within psychology and appear to have considerable potential in researching health-related processes and experiences, the use of unstructured <b>diary</b> <b>methods</b> to generate detailed phenomenological accounts within contemporary health psychology has thus far been limited. In this poster presentation, we describe a recently completed British study in which a sample of first-time mothers used voice-recording technology to make daily diary entries about their infant feeding experiences.

In particular, we focus on ethical and epistemological issues, drawing on the accounts of both participants and members of the research team. We also explore the most suitable ways of analysing data derived from diaries and consider the practical advantages and limitations of using audio-diaries. Finally, some of the implications for developing the use of audio-diaries in health psychologists' research and practice are considered...|$|R

40|$|<b>Diary</b> <b>methods</b> offer {{access to}} social behaviour, {{cognitive}} and affective states as they unfold within natural settings. Recording immediately as events occur, allows research into mental states without problems of sensitising and biases. In this chapter, their potential particularly in developing {{our understanding of the}} dynamics of trust is outlined. <b>Diary</b> <b>methods</b> present an exciting opportunity for trust researchers to gather detailed, accurate and multi-faceted insights into social behaviour, {{cognitive and affective}} states as they occur within their natural settings. The approaches allow events and experiences which shape individuals’ perceptions of trust to be richly explored. More importantly for trust scholars, these techniques present the opportunity to develop more comprehensive understandings of the dynamics of trust development, maintenance and repair. Yet despite their potential, to date little research has been conducted using these tools. One of the most promising applications of this technique is the exploration of major events and their resultant changes and transitions. Such events frequently involve shifts in trust levels between parties. Diary studies could look at how different employees respond to changes such as downsizing, or other major trust breakdowns. There is a paucity of longitudinal study generally in research, but especially in examining trust...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} article, we {{introduce}} the continuous unified electronic (CUE) <b>diary</b> <b>method,</b> a longitudinal, event-based, electronic parent report method that allows real-time recording of infant and child behavior in natural contexts. Thirty-nine expectant mothers {{were trained to}} identify and record target behaviors into programmed handheld computers. From birth to 18 months, maternal reporters recorded the initial, second, and third occurrences of seven target motor behaviors: palmar grasp, rolls from side to back, reaching when sitting, pincer grip, crawling, walking, and climbing stairs. Compliance was assessed as two valid entries per behavior: 97 % of maternal reporters met compliance criteria. Reliability was assessed by comparing diary entries with researcher assessments for three of the motor behaviors: palmar grasp, pincer grip and walking. A total of 81 % of maternal reporters met reliability criteria. For those three target behaviors, age of emergence was compared across data from the CUE <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> and researcher assessments.

40|$|After {{receiving}} a red leather diary for my ninth birthday, I practiced writing daily {{for the following}} year. I abandoned my diary activity at age ten and {{did not return to}} it until recently when I traveled during my sabbatical leave. In this paper I present some parts of my travel diary in order to learn more about how the process of living can be recorded. Allport (1942) notes that understanding the “particulars of life ” can be the beginning of psychological knowledge development. Allport’s observation could be considered a call for modern <b>diary</b> <b>methods.</b> After all, <b>diary</b> <b>methods</b> document and explore the particulars of life as self-report instruments examining experiences. Diaries as such provide opportunities to investigate everyday social, psychological and physiological situations. In this way diaries are designed to capture the “little experiences of everyday life that fill most of our working time and occupy the vast majority of our conscious attention ” (Wheeler & Reis, 1991, p. 340). A diarist is in conversation with herself. Conversation itself {{is a reflection of the}} intertwining of the social with cultural processes. Sociocultural theorists emphasize that this intertwining is a primary activity of knowledge co-construction and appropriation (Rogoff, 1990; Wertsch, 1997). At first glance an inner conversation may appear to be an artificial extension of an act that normally transpires between two or more people (Aleven & Ashley, 1997). However, older theories of dialogue with the self (Mead, 1934) have shown that the critical features o...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Time-location {{data are}} {{required}} to characterize human exposure (e. g. air pollution and noise pollution) and to identify important locations where exposures are occurring. There is limited information about time-location patterns of undergraduate students in Asian countries. This {{study was designed to}} compare the <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> with total physical activity among undergraduate university students in Karachi, Pakistan Objective: To compare subjective methods of total physical activity and <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> among undergraduate university students in Karachi, Pakistan Methodology: A cross-sectional study, conducted from September 2012 to May 2013, included 50 students, half each from Aga Khan University Medical College (AKU-MC), and School of Nursing and Midwifery (AKU-SONAM). Time-location pattern was recorded for 24 hours, on any weekday, for each individual through <b>diary</b> <b>method,</b> while physical activity was assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Results: Daily around 24. 8 % of student’s time was spent outdoors (leisure time with friends, recreation), 30. 8 % indoor-inside campus (academics), while 44. 5 % indoor-outside campus. Based on physical activity categories, 8 % of the students were inactive; 52 % were moderately active and 40 % were physically active. Females had higher proportion of vigorous physical activities 42. 3 % as compare to males 37. 5 % Conclusion: Most of the activity takes place inside campus, as compared to leisure activity and travelling.

40|$|In this paper, we {{calibrate}} {{a set of}} {{time use}} variables for a long-running panel survey (the British Household Panel Survey, BHPS, 1994 - 2004) from evidence derived from a smaller scale panel survey that collected time use information by both the survey method and the <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> from the same respondents (the Home On-line Study, HoL, 1999 - 2001). Past {{research has suggested that}} the time <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> produces more accurate and reliable measures of time use than the survey approach. The diary approach, however, usually has a low response rate and is not practicable for a large-scale panel study like the BHPS. On the other hand, direct questioning in survey interviews is a relatively flexible approach to collect time use data. We therefore propose a method to combine the strengths of the survey approach and the <b>diary</b> <b>method</b> to produce time use data. The survey part of the HoL study shares the same questionnaire-derived time-use predictor variables with the BHPS. We use regression of the predictors on the time diary data in the HoL study to calibrate time use in the BHPS by multiplying the resulting regression coefficients with the same predictor variables in the BHPS. Then we get a calibrated index of time-use patterns based on BHPS questionnaire items. The calibrated time use variables cover all major categories of daily activities and are available in Wave 4 (1994) to Wave 14 (2004) of the BHPS. They are useful resources for the study of time use practices and the life course. ...|$|E
