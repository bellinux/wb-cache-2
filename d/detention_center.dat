They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan <b>Detention</b> <b>Center</b> in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the cultural and political meanings of <b>detention</b> <b>centers</b> for undocumented migrants in Greece. Through the consideration of the Dublin Regulation, which holds that asylum seekers’ applications can be evaluated and adjudicated only {{in the country where}} they first enter, and the presence of Frontex at Greece’s borders for an integrated border management, the article situates Greece’s immigration <b>detention</b> <b>centers</b> within the wider context of state sovereignty and policies of admission and detention. Following the theoretical elaborations of Carl Schmitt (2013) and Wendy Brown (2010) on territorial division, the state of exception and waning sovereignty, in conjunction with reports from the Human Rights Watch and the Greek Council for Refugees, the article argues that immigration <b>detention</b> <b>centers</b> have three meanings for EU citizens and migrants. First, the building of <b>detention</b> <b>centers</b> for unregulated immigrants is an explicit attempt to assert the EU member-state as a ‘total state’ where it can discern between friend and enemy and rule by limiting or eliminating diverse forces that might develop in its interior. This rule does not, however, depend on the implementation of the law but on its suspension and consequently this suspension acquires a permanent status. Second, <b>detention</b> <b>centers</b> communicate anxieties regarding order in the interior of the state and fear and danger in the exterior. <b>Detention</b> <b>centers</b> demarcate where European notions of civilization end but they also highlight the point where the civilized subject can be legitimately violent and uncivilized. Third, <b>detention</b> <b>centers</b> not only prevent unregulated immigrants from entering the EU and the nation state but also produce their content. By safeguarding the national and European territories from the threats which unregulated immigration is thought to pose, <b>detention</b> <b>centers</b> help to produce a defensive national subject in fear of being contaminated by the arrival of anonymous, stateless people...|$|R
