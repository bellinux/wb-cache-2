The objective of the research was to evaluate ultrastructural changes of epineurium at early regeneration stages after surgery on peripheral nerve injury using high-frequency electrosurgical technologies. The research involved male Wistar rats. We investigated morphological features of injured peripheral nerve epineurium after nerve ends junction in different ways. Nerve stem integrity was restored using epineural sutures, electrosurgical <b>high-frequency</b> device at <b>welding</b> conditions and bipolar coagulation device. Electron microscopical study of the epineurium fragments from the injury site was conducted in 1, 3, 7, 21 days and immediately after surgery. According to obtained results, the first preliminary stage of epineurium regeneration consisting in trauma site cleaning from nonviable tissue occurs in different ways depending on epineurium coaptation method during nerve injury operative treatment in order to restore nerve stem integrity. <b>High-frequency</b> electrosurgical <b>welding</b> technology is more perspective for implementation in clinical practice due to less tissue debris formation after its application that enhances nerve regeneration. Application of high-frequency electrosurgical devices in welding mode to restore epineurium of injured nerve stem leads to protein denaturation during damaged tissue elimination. It is not accompanied by large quantity of tissue debris formation and results in soft scar tissue formation at damage site. ...|$|R

Besides {{weldable}} component geometries for the <b>high-frequency</b> <b>welding</b> process {{also possible}} process and system induced activated material reactions during discontinuous <b>high-frequency</b> <b>welding</b> {{are presented in}} this paper. Among others such material reactions can be a locally limited thermal influence on the base metal, defined plastic derformations during the upsetting process as well as grain refinement in the weld seam, comparable to thermomechanical treatment during rolling for increasing strength or ductility. The process versions of discontinuous <b>high-frequency</b> <b>welding</b> Discontinuous <b>high-frequency</b> <b>welding</b> is a pressure-welding process. The process sequence consists of two steps. First, the edges to be joined are simultaneously heated over their entire length to a temperature just below the liquidus temperature by Ohmic resistance heating. After completion of the heating process, the joining edges are mutually upset {{in order to ensure}} positive material bonding. The excellent tolerance compatibility of this welding method results from the mechanical pressure-welding process. Moreover, under some circumstances, oxides which are present in the seam are pinched out into the upset metal which is formed during the upsetting operation. This excess metal must then be removed from the resulting component in an additional operational step...|$|E

The control of the system is achieved using two different control techniques i- fuzzy logic control (FLC) ii- state space averaging based sliding control.
