500|$|Certain {{elements}} of Klingon culture, {{such as the}} Emperor, and a general influence of Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were first explored with the script for the two-part [...] "Kitumba". Writer John Meredith Lucas said that [...] "I wanted something that we {{had never seen before}} on the series, and that's a penetration deep into enemy space. I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, but <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what the Klingon society would be like. The Japanese came to mind, so basically that's what it was, with the Sacred Emperor, the Warlord and so on." [...] While the episode itself was later filmed for the fan production , Star Trek first visited the Klingon homeworld in The Next Generation episode [...] "", and the themes would be revisited through the series.|$|E
500|$|In {{another letter}} to McKellar she {{describes}} how in just five days {{she wrote the}} 60,000-word book The River of Adventure, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by listening to what she referred to as her [...] "under-mind", which she contrasted with her [...] "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled {{with the lack of}} variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother [...] "never knew where her stories came from", but that she used to talk about them [...] "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had [...] "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" [...] but never knew the direction her stories would take. [...] Blyton further explained in her biography that [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination." ...|$|E

I'm more patient ... more forgiving and more aware of my own flaws ... Something that comes with age I think. So fittingly this record is called 21 ... Like a photo album you see [...] progression and change ... throughout the years. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of other album titles but couldn't {{come up with anything}} that represented the album properly."-- Adele, on her meaning behind the title.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God, indeed!" [...] Mrs. Barclay said; [...] "but though <b>I</b> hope--though <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it was him--perhaps it was not, perhaps--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Mary Erskine. [...] "I can't {{even begin}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> now. I {{am going to}} wait a week before <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me {{what you}} really think of them?" [...] he begged. [...] "Count Sabatini has been so kind {{to me that if}} <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about him at all I am already prejudiced." ...|$|R
2500|$|Certain {{elements}} of Klingon culture, {{such as a}} general influence of Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were actually first explored with the script for the planned two-part [...] "Kitumba" [...] episode for the unproduced 1978 [...] series. Writer John Meredith Lucas said, [...] "I wanted something that we {{had never seen before}} on the series, and that's a penetration deep into enemy space. I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, but <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what the Klingon society would be like.

6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} man wasn't you--all along. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it was. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> perhaps {{the water had}} altered your wrists and feet and the colour of your hair." ...|$|E
60|$|To my intense surprise, a {{gleam of}} shameful glory lit up his wizened face, and a sound which <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> a sigh, but which {{sounded like a}} chuckle, escaped his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All {{this time}} I write {{with a full}} sense of the {{uncertainty}} of this and every human work. I know the Bishop is preaching on failures, and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he is preaching to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} what <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> When <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{on these things}} my mind gets confused. Only this am I sure of--that they are, they must be, the {{wonderful}} works of the Good Spirit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{the nice}} times--when we went to Mablethorpe, and Robin Hood's Bay, and Shanklin," [...] she said. [...] "After all, not {{everybody}} has seen those beautiful places. And wasn't it beautiful! <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of that, not of the other things." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{some other}} great man, but I had to give it up. [...] "Didn't Miss Anvoy express her {{satisfaction}} in any less diffident way than by her charming present?" [...] I was reduced to asking instead.|$|E
60|$|His {{eyes were}} remarkably small, but marvellously bright and piercing; {{so much so}} that when he turned them again upon me <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> quickly of {{something}} nice about him, feeling sure that he could see right into me.|$|E
6000|$|... “The beast! the beast!” cried Elizabeth, veiling {{her face}} with her hand. “Oh! I saw nothing, I thought of nothing but the beast. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of better things, but the horror was too glaring, the danger too much before my eyes.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Lewson's {{expression}} grew grim. [...] "That's {{the thing}} that hurts the most--to go away before I got even with that man," [...] he declared. [...] "Still, I may get over it if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him with his nose smashed hard to starboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are my doctor, they say, {{and this}} is your house. Tell me what it means--tell me. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> and there is nothing. Something has {{happened}} to my head. Have I been ill for long? Who am I? Where did I come from? Why am I here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could say}} the same of my memory," [...] I answered. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of matters that are a year old, I seldom find my remembrance as vivid as I could wish it to be. Take the dinner at Lady Verinder's, for instance----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. When you {{are dead}} you're not there, you know. Our bodies are but {{senseless}} clay." [...] I was glad I remembered that line. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of the next}} one, which was about food for worms; but it evaded me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{some good}} reason why [...] "big things" [...] should hunt foxes, {{and he should}} not hunt snails, but none came into my head: so I said at last, [...] "Well, I suppose one's {{as good as the}} other. I'll go snail-hunting myself some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Those {{were black}} nights,” said Jimmy. “While I waited <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be}} better if I saw no more of her. But I knew all the time that I couldn’t take that prudent course.” He paused with an {{appealing}} gesture. “Ruth, haven’t I said enough?” ...|$|E
2500|$|Welles would {{occasionally}} return to Woodstock, {{the place he}} eventually named {{when he was asked}} in a 1960 interview, [...] "Where is home?" [...] Welles replied, [...] "I suppose it's Woodstock, Illinois, if it's anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a home, it's that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{shook her}} head, and tears sprang into her eyes. [...] "Oh no, Edmund; <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it home, and the {{children}} feel it so, {{but it is not}} like Woodley. Do you remember the dear old oak-tree, with the branches that came down so low, where you used to swing Mary and me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a slow-witted man," [...] said John, [...] "and, in sooth, when <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{about such}} matters it casts a gloom upon me. Yet I {{do not look}} upon myself as a worse man in an archer's jerkin than I was in a white cowl, if that be what you mean." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} bewilderment of my heated brain <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what slanderer could have traced {{my family to}} the ignoble animal {{mentioned}} above. Vain were my endeavours. At {{the end of that}} dance I whispered the Colonel to come into the cloak-room, and I showed him the note.|$|E
60|$|Who {{could he}} be? Somebody who loved me very much, {{and who was}} very sorry. My childish logic carried me to that length. But when <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> over all the grown-up gentlemen who loved me very much, I could never get on, to my own satisfaction, beyond {{my father and my}} Uncle George.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{am afraid}} you will think--because I have said strange things--that I {{have been talking}} at random," [...] she insisted. [...] "The doctor will say that, if you meet with him. He {{believes}} I am deluded by a dream. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so myself. It was of no use; I am quite sure he is wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was, and {{he helped}} me when I was stranded," [...] was the answer. [...] "I can't give ye all the particulars, cos some o' 'em {{is more like a}} dream than {{anything}} <b>to</b> me. When <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> my head begins to swim," [...] and the sailor wrinkled his forehead as before and twitched his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes I {{stand for}} hours and peer at my face and wonder at it. At times I turn it upside down and gaze intently at it. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what it means. It seems {{to look back at}} me with its great brown eyes as if it knew me and wanted to speak to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I am not like other girls," [...] she said wistfully. [...] "I cannot {{remember}} my father, or {{my life in}} India, or the voyage. When <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about these things my head plays me such strange tricks. I cannot remember where I was, or what I was doing a year ago--but----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will think}} of no one but Hugh Stanbury. I tried not to love him, mamma. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that it was better}} to make believe that I loved Mr. Glascock. But he got the better of me, and conquered me, and I will never rebel against him. You may help me, mamma;--but you can't change me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{it was a}} sick fancy, {{and would}} not let it trouble anyone. But when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, {{it was hard to}} feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable, Jo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That motive {{would have}} been piety. If a boy takes pains {{to do what is}} right, and avoid what is wrong, because he is {{grateful}} to God, and wishes to please him, it is piety. But I was afraid that would not have much influence with you, and so <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of some other motive. I thought of filial affection next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{a private}} marriage, and cross guardians, and the usual difficulties. In the midst of it all, poor John fell in battle, as you know, and his widow {{followed}} him to the grave, within a month or two. 'Twas a sad story all round, and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it as little as possible." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{you looked}} at my songs 15-16 years ago, you would know what I mean. Learning to finish a song is a process. I've written so many songs...you just learn things you don't want to say, things you've said before. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{interesting}} or quirky things {{that no one else}} has said," [...] Sanders told American Songwriter.|$|R
6000|$|He read {{it through}} slowly, {{and when he}} had done, kept it open in his hand. [...] "I have youth, titles, wealth," [...] he thought to himself, sadly; [...] "everything that is sought after in this world. And yet if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of any human being who really and truly loves me, I can {{remember}} but one--the poor, faithful girl who wrote these lines!" ...|$|R
