5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle and index <b>fingers</b> <b>crossed</b> was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E

500|$|Critics speculated on the {{commercial}} risk of localizing Tatsunoko vs. Capcom for the Wii.

[...] Furthermore, he expressed that the third act was when the film began falling apart, saying, [...] "McG and Nolan muddied the end of the picture, delivering action generics (yet another Terminator fight in a factory) while never finding their own hook that would give this movie more of an impact than you would get from an expanded universe novel."

40|$|The {{authors have}} no {{financial}} conflicts of interest. Purpose: We reviewed {{the results of}} <b>cross</b> <b>finger</b> flaps after surgical release and vigorous postoperative exercises for long-standing, severe flexion contractures of the Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints of fingers. Materials and Methods: In 9 patients, all contracted tissue was sequentially released and the resultant skin defect {{was covered with a}} cross-finger flap. The cause of the contracture was contact burn in 4, skin graft in 3, and a previous operation in 2. The mean followup period was 41. 2 months. Results: The mean flexion contracture/further flexion in the joints were improved from 73. 4 / 87. 8 O to 8. 4 / 95. 4 O at the last follow-up. A mean of 19. 5 O of extension was achieved with vigorous extension exercise after the operation. The mean gain in range of motion (ROM) was 79. 4 O. Near full ROM was achieved in 3 cases. There were no major complications. Conclusion: In severe flexion contractures with scarring of the PIP joints of <b>fingers,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>finger</b> flaps after sufficient release and vigorous postoperative exercise seems to be a reasonable option to obtain satisfactory ROM of the joints...|$|R

5000|$|Common {{usage of}} the gesture traces {{back to the early}} centuries of the Catholic Church. Common use of <b>crossed</b> <b>fingers</b> is found in the Christians who would <b>cross</b> their <b>fingers</b> in order to invoke the power {{associated}} with Christ's cross for protection, when faced with evil. Moreover, Christians, when persecuted by the Romans, used the symbol of <b>crossed</b> <b>fingers</b> in order to recognize one another and assemble for Holy Mass. [...] "When they were persecuted in Rome, Christians would secretly come together with the sign of the fish, and they would hold up their <b>crossed</b> <b>fingers,</b> as a Sign of the crossed emblem that had once been on the vestments of the army of Barabbas. It became a custom everywhere, for Christians when meeting, to make the sign of a cross by crossing their fingers." [...] In 16th century England, people continued to <b>cross</b> <b>fingers</b> or make {{the sign of the cross}} in order to ward off evil, as well as when people coughed or sneezed.|$|R
2500|$|The five-member group {{began to}} work on their debut album, <b>Fingers</b> <b>Crossed,</b> at Super Melody World, Cecil's {{recording}} studio built in a church hall in a south-eastern suburb. Recording was halted when Bird left for an extended holiday in the US, leaving the album unfinished. Upon return from Portland, Oregon, Bird was inspired to write short, catchy pop songs, which marked a new direction for the band. At art school, Bird met members of The Rhinestone Horns, a brass ensemble, and he recruited Isobel Knowles, Tara Shackell and Gus Franklin – all three originally from Victoria's Western District – to complete Architecture in Helsinki's eight-member line-up.

Alex Macpherson from BBC Online commented that [...] "Scherzinger {{is one of the few}} pop performers with the requisite power to dominate [...] beats rather than vice versa.
