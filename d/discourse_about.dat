500|$|In a {{discussion}} about the book in Slate magazine, John Horgan was particularly moved by Gladwell's family history. He felt that the links between race and achievement were given substantive analysis, but found the lessons mentioned in Outliers to be [...] "oddly anticlimactic, even dispiriting". His contribution concluded by remarking, [...] "Outliers represents a squandered opportunity for Gladwell—himself an outlier, an enormously talented and influential writer and the descendant of an African slave—to make a major contribution to our ongoing <b>discourse</b> <b>about</b> nature, nurture, and race." [...] BusinessWeek gave the book four out of five stars and appreciated its [...] "Aha!" [...] moments, but wondered if Gladwell purposely omits evidence that contradicts his thesis. The review remarked that Outliers was repetitive in parts, but that Gladwell eventually pulls the stories together into an overarching narrative.|$|E

One suggestion is that the darkness is a deliberate inversion of the transfiguration; alternately, Jesus's earlier <b>discourse</b> <b>about</b> a future tribulation mentions the sun being darkened, and can be seen as foreshadowing this scene. Striking details such as the darkening of the sky and the tearing of the temple veil may be a way of focusing the reader away from the shame and humiliation [...] of the crucifixion; one professor of biblical theology concluded, [...] "it is clear that Jesus is not a humiliated criminal but a man of great significance. His death is therefore not a sign of his weakness but of his power." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "there is in the entire state no restraining influence of decency, not in the state capital, among the daily newspapers, the clergy, nor any segment of the so-called better citizens."

Mamie Till Bradley and her family knew none of this, having been told only that Louis had been killed for [...] "willful misconduct." [...] Mississippi senators James Eastland and John C.

Although Emmett Till's murder trial was over, news about his father was carried {{on the front pages}} of Mississippi newspapers for weeks in October and November 1955. This renewed debate about Emmett Till's actions and Carolyn Bryant's integrity. Stephen Whitfield writes that the lack of attention paid to identifying or finding Till is [...] "strange" [...] compared to the amount of published <b>discourse</b> <b>about</b> his father.
