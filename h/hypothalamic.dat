5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several <b>hypothalamic</b> nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These <b>hypothalamic</b> nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the <b>hypothalamic</b> thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes {{are responsible for the}} aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a <b>hypothalamic</b> temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|The term {{limbic system}} was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the <b>hypothalamic</b> mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} limbic system.|$|E
25|$|Periaqueductal grey (with <b>hypothalamic</b> hormone aid) hormonally signals reticular formation’s raphe nuclei {{to produce}} {{serotonin}} that inhibits laminae pain nuclei.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>hypothalamic</b> nuclei {{are sexually}} dimorphic; i.e., {{there are clear}} {{differences}} in both structure and function between males and females.|$|E
25|$|Women with PCOS {{experience}} an increased frequency of <b>hypothalamic</b> GnRH pulses, {{which in turn}} results {{in an increase in}} the LH/FSH ratio.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} how all {{peptides}} that influence <b>hypothalamic</b> activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon <b>hypothalamic</b> secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain {{is not clear}}. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.|$|E
25|$|Early {{stages of}} male <b>hypothalamic</b> {{maturation}} {{seem to be}} very similar to the early stages of female puberty, though occurring about 1–2 years later.|$|E
25|$|Citicoline {{has also}} been shown to elevate ACTH {{independently}} from CRH levels and to amplify the release of other HPA axis hormones such as LH, FSH, GH and TSH in response to <b>hypothalamic</b> releasing factors.|$|E
25|$|According to Cloninger, the {{norepinephrine}} neurotransmitter has {{its major}} ascending pathways arising in the locus coeruleus in the pons, projecting onward to the <b>hypothalamic</b> and limbic structures, and then branching upwards to the neocortex.|$|E
25|$|Neurokinin B (a tachykinin peptide) and kisspeptin (a neuropeptide), both {{present in}} the same <b>hypothalamic</b> neurons, are {{critical}} parts of the control system that switches on the release of GnRH {{at the start of}} puberty.|$|E
25|$|When {{the stomach}} is empty, ghrelin is secreted. When the stomach is stretched, {{secretion}} stops. It acts on <b>hypothalamic</b> brain cells both to increase hunger, {{and to increase}} gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility to prepare the body for food intake.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} activins: Activin A, Activin B and Activin AB. Activins are {{involved}} in embryogenesis and osteogenesis. They also regulate many hormones including pituitary, gonadal and <b>hypothalamic</b> hormones as well as insulin. They are also nerve cell survival factors.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is responsible}} for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing hormones or <b>hypothalamic</b> hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} <b>hypothalamic</b> {{function is}} responsive to—and regulated by—levels {{of all three}} classical monoamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), in those tracts from which it receives innervation. For example, noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins {{are local}} hormones (paracrine) {{produced}} {{in the body and}} have diverse effects in the body, including but not limited to transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the <b>hypothalamic</b> thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots.|$|E
25|$|In the hypothalamic–adenohypophyseal axis, {{releasing}} hormones, {{also known}} as hypophysiotropic or <b>hypothalamic</b> hormones, are released from the median eminence, a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones.|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, {{the woman}} {{undergoes}} many physiological changes, which are entirely normal, including cardiovascular, hematologic, metabolic, renal, and respiratory changes. Increases in blood sugar, breathing, and cardiac output are all required. Levels of progesterone and oestrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the <b>hypothalamic</b> axis and therefore also the menstrual cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} has {{a central}} neuroendocrine function, most notably by its {{control of the}} anterior pituitary, which in turn regulates various endocrine glands and organs. Releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) are produced in <b>hypothalamic</b> nuclei then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released as needed.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the effects listed above, use of high-dose steroids {{for more than a}} week begins to produce suppression of the patient's adrenal glands because the exogenous glucocorticoids suppress <b>hypothalamic</b> corticotropin-releasing hormone and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone. With prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), and can take months to recover full function after discontinuation of the exogenous glucocorticoid.|$|E
25|$|More radical {{approaches}} have been studied. A duck or goose with a ventromedian <b>hypothalamic</b> (VMH) lesion will {{tend not to}} feel satiated after eating, and will therefore eat more than a non-lesioned animal. By producing such lesions surgically, {{it is possible to}} increase the bird's food consumption when permitted to eat ad libitum, by a factor of more than two.|$|E
25|$|Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, {{which include}} {{interleukin-1}} (IL-1), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), Interferon-gamma (IFN-Gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth {{as well as}} neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as macrophages, as well as glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of <b>hypothalamic</b> function is an active area of research {{for the treatment of}} anxiety-related disorders.|$|E
25|$|Sex steroids are not {{the only}} {{important}} influences upon <b>hypothalamic</b> development; in particular, pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor. Unlike gonadal steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its function in energy homeostasis, ghrelin also activates the cholinergic–dopaminergic reward link in inputs to the ventral tegmental area and in the mesolimbic pathway, a circuit that communicates the hedonic and reinforcing aspects of natural rewards, such as food and addictive drugs such as ethanol. Ghrelin receptors are located on neurons in this circuit. <b>Hypothalamic</b> ghrelin signalling is required for reward from alcohol and palatable/rewarding foods.|$|E
25|$|Feeding: A 2012 paper {{suggested}} that oxytocin neurons in the para-ventricular hypothalamus {{in the brain}} may {{play a key role}} in suppressing appetite under normal conditions and that other <b>hypothalamic</b> neurons may trigger eating via inhibition of these oxytocin neurons. This population of oxytocin neurons are absent in Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that leads to uncontrollable feeding and obesity, and may {{play a key role in}} its pathophysiology.|$|E
25|$|Hypogonadal {{states can}} cause {{secondary}} osteoporosis. These include Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, anorexia nervosa, andropause, <b>hypothalamic</b> amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia. In females, {{the effect of}} hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as early menopause (<45 years) or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea (>1 year). Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries) and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is the cause (for example, andropause or after surgical removal of the testes).|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin's exact {{mechanism}} of action is unknown, but several {{studies have shown that}} isotretinoin induces apoptosis (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body. Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands, <b>hypothalamic</b> cells, hippocampus cells and—important for treatment of acne—in sebaceous gland cells. Isotretinoin has a low affinity for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), but may be converted intracellularly to metabolites that act as agonists of RAR and RXR nuclear receptors.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{released}} by the <b>hypothalamic</b> pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress, of which cortisol is the most prominent in humans. Results in adults suggest that reduced levels of cortisol, linked to lower fear or a reduced stress response, {{can be associated with}} more aggression. However, it may be that proactive aggression is associated with low cortisol levels while reactive aggression may be accompanied by elevated levels. Differences in assessments of cortisol may also explain a diversity of results, particularly in children.|$|E
25|$|Glucokinase {{has been}} found in the brain in largely the same areas that contain glucose-sensing neurons, {{including}} both of the <b>hypothalamic</b> nuclei. Inhibition of glucokinase abolishes the ventromedial nucleus response to a meal. However, brain glucose levels are lower than plasma levels, typically 0.5–3.5mmol/L. Although this range is matches the sensitivity of the glucose-sensing neurons, it is below the optimal inflection sensitivity for glucokinase. The presumption, based on indirect evidence and speculation, is that neuronal glucokinase is somehow exposed to plasma glucose levels even in the neurons.|$|E
25|$|Compulsions in male lab mice, such {{as those}} in {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme aromatase in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. <b>Hypothalamic</b> protein levels in the gene COMT are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which are believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to normal activity. Aromatase deficiency is ultimately suspected which is involved in the synthesis of estrogen in humans and has therapeutic implications in humans having obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a patient should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as {{this can lead to}} sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the <b>hypothalamic</b> production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to renal pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).|$|E
25|$|Although {{most of the}} {{glucokinase}} in {{the body}} is in the liver, smaller amounts in the beta and alpha cells of the pancreas, certain <b>hypothalamic</b> neurons, and specific cells (enterocytes) of the gut play an increasingly appreciated role in regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In the context of glucokinase function, these cell types are collectively referred to as neuroendocrine tissues, and they share some aspects of glucokinase regulation and function, especially the common neuroendocrine promoter. Of the neuroendocrine cells, the beta cells of the pancreatic islets are the most-studied and best-understood. It is likely {{that many of the}} regulatory relationships discovered in the beta cells will also exist in the other neuroendocrine tissues with glucokinase.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{flashes and}} other vasomotor {{symptoms}} accompany the menopausal transition. While many sources continue {{to claim that}} hot flashes during the menopausal transition are caused by low estrogen levels, this assertion was shown incorrect in 1935 and, in most cases, hot flashes are observed despite elevated estrogen levels. The exact cause of these symptoms is not yet understood, possible factors considered are higher and erratic variation of estradiol level during the cycle, elevated FSH levels which may indicate <b>hypothalamic</b> dysregulation perhaps caused by missing feedback by inhibin. It has been also observed that the vasomotor symptoms differ during early perimenopause and late menopausal transition {{and it is possible}} that they are caused by a different mechanism.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD {{were found to have}} lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and <b>hypothalamic</b> availability. The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of adrenarche and its {{relationship}} to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal androgens (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of <b>hypothalamic</b> puberty. Adrenal androgens {{contribute to the development of}} pubic hair (pubarche), adult body odor, and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.|$|E
