5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Environmental Management Plan there is the Kaikōura Marine Strategy developed by Te Korowai o Te Tai ō Marokura (Kaikōura Coastal Marine Guardians) and is currently in proposal form. Te Korowai membership is not only that of Te Rūnanga o Kaikōura, but also local organisations involved at differing levels of responsibility such as Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and Kaikōura District Council and various concerned government ministries and interest groups. It is this inclusion of local, regional and national organisations that strengthens the opportunities for Ngāti Kuri values and kaitiakitanga principles to be supported in any proposed implementations in the frequently socially and politically contentious coastal environment. [...] Based from local knowledge and best available science the Kaikoura Marine Strategy has a vision formed around four outcomes and four “cross cutting implementation actions”. These outcomes are fishing for abundance, protecting local treasures, living sustainably and sustaining customary practices with the <b>implementation</b> <b>actions</b> being engaging understanding, governance, compliance and monitoring and review.|$|E

According to TPB, additional benefits likely could be achieved by developing <b>implementation</b> <b>actions</b> focused on proactively engaging the public to prevent disturbing behaviors before they occur. Survey results indicated that field staff already engage in proactive actions despite not being trained extensively to do so. In addition, staff held substantially more positive evaluative beliefs about proactive interactions than reactive interactions. Rather than identifying problems confronting the CWP, these results identify opportunities that can be built on to improve the program...|$|E

Food fortification is a prominent nutrition intervention to combat such deficiencies; however, its effectiveness, risks, and ethical implications {{vary depending on}} the contexts associated with the deficiency it is addressing and the circumstances with its implementation. The aim of this research was to analyse the profile of nutrition interventions for combating micronutrient deficiency with particular focus on food fortification reported in existing systematic reviews (SRs), guidelines and policy statements, and <b>implementation</b> <b>actions</b> for nutrition. A review of secondary data available from online databases of SRs, guidelines and policy statements, and <b>implementation</b> <b>actions,</b> categorised as either "nutrition-specific interventions" (NSpI) or "nutrition-sensitive interventions" (NSeI), was conducted. Currently, there is evidence available for a diversity of food fortification topics, and there has been much translation into action. Indeed, food fortification and micronutrient supplementation interventions and NSpI more broadly dominate the profile of interventions for which there were SRs, guidelines, and policy statements available. The findings demonstrate that, although there is a rational linear relationship between evidence synthesis and translation in formulating policy and actions to combat micronutrient deficiencies, the various nutrition interventions available to help combat micronutrient deficiencies are not equally represented in the evidence synthesis and translation processes. Effective and safe policies and actions to combat micronutrient deficiencies require decisions to be informed from a body of evidence that consists of evidence from a variety of interventions. Into the future, investment in making available a higher number of SRs, guidelines and policy statements, and actions of NSeI is indicated...|$|E

This is the landslide and debris flow-specific implementation plan. See also sdr. gov for other hazard-specific implementation plans. What is at Stake? DEFINITION AND BACKGROUND. Landslides are triggered by a number of mechanisms, including intense rainstorms and earthquakes, wildland fire, coastal erosion, and the loss of permafrost in arctic regions. The most dangerous landslides are debris flows where slope material becomes saturated with water resulting in a slurry of rock and mud picking up trees, houses, and cars, thus, at times, blocking bridges and tributaries, causing flooding along its path. IMPACTS. Landslides, debris flows, and other forms of ground failure affect communities in every state of the Nation. Despite advances in science and technology, these events continue to result in human suffering, billions of dollars in property losses, and environmental degradation every year. 1 Approximately two-thirds of the United States population lives in counties where landslide susceptibility is moderate to high. 2...|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{developed}} and evaluated a tailored programme to implement three evidence-based recommendations for multimorbid patients with polypharmacy into primary care practices: structured medication counselling including brown bag reviews, {{the use of}} medication lists and medication reviews. No effect on the primary outcome was found. This process evaluation aimed to identify factors associated with outcomes by exploring nine hypotheses specified in the logic model of the tailored programme. Methods: The tailored programme was developed with respect to identified determinants of practice and consisted of a workshop for practice teams, elaboration of <b>implementation</b> <b>action</b> plans, aids for medication reviews, a multilingual info-tool for patients on a tablet PC, posters and brown paper bags as reminders for patients. The tailored programme was evaluated in a cluster randomized trial. The process evaluation was based on various data sources: interviews with general practitioners and medical assistants of the intervention group and a survey with general practitioners of the intervention and control group, written reports on the <b>implementation</b> <b>action</b> plans, documentation forms for structured medication counselling and the log file of the info-tool. Results: We analyzed 12 interviews, 21 questionnaires, 120 documentation forms for medication counselling, 5 <b>implementation</b> <b>action</b> plans and one log file of the info-tool. The most frequently reported effect of the tailored programme was the increase of awareness for the health problem and the recommendations, while implementation of routine processes was only reported for structured medication counselling. The survey largely confirmed {{the usefulness of the}} applied strategies, yet the interviews provided a more detailed understanding of the actual use of the strategies and several suggestions for modifications of the tailored programme. Conclusions: The tailored programme seemed to have induced awareness as a first step of behaviour change. Several modifications of the tailored programme may enhance its effectiveness such as conducting outreach visits instead of a workshop, improved targeting, provision of evidence, integration of tools into the practice software and information materials in tailored formats.

This is the coastal inundation-specific implementation plan. See also sdr. gov for other hazard-specific implementation plans. What is at Stake? DEFINITION AND BACKGROUND. Coastal inundation is the flooding of coastal lands, including wave action, usually resulting from riverine flooding, spring tides, severe storms, or seismic activity (tsunami). With over 50 percent of the United States population living in the coastal zone 1 and as the source of {{more than half of the}} nation’s economic productivity, 2 the impacts of coastal inundation can be severe. Longterm vulnerability and future impacts are exacerbated by sea-level variability and land subsidence as well as long- and short-term climate change affecting wave heights and coastal and riverine water levels. As a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, coastal inundation throughout Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama left millions without power and tens of thousands in temporary housing, 3 and severely impacted critical coastal and riverine ecosystems. In addition, our nation’s energy supply, ability to ship goods, and overall commerce were significantly affected. ...|$|E
