The process of applying for mineral rights was also being revised as of 2006. All minerals located on or under the surface are the exclusive property of the Government, except for hydrocarbons and water, which are regulated under separate laws. The principal role of the Government with respect to minerals is to promote the efficient development of the mineral industry by the private sector. The Ministry of Mines and Industries is responsible for the administration and implementation of the Mining Law. The Law provides investment security to the holder of a mineral right. The Government cannot expropriate mineral rights without adequate compensation in accordance with international norms. The Law also gives the mineral royalty rates, which range from 5% of gross revenue for industrial minerals to up to 10% for gemstones. Other changes in Government policy in 2006 included the legalization of the gemstone trade, Government control of the gemstone industry, and <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in mining.|$|E

A general equilibrium, vintage capital model is then developed that accounts {{for the long run}} relationship between employment protection and diffusion. ^ The model economy is characterized by constant job and establishment turnover, with such turnover depending partly on the process of technological change. It is capable of reproducing a number of statistics that characterize job and establishment turnover in the US economy. Employment protection suppresses both entry and adoption and delays exit, retarding diffusion as observed in the data. ^ Additionally, the effect of industrial subsidies on diffusion is explored. Income subsidies substantially change the structure of turnover by delaying obsolescence, and have a detrimental effect on output and welfare. Capital subsidies accelerate diffusion but have a large and negative impact on output and welfare, even though their target is the <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in productivity.

Which was more successful labor intensive or capital intensive industries? Which were more successful private ownership industries or public ownership? To provide answers to the previous questions, Jordan experience will be evaluated in light of the following: 1 - Profit maximization is the prime goal of any investor, and the question is; which industries achieved higher profits, the small or larger scale industries? 2 - The efficiency of any industry can be measured, in addition to its profitability, by its productivity level which is considered the source of profitability. 3 - Capital intensive industries believed to be more productive than labor intensive industries. Therefore, the analyses will take these intensities into consideration when evaluating profitability and productivity levels. Evaluating the previous three indicators (profitability, productivity, and capital and labor intensities, on the industry level not firm level), will be carried out to show the degree o...|$|E

One of the principal requirements for economic growth, and quite possibly for the Palestinian Authority 2 ̆ 7 s economic survival, is foreign investment in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG). As they currently exist, laws concerning foreign investment in WBG are a quagmire. Indeed, it is a challenge for an investor to simply identify which law applies to which area, let alone to interpret the law. At the same time many of the protections often found in a transparent 2 ̆ 7 rule of law 2 ̆ 7 society are still lacking in the WBG. This article provides an examination of one such issue-the commercial arbitration laws applicable to foreign investment in WBG.

Next, it examines how a PA arbitration law fits into the Interim Agreement.

A chemical test for produced wastewater was evident that the pollution load and waste constitutions is exceeding the permissible limits stated by laws which indicated miss control and absence of pretreatment plant for produced wastewater in most of industries prior to discharge in public sewer.
