50|$|Next follows an {{elaborate}} discussion upon {{what are called}} <b>estates</b> <b>upon</b> <b>condition</b> - a class of interests that occupied a large space in the early common law, giving rise, on one side, to estates tail, and, on another, to mortgages. In Littleton's time, a mortgage, which he carefully describes, was merely a conveyance of land by the tenant to the mortgagee, with a condition that, if the tenant paid to the mortgagee a certain sum on a certain day, he might reënter and have the land again. If the condition was not fulfilled, {{the interest of the}} mortgagee became absolute, and Littleton gives no indication of any modification of this strict rule, such as was introduced by courts of equity, permitting the debtor to redeem his land by payment of all that was due to the mortgagee although the day of payment had passed, and his interest had become, at law, indefeasible. The remainder of the work is occupied with an exposition of a miscellaneous class of modes of acquiring rights of property, the analysis of which would occupy too large a space.|$|R
40|$|This article envisages a {{model of}} making credit {{decisions}} from the investor?s point of view amid priori information about the market capacity. One of the main objectives for every company is a possible loan default risk minimization. In general, there is a variety of models which evaluate business {{depending on the size}} of a loan. However, it is crucially important for a creditor who draws upon a credit for further real <b>estate</b> investments <b>upon</b> <b>condition</b> of prices instability to choose an optimal extent of a credit. Indeed there is always a risk of a real estate overproduction or vice versa underproduction. And hence loan repayment difficulties may arise. In order to avoid a set of such issues it is necessary to consider many factors, namely to estimate predicted construction sector development and possible real estate sales revenue, i. e. market capacity in the sector. This model will be helpful for an investor while making optimal decisions about adequate requested extent of a credit for his successful growth. A given model can also be used not only for a loan size determination, but also in calculation of required loan repayment terms with real estate revenues predefined on the interval. An example of the model is given. ? ?????? ?????? ???????????? ? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ? ??????? ????????? ? ???????? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ????? ????????????. ?????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ? ?????? ??? ???????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ??? ?? ????????????. ???????? ????????? ??????...|$|R
