40|$|We {{describe}} an ef cient technique for out-of-core construction and accurate view-dependent visualization of very large surface models. The method uses a regular conformal hierarchy of tetrahedra to spatially partition the model. Each tetrahedral cell contains a precomputed simplified {{version of the}} original model, represented using cache coherent <b>indexed</b> <b>strips</b> for fast rendering. The representation is constructed during a fine-to-coarse simplification of the surface contained in diamonds (sets of tetrahedral cells sharing their longest edge). The construction preprocess operates out-ofcore and parallelizes nicely. Appropriate boundary constraints are introduced in the simplification {{to ensure that all}} conforming selective subdivisions of the tetrahedron hierarchy lead to correctly matching surface patches. For each frame at runtime, the hierarchy is traversed coarse-to-fine to select diamonds of the appropriate resolution given the view parameters. The resulting system can interatively render high quality views of out-of-core models of hundreds of millions of triangles at over 40 Hz (or 70 M triangles/s) on current commodity graphics platforms...|$|R

This study aims to develop methods for quantifying the {{effectiveness of}} defences, thereby allowing for comparisons between individuals and localities. Measurements of a range of thorn and branching parameters of eight Acacia species were used to calculate three <b>indices</b> (<b>stripping,</b> biting and branching) describing different components of Acacia structural defences. These were combined to form an overall defence index that was tested against the results of three feeding simulation tests as well as actual animal feeding rates obtained from trials using nyala held in bomas. The stripping, biting and branching indices were shown to provide a good measure of the different components of a structural defence, although the scaling of their contribution to an overall defence index is complicated by variation in the suite of browsers and the resources available at a locality. The indices developed in this study provide a useful tool for assessing the role of large mammal herbivory in different environments when attempting to understand variation in the life history strategies of Acacias...|$|R
40|$|SABIO is a {{multidisciplinary}} project involving the emerging fields of micro-nanotechnology, photonics, fluidics and bio-chemistry, targeting {{a contribution to}} the development of intelligent diagnostic equipment through the demonstration of a compact polymer based and silicon-based CMOS-compatible micro-nano system. It integrates optical biosensors for label-free biomolecular recognition based on a novel photonic structure named slot-waveguide with immobilized bimolecular receptors on its surface. The slot-waveguides provide high optical intensity in a sub wavelength-size low refractive index region (slot-region) sandwiched between two high refractive <b>index</b> <b>strips</b> (rails) [1] leading to an enhanced interaction between the optical probe and biomolecular complexes (antibody-antigen). As such a biosensor is predicted to exhibit a surface concentration detection-limit lower than 1 pg/mm 2, state-of-the-art in label free integrated optical biosensors, as well as the possibility of multiplexed assay, which, together with reduced reaction volumes, leads to the ability to perform rapid multi-analytesensing and comprehensive tests. This offers the further advantageous possibility of assaying several parameters simultaneously and consequently, statistical analysis of these results can potentially increase the reliability and reduce the measurement uncertainty of a diagnostic over single-parameter assays.

The process above will be repeated iteratively until a cropping window can be selected which makes the content loss acceptable. The experimental results show that our proposed method can protect more important content information than traditional cropping and make less deformation than previous content-aware media retargeting method. <b>Index</b> Terms—Media retargeting, <b>strip</b> process, multi-operator.

40|$|Although {{photonics}} {{offers an}} attractive {{solution to the}} speed limitation of electronics, reducing the size of bulky photonic components {{is one of the}} major issues towards the implementation of photonic integrated circuits. Plasmonic circuits, which tightly confine electromagnetic waves at the metal-dielectric interface, can be a potential solution to this problem. Despite an excessive amount of papers published in the field, there exist an inconsistency in terms of the measure of plasmonic modal properties, especially their mode size. In this thesis work, several representative plasmonic structures are studied and there modal characteristics are cross-compared. Confinement has been calculated using several definitions in order to measure their figure of merits consistently. In addition, we propose a plasmonic waveguide, which achieves both deep sub-wavelength scale confinement and relatively long propagation. The waveguide consists a metal nanowire on top of a high <b>index</b> dielectric <b>strip</b> which can be made of Germanium. The hybridization of dielectric mode and cylinder plasmon polariton mode leads to localization of the mode energy in the nanoscale gap. This structure outperforms existing plasmonic waveguides in terms of gure of merit, which makes the waveguide particularly useful in high density photonic integrated circuits. This thesis also investigates optical forces due to the enhanced gradient field in plasmonic waveguides. Gradient forces and trapping forces are calculated using Maxwell's stress tensor for dierent hybrid waveguides, among which the forces with the proposed waveguide structure are found to be the largest...|$|R

Conjugation experiments were conducted to determine the transmission of blaNDM- 1 -positive strains. RESULTS: Among 2, 170 Enterobacteriaceae and 600 ABCs, seven Enterobacteriaceae strains and two A. calcoaceticus isolates from five different cities carried the blaNDM- 1 gene. The seven Enterobacteriaceae strains comprised four Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Enterobacter cloacae, one Enterobacter aerogen and one Citrobacter freundii. All seven were non-susceptible to imipenem, meropenem or ertapenem. Two A. calcoaceticus species were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. Three K. pneumoniae showed the same PFGE profiles. The blaNDM- 1 genes of eight strains were localized on plasmids, while one was chromosomal. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous reports, the numbers and species containing the blaNDM- 1 in Enterobacteriaceae have significantly increased in China.

However, these schemes require evaluation to estimate their efficiency, for further consolidation and improvement. The establishment of grassy strips along watercourses represents a measure of cross-compliance introduced in France in 2005. In this study, we analyzed the benefits of these new landscape elements for biodiversity, by (i) exploring the plant community composition of grassy strips {{in relation to their}} landscape context, (ii) analyzing the faunal communities of three major functional groups (i. e., small mammals, syrphids, and carabid beetles) present in grassy strips of agroecosystems, (iii) comparing the faunal biodiversity to that observed in other habitats of agroecosystems, such as fields and hedgerows, and (iv) investigating the relationships between faunal community <b>indices</b> and grassy <b>strip</b> properties. The results of our study showed that the plant community of grassy strips is mainly influenced by semi-natural habitats that are present within a landscape context, i. e., at a scale > 500 m. We found that grassy strips do not necessarily present areas of particularly high animal biodiversity compared to other habitats (i. e., fields and hedgerows). However, the properties of these strips (i. e., length, width and plant biodiversity) influence the structure of faunal communities. Two years after the establishment of grassy strips, their role as ecotones between previous field margins (mostly hedgerows in our study site) is illustrated through the response of the fauna.

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. Most tissues in the body are under mechanical tension, and while enzymes mediate many cellular and extracellular processes, the effects of mechanical forces on enzyme reactions in native extracellular matrix (ECM) are not well known. Previous studies have shown that elastin remodeling in the lung occurs during the progression of emphysema, a disease that involves enzymatic cleavage of various ECM proteins of the parenchyma. Here we hypothesize that physiological levels of mechanical forces are also capable of modifying the activity of collagenase, a key remodeling enzyme of the ECM, leading to increased collagen deterioration, which results in decreased ECM stiffness. To test this, we measured the changes in mechanical properties of lung tissue strips under various conditions of stretch and digestion. Specifically, we analyzed the stiffness and nonlinearity <b>index</b> of tissue <b>strips</b> tested under uniaxial static stretch (amplitudes of 0, 20, 40, and 80 % strain), as well as cyclic mechanical loading (amplitudes of ± 10 % and ± 20 % superimposed on 40 % static stretch, and frequencies of 0. 1 and 1 Hz). We also used confocal and electron microscopy to determine and quantify changes in ECM structure. In particular, we observed qualitatively the effect of mechanical loading on enzyme activity through the increased destruction seen in our confocal and electron images. We also analyzed the changes in equivalent diameter and distortion index measurements of the alveolar structures through analysis of the confocal images. The decline in stiffness during digestion positively correlated with the increase in equivalent diameters and negatively correlated with the distortion index. These results suggest that the decline in stiffness results from collagen rupture within and of the alveolar wall, and changes in shape of the airspaces subsequent to local tissue failure. In general, from these studies, we found that mechanical forces accelerated collagen digestion and lead to increased destruction of ECM structure of the alveoli. This research may provide new understanding of the role of collagen degradation in general tissue remodeling and disease progression...|$|R

The period of latence from the second hormonally injection to the {{artificial propagation}} (after ovulation) was 15. 5 +- 1. 2 h (resp. 324 +- 25 h°) with Ovopel, with CPE 16. 4 +- 1. 0 h (so 341 +- 22 h°) and with Dagin 16. 5 +- 0. 4 h (so 345 +- 7. 6 h°). The statistically important difference (= 0. 05) was observed only in period of latence between groups of fish injected by Ovopel and Dagin. The highest propagation of stripped eggs in incubation bottles was observed by using extract of Ovopel (80. 9 +- 14. 9 %), then by using CPE (75. 0 +- 17. 1 %) and Dagin (74. 8 +- 9. 6 %). By comparing cumulate parameter,which is given by number of fertilized eggs in one kilo after hormonally injection and after 24 hours of incubation in incubation bottles (including all followed aspects: % of stripped eggs, the relative labour fertility of stripped eggs and number of fertilized eggs), were observed synthetic preparations GnRHa like more effective than CPE, which contains natural carp gonadotropin. The highest values of this parameter were found out in Ovopel groups (78000 pcs×kg- 1) and Dagin groups (77000 pcs×kg- 1). The lowest value was observed in CPE group (66000 pcs×kg- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{layer of}} oxide scale is inevitably formed {{on the strip}} surface due to the high {{temperature}} of the hot strip rolling process. Experimental result indicates that the oxide scale surface is rough {{no matter what the}} original state of the steel surface is. The oxide scale layer and its surface roughness {{play an important role in}} the hot strip rolling process. They may affect the friction and heat transfer and consequently affect the rolling force, torque and energy consumption of the rolling process. Surface roughness is also an important <b>index</b> of rolled <b>strip</b> quality. Hot rolling process and many involved factors have been studied by many researchers. Many models were developed to describe hot strip rolling process and various phenomena in the process. But a model that actually describes the geometrical profile of the rough surface has not been reported. A model that includes oxide scale layer and its surface roughness can better describe the rolling process so that the transformation of the surface roughness can be better understood. The goal of this research is to establish such a model and obtain the required information of the surface roughness transformation and scale layer deformation. In this thesis, a mathematical model is presented to describe the profile of the surface asperity. The algorithms to generate 3 D rough surface or 2 D rough surface section through the model are also presented. The model can generate random surface roughness and yet the profiles generated are still relatively simple for the convenience of further FEM analysis. The comparison of generated and scanned surface profiles shows that the model can generate a rough surface that fits very well the actual rough surface of the oxide scale of the strip. A circular roll model and a flat roll model, which include the oxide scale layer and profiles of the rough surface, have been developed to simulate the hot strip rolling process. With these models, deformation of the oxide scale layer and the transformation of the surface roughness in the rolling process can be calculated. Other important rolling parameters such as pressure distribution and real area of contact ratio can also be obtained through such models. Comparing the parameters obtained through simulation with those from the experiments, the models developed are effective in calculating these parameters. A developed thermo-mechanical coupling FEM analysis has also been implemented with such models. Many factors may affect the deformation of oxide scale layer and the surface roughness transformation in the hot strip rolling process. The effects of these factors such as Flow stress of oxide scale and steel materials Initial roughness Reduction Work roll surface roughness Scale layer thickness Lubrication Voids inside the scale layer Coefficients of friction on the interfaces of tool-scale and scale-steel Wavelength of the asperity on the scale layer deformation and the surface roughness transformation have been evaluated through the developed models. Simulation results compare closely to the experimental results, which are obtained from the experiments in Gleeble 3000 and experimental rolling mill Hille 100, in scale surface roughness change and other parameters for the hot strip rolling process. The oxide scale layer may crack before or inside the roll bite. The development of the pre-existed openings in the oxide scale layer is simulated. The effect of the ratio of the initial opening width over scale layer thickness, frictional coefficient on the tool-scale and scale-steel interfaces, profile roughness of the interfaces and the lubrication on the propagation of the crack in the rolling process is explored. A model of the crack generation from a weak position in the oxide scale layer has also been developed and the final crack width is in agreement with experimental results. After careful calculation and comparing with the experimental results, a series of conclusions is drawn and further work for the research in this area is recommended...|$|R
