25|$|When Northrop's Flying Wing bomber {{program was}} canceled, all {{remaining}} N-9M flight test aircraft, {{except for the}} final N-9MB, were scrapped. For more than three decades, it slowly deteriorated until the Chino, California Planes of Fame Air Museum acquired the aircraft in 1982 and began the labor-intensive restoration process. For the next two decades, former Northrop employees and other skilled volunteers slowly returned the N-9MB to its final <b>flight</b> <b>configuration.</b> Since 1993, the yellow-and-blue Flying Wing has been exhibited, with flight demonstrations at several airshows every year.|$|E
25|$|The N-1M {{proved to}} be {{basically}} sound, {{paving the way for}} Northrop's later and much larger Northrop YB-35 and YB-49 aircraft. The pioneering aircraft was then donated to the United States Army Air Forces in 1945 and was placed in the storage collection of the National Air Museum the following year. It sat there for nearly three decades, but was finally brought back to static, non-flying status, in its final <b>flight</b> <b>configuration,</b> after several years of painstaking restoration during the 1980s. The N-1M is now on public display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.|$|E

500|$|An {{experimental}} re-creation {{was conducted}} {{using the same}} aircraft hijacked by Cooper in the same <b>flight</b> <b>configuration,</b> piloted by Scott. FBI agents, pushing a [...] sled out of the open airstair, were able to reproduce the upward motion of the tail section described by the flight crew at 8:13pm. Based on this experiment, {{it was concluded that}} 8:13pm was the most likely jump time. At that moment the aircraft was flying through a heavy rainstorm over the Lewis River in southwestern Washington.|$|E
500|$|During {{refueling}} Cooper outlined {{his flight}} {{plan to the}} cockpit crew: a southeast course toward Mexico City at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraftapproximately at a maximum [...] altitude. He further specified that the landing gear remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the wing flaps be lowered 15degrees, and the cabin remain unpressurized. Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately [...] under the specified <b>flight</b> <b>configuration,</b> which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada, as the refueling stop. Finally, Cooper directed that the plane take off with the rear exit door open and its staircase extended. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, {{but he would not}} argue the point; he would lower it himself once they were airborne.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} aerodynamic {{calculations of}} the model-scale ERICA tiltrotor with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics. The {{aim of this}} work is to assess the capability of the present CFD method in predicting airloads on the tiltrotor at different <b>flight</b> <b>configurations.</b> In this regard, three representative <b>flight</b> <b>configurations</b> of the ERICA were selected, corresponding to aeroplane, transi- tion corridor, and helicopter modes, covering most modes of tiltrotor flight. The rotor blades were fully resolved {{and the use of}} a uniform and non-uniform actuator disk was also put forward to quantify the effect of the rotor on the fuselage loads. A fundamental investigation of the effect of the aerodynamic interference between the rotor and wing of the tiltwing aircraft is also shown. The employed CFD method was able to capture the aerodynamics of the different configurations and the overall agree- ment obtained with the experimental data demonstrates the capability of the present CFD method in accurately predict tiltrotor flows...|$|R

This work {{examines}} the Cooperative Hunters problem, where {{a swarm of}} unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) is used for searching after one or more “evading targets”, which are moving in a predefined area while trying to avoid a detection by the swarm.

Each rocket thruster, called a Mars Lander Engine (MLE), produces [...] of thrust and were derived from those used on the Viking landers. A radar altimeter measured altitude and velocity, feeding data to the rover's flight computer.

2500|$|Fifty {{seconds after}} take-off, it {{flew into the}} ground in <b>flight</b> <b>configuration</b> at a speed of {{approximately}} [...] [...] The four engines, which were the first parts of the aircraft to touch the ground, created four gouges in the soil {{before the rest of}} the aircraft also hit the ground and broke up. [...] Two fires immediately broke out when fuel in the wings ignited. [...] Although the crash site was only [...] {{from the end of the}} runway, emergency services took 40 minutes to reach the scene because of rugged terrain. [...] Nine passengers who were seated in the forward section of the fuselage initially survived, but two died soon after the accident, and another two a few days later, leaving a final death toll of 123 passengers and crew.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a {{re-entry}} vehicle strongly depends on the entry strategy of the projected mission. From the aerodynamic point of view, the layout of a hypersonic vehicle is a compromise between a vehicle being blunt enough to reduce the aerodynamic heating and sharp enough to obtain acceptable aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency. The selected <b>flight</b> <b>configurations</b> in this paper are wingless lifting bodies. Two different types of lifting bodies are compared: a sharp and a blunt body. The chosen blunt bicone {{is one of the}} ReFEx geometries, which was designed in the frame of the DLR vehicle concept study of ReFEx (Reusability Flight Experiment). The sharp configuration is one of the DLR SHEFEX (SHarp Edge <b>Flight</b> EXperiment) <b>configurations,</b> which is a facetted body with sharp leading edge. The focus of the present study is the discussion of advantages and drawbacks of both concepts with respect to structure and aerodynamics...|$|R

Axial Reynolds numbers {{on the order of}} 400, 000 are realized in the test facility by using a Dupont freon fluid called Halon (CBrF 3). The kinematic viscosity of Halon is of the same order as the liquid hydrogen used in the HPFTP.

50|$|By using tethers {{there is}} no {{rigidity}} between ship elements and engines. Without active acceleration or thrust to pull and straighten the tethers the slightest imbalance, excess force, or the moving of the ship elements into different <b>flight</b> <b>configurations</b> pose a danger for collisions between ship elements and engines. As long term space flight at interstellar velocities causes erosion due to collision with particles, gas, dust and micrometeorites the tethers are literally lifelines. Changing course or turning the ship requires re-positioning or aligning every ship element and presumably consumes more fuel in doing so.|$|R
