40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} optical conductivity of graphene with magnetic and nonmagnetic adatoms. First, by introducing alternating potential in a pure graphene, we demonstrate a gap formation in the density of states and the corresponding optical conductivity. We highlight the distinction between such a gap formation and the so-called Pauli blocking effect. Next, we apply this idea to graphene with adatoms by introducing magnetic interactions between the carrier spins and the spins of the adatoms. Exploring various possible ground-state spin configurations of the adatoms, we find that antiferromagnetic configuration yields the lowest total electronic energy, {{and is the only}} configuration that <b>forms</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap.</b> Furthermore, we analyze four different circumstances leading to similar gaplike structures and propose a means to interpret the magneticity and the possible orderings of the adatoms on graphene solely from the optical conductivity data.

40|$|Connexin {{channels}} mediate electrical coupling, intercellular molecular signaling and extracellular {{release of}} signaling molecules. Connexin proteins assemble intracellularly as hexamers to form plasma membrane hemichannels. The docking of two hemichannels in apposed cells <b>forms</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> junction channel that allows direct electrical and selective cytoplasmic communication between adjacent cells. Hemichannels and junctional channels are gated by voltage, but extracellular Ca 2 + also gates unpaired plasma membrane hemichannels. Unlike other ion channels, connexin channels {{do not contain}} discrete voltage- or Ca 2 +–sensing modules linked to a separate pore-forming module. All studies to date indicate that voltage and Ca 2 + sensing are predominantly mediated by motifs that lie within or {{are exposed to the}} pore lumen. The sensors appear to be integral components of the gates, imposing an obligatory structural linkage between sensing and gating not commonly present in other ion channels, in which the sensors are semi-independent domains distinct from the pore. Because of this, the structural and electrostatic features that define connexin channel gating also define pore permeability properties, and vice versa; analysis/mutagenesis of gating and of permeability properties are linked. This offers unique challenges and opportunities for elucidating mechanisms of ligand and voltage-driven gating...|$|E
40|$|A giant planet {{embedded}} in a protoplanetary disk <b>forms</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap.</b> An analytic relationship among the gap depth, planet mass M_p, disk aspect ratio h_p, and viscosity α has been found recently, and the gap depth can be written {{in terms of a}} single parameter K= (M_p/M_∗) ^ 2 h_p^- 5 α^- 1. We discuss how observed gap features can be used to constrain the disk and/or planet parameters based on the analytic formula for the gap depth. The constraint on the disk aspect ratio is critical in determining the planet mass so the combination of the observations of the temperature and the image can provide a constraint on the planet mass. We apply the formula for the gap depth to observations of HL Tau and HD 169142. In the case of HL Tau, we propose that a planet with ≳ 0. 3 is responsible for the observed gap at 30 AU from the central star based on the estimate that the gap depth is ≲ 1 / 3. In the case of HD 169142, the planet mass that causes the gap structure recently found by VLA is ≳ 0. 4 M_J. We also argue that the spiral structure, if observed, can be used to estimate the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio and the planet mass.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the possibility, form and key {{features of a}} jurisprudence or theory of law based on the philosophy of Theodor W. Adorno. The theory of law I propose draws on Adorno's critique of the thoroughgoing abstraction of contemporary society, which considers existence {{only in terms of}} universal concepts. I contend that the field of law provides a paradigmatic example of the operation of identity-thinking. In making this argument I draw on the jurisprudential theories of Ronald Dworkin, Roberto Mangabeira Unger and Alan Norrie in particular. I also draw on the work of J. M. Bernstein in proposing an brand of normative ethics based on Adorno's philosophy. I argue that the space between law's abstract itemisation of situations and subjects over which it passes judgment and the full, non-identical particularity of those situations and subjects <b>forms</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> between the operation of law and the possibility of justice. By training its gaze to the gap itself and maintaining a self-reflective attitude towards its own distorting effects, I argue that an "Adornian" jurisprudence can more successfully avoid doing "violence" to the world it seeks to adjudicate. In particular, this jurisprudence would need to negotiate the space between the law's current reliance on universal ethical principles and a more substantial engagement with the situation presented for judgment, so as to ask how such a situation might give rise to its own, particular ethical response...|$|E
40|$|We find a strong-to-weak {{coupling}} cross-over in D 2 1 SU N lattice gauge {{theories that}} appears to become a third-order phase transition at N ∞, {{in a similar way}} to the Gross-Witten transition in the D 1 1 SU N ∞ lattice gauge theory. There is, in addition, a peak in the specific heat at approximately the same coupling that increases with N, which is connected to ZN monopoles (instantons), reminiscent of the first order bulk transition that occurs in D 3 1 for N 5. Our calculations are not precise enough to determine whether this peak is due to a second-order phase transition at N ∞ or to a third-order phase transition with different critical behaviour to that of the Gross-Witten transition. We investigate whether the trace of the Wilson loop has a non-analyticity in the coupling at some critical area, but find no evidence for this. However we do find that, just as one can prove occurs in D 1 1, the eigenvalue density of a Wilson loop <b>forms</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> at N ∞ at a critical value of its trace. We show that this gap formation is in fact a corollary of a remarkable similarity between the eigenvalue spectra of Wilson loops in D 1 1 and D 2 1 (and indeed D 3 1) : for the same value of the trace, the eigenvalue spectra are nearly identical. This holds for finite as well as infinite N; irrespective of the Wilson loop size in lattice units; and for Polyakov as well as Wilson loops...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{gravitational}} scattering of planetesimals {{by a massive}} protoplanetary embryo is explored theoretically. We propose a method to describe {{the evolution of the}} disk surface density, eccentricity, and inclination caused by the embryo-planetesimal interaction. It relies on the analytical treatment of the scattering in two extreme regimes of the planetesimal epicyclic velocities: shear-dominated (dynamically ``cold'') and dispersion-dominated (dynamically ``hot''). In the former, planetesimal scattering can be treated as a deterministic process. In the latter, scattering is mostly weak because of the large relative velocities of interacting bodies. This allows one to use the Fokker-Planck approximation and the two-body approximation to explore the disk evolution. We compare the results obtained by this method with the outcomes of the direct numerical integrations of planetesimal orbits and they agree quite well. In the intermediate velocity regime an approximate treatment of the disk evolution is proposed based on interpolation between the two extreme regimes. We also calculate the rate of embryo's mass growth in an inhomogeneous planetesimal disk and demonstrate that it is in agreement with both the simulations and earlier calculations. Finally we discuss the question of the direction of the embryo-planetesimal interaction in the dispersion-dominated regime and demonstrate that it is repulsive. This means that the embryo always <b>forms</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> in the disk around it, which is in contrast with the results of other authors. The machinery developed here will be applied to realistic protoplanetary systems in future papers. Comment: 40 pages, 9 figures, submitted to A...|$|E
