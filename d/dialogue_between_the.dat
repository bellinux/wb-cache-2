5|$|The finale is in sonata form. It {{features}} significant {{developments of}} a simple motif, and considerable <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> four parts. The finale also contains {{a high degree of}} chromaticism, a feature that links the four movements of the work. The musicologist W. Dean Sutcliffe points to the recurrence of C at key points in each movement, serving at different times to create dissonance, to commence modulation (music) away from the tonic, or, {{as in the case of}} the finale, as a device for inflection.|$|E

5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of the}} Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. The player has a chance to assume the role of four protagonists, two in each Ef: The First Tale and Ef: The Latter Tale. Each protagonist is paired with a heroine, and each scenario in the original PC versions of the visual novels includes scenes with sexual content. These scenes are removed or modified in the PlayStation 2 port.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E

5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E
