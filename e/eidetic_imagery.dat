50|$|Older {{studies have}} {{claimed to have}} {{observed}} a variety of drawbacks {{among those who have}} an apparent eidetic memory. <b>Eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> can be so vivid as to mimic actual perception of stimuli, which can be much like a hallucination.

5000|$|... "Eidetikers", {{as those}} who possess this ability are called, report a vivid afterimage that lingers in the visual field with their eyes {{appearing}} to scan across the image as it is described. Contrary to ordinary mental <b>imagery,</b> <b>eidetic</b> images are externally projected, experienced as [...] "out there" [...] {{rather than in the}} mind. Vividness and stability of the image begins to fade within minutes after the removal of the visual stimulus.

50|$|An eidetic {{image is}} a type of vivid mental image, not {{necessarily}} derived from an actual external event or memory. It was identified {{in the early twentieth century}} as a distinct phenomenon by psychologists including E.R. Jaensch, Heinrich Klüver, Gordon Allport and Frederic Bartlett. Later, Akhter Ahsen located <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> in a structuralist context, and explored its therapeutic applications: psychotherapists sometimes encourage their clients to create and explore eidetic images as a way of coming to terms with past life events. <b>Eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> has also been studied in relation to the creative arts.|$|E
5000|$|Eidetic {{memory is}} {{typically}} only found in young children, {{as it is}} virtually nonexistent in adults. Hudmon stated, [...] "Children possess far more capacity for <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> than adults, suggesting that a developmental change (such as acquiring language skills) may disrupt the potential for eidetic imagery." [...] Eidetic memory {{has been found in}} 2 to 10 percent of children aged 6 to 12. It has been hypothesized that language acquisition and verbal skills allow older children to think more abstractly and thus rely less on visual memory systems. Extensive research has failed to demonstrate consistent correlations between the presence of <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> and any cognitive, intellectual, neurological or emotional measure.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond therapeutics, {{interest}} in <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> has developed within sociology, literary criticism and the creative arts. The scientist Ivan Pavlov, from whose work behaviorism developed, {{wrote in his}} book Conditioned Reflexes and Psychiatry that there are “two categories of people — artists and thinkers. Between them, there is a marked difference. The artists … comprehend reality as a whole, as continuity, a complete living reality, without divisions, without any separations. The other group, the thinkers, pull it apart, kill it. … This difference is especially prominent in the so-called <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> of children. … Such a whole creation of reality cannot be completely attained by a thinker.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The American {{cognitive}} scientist Marvin Minsky, in {{his book}} The Society of Mind (1988), considered reports of photographic memory to be an [...] "unfounded myth."

50|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> {{is low in}} adults and shows greatest frequency in early child development. In fact, it is almost non-existent {{past the age of}} 7. When procedures are used to classify eidetic memory separate from the characteristic of afterimage and memory image, a small number of children are classified as true eidetikers. These children are still suggestible; their eyewitness testimonies may still have error.|$|E

50|$|The {{lunate sulcus}} lies further back of human brains {{but has a}} more frontal {{location}} in chimpanzees.

Furthermore, this reorganization must have been implemented during early maturity and is likely responsible for <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> in some adolescents.|$|E
5000|$|Allport {{also argued}} that neither the after-image nor the memory image is favored as the {{possible}} middle point in the perception model when he said, “Some {{have said that the}} key to the solution {{is to be found in}} a better understanding of the nature and is of the Al.

5000|$|The terms eidetic {{memory and}} {{photographic}} memory {{are commonly used}} interchangeably, {{but they are also}} distinguished.

However, eidetic memory is not limited to visual aspects of memory and includes auditory memories as well as various sensory aspects across a range of stimuli associated with a visual image." [...] Author Andrew Hudmon commented: [...] "Examples of people with a photographic-like memory are rare. <b>Eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> is the ability to remember an image in so much detail, clarity, and accuracy that it is as though the image were still being perceived. It is not perfect, as it is subject to distortions and additions (like episodic memory), and vocalization interferes with the memory." ...|$|E

5000|$|Individuals who {{are said}} to possess eidetic {{memories}} are thought to hold to an image in mind for longer and with more accuracy than the average individual. But evidence for eidetic memory is limited, {{and there is no}} evidence for photographic memory or a memory being an exact replica of an event. The memories of those who claim to have superior eidetic memories are just as flawed as the memories of individuals who have normal mnemonic abilities; people who claim to have photographic memories are not immune to flawed eyewitness testimony. Witnesses who believe that they are able to retrieve an accurate mental photograph will also be much more confident in their account of the event and may influence the trial outcome. [...] Accuracy recall of such visual scenes is a controversial issue. In the past, eidetikers were believed to have extremely accurate recall for visual displays, but modern research findings might reveal a different story. Some research demonstrates that eidetic children have greater recall accuracy for visual details compared to non-eidetic children. Other researchers have failed to find any advantage between the two groups. It is also hypothesized that <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> is not exactly related to memory and improves recall for visual details. As such, photographic memory is not useful in the courtroom.|$|E

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1971. Bibliography: leaves [139]- 144. x, 144 l illus., tablesThe {{purposes}} of this study were (1) to investigate the incidence of visual <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> among Chinese school children, and (2) to test Travers' (1970) assumption, which stated that <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> might be due to a retarded development of erasure mechanism. A sample of 519 subjects were randomly drawn from a population of 130, 000 school children of Grades 3 to 6 in Taipei City. A method similar to that used by Haber and Haber (1964) was adopted to screen the eidetic children from this sample. Results indicated that if the "Strict Criteria," the same criteria used by the Habers, were used, 3. 3 % of the 519 subjects were identified as eidetic children. By the "Less Strict Criteria," the percentage was 5. 8 %. The former percentage (3. 3 %) was significantly smaller than that found in the Habers' study (8 %). Both these studies, however, revealed that <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> is not a widely prevalent phenomenon. Travers' assumption was tested in four experiments. The rationale upon which these experiments were based was that because of a retarded erasure mechanism, images from antecedent stimuli continue to persist for a relatively long time and accumulate, overlap, or superimpose with the images, or even the percepts, of succeeding stimuli. Thirty eidetic children selected by the "Less Strict Criteria" and 30 non-eidetic children were used as subjects. Results of these experiments can be stated as follows: (1) The mean reaction time to the offset of the visual stimulus for the eidetic children was significantly longer than that for the non-eidetic children. (2) In a task requiring the subjects to search out the absence of target stimuli, the mean search time was not significantly different for the groups established by the "Less Strict Criteria," but eidetic subjects selected by the "Strict Criteria" required significantly more time in this task than their counterparts. (3) The eidetic children demonstrated a persisting visual image in several ways. They reported a compound picture when two slide pictures were presented in sequence. They correctly identified figures that were "hidden" in sequentially presented dot-patterns. Also, they reported a stereoscopic effect when the left and right-eye views were presented to the left and right eyes without the advantage of a stereoscope. Further, they reported the perception of an expanding spiral after viewing a rotating-contracting spiral while the stationary spiral had in fact been removed. (4) In EEG tests, the post-stimulation recovery time of the eidetic children was significantly longer than that for the non-eidetic children. The post-stimulation alpha index for the eidetic children was significantly smaller than that for the non-eidetic children. While deductions based upon Travers' assumption were generally confirmed, there were several results that indicated that the construct of a deficient erasure mechanism was not sufficient to account for the phenomena associated with <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery.</b> The limitations of Travers' assumption were discussed and a new model for the phenomena of <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> tentatively proposed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the eidetic image {{as it relates}} to the {{rethinking}} and imaging of architectural and urban planning concerns. An eidetic image is produced through drawing, painting, modeling, mapping, and/or computer animation from which artists, designers and architects may conduct research into complex spatiality that challenges the passive Cartesian mode of picturing prevalent in both architecture and painting conventions. The term eidetic generally refers to mental imagery, “which are revived versions of [...] impressions called up by the imagination in the absence of the objects that originally stimulated them [...] . ” (Mitchell, Iconology 10). Which is not to say that all <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> must be recalled from memory. Within the context of this paper, an eidetic image is a visual model constructed by an artist, or designer. In his essay, “Eidetic Operations and New Landscapes” landscape architect James Corner calls on researchers to use this imaging methodology as a means of stimulating discourse, creative invention, and actualizing emergent realities. In his seminal work, “The Image of the City” Kevin Lynch categorizes the contents of the imageable city into five types of architectural components: paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks (46). A summary of what those components are and how they function within the urban-landscape will be provided. In addition to Lynch’s five categories, I address the phenomena of pictorial architecture. Pictorial architecture refers to the ubiquitous application of two-dimensional graphic imagery onto three-dimensional architectural structures in the form of retail signage, large-format television screens, and billboards. The thesis of my proposal is that, an artist, designer or architect may use the operational language of Lynch’s five architectural components, and pictorial architecture, within <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery,</b> as a means of describing the contemporary urban-landscape. To elaborate how architectural components may be deployed in <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> I will review the works of contemporary artists such as Zaha Hadid, Benjamin Edwards, and Julie Mehretu who specifically deal with the urban-landscape. In addition, I have constructed my own eidetic image, Dream City: Vancouver (2008) and will describe my methodological approach towards urban exploration and image building. In relation to the exploration of cities, the works of The Situationist International and Franz Ackermann will also be discussed. Personal, noncommercial use of this item is permitted...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—High {{functioning}} autistic {{people can}} exhibit excep-tional skills with numbers, <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> and recall of concrete detail, as brought to popular {{attention in the}} film Rain Man. However, it now transpires that these skills are to some extent latent within all of us. We {{do not have access}} under normal circumstances to this concrete detail, because it is dynamically inhibited by higher level concepts. Brain stimulation using Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation or Direct Current Stimulation, which blocks this inhibition, releases savant-like skills in non-savants. This paper proposes {{that one of the reasons}} for this lies in the brain’s need to conserve energy. Computer simulations using a spiking neural network support this hypothesis. A spiking neural network was set up with a number of feature detectors feeding an output unit, which in turn generates inhibition of the input neurons. This reduces the spike activity of the input, and thus overall energy usage. We introduce a theoretical analysis for the gains, which might be made. Thus, we demonstrate that energy conservation is a possible cause of inhibition of sensory detail by high level concepts. Keywords—energy, spiking neuron, inhibition, simulation, sen-sory detail.

40|$|Musical {{imagery is}} defined as the {{conscious}} 'inner hearing' of a mental representation of music. In spite of the apparent importance of imagery for musical activity, there is a dearth of empirical knowledge on the subject, due in part to its essentially private and internal nature. Psychological methods of examining the phenomenon are necessarily restricted to indirect research techniques. This thesis explores the intuition that musical imagery is central to musical thought, through an exploration of its occurrence and its character in a variety of musical activities. Three categories of musical imagery are described. First, musical imagery can occur unintentionally - the phenomenon often called 'tune on the brain'. Second, musical imagery may be an involuntary consequence of musical activity. Finally, imagery may be intentional, as in the ‘silent' analysis of musical score. The studies reported progress from unintentional to intentional imagery, combining a variety of methods in increasingly specialised musical contexts to investigate the relationship between imagery and perception. The subject is approached through theoretical discussion, a sampling study, experiments, fieldwork, and interviews with expert musicians. It is argued that musical imagery and perception are separable but mutually dependent cognitive phenomena. The results highlight a shifting relationship between perception and imagery depending upon the contextual factors of image intentionality and musical task. Evidence is provided for the prevalence of 'tune on the brain' episodes in everyday life. The veridicality of imagery for different musical dimensions is also explored, with the experiment finding that tirnbre is a less stable component of musical imagery than timing and pitch. Musical imagery is described as situated between the subconscious influence of mental representations during the pure perception of music, and the rare occurrence of <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of behaviour necessitates {{a clear and}} concise approach in order to comprehend its functioning. An example of such an approach is highlighted by the field of cybernetics. Cybernetic models have been used extensively throughout the various fields of Psychology but perhaps never more so {{as in the case}} of short term memory (STM). This particular field abounds with behavioural models and research workers are constantly developing new models or testing the unviversality of existing models. Universal validity is essential to the strength of the behavioural principles inherent in any model but unfortunately such validity tends to be neglected. The present study attempts to reconcile this position with reference to specific models of STM, with relation to the phenomena of <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> (EI). Certain studies concerning the incidence of EI in illiterate Africans have produced results which are contradictory to those obtained in the Western culture. Two of the most important contradictions concern the fact that the illiterate Africans experienced the absence of an age parameter on the occurrence of such imagery and the fact that the incidence of imagery was more extensive in the African culture. A reason for these contradictions was sought and it was reasoned that as eidetic images have been closely linked with memory images, it may, therefore, be assumed that these particular cultures may use EI as an aid to memory in the absence of written material. Further, it would not be unreasonable to assume that this visual imagery may tend to dominate the STM process and thereby challenge the universality of those memory models that proposed acoustic domination of this process. No work has been done in investigating the memory process of the Africans. Thus, a study which did so would not only test the universality of specific memory models but would also possibly throw more light on the memory process itself. In this particular study there were three specific aims; (a) to ascertain the relative incidence of EI on a cross-cultural level, (b) to assess the influence of EI on the memory process, and (c) to ascertain the extent to which principles of STM developed in the West applied to the African groups. The groups concerned in the study comprised two Xhosa groups and a European group. The European group (WS) was drawn from a White Student population at Rhodes University and was regarded as a control group. The equivalent literate Xhosa group (BS) was drawn from a Black Student population at the University of Fort Hare. The illiterate Xhosa group (RX) was drawn from a population of Red Xhosa people in the Transkei. Four tasks were administered to the groups with the cross-cultural variable carefully controlled as much as possible. The following comprised the four tasks; (a) <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> (b) auditory serial recall (c) visual serial recall and (d) an acoustic confusable task. Each subject commenced with the <b>eidetic</b> <b>imagery</b> task and was then confronted with a random presentation of the other three tasks. The EI task began with an after image task which was foIlowed by three selected pictures which comprised the EI task. After each picture presentation the subject was closely questioned as to the presence of imagery. Scoring was of a subjective nature. The visual and acoustic confusion tasks constituted serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. Each item was presented for 0, 75 seconds with a negligible inter-item interval. The presentation order of the items was randomized throughout the trials. Presentation was by means of a preprogrammed 16 mm colour film. Items were scored for correct serial position. The auditory task consisted of the serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. The items were once again randomized throughout the trials with regards to presentation order. The presentation speed was one word per second. The presentation was by means of a pre-programmed tape. Items were scored for correct serial position. The visual task was common to both language groups whilst the other two tasks correIated with the language group. Thus, the items in the auditory and acoustic confusion tasks were different for each language but an attempt was made to control this variable. The tasks were conducted in the subjects home languagc which was either Xhosa or English. It was assumed that the RX group would demonstrate a greater incidence of EI, irrespective of the age of the subject, and that imagery would be reflected in the recall performance of the memory tasks. It was suggested that imagery may determine or encourage the mode of storage that the subject cmployed, which, in this case, would be the visual modality. If so then it would be expected that visual storage would circumvent the detrimental influence of acoustic confusability. The Xhosa university group (BS) was an unknown quantity but was included to ascertain whether there were any marked differences between the group and the other two. The results revealed that imagery was in fact more prevalent in the Xhosa groups whilst the WS group demonstrated a complete lack of EI but did report the presence of pictorial imagery (PI). However, imagery did not appear to function as an aid to memory. It seemed, however, that in certain instances it correlated with visual encoding. Generally the Xhosa subjects, especially with regards to the visual tasks, tended to encode visually whilst the WS group encoded auditorily. With reference to recall performance, it was found that in all instances the WS group demonstrated superior recall followed by the BS and RX groups in that order. There was a significant difference in the strength of recall between each of the groups. The results of the auditory and visual tasks were interpreted within the STM principles developed in the West. It was found that the WS group adhered to these principles thereby justifying its position as a central group. The BS group followed a similar pattern with exception to the recency effect which was much weaker in their case. The RX group reported the absence of any storage and rehearsal strategies and this was reflected in their poor recall performance. They too were characterized by a very weak recency effect. The interesting point arose, however, when the auditory and visual recency effects were compared. According to Crawder and Norton (1969) the influence or the precategorical acoustic store (PAS) on recall should be reflected by a comparatively stronger auditory recency effect. This trend was observed in relation to the WS group but not to the Xhosa groups who tended to demonstrate a stronger visual recency effect. It was therefore, suspected that PAS did not operate with the same effectiveness with the Xhosa subjects. In fact it was suggested that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the visual peripheral store may be stronger than PAS. Contrary to expectation all three groups exhibited acoustic confusion. This was expected of the WS group as the subjects preferred auditory storage, but not of the Xhosa subjects who preferred visual storage. It was suggested however, that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the visual storage technique would have to be abandoned immediately prior to or during recall as recall was necessarily in the auditory modality. The outcome of the experiment generally confirmed Doab's conclusions as to the incidence of imagery and its relation with memory. However, due to the Xhosa preference for visual storage and their stronger visual recency effect, Sperling's model was slightly modified. Conrad 's findings were, of course, substantiated.
