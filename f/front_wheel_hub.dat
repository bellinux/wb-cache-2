2500|$|The first really {{popular and}} commercially {{successful}} design was French. An example {{is at the}} Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa. Initially developed around 1863, it sparked a fashionable craze briefly during 1868-70. Its design was simpler than the Macmillan bicycle; it used rotary cranks and pedals mounted to the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> Pedaling {{made it easier for}} riders to propel the machine at speed, but the rotational speed limitation of this design created stability and comfort concerns which would lead to the large front wheel of the [...] "penny farthing". It was difficult to pedal the wheel that was used for steering. The use of metal frames reduced the weight and provided sleeker, more elegant designs, and also allowed mass-production. [...] Different braking mechanisms were used depending on the manufacturer. In England, the velocipede earned the name of [...] "bone-shaker" [...] because of its rigid frame and iron-banded wheels that resulted in a [...] "bone-shaking experience for riders." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{front wheel}} drive vehicles, the drive shafts {{transfer}} the drive directly from the differential to the front wheels. A short inner stub shaft is splined to the differential side gear and an outer stub shaft is splined to the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> Each stub shaft has a yoke, or housing, to accommodate a universal joint, {{at each end of}} a connecting intermediate shaft.|$|E

5000|$|The Egger-Lohner was a carriage-like car {{driven by}} two {{electric}} motors within the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> powered by batteries. This drive train construction was easily expanded to four-wheel drive, by mounting two more electric motors {{to the rear}} wheels, and a four-motor example was ordered by Englishman E. W. Hart in 1900. In December that year, the car was displayed at the Paris World Exhibition under the name Toujours-Contente. Even though this one-off vehicle had been commissioned {{for the purposes of}} racing and record-breaking, its 1,800 kg of lead-acid batteries was a severe shortcoming [...] Though it [...] "showed wonderful speed when it was allowed to sprint", the weight of the batteries rendered it slow to climb hills. It also suffered from limited range due to limited battery life.|$|R

50|$|The Tidalforce Electric Bicycle was an {{electric}} bicycle manufactured by Wavecrest Labs from 2003 until {{the company went}} out of business in 2006. All models of Wavecrest Tidalforce electric bikes have a 36 volt electric hub motor built into the rear wheel hub and a 36 volt battery pack built into the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> Wavecrest Labs manufactured three models of Tidalforce bikes: The Wavecrest Tidalforce M-750, the S-750 Traditional hard tail mountain bike and the iO-750 Cruiser. Any of the three bikes with an X suffix denotes that the motor is a 1000 watt motor without a set speed restriction as compared to the speed limited 750 watt version.|$|E

5000|$|In older cars, the {{trunnion}} {{is part of}} the suspension and either allows free movement of the rear wheel hub in relation to the chassis or allows the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> to rotate with the steering. On many cars (such as those made by the Triumph) {{the trunnion}} is machined from a brass or bronze casting and is prone to failure if not greased properly. American Motors recommended lubrication of its pre-packed front suspension trunnions using a sodium base grease every 32000 mi or three years. It later incorporated molded rubber [...] "Clevebloc" [...] bushings on the upper trunnion to seal out dirt and retain silicone lubricant {{for the life of the}} car.|$|E
50|$|The current Autobike uses {{three main}} {{components}} in its automatic transmission. In order to provide the system with power, the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> uses a <b>hub</b> dynamo to generate electricity. Wires connect the dynamo through the frame to the bottom bracket area where it joins a small onboard computer with sensors that detect the rider's speed and cadence. The computer uses this information to actuate a motorised shifter mounted on the rear <b>wheel's</b> <b>hub</b> gear to change the gear ratio. The rear hub used is the Nuvinci N360 CVP which is a continuously variable transmission using a planetary gear system that can be shifted smoothly at any time, under any load.|$|R

50|$|The bikes {{adopted by}} the ToBike {{services}} are low-profile women model citybikes. The livery is inspired by the symbol-colours of the city: a yellow paint coats the entire main frame, while blue large stickers applied on it carry the name and the logo of the ToBike service.The equipment includes a 7-speed chain transmission, front and rear lights powered by a dynamo installed on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> and, a metallic basket on the handlebar and a bell. On {{the left side of}} the junction between the handlebar and the rest of the structure is located the cylindrical locking joint that contains the identifying RFID chip and allows to lock it to the terminal.The wheels are made of aluminum alloy on which reinforced tires are mounted.|$|E
5000|$|All models {{may have}} the wheels on {{the corners of the}} rack {{replaced}} with larger eazy wheels, to aid pushing when folded and to give greater heel clearance than the stock rollers. All models can choose to have no lights, lighting powered from battery, or two variants of <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> dynamo. Seat posts can be swapped between standard length, extended or telescopic for tall riders (titanium and, later, aluminium equivalents previously fitted to the lightweight models are no longer available). Bicycles are offered in four colours at no additional charge: Black, White, Orange and Cobalt Blue. [...] Other colours, raw lacquer, and titanium are available at extra cost. Titanium areas are left unpainted, in their natural titanium colour. The standard Brompton saddle can be substituted by a Brooks B17 Special leather saddle ladies' or men's versions. Non-titanium models have braze-on fittings for holding the supplied Zefal HP compact high-pressure bicycle pump.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1860s the first true bicycle {{was created in}} Paris, France, by {{attaching}} rotary cranks and pedals to the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> of a dandy-horse. The Olivier brothers recognized the commercial potential of this invention, {{and set up a}} partnership with blacksmith and bicycle maker Pierre Michaux, using Michaux's name, already famous among enthusiasts of the new sport, for the company. They began the first mass-production of bicycles (still called [...] "velocipedes") in 1868, as the first real bicycle craze had begun the year before, reaching full force all over Europe and America in 1868 and 1869. But exactly as with the dandy-horse, pedestrians complained about them, and the craze again faded quickly. Another factor in their demise was the extremely uncomfortable ride, because of the stiff wrought-iron frame and wooden wheels surrounded by tires made of iron — this led to the pejorative name [...] "boneshaker", which is still used today to refer to this type of bicycle.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, NTK Precision Axle Corporation began {{business}} with its sole facility in Frankfort, IN. The subsidiary manufactures <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> assemblies for four <b>wheel</b> drive and <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> drive vehicles {{as well as}} axles for constant velocity joints.|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> motor was raced by Ferdinand Porsche in 1897 in Vienna, Austria. Porsche's first engineering {{training was}} electrical, not internal combustion based. As a result, he developed his first cars as electric cars with electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> motors that ran on batteries. The Lohner Porsche, fitted with one wheel motor {{in each of}} the <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> appeared at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900 and created a sensation in the young automobile world. In the following years, 300 Lohner Porsches were made and sold to wealthy buyers.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{bicycles}} {{have adopted}} standard axle spacing: the <b>hubs</b> of <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> are generally 100 mm wide fork spacing, road wheels with freehubs generally have a 130 mm wide rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> Mountain bikes {{have adopted a}} 135 mm rear hub width, which allows clearance to mount a brake disc on the hub or to decrease the wheel dish for a more durable wheel. Freeride and downhill are available with 150 mm spacing.|$|R

5000|$|RTV trials {{usually take}} place on farmland, a quarry site or at a {{dedicated}} off-road driving center, and are usually organized by a dedicated trialing body (such as the All Wheel Drive Club or The Association of Land Rover clubs in the UK), or by a vehicle owner's club. The course consists of 10 to 12 [...] "gates" [...] marked by two garden canes, vertically placed. The gates are just wide {{enough to get a}} standard vehicle through. One vehicle attempts the course at a time, and is deemed to have cleared a gate if {{at least one of the}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> passes between the canes. The vehicle's attempt ends when it comes to a stop (depending on the exact level of skill the trial is aimed at, any stopping may end the attempt, or a few seconds may be allowed). Long-wheelbase vehicles are usually allowed to perform a three-point turn if needed, providing the driver declares where the turn is going to be made before they attempt the course (this puts a strong emphasis on ground-reading ability).This can also be called a [...] "shunt" [...] where the driver has to attempt a gate and then shout shunt. they are then allowed a space of 1 and a half car lengths to reverse and line the car better to enter through the gate ...|$|E
50|$|In {{production}} {{the complete}} power unit was {{carried on a}} special front fork, with the 104 cc two-stroke engine on the left with its main-shaft run through the wheel spindle to a flywheel. Ignition was by chain-driven Runbaken magneto bolted upside-down to the crankcase base, and transmission was by chain up to a counter-shaft carrying a clutch {{and then back to}} the wheel by a second chain. The firm offered a package of wheel, engine unit and front fork or the choice of complete ladies’ or gents’ machines. The complete Cykelaid could be purchased for £50. The specification included an Eadie coaster brake, rear hand-operated brake, number plate, rear stand and Brooks saddle. The wheels were 28″×1.75″, shod with Dunlop Roadster tyres. Alternatively, the complete front fork assembly was available for £32, as a conversion of an existing bicycle. The early versions were not fitted with a front brake and, as mentioned above, the complete machine was fitted with two independent rear brakes. Presumably, when buying the front fork unit to convert an existing bicycle, one was also expected to fit an additional rear brake to the machine. Although the engine was lubricated by the petroil mixture, an additional oil tank was fitted. An oil pump driven by the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> delivered a measured supply of oil to the engine’s main bearings. It would, therefore, be inadvisable to allow the engine to run for a long period with the clutch disengaged, since this would cut off the supply of oil to the crankshaft. None of the available options proved to be very popular with the buying public.|$|E
50|$|Locking hubs, {{also known}} as free <b>wheeling</b> <b>hubs</b> are fitted to some (mainly older) four-wheel drive vehicles, {{allowing}} the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to rotate freely when disconnected (unlocked) from the front axle. This is done to reduce the mechanical resistance of the front-portion of the drivetrain when four-wheel drive is not in use. The hub, along with the wheel, is designed to engage (lock) onto the axle, to be powered by the drivetrain in four-wheel drive; or the hub can disengage (unlock) from the axle when four-wheel drive is not needed, thus allowing the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to rotate freely within the hub. The hub is a component where the wheel is directly mounted to, and is outside the axle.|$|R

50|$|At the German Grand Prix, Mikkola {{injured his}} ribs during {{practice}} {{and missed the}} race, allowing Maico rider, Adolf Weil to finally break the monopoly with a win in the first race at his home Grand Prix while De Coster finished in fourth place. A malfunctioning front brake caused De Coster to crash in the second race while his Suzuki teammate, Gerrit Wolsink took the win. Three weeks later at the British Grand Prix, Mikkola was back in action however, a bent brake pedal in a first turn crash forced {{him out of the}} race. De Coster was leading the race when his rear suspension broke and led to his retirement, allowing Yamaha rider Jaak van Velthoven to claim the victory. De Coster came back to win the second race while Mikkola once again was involved in a first turn crash with Weil putting him in last place. In a display of determination, Mikkola fought his way through the pack and into third place after 10 laps. The series then crossed the Atlantic for the United States Grand Prix with Mikkola holding a 25-point lead in the standings. De Coster had suffered mechanical breakdowns while leading five races. In the first moto, Wolsink held the lead before allowing his teammate De Coster to pass him and collect maximum championship points three laps from the finish. Mikkola rode the last four laps with a flat tire to salvage a fourth-place finish. De Coster was hindered by a damaged <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> in the second race while his teammate Wolsink barely held off a charging Mikkola to win the race by a one-foot margin and deny Mikkola valuable championship points. An exhausted Wolsink collapsed from his bike immediately after crossing the finish line.Back in Europe for the Dutch Grand Prix, Mikkola and De Coster traded moto wins in the exhausting deep, sand track at Markelo. Going into the final two events of the season, Mikkola held a 10-point lead meaning that De Coster would have to win three of the last four motos to secure his fourth consecutive 500cc world championship. The setting of the Belgian Grand Prix was a rugged, narrow track in the forests surrounding the picturesque hilltop Citadel of Namur. Wolsink took the lead {{at the start of the}} first race while Mikkola and De Coster battled their way to the front of the pack. When Wolsink's engine seized, the two series points leaders once again found themselves first and second with Mikkola holding on to the lead to the end of the race. Now De Coster had to win the final three races to win the championship. Wolsink once again grabbed the early lead in the second race but, soon crashed allowing De Coster into the lead with Mikkola in second place. De Coster continued to widen his lead to win the second moto to extend the championship points battle to the final race of the season in Luxembourg. In the first race, De Coster worked his way through the pack to take the lead before his Suzuki suffered an engine problem forcing him out of the race. Mikkola took over the lead and won the race to clinch his first world championship.|$|E

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the <b>wheel's</b> <b>hub,</b> faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|R

As we know that do a FEA (finite element analysis) is necessary {{before and after the}} alloy <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> have been made. In this paper, a detail analysis was done with FEM (finite element method), and the stress distribution of <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> we got was consistent with the real distribution. Also the FEA results show that the maximum stress is much less the yield stress and the working safety factor is less than the allowed safety factor and it is useful for further work such as fatigue life prediction and reliability assessment...|$|R
