50|$|The Region is {{characterized}} by two seasons. The cool season which runs from November to April, and the warm season which begins in May and is often more or less dry. And the rare and low rainfall and <b>endemic</b> <b>drought</b> make this area one of the driest places in our country. The {{effects of climate change}} are also being felt. Sometimes it's hot and dry and sooner or later than usual. Sometimes it makes cool and wet longer or shorter, later or earlier than expected.|$|E
40|$|Wallace’s Line or its {{variants}} {{divide the}} Malay Archipelago or Malesia into a western and eastern area, {{but is this}} suitable for plant distributions? Indeed, all boundaries satisfactorily divide Malesia into two parts, stopping far more species east or west of a line than disperse over the boundary. However, phenetic analyses (principal components analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) of 7340 species distributions revealed a stronger partitioning of Malesia into three instead of two regions: the western Sunda Shelf minus Java (Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo), central Wallacea (Philippines, Sulawesi, Lesser Sunda Islands, Moluccas, with Java), and the eastern Sahul Shelf (New Guinea). Java always appears {{to be part of}} Wallacea, probably because of its mainly dry monsoon climate. The three phytogeographic areas equal the present climatic division of Malesia. An everwet climate exists on the Sunda and Sahul Shelves, whereas most of Wallacea has a yearly dry monsoon. During glacial maxima, the Sunda and Sahul Shelves became land areas connected with Asia and Australia, respectively, whereas sea barriers remained within Wallacea. Consequently, the flora of the two shelves is more homogeneous than the Wallacean flora. Wallacea is a distinct area because it comprises many <b>endemic,</b> <b>drought</b> tolerant floristic elements. © 2011 The Linnean Society o...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} sector, {{particularly the}} rice farming system (SUT) is very vulnerable to climate variability and change. SUT that {{rely heavily on}} water will be easily affected by climate variability and change when the water supply deficit of needs that should be. SUT is still dominant in the food supply in Indonesia, so the shock of farming due to extreme climate events will {{have a major impact}} on food security. Many findings indicate that the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events will increase as a result of global warming. Extreme climate events dominant occur in center of rice production in West Java like Indramayu is drought. Approximately 80 % of the causes of the rice harvest failed in the district of Indramayu is the incidence of droughts. Farmers as the main actors receive large impacts due to drought is expected to be increasingly difficult to develop the farm. It is therefore necessary to have protection program for farmers from the impact of climate events such climate extrim. One option is starting a lot of feasibility is Climate Index Insurance. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of the implementation of the climate index insurance system in Indramayu. Analysis step is performed include (i) preparation of <b>endemic</b> <b>drought</b> maps are required as the basis in determining the priority areas of climate risk management and (ii) the determination of climate index value (threshold value) to be used as an index into the determination of the value of insurance claims. This study found that climate indices that can be used for the three villages at high risk of drought is high rainfall during the dry season. Index value for the three villages is 168 mm, 248 mm and 472 mm for Cikedung, Lelea and Terisi. Potential applications of Climate Index Insurance for rice SUT in Indramayu is high because about 90 % of the people are rice farmers. Besides benefit of rice farming is also quite large with B/C from 1. 4 to 1. 8 during the wet season and 1. 2 to 1. 7 on the dry season, so the expected ability to pay insurance premiums high enoug...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{relative}} importance of groundwater in coastal dune systems, the number of studies concerning the responsiveness of vegetation to ground water (GW) variability, in particularly in Mediterranean regions, is scarce. In this study, we established 5 study sites within a meso-mediterranean sand dune Pinus pinaster forest on the Atlantic coast of Portugal, taking advantage of natural topographic variability and artificial GW exploitation, which resulted in substantial variability in depth to GW between microsites. Here we identify the degree of usage and dependence on GW of different plant functional groups (two deep-rooted trees, a drought adapted shrub, a phreatophyte and a non-native woody invader) and how GW dependence varied seasonally and between the heterogeneous microsites. Our results indicated that the plant species had differential responses to changes in GW depth according to specific functional traits (i. e. rooting depth, leaf morphology, and water use strategy). The species comparison revealed that variability in pre-dawn water potential (&Psi;pre) and bulk leaf &delta; 13 C was related to microsite differences in GW use in deep-rooted (Pinus pinaster, Myrica faya) and phreatophyte (Salix repens) species. However, such variation was more evident during spring rather than during summer drought. The exotic invader, Acacia longifolia, which does not possess a very deep root system, presented the largest seasonal variability in &Psi;pre and bulk leaf &delta; 13 C. In contrast, the response of Corema album, an <b>endemic</b> understorey <b>drought</b> adapted shrub, across seasons and microsites seemed to be independent of water availability. Thus, the susceptibility to changing GW availability in sand dune plant species is variable, being particularly relevant for deep rooted species and phreatophytes, which have typically been less exposed to GW fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Agro-pastoral {{livelihoods}} in semi-arid Botswana {{have evolved}} and adapted to recurrent <b>droughts</b> <b>endemic</b> to the region. Droughts, {{more than any}} other phenomena, have shaped and influenced rural communities' interaction with their environment on which they eke a living. The physical aspect of droughts and their effects are well known, but the often subtle and complex dynamics emanating from drought outbreaks are less understood among communities. A study was conducted during the 2009 / 2010 season to investigate how communities in Kgalagadi North and Bobonong Sub-districts perceive droughts, anticipate droughts and which sections of the respective communities were most vulnerable to drought shocks. An extensive agro-ecological knowledge base, in form of environmental indicators, was used by communities to predict imminent droughts. Preparations included storing excess crop harvests during good years, storing crop residues for livestock, buying commercial feed to supplement livestock and seeking alternative sources of income outside the agricultural sector. In spite of these efforts, drought still affected the communities negatively mainly through increased livestock mortalities and crop failure-especially among poorer households. Subsequently, it is recommended that any effective aid interventions ought to understand and appreciate these dynamics to enhance resilience to future droughts and ensure sustainable rural development...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{degradation}} of fragile drylands affects 25 per {{cent of the}} earth’s land area and threatens the livelihoods of 900 million people in one hundred countries. Desertification affects one-sixth of the world’s population. 800 million people live without adequate food resources in these drylands. 2 The problem is particularly <b>endemic</b> in India. <b>Droughts</b> {{have been a major}} impediment in India’s development, a country heavily dependant on monsoon rains to annually replenish its water sources. A poor monsoon caused draught like situations in 77. 6 per cent of India’s geographical area at least once or twice in every five years. Forcing people to sell their livestock and leave their homes, droughts cause large-scale misery {{in the lives of the}} poor and the marginalised. Combating the effects of drought often precipitates into larger crisis, as drought relief operations struggle to provide wage employment, drinking water, food, fodder and often wage employment to those affected. The drought in 1999 – 2000 affected around 100 million people and 3. 4 million cattle. 3 A drought is not just a natural calamity; it is also the result of a process of systematic neglect of the drylands and its inhabitants, their knowledge systems and their livelihood needs. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, Martha Crenshaw’s edited volume Terrorism in Africa {{made clear}} how {{terrorism}} – generally {{defined as a}} tactic that uses violence or {{the threat of violence}} as a coercive strategy to cause fear and political intimidation – was a feature within resistance movements, military coups, political assassinations, and various intra- and inter-state wars that have affected most African states {{at some point during the}} continent’s transition to independence and subsequent post-colonial period.   Crenshaw further noted that terrorism was not “an isolated phenomenon” for African states or the region more broadly [1]. This description remains salient today: terrorism has been a global phenomenon for many decades, and Africa has not been unscathed by it. Terrorism is just one of several types of political violence that states and their citizens, in Africa and elsewhere, have had to grapple with. In fact, from a macro perspective, terrorism may not be universally seen as the most important security challenge faced by African states and their citizens. Famine, <b>drought,</b> <b>endemic</b> poverty, diseases and other natural and man-made disasters that undermine human security have also been at the forefront of recent policy discussions on Africa among Western governments and international aid organizations. It is thus necessary to place terrorism within the broader terrain of Africa’s security challenges, before examining the historical trends and specific examples discussed in this Special Issue of Perspectives on Terrorism. </p...|$|R
