5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} <b>grayscale,</b> in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E
5|$|As in Myst, the {{topology}} of {{the islands}} was originally created as <b>grayscale</b> images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend's first self-developed game. The game idea came from staring at the ceiling, and Wohlwend applied a <b>grayscale</b> color palette from {{his first year in}} art school. When Flash game sites did not purchase the title, he open sourced the code. Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad, which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company's Adam Saltsman, who became the primary puzzle designer.|$|E

5|$|Notably, {{the comic}} strip stories' {{holographic}} characters, predominately Rimmer, were drawn in <b>grayscale.</b> This was {{at the request of}} Grant and Naylor, who had wanted to use the technique for the television series, but the process was deemed too expensive to produce. Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month, the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications. A farewell issue was published, cover dated January 1994, and featured the remaining interviews, features, and comic strips that were to feature in the following issues.|$|E
5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel <b>grayscale</b> display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E

F. & G. Witherby. It was published in the United States the following year by D. Appleton & Company. The book was reprinted in 1972 by Dover Publications, Inc., with the only change being the <b>grayscale</b> reproduction of several illustrations originally published in color.|$|E

5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early <b>grayscale</b> concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E

These transient dynamic optical responses manifest when the phase of a homogeneous cell is nearby Np or ðN 12 Þp, where N is an integer.

25|$|In {{their most}} common configurations, {{electron}} microscopes produce images {{with a single}} brightness value per pixel, with the results usually rendered in <b>grayscale.</b> However, often these images are then colorized {{through the use of}} feature-detection software, or simply by hand-editing using a graphics editor. This may be done to clarify structure or for aesthetic effect and generally does not add new information about the specimen.|$|E
25|$|Color images {{typically}} {{consist of}} a composite of three separate <b>grayscale</b> images, one to represent {{each of the three}} primary colors—red, green, and blue, or RGB for short. Other colorspaces using 3-vectors for colors include HSV, CIELAB, XYZ, etc. Some colorspaces such as cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) may represent color by four dimensions. All of these are treated as vector-valued functions over a two-dimensional sampled domain.|$|E
25|$|Currently, web-integrated crystal {{structure}} visualization {{is based on}} Java applets from open-source projects such as Jmol. Web-integrated {{crystal structure}} visualization is tailored for examining crystal structures in web browsers, often supporting wide color spectra (up to 32 bit) and window size adaptation. However, web-generated crystal structure images are not always suitable for publishing due to issues such as resolution depth, color choice, <b>grayscale</b> contrast, or labeling (positioning, font type, font size).|$|E

Additionally, all public and online entertainment was suspended, and major newspapers and internet sites were <b>grayscaled.</b> At the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, all activities were canceled.

30|$|Road {{images have}} high gray level due to light changes. The {{contrast}} between the road marking line and pavement is seriously low, and sometimes white pavement appears {{at the end of}} the road [5]. In order to reduce the interference of light changes, the work used histogram equalization enhancement to reconstruct gray level transformation. The contrast was increased by stretching the area of <b>grayscales</b> in the original image, which makes the details of the image clear and highlights depth information of the road image.|$|R
40|$|Video {{panoramic}} image stitching {{is extremely}} time-consuming among other challenges. We present a new algorithm: (i) Improved, self-adaptive selection of Harris corners. The successful stitching {{relies heavily on}} the accuracy of corner selection. We fragment each image into numerous regions and select corners within each region according to the normalized variance of region <b>grayscales.</b> Such a selection is self-adaptive and guarantees that corners are distributed proportional to region texture information. The possible clustering of corners is also avoided. (ii) Multiple-constraint corner matching. The traditional Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is inefficient, especially when handling {{a large number of}} images with similar features. We filter out many inappropriate corners according to their position information, and then generate candidate matching pairs based on <b>grayscales</b> of adjacent regions around corners. Finally we apply multiple constraints on every two pairs to remove incorrectly matched pairs. By a significantly reduced number of iterations needed in RANSAC, the stitching can be performed in a much more efficient manner. Experiments demonstrate that (i) our corner matching is four times faster than normalized cross-correlation function (NCC) rough match in RANSAC and (ii) generated panoramas feature a smooth transition in overlapping image areas and satisfy real-time human visual requirements...|$|R
