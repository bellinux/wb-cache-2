40|$|Abstract. A low-clay {{translucent}} whiteware {{has been}} formulated and the {{studies have been}} carried out to establish the necessary conditions required for different whiteware manufacturing processes, such as slip casting. The aim of the present work is to identify the conditions for the preparation of stable low-clay whiteware slips with high solids content for the production of slip-cast objects with improved properties, as well as to establish a relationship between the slip properties and the final object properties. The slips containing 88 wt % nonplastic prefired materials and 12 wt % clay mixtures were prepared and the effects of type and amount of various commercial deflocculants and solids content on the casting behaviour were investigated. It was found that for each deflocculant there exists an optimum concentration range within which low viscosity is achieved for a slip of high solids content. It was determined that the addition of 0. 1 % Dolaflux SP NEU commercial deflocculant was enough to reduce the viscosity at a level required for successful casting. Casting trials showed that the combination of high slip solids content and slower casting rate results in objects with higher densities both in the green and <b>fired</b> <b>state.</b> For instance, the casting time of 8 minutes was enough to produce approximately 5 mm wall thickness at 47. 5 vol. % solids content...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect water ratio in relation to dry mass has on the mechanical properties of refractory materials. A number of different refractory materials ranging from lightweight to dense grade were investigated for the following properties: - permanent dimensional change; - bulk density; - cold compressive strength; and - cold modulus of rupture. Water is an essential component when preparing refractory materials however with increased water ratio adverse mechanical properties developed. Each of the materials tested suffered an increase in permanent dimensional change {{as a result of}} increased water ratio between the dried and the <b>fired</b> <b>state.</b> The degree of shrinkage associated with the increase in water ratio was more significant in the dense materials. Each material tested exhibited a reduction in fired bulk density associated with an increase in water ratio. This reduction was relatively consistent across all materials tested. An increase in water ratio was associated with a reduction in each material's ability to withstand a compressive force. The cold compressive test results tended to display a more significant reduction in compressive strength for the denser materials. All materials exhibited a greater than expected flexural strength when prepared in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations. As additional water was used the cold modulus of rupture results of all materials reduced indicating that increased water ratio decreases a refractory materials ability to withstand a bending force...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, the {{permittivity}} of porous LTCC (low temperature co-fired ceramics) DP 951 {{is measured}} and evaluated. The dielectric constant is locally lowered {{to improve the}} performance of e. g. radar sensors operated in the GHz range. Porousification is done at originally dense LTCC substrates in the <b>fired</b> <b>state</b> by a wet chemical etching procedure using hot phosphoric acid. Choosing this approach, areas with tailored permittivity can be generated in one single LTCC layer. The etch time and the bath temperature precisely control the penetration and hence, the porosification depth. Therefore, the decrease in dielectric constant of the LTCC substrate can be correlated to {{the thickness of the}} porous layer. The dielectric constant is measured using a ring resonator in microstrip configuration. From the resonances occurring in the transmission S-parameter |S 21 | spectrum between 1 to 10 GHz, the relative dielectric constant can be determined. Using 820  μm thick substrates a relatively low reduction from ϵr= 7. 8 to 6. 45 is achieved when a porosification depth of about 35  μm is reached. Based on numerical simulations, the effective dielectric constant for a 100  μm thick glass-ceramic layer which is porousified to a depth of 35  μm is calculated to 5. 2, whereas the thickness represents a lower limit for tapes being typically implemented into the fabrication process of monolithic LTCC systems with integrated metallization planes. This value is lower compared to those of commercially available low-k LTCC tape systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{study the}} {{influence}} of spatially correlated noise on the tran-sient dynamics of a recurrent network with Mexican-Hat type connectivity. We derive the closed form of the order parameter functional in the thermo-dynamical limit of neuron number N. Our analysis shows that the network dynamics is qualitatively changed {{by the presence of}} common noise. Network dynamics driven by the common noise obtains the global level of fluctua-tion, which is not observed in a network driven by independent noise only. 2 Kosuke Hamaguchi et al. We show that the optimal level of global fluctuation enhances the transition from non-localized <b>firing</b> <b>states</b> to spatially localized <b>firing</b> <b>states,</b> and also enhances the rotation speed of localized activity. ...|$|R
