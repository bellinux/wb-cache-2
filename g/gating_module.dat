40|$|BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency (RF) {{catheter}} ablation {{guided by}} electroanatomic mapping systems {{is an effective}} therapy for atrial fibrillation. However, it may be affected by respiration movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the impact of respiratory gating on procedural parameters in patients undergoing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred forty consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation were admitted to study. Respiratory <b>gating</b> <b>module</b> (AccuResp algorithm, Carto 3, Biosense Webster) was enabled in 70 patients and disabled in 70 patients during procedures. Successful pulmonary vein isolation and sinus rhythm were obtained in all patients. A significant reduction in total procedure times [median 77, interquartile range (IQR 66 - 95) min vs median 82 (IQR 72 - 104) min, p < 0. 05] and fluoroscopy times [median 14 (IQR 9 - 17) min vs median 16 (IQR 12 - 22) min, p < 0. 05] were observed in the respiratory gated group. Although ablation times (duration between the first and last ablation) were significantly shorter in respiratory gated group [median 37 (IQR 32 - 53) min vs median 48 (IQR 39 - 65) min, p < 0. 05], total RF application durations were not different between two groups [median 1, 554 (IQR 1, 213 - 2, 196) s vs median 1, 802 (IQR 1, 344 - 2, 448) s, p = 0. 11]. Difference in electroanatomical map reconstruction times was not significant [median 14 (IQR 12 - 16) min in gated group vs median 13 (IQR 10 - 18) min in nongated group, p = 0. 19]. CONCLUSION: Respiratory gating significantly improves fluoroscopy and ablation times during electroanatomic mapping guided AF ablation. Respiratory gated maps may provide uninterrupted continuous ablation applications. Furthermore, using automatic respiratory <b>gating</b> <b>module</b> does not prolong mapping times...|$|E
40|$|Objects {{may appear}} at {{arbitrary}} scales in perspective {{images of a}} scene, posing a challenge for recognition systems that process images at a fixed resolution. We propose a depth-aware <b>gating</b> <b>module</b> that adaptively selects the pooling field size in a convolutional network architecture according to the object scale (inversely proportional to the depth) so that small details are preserved for distant objects while larger receptive fields are used for those nearby. The depth gating signal is provided by stereo disparity or estimated directly from monocular input. We integrate this depth-aware gating into a recurrent convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation. Our recurrent module iteratively refines the segmentation results, leveraging the depth and semantic predictions from the previous iterations. Through extensive experiments on four popular large-scale RGB-D datasets, we demonstrate this approach achieves competitive semantic segmentation performance with a model which is substantially more compact. We carry out extensive analysis of this architecture including variants that operate on monocular RGB but use depth as side-information during training, unsupervised gating as a generic attentional mechanism, and multi-resolution gating. We find that gated pooling for joint semantic segmentation and depth yields state-of-the-art results for quantitative monocular depth estimation...|$|E
40|$|Ion {{channels}} are transmembrane proteins {{that control the}} movement of ions across the cell membrane. They are the molecular machines that make neurons excitable by enabling the initiation and propagation of action potentials. Rapid signaling within and between neurons requires complex molecular processes that couple the sensing of membrane voltage or neurotransmitter release to the fast opening and closing of the ion channel gate. Dysfunction of an ion channel’s sensing or <b>gating</b> <b>module</b> can have disastrous pathological consequences. However, linking molecular changes to the modulation of neural circuits and ultimately to a physiological or pathological state is not a straightforward task. It requires precise and sophisticated methods of controlling the function of ion channels in their native environment. To address this issue we have developed new photochemical tools that enable the remote control of neuronal ion channels with light. Due to its optical nature, our approach permits the manipulation {{of the nervous system}} with high spatial, temporal and molecular precision that will help us understand the link between ion channel function and physiology. In addition, this strategy may also be used in the clinic for the direct treatment of some neuronal disorders...|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{coupled with}} functional {{analyses of the}} major yeast phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein Sec 14 p identify structural elements involved in regulating the ability of Sec 14 p to execute phospholipid exchange. The molecular dynamics simulations suggest large rigid body motions within the Sec 14 p molecule accompany closing and opening of an A 10 /T 4 /A 11 helical gate, and that “state-of-closure” of this helical gate determines access to the Sec 14 p phospholipid binding cavity. The data also project that conformational dynamics of the helical gate are controlled by a hinge unit (residues F 212, Y 213, K 239, I 240, and I 242) that links to the N- and C-terminal ends of the helical gate, and by a novel <b>gating</b> <b>module</b> (composed of the B 1 LB 2 and A 12 LT 5 substructures) through which conformational information is transduced to the hinge. The 114 TDKDGR 119 motif of B 1 LB 2 {{plays an important role}} in that transduction process. These simulations offer new mechanistic possibilities for an important half-reaction of the Sec 14 p phospholipid exchange cycle that occurs on membrane surfaces after Sec 14 p has ejected bound ligand, and is reloading with another phospholipid molecule.

Image reconstruction was performed using BrukerParaVision 5.1 software (BrukerBiospin, Ettlingen, Germany). To evaluate cardiac function, a high-resolution 2 D FLASH cine sequence was used to acquire a set of 9 contiguous 1  mm slices in short-axis orientation covering the entire heart. Imaging parameters were: echo time of 1.49  ms, repetition time of 5.16  ms, field of view (26  mm) 2 and a matrix size of 144  ×  192. To determine infarct size, contrast enhanced MRI imaging was performed after injection of a 150  µL bolus (0.5  mmol/mL) of gadolinium-DPTA (Gd-DPTA, Dotarem, Guerbet, The Netherlands) via the tail vein.

40|$|Two {{representative}} computational {{models for}} switching between internal {{models have been}} proposed (Imamizu et al., 2004), namely a mixture-of-experts model (Gomi and Kawato, 1993; Graybiel et al., 1994; Jordan and Jacobs, 1994), and a modular selection and identification for control model (MOSAIC) (Haruno et al., 2001; Doya et al., 2002; Wolpert et al., 2003). The behaviour in the mixture-of-experts model is determined by a <b>gating</b> <b>module</b> which selects between experts, while behaviour in the MOSAIC model combines recommendations from each expert. However, these two switching models alone seem unable to {{capture the essence of}} learned skills, learning behaviour and the occurrence of errors (cf. Diedrichsen et al., 2005; Thoroughman et al., 1999). In this poster, a novel hierarchical control architecture for switching internal models is proposed. The architecture, which is based on a combination of predictive and adaptive control, can account for the observed results on combined mixture-of-experts and MOSAIC control behaviour. Experimental trials on verbal fluency tasks are designed to tap the subjects switch costs (cf. Gurd et al., 2002). Subjects switch between producing verbal output from over-learned sequences, such as days of the week, months of the year, or letters of the alphabet (ie. Monday, January, A, Tuesday, February, B, etc [...] The added times the subjects take to switch between tasks, as well as the occurrence of errors, are measured. The results show that the deteriorating performance of the subjects (ie. as the number of categories are increased, or as the time into the task progresses), seems due to the inconsistency between predictive outputs in the internal models and actual outcomes on the performed tasks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to succinctly identify the critical {{problems inherent in}} deep submicron (DSM) designs.

40|$|In {{nerve and}} muscle cells, the {{voltage-gated}} {{opening and closing}} of cation-selective ion channels is accompanied by the translocation of 12 – 14 elementary charges across the membrane's electric field. Although most of these charges are carried by residues in the S 4 helix of the <b>gating</b> <b>module</b> of these channels, the precise nature of their physical movement is currently the topic of spirited debate. Broadly speaking, two classes of models have emerged: those that suggest that small-scale motions can account for the extensive charge displacement, and those that invoke a much larger physical movement. In the most recent incarnation of the latter type of model, {{which is based on}} structural and functional data from the archaebacterial K+ channel KvAP, a “voltage-sensor paddle” comprising a helix-turn-helix of S 3 –S 4 translocates ∼ 20 Å through the bilayer during the gating cycle (Jiang, Y., A. Lee, J. Chen, V. Ruta, M. Cadene, B. T. Chait, and R. MacKinnon. 2003. Nature. 423 : 33 – 41; Jiang, Y., V. Ruta, J. Chen, A. Lee, and R. MacKinnon. 2003. Nature. 423 : 42 – 48.; Ruta, V., J. Chen, and R. MacKinnon. 2005. Cell. 123 : 463 – 475). We used two methods to test for analogous motions in the Shaker K+ channel, each examining the aqueous exposure of residues near S 3. In the first, we employed a pore-blocking maleimide reagent (Blaustein, R. O., P. A. Cole, C. Williams, and C. Miller. 2000. Nat. Struct. Biol. 7 : 309 – 311) to probe for state-dependent changes in the chemical reactivity of substituted cysteines; in the second, we tested the state-dependent accessibility of a tethered biotin to external streptavidin (Qiu, X. Q., K. S. Jakes, A. Finkelstein, and S. L. Slatin. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269 : 7483 – 7488; Slatin, S. L., X. Q. Qiu, K. S. Jakes, and A. Finkelstein. 1994. Nature. 371 : 158 – 161). In both types of experiments, residues predicted to lie near the top of S 3 did not exhibit any change in aqueous exposure during the gating cycle.

Stiff gate materials, such as titanium nitride, lead to a decreased channel stress, while a replacement-gate scheme allows the increase of the effectiveness of the Si 1 -xGex and Si 1 -yCy S/D techniques significantly, independent of the gate material used. The drawback of using a replacement gate is that the channel stress becomes more sensitive to layout variations. In terms of effect on Si 1 -xGex/Si 1 -yCy S/D stress generation, using a thin metal gate capped by polysilicon is similar to a full metal gate if the thin metal gate thickness exceeds 10 nm. Even metal gates as thin as 1 nm have a clear influence on the stress generation by Si 1 -xGex/Si 1 -yCy, S/D. Removing and redepositing the polysilicon layer while leaving the underlying metal gate unchanged increases the stress, although not to the same extent as for complete gate removal.

By constructing the medical cloud data outsourcing system, the medical data administrator {{operates the}} key generation module to generate an index generation key λτ and an encryption key τ, and operation index establishment module creates the index; the patient can operate the trap <b>Gate</b> Generation <b>module,</b> then traps the gate setF_σ_d=f(λτ, σ_d), and sends it to the medical cloud server. The medical cloud server launches the search module to carry on the search in the index tree and returns the address set Aσand evidence set Proofset of the fuzzy keywords σ and validates them. This method not only supports fuzzy keyword search, but also can validate the search results.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a neural network capable of dynamically adapting its architecture to realize time variant non-linear input-output maps. This network {{has its roots}} in the mixture of experts framework but uses a localized model for the <b>gating</b> network. <b>Modules</b> or experts are grown or pruned depending on the complexity of the modeling problem. The structural adaptation procedure addresses the model selection problem and typically leads to much better parameter estimation. Batch mode learning equations are extended to obtain on-line update rules enabling the network to model time varying environments. Simulation results are presented throughout the paper to support the proposed techniques. Keywords: mixture of experts, network growing, pruning, model complexity, on-line learning, non-stationarity, localized gating, function approximation.

40|$|Recently, {{the best}} 65 nm Ge {{p-channel}} {{metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor}} (pMOSFET) performance has been reported with a standard Si complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor HfO 2 <b>gate</b> stack <b>module.</b> The Ge passivation {{is based on a}} thin, fully strained epitaxial Si layer grown on the Ge surface. We investigate in more detail how the device performance (hole mobility, I-on, D-it, V-t, etc. (depends on the characteristics of this Si layer. We found that surface segregation of Ge through the Si layer takes place during the growth, which turns out to be determining for the interfacial trap density and distribution in the finalized gate stack. Based on {{a better understanding of the}} fundamentals of the Si deposition process, we optimize the process by switching to another Si precursor and lowering the deposition temperature. This results in a 4 times lower D-it and improved device performance. (C) 2009 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10. 1149 / 1. 3240880]status: publishe...|$|R
