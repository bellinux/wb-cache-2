5000|$|Synthetic fibers {{are made}} from {{synthesized}} polymers of small molecules. The compounds {{that are used to}} make these fibers come from raw materials such as petroleum based chemicals or petrochemicals. These materials are polymerized into a long, linear chemical that bond two adjacent carbon atoms. Differing chemical compounds will be used to produce different types of synthetic fibers. Synthetic fibers account for about half of all fiber usage, with applications in every field of fiber and textile technology. Although many classes of fiber based on synthetic polymers have been evaluated as potentially valuable commercial products, four of them - nylon, polyester, acrylic and polyolefin - dominate the market. These four account for approximately 98 percent by volume of synthetic fiber production, with polyester alone accounting for around 60 per cent. There are several methods of manufacturing synthetic fibers but the most common is the Melt-Spinning Process. It involves heating the fiber until it begins to melt, then you must draw out the melt with tweezers as quickly as possible. The next step would be to draw the molecules by aligning them in a parallel arrangement. This brings the fibers closer together and allows them to crystallize and orient. Lastly, is <b>Heat-Setting.</b> This utilizes heat to permeate the shape/dimensions of the fabrics made from heat-sensitive fibers.|$|R

40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{ability of}} a charge-transfer (CT) complex prepared from a pyrene-based donor (Py-D) and a naphthalenediimide-based acceptor (NDI-A) {{led to the formation}} of a deep-violet in color, transparent hydrogel at room temperature (RT-gel). Simultaneously, the RT-gel was diluted beyond its critical gelator concentration (CGC) to obtain a transparent sol. Very interestingly, the resultant sol, on heating above 70 degrees C, transformed into a <b>heat-set</b> gel instantaneously with a hitherto unknown CGC value. Detailed studies revealed the smaller globular aggregates of the RT-gels fuse to form giant globules upon heating, which, in turn, resulted in <b>heat-set</b> gelation through further aggregation. The thermoresponsive property of Py-D alone and 1 : 1 Py-D : NDI-A CT complex was investigated in detail which revealed the hydrophobic collapse of the oxyethylene chains of the CT complex upon heating was mainly responsible for <b>heat-set</b> gelation. Thixotropy, injectability, as well as stimuli responsiveness of the RT-gels were also addressed. In contrast, <b>heat-set</b> gel did not show thixotropic behavior. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the xerogel depicted lamellar packing of the CT stacks in the gel phase. Single crystal XRD studies further evidenced the 1 : 1 mixed CT stack formation in the lamellae and also ruled out orthogonal hydrogen bonding possibilities among the hydrazide unit in the CT gel although such interaction was observed in a single crystal of NDI-A alone.

A preference over glass due to its low weight, similar transparency to glass and cost consideration, including the availability of recycled PET feedstock via kerbside collection has provided newer opportunities for hot-fill applications. Ostensibly, this material is used for beverage markets requiring cold and hot filling (85 oC) of liquid foods. However due to the poor thermal stability of PET - due to its low glass transition temperature - an increase in elevated temperatures limits the number of market segments the material can be utilised.

We investigated the rate and mechanism of breakdown of protein microbeads in a simulated gastric system, and studied the influence of microbead protein concentration, gelling method (cold-set, slow and fast <b>heat-set),</b> and further processing (freeze-drying), on the breakdown process. Breakdown rate decreased with increasing protein content of the beads, for the same method of production. Due to the porosity of the slowly-heated <b>heat-set</b> beads, breakdown occurred evenly throughout the entire bead. Cold-set microbeads of 10 % protein broke down slightly slower than the <b>heat-set</b> microbeads of 15 %. The denser surface of the 10 % beads slowed down the diffusion of the enzymes into the bead's interior, causing the beads to be broken down from the outside inward. All these beads broke down within one hour. Increasing the rate of temperature increase during the heating step dramatically slowed breakdown. There was no significant breakdown of rapidly heated beads within 138 minutes, even though no difference in microstructure between rapidly and slowly heated beads was visible with electron microscopy. Freeze-drying of the beads also slowed their breakdown. After 132 minutes more than half the measured particle volume of were intact beads.

40|$|Oscillatory shear rheometry (mechanical spectroscopy) {{has been}} used to study the <b>heat-set</b> {{gelation}} of beta-lactoglobulin at pH 2. Modulus-concentration relationships were obtained by extrapolating cure data to infinite time. In terms of theory, these fail to provide a clear distinction between the fractal description of biopolymer gels and the classical random f-functional polycondensation branching theory (cascade) approach, though the latter is preferred. Critical exponents for the sol-gel transition, derived from these data, are also discussed. Where gel time-concentration results are concerned the fractal model makes no predictions, and the cascade approach in its simplest form must be rejected in favor of a more sophisticated version involving delivery of fibrils by nucleation and growth into the random aggregation process. Over the limited concentration range accessed experimentally, cure data for the different beta-lactoglobulin solutions, reduced to the universal form G'/G'inf versus t/tgel, superimposed well for samples heated both at 80 and 75 degrees C and for different batches of protein. Studies of the frequency responses of the fully cured gels confirm the validity of the gel description given to these materials, and a study of the temperature dependence of the frequency spectrum suggests a fall in the elastic component of the modulus as temperature decreases. This contrasts with what has been found for other <b>heat-set</b> globular protein gels such as those from serum albumin where the gel modulus increases at lower temperatures. The present results are in good agreement with more limited amounts of pH 2 beta-lactoglobulin data published earlier, though some differences arise through a previous neglect of measurement "dead time"...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{claims a}} {{relationship}} between the film splitting sound emission from the printing press nip and the dynamic interaction occurring there between ink, fountain solution and substrate in offset lithography. The film splitting sound derives from the cavitation formed by the pressure drop {{in the second half of}} the print nip flow passage. As the ink film is strained, the cavities expand and eventually implode into breaking filaments at the nip exit, while emitting a partly audible, broadband, high frequency, noisy sound. A free-field microphone, A/D-converter and laptop computer were used to record pressure signals in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 50 kHz emitted by a variety of printing instruments and presses for a range of offset ink and paper types. After signal acquisition and filtering two signal averages of power and frequency were estimated. This average power increased with increasing loads of sheet-fed offset ink on an ink distributor, in accordance with a mass-conservation model developed. The behaviour of average frequency and power over different ink load ranges indicated transitions between different flow regimes. A glossy fine-coated paper gave higher average power than a corresponding matte paper during printing with such inks on a laboratory device, possibly due to an air sealing effect. The sound from tack measurements with the Deltack instrument during setting of <b>heat-set</b> offset inks printed on MWC papers showed a relation between the measured tack rise and average power, reflecting changes in splitting mechanism during the course of setting. With the Hydroscope instrument the interaction between these <b>heat-set</b> inks and fountain solution was studied, with the measured tack and sound emission displaying a clear, but non-linear, correlation. A <b>heat-set</b> offset pilot trial showed that the acoustic response from the printing nip sensitively and systematically detected changes in (LWC) paper type, optical density, ink-fount balance, and press stability. Pilot trials of cold-set offset inks on newsprint by sheet-fed presses indicated a strong correlation between evolution in average power, optical density and fountain solution consumption during the first thousand sheets normally needed for stabilisation. Acoustic measurements of ink film splitting have, aside from the laboratory studies performed by one Japanese group, previously received little attention, with the current study showing that a great deal of information useful to the printer can be accessed from this sound emission. Although the detailed mechanisms for ink film splitting have to be further studied and supported by mathematical simulation, the sensitivity of the acoustic method recommends its implementation for monitoring and control of offset printing.

In this work the effect of LBG on the <b>heat-set</b> gelation of aqueous whey protein hydrolysates (10 % w/w) from pepsin was assessed at pH 7. 0 by small deformation rheology. Whey protein concentrate (WPC) and hydrolysates with a degree of hydrolysis (DH) of 1. 5, 2. 5 and 4. 9 % were used. Different LBG concentrations were tested: 0, 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 55 % (w/w). The behaviour of gels from whey proteins or whey protein hydrolysates towards the presence of LBG was very similar. The evolution of the viscous and storage moduli followed the general behaviour reported for many biopolymer <b>heat-set</b> gelation processes including whey proteins gelation. The increase in the LBG concentration generally led to a decrease in the gel strength. However, for whey proteins a small amount of LBG (0. 1 %) leads to a big enhancement in the gel strength probably due to an increase in the protein concentration of the protein enriched phase. Further increases in the LBG concentration led to a decrease in the gel strength. The gelation process is very sensible to environmental conditions and to processing and often leads to rather coarse data. The factorial planning used allowed validating conclusions using fewer experiments than those needed if no planning had been used, while still getting statistical significance out of the results.

In contrast to what was found on heating aqueous solutions at pH 2 (Part 2 of this series), a more expected "chemical gelation"-like profile was found with modulus components G' and G' ' crossing over as the gels formed and then with G' ' passing through a maximum. In addition, for the EtOH system, there was a significant modulus increase at long time, suggestive of a more complex two-step aggregation scheme. Modulus-concentration relationships were obtained for both systems by extrapolating cure data to infinite time. For the TFE gels, this data was accurately described by classical branching theory, although it could also be approximated by a constant power [...] law relationship. Only the latter described the modulus [...] concentration data for the gels in ethanol, but there were problems here of greater frequency dependence of the modulus values and much less certain extrapolation. Gel times for the TFE systems showed higher power laws in the concentration than could be explained by the branching theory in its simplest form being similar, in this respect, to the <b>heat-set</b> systems at pH 2. Such power laws were harder to establish for the EtOH gels as for these there was evidence of gel time divergence close to a critical concentration. Reduced G'/G'inf versus t/tgel data were difficult to interpret for the gels in ethanol, but for the TFE system they were consistent with previous results for the <b>heat-set</b> gels and approximated master curve superposition.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The relatively low deformation temperature of biaxially oriented PET excludes its use in many hot fill applications or hot washing {{as part of a}} reuse cycle, due to the shrinkage which generally occurs on reheating towards Tg. Isothermal, isometric annealing processes (referred to as heat-setting) can cause oriented PET to maintain its dimensional stability to higher temperatures. However, to experiment on a commercial stretch blow moulding machine is a very costly and time consuming process, justifying the requirement for an accurate simulation technique. The objective of this project was, therefore, to simulate the stretch blow moulding of PET with a heat-setting phase, by biaxially drawing PET sheets on a TM Long Stretcher, then to <b>heat-set</b> them in a separate phase using a purpose designed jig. A heat-setting rig was designed and constructed at IPTME. Due {{to the size of the}} proposed investigation window, a factorial experimental design (FED) technique was employed to characterise the behaviour of two commercial bottle grades of PET (B 90 N and B 95 A Laser) under a variety of draws and heat-setting conditions. These sheets were then characterised in terms of shrinkage, tensile properties and resistance to creep. This data was regressed to generate predictive model equations for both grades of material and in both major and minor draw axes. Using these equations, it is now possible to define a set of processing parameters which would give a bottle with lower and more uniform shrinkage (less draw dependent) with enhanced creep properties and at least comparable mechanical properties. To develop a more fundamental understanding of the process of heat-setting in biaxially drawn PET, as well as to prove the validity of the model equations, a separate series of conventional experiments was devised to investigate the two most significant predictor variables from the FED analysis; biaxial draw ratio and heat-setting temperature (for Laser only). This material was characterised by TMA, DSC and birefringence measurements. The DSC and birefringence measurements allow the effect of heat-setting and draw on crystallinity levels and orientation to be monitored.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at [URL] {{of the factors that}} affect the rheological characteristics of fibril gels are discussed. Fibrils with nanoscale diameters from β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-la) have been used to create gels with different rheological characteristics. Values of the gelation time, tc, the critical gel concentration, c 0, and the equilibrium value of the storage modulus, G, such as G'inf at long gelation times, derived from experimental rheological data, are discussed. Fibrils created from β-lg using solvent-incubation and heating result in gels with different rheological properties, probably because of different microstructures and fibril densities. Partial hydrolysis of α-la with a serine proteinase from Bacillus licheniformis results in fibrils that are tubes about 20 nm in diameter. Such a fibril gel from a 10. 0 % w/v α-la solution has a higher modulus than a <b>heat-set</b> gel from a 10 % w/w β-lg, pH 2. 5 solution; it is suggested that one reason for the higher modulus might be the greater stiffness of α-la fibrils. However, the gelation times of α-la fibrils are longer than those of β-lg fibrils...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of paper {{is a difficult}} subject because paper is a unique material. It is very thin, flexible at bending, unstable in compression and stiff at tension. Dealing with paper we have to account for orthotropy and heterogeneities created during the manufacturing process. This thesis addresses two topics in {{mechanics of}} paper webs in printing press applications. First is the dynamic behaviour of the travelling webs. Second is so-called “fluting” after <b>heat-set</b> web-fed offset printing. There {{are a number of}} challenges in simulating the dynamics of the paper web. It is necessary to include the influence of the paper web transport velocity. Due to initial sag or vibrations, gyroscopic forces affect the dynamics of the webs. Furthermore, the transport velocity reduces the stress stiffening of the web. A good theoretical model should account for large displacements and should be capable of simulating wrinkles, which is essentially a post-buckling phenomenon. Finally, the paper web is surrounded with air which reduces the natural frequencies substantially by “adding" mass to the paper. A non-linear finite element formulation has been developed in this study for simulation of travelling webs. The results of the studies shows that for the tension magnitudes used in the printing industry the critical web speed lies far above those used today. Speed limitations are rather caused by ink setting and tension control problems. If the web tension profile is skew, however, edge vibrations are inevitable even at small external excitations. Fluting is a permanent wavy distortion of the paper web after <b>heat-set</b> web offset printing. It is often seen in high quality printing products, especially in areas covered with ink. It is generally accepted that tension and heat are required to create fluting. However, there have been certain disputes as to the mechanism of fluting formation, retention and key factors affecting this phenomenon. Most of the existing studies related to fluting are based on linear buckling theories. A finite element model, capable of simulating a post-buckling behaviour has been developed and experimentally verified. Studies show that none of the existing theories can consistently explain fluting. A new basic mechanism of fluting formation has been proposed and numerically demonstrated. Fluting was explained as a post-buckling phenomenon due to small scale moisture variations developing during through-air drying. It was concluded that air permeability variation is the key factor affecting fluting tendency. Fluting is retained due to inelastic deformations promoted by high drying temperatures.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the mesoscopic structure and rheological properties of <b>heat-set</b> -lactoglobulin gels at low pH and low ionic strength. We have determined the scaling of the elastic or storage modulus of the gel with protein concentration. Four batches with a pH of 2 and an ionic strength of 13 mM showed {{a wide range of}} scaling behavior. In two of the batches, two concentration regimes with distinctive exponents could be detected. We constructed the phase diagram for this system as a function of pH and ionic strength, and were able to show that the wide spread in scaling behavior between the batches is the result of differences in the mescopic structure of the gels. These differences in mesoscopic structure were the result of small variations in pH and ionic strength between the batches. Our experiments show that when characterizing gel properties of -lactoglobulin solutions at very acidic conditions and low ionic strength, extreme care has to be taken to stabilize the pH of these systems. Small variations in pH have a drastic effect on the structure of the gels, and on the macroscopic viscoelastic properties...|$|E
