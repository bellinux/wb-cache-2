I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, {{and this is my}} sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind – I could see her.|$|E
500|$|The parade scene took {{multiple}} days of filming; Broderick {{spent some}} time practicing the dance moves. [...] "I was very scared", Broderick said. [...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and saw a river of people. I put my hands {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. I can understand how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's working {{title was}} Strawberries for Pigs, a name {{inspired}} by the reception the band's newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, [...] "we were playing {{a lot of new}} material, and we had an audience that didn't want to hear about anything, they just wanted to hear Neat Neat Neat and New Rose nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren't interested in hearing music at all.

When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E

2500|$|Giladi relates that {{he became}} politicized after an {{experience}} at the Socialist/Zionist party headquarters.

He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E

5000|$|David Boreanaz {{had just}} had knee surgery prior to filming, so writer David Fury {{did his best to}} keep Angel sitting down as much as possible.

60|$|For {{some time}} I lay across a seat where I had been flung, face downward, {{and with the}} water running out of my mouth. After a while, still weak and faint, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> {{to see who was}} my rescuer. And there, in the stern, sheet in one hand and tiller in the other, {{grinning}} and nodding good-naturedly, sat Demetrios Contos.

60|$|But when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> {{and peered}} over the dark waters, {{it was quite}} plain {{to me that it}} was not want of oil, but {{increased}} distance, which made those lights so dim. I could now perceive but three of them, and as the surface was agitated only by a gentle swell, I could not suppose that any of them were hidden from our view by waves. We were being left behind, that was certain, and all I could do was to row on as long and as well as I could in the direction which the other boats had taken. I had been used to rowing, and thought I pulled a good oar, and I certainly did not expect to be left behind in this way.|$|E
60|$|Judge Douglas, {{in reply}} to what I {{have said about}} having upon a {{previous}} occasion made the speech at Ottawa as the one he took an extract from at Charleston, says it only shows that I practiced the deception twice.
