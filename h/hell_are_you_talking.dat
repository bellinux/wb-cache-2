5000|$|The {{songs on}} T.S.O.L. are fast-tempoed and have angry, leftist lyrics attacking the United States {{government}} and the renewal of the military draft. Grisham has described it as [...] "four kids hating the government and refusing to get real jobs. It was muscular and threatening, anarchistic and confrontational. It was a straight up attack at {{the government of the}} United States and those involved with it." [...] "Property Is Theft" [...] employs Marxist rhetoric, echoing the communist belief in the abolishment of private property, while [...] "Abolish Government / Silent Majority" [...] is anarchist in nature. Reflecting on the EP thirty years later, Grisham recalled that the band already had most of the songs' lyrics written before he joined, and that he probably only penned those to [...] "No Way Out". He criticized the lyrics' naivety, since the band members were too young to pay taxes or be drafted, and pointed out the lack of focus in [...] "Superficial Love": [...] "Superficial love, only for a fuck / But love is incest, and it's only for a buck / Eating to survive, surviving for free / Peacetime, wartime, trying to draft me...It's like, 'What the <b>hell?</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about this, or are you talking about that?
