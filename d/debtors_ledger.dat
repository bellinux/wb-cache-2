50|$|Security {{requirements}} vary, but traditionally {{focus on}} the value of the <b>debtors</b> <b>ledger,</b> supported by a pledge of specific assets as collateral and a charge or mortgage over the business, along with the personal guarantees of directors. Apart from some specialised lenders, real estate security is not taken. By focusing on the value and collectability of the accounts receivable ledger, most debtor finance credit lines will automatically increase in response to increases in sales, and provide ongoing working capital to fund the growth of the business. Typically the advance rate ranges from 70% of accounts receivable ledger value up to 90%. The remaining 30% to 10%, known as the 'retention' is released following receipt of payment of each invoice by the customer/debtor/buyer.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} difficult for SMEs to obtain traditional finance from banks. Alternative options are invoice discounting or factoring, whereby the company borrows against its outstanding invoices, with the ability to obtain funds as soon as new invoices are created. It is often questioned which option is best for your business - factoring or discounting - and the answer depends on how the business wants to be perceived by customers. With factoring, the finance company charges interest on the loan until the invoice is paid, as well as fees, and the finance company takes ownership of the <b>debtor</b> <b>ledger</b> and uses its own credit control team to secure payment. With invoice discounting, the business maintains control of its own ledger and chases debts itself.|$|R
40|$|National audienceMore {{and more}} organisations {{purchase}} software "off-the-shelf" {{as an alternative}} to developing new systems either internally or through outsourcing. This trend, which began with generic software aimed at supporting major organisational processes such as payroll or <b>debtors</b> and creditors <b>ledgers,</b> is now spreading to strategic information systems. This article attempts to investigate the reasons why managers would adopt such an option and seeks to identify the factors which determine {{the success or failure of}} such projects. We focused on SOCRATE, the reservation system of the SNCF (the French railroad company). This system is indeed the most famous instance of purchase of a strategic information system to date. On the one hand, we sought to understand the context in which SOCRATE has been implemented and the state of mind of the project leaders. On the other hand, we also sought to identify the risks inherent in such projects. The opposition between the point of view of the leaders of the project and the traditional risk analysis techniques sheds some light on the problems encountered as the project unfolded, but it also indicates a number of ways that the management of such projects could be improved...|$|R
