5|$|By 1876, White {{was serving}} as the {{chairman}} of the Hampshire County Democratic Executive Committee. While holding this post, White organized and carried out extensive campaigning for West Virginia Democratic Party membership and political candidates. Through his efforts, the number of registered Democrats in Hampshire County swelled from 449 in the preceding <b>election</b> <b>year</b> to 1,369.|$|E
5|$|Daniels {{entered the}} 2008 <b>election</b> <b>year</b> with a 51% {{approval}} rate, and 28% disapproval rate. Daniels' reelection campaign {{focused on the}} states unemployment rate, which had lowered during his time in office, the proposed property tax reform amendment, and the successful balancing of the state budget during his first term.|$|E
5|$|Ohio statewide {{offices are}} {{regularly}} contested {{every four years}} in the midterm election years. 2008 is Class 2 senatorial <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus, the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Republican Mike Crites, 57%-38%.|$|E
30|$|Reforms appear {{significantly}} less numerous in <b>election</b> <b>years,</b> while {{the relation of}} political variables with the reform stance is generally weak. This suggests that reform activism per se is perceived as imprudent in <b>election</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{volatility}} {{experienced in}} inflation, exchange {{and interest rates}} in the study, {{to a large extent}} were not in <b>elections</b> <b>year.</b> It is therefore factually inaccurate to assert that during <b>election</b> <b>years,</b> the cedi depreciates faster to the US dollar. The evidence rather suggests, there seem to be volatility in these economic variables, periods after elections were held rather than during <b>elections</b> <b>year</b> and also during the first quarter of every year.|$|R

5|$|During the 2004 <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> Great Southern gave A$20,000 {{to each of}} the {{governing}} Liberal and National Parties, {{as well as to the}} Labor opposition. In the lead up to the 2007 federal election, Great Southern made A$40,000 of donations to the Labor opposition, including A$10,000 two days after the release of the party's primary industries policy. After Labor won the election, Great Southern's managing director John Young spoke positively of the change in government and of Labor's willingness to review policy toward managed investment schemes.|$|E
5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear that federal intervention {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of <b>election</b> <b>year</b> violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E
5|$|The new Labor leader Frank Tudor was a weak {{leader in}} health and {{political}} prowess. A successor-designate was chosen by the caucus {{but it was not}} Charlton. T. J. Ryan was chosen over him, but he died in 1921 and Charlton filled the deputy leadership position. During <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> 1922, Tudor died also, and Charlton became Leader of the Opposition going into the 1922 election. Charlton defeated Albert Gardiner for the leadership by 22 votes to 2.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the <b>election</b> <b>year.</b> McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E
5|$|With the 1950 mid-term {{elections}} drawing near, and Truman abstaining from overt campaigning {{while the}} troops were fighting in Korea, members of Truman's staff, most notably George Elsey, came up with another way to garner votes for the Democratic Party. In July 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt had traveled to Hawaii to meet with MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz. At this meeting, Roosevelt {{made the decision to}} attack the Philippines in the final year of the Pacific war. It was a political triumph in an <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> refuting Republican claims that Roosevelt fixated on Europe {{at the expense of the}} Pacific.|$|E
5|$|With {{the state}} still {{recovering}} from an economic recession and an <b>election</b> <b>year</b> upcoming, legislators refused to raise taxes. Collins eventually withdrew her request and submitted a continuation budget instead. Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory kindergarten, remedial programs for elementary school children, mandatory testing and internship for teachers, and the implementation of academic receivership for underperforming schools. Among the other accomplishments of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher drunk driving law, and a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the state.|$|E
50|$|Presidential {{elections}} are {{held on the}} same date as those for all {{the seats in the}} United States House of Representatives, the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate, the governorships in several U.S. states, and many state and local elections. Presidential candidates tend to bring out supporters who then vote for their party's candidates for those other offices. These other candidates are said to ride on the presidential candidates' coattails. Voter turnout is also generally higher during presidential <b>election</b> <b>years</b> than either midterm <b>election</b> <b>years</b> or odd-numbered <b>election</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{members are}} elected in their {{respective}} districts for a four-year term.

50|$|The {{city council}} {{consists}} of the mayor and six councilors, all of whom serve four-year terms. Elections are held in November of even-numbered <b>years.</b> In <b>election</b> <b>years</b> divisible by four, (e.g. 2000, 2004, 2008), three councilors are elected. In <b>election</b> <b>years</b> not divisible by four, (e.g. 1998, 2002, 2006), the other three councilors and the mayor are elected.|$|R
5|$|Limited to {{two terms}} as governor, Hatfield {{announced}} his candidacy in the 1966 U.S. Senate election {{for the seat}} vacated by the retiring Maurine Neuberger. During the Vietnam War, and during an <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> {{he was the only}} person to vote against a resolution by a governors' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966. At that time the war was supported by 75percent of the public, and was also supported by Hatfield's opponent in the November election. He won the primary election with 178,782 votes compared to a combined 56,760votes for three opponents. Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman Robert Duncan in the election. In order to finish his term as governor, which ended on January 9, 1967, he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3.|$|E
5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an <b>election</b> <b>year</b> when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an <b>election</b> <b>year</b> if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

50|$|Gubernatorial {{elections}} {{were held in}} Illinois in November 1976. Incumbent Governor Dan Walker lost renomination in favor of Secretary of State Michael J. Howlett, who was a Daley ally. Howlett then lost the general election to Republican James R. Thompson. This election was for a two-year term which would synchronize future gubernatorial elections with midterm <b>election</b> <b>years,</b> rather than presidential <b>election</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of IMF and World Bank conditionality and tries to explain changes in this conditionality over time as well as differences between the two institutions. Using panel data it is shown that the number of Fund conditions seem to be influenced by contemporaneous World Bank activity. Moreover, the paper tries to explain compliance with World Bank conditionality as well as interruptions of IMF programs in the recipient countries. Compliance with World Bank conditionality is lower in <b>election</b> <b>years</b> and pre- <b>election</b> <b>years.</b> Breakdowns of IMF programs are less likely in <b>election</b> <b>years.</b> However, no other political factors seem to influence interruptions and compliance systematically. The paper describes the institutions’ reaction to recent criticism and concludes with implications for reform. IMF, World Bank, Conditionality, Compliance, Program Interruption...|$|R
