5|$|A {{large number}} of {{international}} institutions have their seats in Switzerland, {{in part because of}} <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> neutrality. Geneva is the birthplace of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the Geneva Conventions and, since 2006, hosts the United Nations Human Rights Council. Even though Switzerland {{is one of the most}} recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the Palace of Nations in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State {{joined with}} a pro-gun rights organization, the Second Amendment Foundation, and prevailed {{in a lawsuit}} against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> refusing to disable {{restrictions}} upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to press criticism, the foundation announced {{a review of}} its investments to assess social responsibility. It subsequently canceled the review and stood by <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices. The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students. The scholarship program {{is administered by the}} United Negro College Fund.|$|E

5|$|The suit {{called for}} the school {{district}} to reverse <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for {{black and white students}} in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by the leadership of the Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances {{that might}} entail military, political, or direct {{economic}} action {{and has been}} neutral {{since the end of}} its expansion in 1515. <b>Its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations {{and it was the first}} state to join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s. However, Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area.|$|E
5|$|After leaving school, Chappell {{spent two}} years as a clerk in a sharebroker's office, which he left to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a {{promotions}} representative for Nestlé and, later, the cigarette manufacturer WD & HO Wills. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession. He is twice married, and has a daughter (Amanda) with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with his second wife Barbara-Ann. In recent years, Chappell has been a high-profile activist for better treatment of asylum seekers by the Australian government, in particular <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> mandatory detention. He supports Australia cutting ties with the United Kingdom and becoming a republic, being {{a founding member of}} the Australian Republican Movement.|$|E
50|$|In {{effort to}} punish South Africa for <b>its</b> <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> apartheid, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a {{voluntary}} international oil embargo against South Africa on November 20, 1987; that embargo {{had the support}} of 130 countries.|$|R
50|$|The Republican Front Party was a {{political}} party in Zimbabwe in the 1980s, led by Ian Smith as {{the continuation of the}} Rhodesian Front. The name change came on June 6, 1981, as an attempt to distance itself from <b>its</b> <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> the past.|$|R
5000|$|Historian Timothy Snyder {{has argued}} that the theory served the Stalinist regime both as self-justification for the {{failures}} <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> collectivization (which were to be blamed on [...] "saboteurs" [...] rather than on the inadequacies of Soviet planning), and as an ideological tool for the continuation of mass repression: ...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not the only place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E
5|$|By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, {{and aimed}} to {{increase}} the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997 and refocused on its restaurant and gift store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country store setting, with good service and country music. The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama. In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{its only}} {{access to the}} Baltic Sea was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which {{represented}} only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained {{a third of its}} industry. Lithuania also lost its heavy investments in the port's infrastructure. About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, left the region and sought shelter and support from the Lithuanian government. Lithuanians doubted the fate of their country: in March–April withdrawals of deposits in banks and credit institutions totaled almost 20% of total deposits. After the loss of Klaipėda, Lithuania drifted into the German sphere of influence, especially in terms of trade. At the end of 1939, Germany accounted for 75% of Lithuanian exports and for 86% of its imports. Germany and the Soviet Union concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. Not surprisingly, Lithuania was, at first, assigned to Germany. The Nazis {{went so far as to}} suggest a German–Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the Vilnius Region, but Lithuania held to <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> strict neutrality.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economic}} impact in coastal Newfoundland was unprecedented. To lessen {{the impact that}} <b>its</b> <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> permitting overfishing had exacted upon rural Newfoundlanders, the federal government swiftly created a relief program called [...] "The Atlantic Groundfish Strategy" [...] (TAGS) to provide short- to medium-term financial support, and employment retraining for the longer term.|$|R

50|$|In the Interwar period (1918-39), the Albanian {{government}} {{closed down}} Greek schools as part <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> assimilation. During the Communist rule in Albania (1944-92), the government restricted {{the use of}} Greek language and Greek names by the country's Greek minority in an attempt of forced assimilation. Anti-Greek sentiment dominated the thinking of Enver Hoxha, the communist leader of Albania, during the Greek Civil War.|$|R

The Labour Party also appealed directly to British drivers Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Paul di Resta to boycott the race. Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper openly called for the race to be cancelled.|$|R
25|$|The famine {{resulted}} from combined effects of economic disturbance—which {{had already started}} during World War I, and continued through the disturbances of the Russian Revolution—and Russian Civil War with <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> War Communism, especially prodrazvyorstka, exacerbated by rail systems that could not distribute food efficiently.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to state-sponsored violence, {{other means of}} crushing the Isaaq uprising included the government's continuation of <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> political repression and harsh economic measures, this included withholding international food aid donations to the Isaaq. This was especially harsh as food aid accounted for {{nearly half of all}} food consumption in Somalia in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian government's {{unwillingness to}} deal with the 1984–85 famine {{provoked}} universal condemnation by the international community. Even many supporters of the Ethiopian regime opposed <b>its</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> withholding food shipments to rebel areas. The combined effects of famine and internal war had by then put the nation's economy into a state of collapse.|$|E
