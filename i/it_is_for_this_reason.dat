5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that {{the variations in}} style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
50|$|After Montaigne's death, Gournay {{edited the}} third {{edition of the}} Essays in 1595, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> that she <b>is</b> best known.|$|R
25|$|About {{the year}} 1529, he and Pedro Moreno {{organized}} sugar plantations and mills at Zempoala, near Veracruz. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> project {{that he needed}} the black slaves.|$|R
25|$|The {{police and}} the {{government}} were {{of the opinion that}} the death penalty deterred offenders from carrying firearms and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that such offences remained punishable by death.|$|R
5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that plans to relocate the airport are so important in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{integration}} {{tends to}} occur in or near oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that {{the integration of the}} virus can greatly {{contribute to the development of}} tumor characteristics.|$|E
25|$|By 1840, {{the area}} of Nova Scotia Gardens had {{degenerated}} into a notorious slum. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that the philanthropist, Angela Burdett-Coutts purchased the land, and, after the leases expired, established Columbia Market in 1869.|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of Guantanamo Cuba Bannon {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} combat {{and received a}} Brevet promotion to First Lieutenant effective June 13, 1898. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> action that he would later receive the Brevet Medal.|$|R
50|$|In 1848, {{along with}} Giacomo Margotti, {{he founded the}} newspaper, Armonia ("Harmony") in Turin. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that he fell a victim to the anti-clerical {{influence}} which had deprived him of his post at Superga.|$|R
50|$|His main work 1894/1895 was the Manchester Ship Canal and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{work which}} he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1895. His company was then renamed from John Jackson Ltd to Sir John Jackson Ltd.|$|R
25|$|The term Implementer was the self-given name of {{the creators}} of the text {{adventure}} series Zork. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that game designers and programmers {{can be referred to}} as an Implementer (video games), often shortened to Imp, rather than a writer.|$|E
25|$|Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not {{cleanse the}} hands of organic material, but simply {{disinfect}} them. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.|$|E
25|$|A Catechumen (from Latin catechumenus, Greek κατηχουμενος , instructed) is one {{receiving}} {{instruction in}} {{the principles of the}} Christian religion with a view to baptism. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that those who are already validly baptized in another Christian Faith are not known as Catechumens, but rather Candidates.|$|E
50|$|He raised two {{companies}} for service during the Boer War. He {{was one of}} the organizers of the Valcartier Military Camp (now CFB Valcartier). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> work that he was knighted. During World War I, he served as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 171st Battalion.|$|R
25|$|Howze {{participated in}} the Pine Ridge Campaign from November 1890 to January 1891. On January 1, 1891, the 6th Cavalry crossed the frozen White River in South Dakota to engage a group of Brulé Sioux. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> action he <b>was</b> {{presented}} with the Medal of Honor.|$|R
50|$|From 1995 until 2009 Whitney {{served as}} an advisor and {{facilitator}} {{in the design and}} development of the United Religions Initiative, a global inter-faith organization dedicated to peace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose that Whitney and David Cooperrider created the processes that Whitney entitled the Appreciative Inquiry Summit.|$|R
25|$|Noseclips {{can prevent}} water from {{getting in the}} nose. However, this is {{generally}} only used for synchronised swimming. Using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause a disadvantage to most swimmers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that noseclips are only used for synchronised swimming and recreational swimming.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{independence}} of local communities, Jewish ethnicities, even when they circumscribe differences in liturgy, language, cuisine and other cultural accoutrements, are more often a reflection of geographic and historical isolation from other communities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that communities are referred to by referencing the historical region in which the community cohered when discussing their practices, regardless of where those practices are found today.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church and {{the ancient}} Christian Churches see priestly {{ordination}} as a sacrament dedicating the person ordained to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on the person. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that a person may be ordained {{to each of the}} three orders only once. They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males.|$|E
50|$|Howze {{participated in}} the Pine Ridge Campaign from November 1890 to January 1891. On January 1, 1891, the 6th Cavalry crossed the frozen White River in South Dakota to engage a group of Brulé Sioux. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> action he <b>was</b> {{presented}} with the Medal of Honor.|$|R
50|$|Although this {{corporation}} {{through the}} centuries became an entity resembling more a municipal government than a trade organization, they maintained their original arms and motto, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> that the Mairie de Paris bears them still today. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> made official on November 24, 1853 by Baron Haussmann.|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{reason that}} the Middlesborough Consensus {{recommended}} that a disposable Veress needle {{should be used in}} order to reliably hear these important clicks, which signify that these two layers have <b>been</b> penetrated, whereas <b>for</b> all other ports, reusable equipment could be justified on the grounds of economy.|$|R
25|$|Intravenous sodium {{bicarbonate}} is an aqueous solution that is sometimes used for cases of acidosis, or when insufficient sodium or bicarbonate ions {{are in the}} blood. In cases of respiratory acidosis, the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer of plasma to the left and, thus, raises the pH. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that {{sodium bicarbonate}} is used in medically supervised cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood pH is markedly (<7.1–7.0) low.|$|E
25|$|Kula {{exchange}} {{is the only}} way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.|$|E
25|$|While {{it works}} in {{preventing}} speech, {{a person who has}} been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she feels any kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for someone who is not careful.|$|E
50|$|Burton was 21 {{years old}} and a private in the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment, British Army, during the Second World War at Monte Ceco, near Palazzuolo sul Senio, {{north-east}} of Florence when the following deed took place. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> that he <b>was</b> awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|R
2500|$|Señorita was “pretty badly shaken up” {{during one}} {{run to the}} Cascades in 1858, when the {{hurricane}} deck was blown off, and other damage was sustained. [...] According to one source, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason, and high operation costs, that Señorita was soon thereafter withdrawn from service {{and sent to the}} scrapyard.|$|R
50|$|During the {{disturbances}} of 1830-32, Melbourne acted vigorously and sensitively, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{that his}} reforming brethren thanked him heartily. Melbourne blamed local magistrates {{for being too}} lenient and the government appointed a Special Commission of three judges to try rioters in the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.|$|R
25|$|The most {{accurate}} figures usually {{belong to the}} air arm fighting over its own territory, where many wrecks can be located, and even identified, and where shot down enemy are either killed or captured. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that at least 76 of the 80 aircraft credited to Manfred von Richthofen can be tied to known British losses—the German Jagdstaffeln flew defensively, on their own side of the lines, {{in part due to}} General Hugh Trenchard's policy of offensive patrol.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} sale of {{the track}} bed was postponed following {{the prospect of a}} number of schemes to re-open the closed section of the line. But they were all unsuccessful, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that it took 15 years for the railway to become available to private buyers. Even so, certain covenants have been inserted into the deeds stating that there is to be no building on this land and it can be compulsorily purchased back should the need arise to reinstate the line.|$|E
25|$|The BEST bus routes {{are spread}} citywide and to {{neighboring}} cities. The BEST operates inter-city services to three areas beyond the municipal limits of Mumbai city, i.e., into {{the limits of}} the bordering corporations of Navi Mumbai, Thane & Mira - Bhayander. The BEST supplements suburban rails, which is the mass carrier on Mumbai region. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that BEST always gives priority for feeder routes over other routes. The BEST uses CNG and diesel powered buses for its operation. BEST introduced Air conditioned buses in 1998.|$|E
50|$|His {{part-owner}} Richard Burridge {{has stated}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that Desert Orchid would have struggled in the Grand National: connections felt he could do himself serious injury at the ninety-degree Canal Turn especially on the second circuit (ref. Richard Burridge: The Grey Horse: The True Story of Desert Orchid).|$|R
25|$|In 1947, when Bijan Jazani was 9 years old, {{his father}} joined the Democratic Azerbaijan group {{and in the}} same year with the fall of {{sovereign}} Azerbaijan his father left for the Soviet Union and remained there until 1967. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that Alamtaj Kalantari took Bijan Jazani and his sisters to her parent's home.|$|R
500|$|Mao biographer Lee Feigon {{asserted}} that Mao experienced [...] "a relatively typical childhood". He commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that previous biographers {{had found it}} difficult to [...] "find something fundamentally wrong with Mao from an early age" [...] with which they had hoped to explain his later development into [...] "a revolutionary tyrant".|$|R
