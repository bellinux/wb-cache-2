50|$|Characteristics of the {{syndrome}} include {{the presence of}} acanthocytes (burr-cell malformation of the erythrocytes), and the reduction or even absence of B-lipoproteins. Complications include retinitis pigmentosa, degenerative changes in {{the central nervous system}} involving the cerebellum and long tracts, <b>fatty</b> <b>diarrhea,</b> ataxia, areflexia, demyelination, defective intestinal lipid absorption with low serum cholesterol level, intestinal malabsorption, amaurosis, retarded growth, and steatorrhea. Intellectual development may be slightly retarded.Many afflicted with {{the syndrome}} are unable to walk.|$|E
40|$|T H E {{occurrence}} of either hyperglycemia or diarrhea in {{carcinoma of the}} pancreas is not uncommon, but {{the combination of these}} findings, although frequently alluded to as suggestive of carcinoma, 1 is infrequently reported. Urmy et al. 2 in 1931 reported the only well documented case of diabetes mellitus and <b>fatty</b> <b>diarrhea</b> attributed to carcinoma of the pancreas, and Joslin et al. 3 cite one other case. Recently Gullick, 4 in a study of 97 proved cases of pancreatic carcinoma, noted hyperglycemia in two of eight patients with diarrhea whose fasting blood sugar was measured. This study is based on the observation of two patients with newly discovered diabetes mellitus and steatorrhea secondary to carcinoma of the pancreas. In both patients the presenting complaint was diarrhea. CASE REPORT Case 1. On June 3, 1958, a 73 year old white female was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital of the City of New York for the first time. Her chief complaint was frequent loose bowel movements of about six months ' duration. The patient ha...|$|E
25|$|Pancreatitis is {{inflammation}} of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes {{and a number of}} hormones. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, <b>fatty</b> stool, and <b>diarrhea</b> may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs.|$|R
40|$|The {{antidiarrheal}} {{effects of}} chloroform, methanol, and aqueous extracts of Bidens odorata Cav. were investigated at doses of 200 [*]mg/kg on castor-oil-induced diarrhea. The chloroform extract of B. odorata (CBO) reduced diarrhea by 72. 72 %. The effect of CBO was evaluated on mice with diarrhea induced by castor oil, MgSO 4, arachidonic acid, or prostaglandin E 2. CBO inhibited the contraction induced by carbachol chloride on ileum (100 [*]Âµg/mL) and intestinal transit (200 [*]mg/kg) in Wistar rats. The active fraction of CBO (F 4) at doses of 100 [*]mg/kg inhibited the diarrhea induced by castor oil (90. 1 %) or arachidonic acid (72. 9 %) {{but did not}} inhibit the diarrhea induced by PGE 2. The active fraction of F 4 (FR 5) only was tested on diarrhea induced with castor oil and inhibited this diarrhea by 92. 1 %. The compositions of F 4 and FR 5 were determined by GC-MS, and oleic, palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acids were found. F 4 and a mixture of the four <b>fatty</b> acids inhibited <b>diarrhea</b> at doses of 100 [*]mg/kg (90. 1 % and 70. 6 %, resp.). The {{results of this study}} show that B. odorata has antidiarrheal effects, as is claimed by folk medicine, and could possibly be used for the production of a phytomedicine...|$|R
