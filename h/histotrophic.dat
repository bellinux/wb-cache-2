5000|$|<b>Histotrophic</b> {{viviparity}} means embryos {{develop in}} the female’s oviducts but obtain nutrients by consuming other ova, zygotes or sibling embryos (oophagy or adelphophagy).

50|$|Phoronts {{go through}} {{metamorphosis}} {{to prepare for}} excystation. Metamorphosis changes the body shape, organization, and physiology of the phoront to allow for rapid ingestion and storage of large amounts of food. <b>Histotrophic</b> phoronts metamorphose {{within a few hours}} of encysting on their hosts. Exuviotrophic phoronts can remain dormant for months after encysting and only metamorphose immediately before their hosts molt their exoskeleton.|$|E
50|$|In fish, {{fertilisation}} of eggs can {{be either}} external or internal. In many species of fish, fins have been modified to allow Internal fertilisation. Similarly, development of the embryo can be external or internal, although some species show a change between the two at various stages of embryo development. Thierry Lodé described reproductive strategies {{in terms of the}} development of the zygote and the interrelationship with the parents; there are five classifications - ovuliparity, oviparity, ovo-viviparity, <b>histotrophic</b> viviparity and hemotrophic viviparity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Histotrophic</b> (tissue eating) {{viviparity}} means embryos {{develop in}} the female’s oviducts but obtain nutrients by consuming other tissues, such as ova (oophagy) or zygotes. This has been observed primarily among sharks such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. An unusual mode of vivipary is adelphophagy or intrauterine cannibalism, in which the largest embryos eat weaker, smaller unborn siblings. This is most commonly found among sharks such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
50|$|However, each {{of those}} {{so-called}} traditional modes covered {{a wide range of}} diverse reproductive strategies. The biologist Thierry Lodé has accordingly proposed five modes of reproduction based on the relationship between the zygote (the fertilised egg) and the parents. His revised modes are ovuliparity, with external fertilisation; oviparity, with internal fertilisation of large eggs containing a substantial nutritive yolk; ovo-viviparity, that is oviparity where the zygotes are retained for a time in a parent's body, but without any sort of feeding by the parent; <b>histotrophic</b> viviparity, where the zygotes develop in the female's oviducts, but are fed on other tissues; and hemotrophic viviparity, where the developing embryos are fed by the mother, often through a placenta.|$|E
5000|$|Pregnancy {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{defined as the}} period during which developing embryos are incubated in the body after egg-sperm union. Although the term often refers to placental mammals, {{it has also been}} used in the titles of many international, peer-reviewed, scientific articles on fish, e.g. [...] Consistent with this definition, there are several modes of reproduction in fish, providing different amounts of parental care. In ovoviviparity, there is internal fertilization and the young are born live but there is no placental connection or significant trophic (feeding) interaction; the mother's body maintains gas exchange but the unborn young are nourished by egg yolk. There are two types of viviparity in fish. In <b>histotrophic</b> viviparity, the zygotes develop in the female's oviducts, but she provides no direct nutrition; the embryos survive by eating her eggs or their unborn siblings. In hemotrophic viviparity, the zygotes are retained within the female and are provided with nutrients by her, often through some form of placenta.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} used {{wobbegong}} sharks (genus Orectolobus) {{to assess the}} threshold value proposed by previous research to categorize strict lecithotrophic from incipient <b>histotrophic</b> species. Totals of 236 and 135 ornate wobbegong Orectolobus ornatus and spotted wobbegong Orectolobus maculatus, respectively, were collected from the New South Wales commercial fishery between June 2003 and May 2006. Eight pregnant gulf wobbegong Orectolobus halei were also recorded outside the sampling period for the first time. The three species were reproductively synchronous with a gestation of c. 10 - 11 months. Embryos started to be macroscopically visible during January and external yolk sacs were fully absorbed by June to July when embryos were c. 200 mm total length (LT). Internal yolk sacs were first observed during April to May when embryos were c. 160 mm LT, reached a peak during June and persisted in embryos immediately prior to parturition. The total wet mass from uterine egg to full-term embryos increased by 44 - 89 % and 45 - 62 %, whereas the total organic mass decreased by 32 - 33 % and 26 %, for O. o rnatus and O. maculatus, respectively, suggesting that these species are strict lecithotrophic yolk-sac viviparous sharks with no maternal nutrient input. A {{review of the literature}} identified various issues and suggested that the previously proposed organic mass loss threshold value separating strict lecithotrophic species from incipient <b>histotrophic</b> species might not be appropriate. Instead, it is recommended that a combination of methods (e. g. estimation of organic mass gain or loss between ovarian egg and developed embryo, histology and electron microscopy of the uterus, radio-tracer assay and uterine fluid analysis throughout gestation) is used to discern between strict lecithotrophic and incipient <b>histotrophic</b> species. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Although not {{belonging}} to the class of professional phagocytes, in many species trophoblast cells exhibit intense phagocytic activity. The complete range of physiological functions of trophoblast phagocytosis {{has not yet been}} fully characterized. Close association between the trophoblast and nutrition was determined many years ago. Hubrecht (1889) when proposing {{for the first time the}} name trophoblast to the external layer of the blastocyst, directly established the nutritive significance of this embryonic layer. Indeed, <b>histotrophic</b> phagocytosis, i. e. the internalization of maternal cells and secreted materials, is considered an important function of the trophoblast before the completion of the placenta. Recently, however, unexpected characteristics of the trophoblast have significantly enhanced our understanding of this process. Roles in acquisition of space for embryo development, in tissue remodeling during implantation and placentation and in defense mechanisms are highlighting how this cellular activity may be relevant for the maternal-fetal relationship beyond its nutritional function...|$|E
40|$|We used light {{microscopy}} to study placental {{structure of the}} lizard Sceloporus mucronatus throughout 6 months of embryonic development. Three stages of placental development could be assigned to embryos based on {{the arrangement of the}} extraembryonic membranes. A highly vascular choriovitelline placenta was present in the embryonic hemisphere and a nonvascular bilaminar omphalopleure covered most of the abembryonic hemisphere of the egg during embryonic Stages 10 - 28. A chorioallantoic placenta replaced the choriovitelline placenta by embryonic Stage 29 and an omphaloplacenta covered the abembryonic hemisphere at this stage. The combination of these two placental types occurred in Stage 29 - 36 embryos. The final stage of placentation, embryonic Stages 37 - 40, was characterized by an omphalallantoic placenta in the abembryonic hemisphere and a chorioallantoic placenta in the embryonic hemisphere of the egg. The choriovitelline and chorioallantoic placentae are well vascularized, with closely apposed maternal and embryonic blood vessels. These structures are the most likely sites of respiratory exchange. In contrast, the omphaloplacenta and omphalallantoic placentae contain cuboidal or columnar epithelia and these structures may function in <b>histotrophic</b> exchange. Placentation of S. mucronatus {{is similar to that of}} predominantly lecithotrophic species in other squamate lineages suggesting that the evolution of this placental morphology is a response to similar factors and is independent of phylogeny.

40|$|International audienceThe {{modes of}} {{reproduction}} undoubtedly represent {{one of the}} most critical life-history traits because they profoundly affect fitness and survival. The parent-offspring conflict over the degree of parental investment may be the main selective factor in the evolution of reproduction. Although the modes of sexual reproduction are remarkably diversified in animals, the traditional typology spanning three classes does not seem to be adequate to clarify the level of parental investment. Thus, lecithotrophy does not provide any information on the retention of the zygotes inside the parent's body and matrotrophy only indicates that nutrients are provided by mother but does not make any distinction between various types of maternal care. I here present a scientific typology of the reproductive modes comprising five classes: ovuliparity, oviparity, ovo-viviparity, <b>histotrophic</b> viviparity and hemotrophic viviparity. Based on the development stage of the zygote and on its interrelation with the parent, my classification details the degree of contrivances by which animals provide alternative parental investment in their offspring. Hence, this typology possesses a great heuristic value, both in reproduction and evolutionary biology. These different modes of reproduction do represent a sequence, with ovuliparity being the most primitive and hemotrophic viviparity the most advanced mode. Lastly, the comparative analysis of different reproductive modes in vertebrates suggests that climatic conditions (cold) could be one of the strongest selection pressures for extending egg retention and the establishment of viviparity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There is a {{dialogue}} between the developing conceptus (embryo-fetus and associated placental membranes) and maternal uterus which must be established during the peri-implantation period for pregnancy recognition signaling, implantation, regulation of gene expression by uterine epithelial and stromal cells, placentation and exchange of nutrients and gases. The uterus provide a microenvironment in which molecules secreted by uterine epithelia or transported into the uterine lumen represent histotroph required for growth {{and development of the}} conceptus and receptivity of the uterus to implantation. Pregnancy recognition signaling mechanisms sustain the functional lifespan of the corpora lutea (CL) which produce progesterone, the hormone of pregnancy essential for uterine functions that support implantation and placentation required for a successful outcome of pregnancy. It is within the peri-implantation period that most embryonic deaths occur due to deficiencies attributed to uterine functions or failure of the conceptus to develop appropriately, signal pregnancy recognition and/or undergo implantation and placentation. With proper placentation, the fetal fluids and fetal membranes each have unique functions to ensure hematotrophic and <b>histotrophic</b> nutrition in support of growth and development of the fetus. The endocrine status of the pregnant female and her nutritional status are critical for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. This review addresses the complexity of key mechanisms that are characteristic of successful reproduction in sheep and pigs and gaps in knowledge that must be the subject of research in order to enhance fertility and reproductive health of livestock species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cumulus-oocyte {{complexes}} (COCs) {{and early}} embryos {{rely on a}} <b>histotrophic</b> nutrition source for energy production and the synthesis of macromolecules. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that the balance {{of supply and demand}} for energy and other anabolic substrates during oocyte maturation and very early stages of development programmes subsequent developmental potential, and this may include subsequent fetal growth trajectory. One example is the role of glucose (Glc) during cumulus-oocyte complex maturation. Glucose is an essential nutrient for maturation, especially its role during cumulus expansion. Our laboratory has shown that during in vitro culture, too little glucose during cumulus-oocyte complex maturation affects meiotic competence. We have focussed on glucose (Glc) metabolism through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) during COC maturation in vitro. The HBP in somatic cells is regarded as a "fuel-sensing" pathway and its interaction with cell signalling systems and transcriptional regulation is increasingly apparent. Up-regulation of the HBP during oocyte maturation in vitro has negative consequences for subsequent development. Another example is the role of hypoxia (low O 2) during peri-compaction development. My laboratory believes that ruminant embryos during compaction, blastulation and subsequent development in the uterine cavity lack a key hypoxia responsive element. Because of this, hypoxia is important for normal development in ruminants but perturbs further development in rodents. The implication of these examples to the fundamental concept of peri-conception nutritional programming of development are discussed. Jeremy G. Thompso...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{purpose was}} to establish the features of structural organization of hemomicrocirculatory vessels in a human cardionector in early ontogenesis, to expose the degree of correlation of morphometric parameters of CCS and being alongside retractive myocardium. On 26 foetuses and under 3 years old children’s hearts the histostructural peculiarities of hemomicrocirculation vessels formation in the cardiac conduction system and nearby myocardium were considered. It has been determined that the formation of hemomicrocirculatory vessels takes place in two stages – intertrabecular and extracar-dial, each corresponding to transition from <b>histotrophic</b> to hemotrophic feeding types. It has been established that apart from simultaneous development and functioning of cardiac conduction system and contractive myocardium their hemomicrocircu-latory vessels differ both in location and in morphology. The circulatory system of CCS in early postnatal ontogenesis has the same structural elements of hemomicrocirculatory vessels mainly, {{as well as in}} retractive myocardium. Along with the proc-esses of formbuilding in the about-leading system after birth, by a compression and interlacing of conducting myocytes, their compactisation, the hemomicrocirculatory vessels acquire a net-form spatially, and the vessels of a special form – sinusiod veins – appear here. The analysis of specific volume of hemomicrocirculatory vessels rotined that AVP, its perforation part, has the least intensive bloodsupply, and, taking into account that it same the bottleneck of atrio-ventricular department of CCS, the insignificant diminishing of blood stream in it or sclerotic processes in a central fibrous body can influence on forming of arhytmhogeny heart...|$|E
40|$|This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} derivation and long-term culture of self-organising, 3 D epithelial organoids from human uterine tissues. Organoids which recapitulate features of uterine glands in vivo {{can be derived}} from both non-pregnant endometrium and from the decidua of early pregnancy using the method described. The organoids are able to respond to hormonal signals, secrete components of uterine ‘milk’ and can also differentiate into ciliated luminal epithelial cells. Since implantation in vivo occurs onto the uterine ciliated luminal epithelium and since uterine glands are the major source of <b>histotrophic</b> nutrition for the developing human conceptus the organoids will allow studies of early implantation in vitro. In addition they provide a useful tool to study the role of uterine stem cells in cyclical endometrial breakdown, repair, hyperplasia, carcinoma and endometriosis. Organoids can be consistently established within one to two weeks of initiation of culture and can be expanded long term, cryopreserved and resurrected.

40|$|The school shark, Galeorhinus galeus, is {{commonly}} captured off the Maghreb shore along the Algerian and Tunisian coasts {{of the southern}} Mediterranean. Of 517 specimens collected during more than twenty years, the smallest adult male was 1225 mm total length (TL) and weighed 11 580 g, the largest adult male was 1580 mm and weighed 18 000 g, and the heaviest male was 1570 mm and weighed 19 900 g. All males above 1260 mm TL were adult. Adult females were 1400 - 1900 mm TL. The smallest pregnant female was 1400 mm TL and carried developing embryos. The largest female was 1990 mm TL and weighed 27 900 g. Females were generally heavier than males, {{but there was no}} significant difference between males and females in mass versus total length relationship. Two ovulation and two pupping seasons occurred in winter and in spring. Gestation was estimated at twelve months, with most females appearing to reproduce in alternate years. The diameter of the largest yolky oocytes ranged 43 - 47 mm (mean 44. 7 ± 1. 8) and the mass ranged 45 - 52 g (mean 47. 9 ± 2. 2). Both uteri were compartmentalized into chambers and a single embryo developed in each chamber. Length and weight at birth, based on near-term embryos, were estimated at 240 - 320 mm TL and 88 - 109 g. The chemical balance of development, based on the mean dry mass of the largest yolky oocytes and of near-term fetuses, was about 1, showing that G. galeus can be considered as an incipient <b>histotrophic</b> species. Ovarian fecundity was higher than uterine fecundity. Litter sizes ranged 8 - 41. Males generally outnumbered females, especially among free-swimming adult specimens...|$|E
