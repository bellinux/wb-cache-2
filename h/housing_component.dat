40|$|House {{maintenance}} {{is crucial to}} ensure the longevity of <b>house</b> <b>components,</b> {{in the same time}} retaining their functionality. Unfortunately, house owners are usually caught off-guarded, especially when <b>house</b> <b>components</b> were already deteriorated without warning. Adding salt to the wound, major house maintenance and rectification generally occur after defect liability period in which the costs incurred are not covered by the developer. The pertaining issue of lack prevention measures towards <b>house</b> <b>components</b> at certain point of time is prevalent. Since there is no established pre-rectification guideline that is able to assist house owners to proactively self-evaluate their <b>house</b> <b>components</b> from time to time, the said problem stays firm. Here, as far as maintenance’s guideline is concerned, knowledge gap in terms of life expectancy (LE) of generic <b>house</b> <b>components</b> is well observed. Therefore, the authors embarked on research exploration through literatures on identifying the factors leading to LE for <b>house</b> <b>components</b> and further suggested average LE for generic <b>house</b> <b>components.</b> However, the authors limit the paper within the initial process of research exploration to understand the central phenomenon of this study, which only governed the process of reviewing literatures. In a nutshell, the authors posit that LE was worth explored by embedding a multi-layered thematic analysis which comprised of several interconnected themes between <b>house</b> <b>components</b> and life expectancy of <b>house</b> <b>component.</b> Finally, the authors are optimist that the initial outcome from the literature reviews is paramount for subsequent phases, for instance validation and data gathering phases...|$|R
40|$|To satisfy customers’ desires with a {{maintained}} {{efficiency of}} the production process is a challenge for many house construction companies. Houses are one-off projects with a production process characterized by variability and complexity that often lead to unpredicted costs. Prefabricated component solutions could possibly solve these issues through modularization, mass customization and delayed product differentiation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the opportunities and barriers to use prefabricated <b>house</b> <b>components.</b> Interviews were conducted with two industrial house manufacturers to pinpoint these opportunities and barriers. The impact of this research may have value for house construction companies considering the use of prefabricated <b>house</b> <b>components.</b> The use of these components may lead to benefits such as shorter lead-time, higher quality, decreased complexity in coordination and reduced risks of production failures. Moreover, this research may be valuable to <b>house</b> <b>component</b> suppliers in the business development of their product offers to industrial house builders...|$|R

Critics countered that similar set-asides for affordable housing have gone unfulfilled in previous large-scale developments, such as Battery Park City. The New York Times reported this proved to be the case in Williamsburg as well, as developers largely decided to forgo incentives to build affordable housing in inland areas.|$|E

In 2004, MJABC filed {{plans for a}} mixed-use development on the site that included 133 upscale, single-family houses and townhouses, all built in Victorian style and with an age restriction for owners, and for keeping and restoring most of the original dozen or so buildings. That proposal fell apart, however, because the <b>housing</b> <b>component</b> was deemed too high-density. MJABC LLC still owns the property and continues {{to pay taxes on}} it.

50|$|Direct {{payment of}} the <b>housing</b> <b>component</b> of Universal Credit (i.e. {{what used to}} be Housing Benefit) to tenants {{has been the subject of}} controversy. Although housing benefit has long been paid to most private sector tenants directly, for social housing tenants it has {{historically}} been paid directly to their landlords. As a result, the implementation of a social housing equivalent to the Local Housing Allowance policy, which has been present in the private sector without comment for over a decade, has widely been perceived as a tax on having extra bedrooms, rather than the tenant making up a shortfall in the rent arising from a standardisation of their level of benefit.|$|E
50|$|Park Avenue West Tower was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} completed in 2010 and is being developed by Tom Moyer's TMT Development. The tower was to have a total of 33 floors and offer retail space, office space and 85 housing units. The <b>housing</b> <b>component</b> has since been dropped from the plans (see below). It was also to have a six floor underground garage with 325 parking spaces. The building gained the top four floors when developers agreed to add 1650 sq ft of bike facilities (including public bicycle commuter showers, bike parking, and locker space) under the connected Director Park subsurface parking, gaining the tower a 40-to-1 bonus.|$|E

50|$|One Manhattan Square (also {{known as}} 227 Cherry Street or 250 South Street) is a {{residential}} skyscraper project {{being developed by}} Extell Development Company in Two Bridges, Manhattan, New York City. The project is being built {{on the site of}} a former Pathmark grocery store, which was demolished in 2014. The building will stand 80 stories or 850 feet (259 m) above the street, and will possibly have a new supermarket in the tower's base. Once completed, the building will stand out significantly {{within the context of the}} neighborhood, the next highest structure being the Manhattan Bridge at roughy 30 stories (102 m) in height. A 13-story affordable <b>housing</b> <b>component</b> will be located separately on-site from the main tower, and completion is currently expected in 2019.|$|E
5000|$|Ground {{was broken}} {{on the first}} {{residential}} building at Pacific Park — B2 — on December 18, 2012. The building will have 363 units, 50% of those units will be affordable. In March 2011, The New York Times revealed that Forest City Ratner was considering building a 34-story apartment building out of prefabricated units. If constructed, {{it will be the}} largest prefabricated structure in the world. Given that, it is likely to face new engineering challenges, and it is not yet certain whether it can be constructed economically. However, if construction turns out to be feasible, the move is likely to save considerable building costs, because construction in a factory is cheaper than at a field site. While satisfying affordable housing advocates, it is likely to anger construction unions, who have been major supporters of the project. At 32 storeys tall, B2 will be the tallest building in the world constructed using modular technology. The <b>housing</b> <b>component</b> of the project has been criticized for its urban density. The construction of a 34-story prefabricated building, while not the first prefab high-rise in the city, would be the largest. However, B2 will be completed in late 2015 — more than ten years after Atlantic Yard's commencement — instead of 2014, the original expected completion date. It was only 13% complete [...]|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe malaria {{parasite}} harbours {{an indispensable}} plastid {{known as the}} ‘apicoplast’. The apicoplast’s exact role remains uncertain, but it <b>houses</b> <b>components</b> involved in fatty acid, isoprenoid and haem biosyntheses. These pathways offer opportunities to develop anti-malarials. In the absence of photosynthesis, how apicoplast anabolism is fuelled is unclear. Here we investigated plant-like transporters of the apicoplast and measured their substrate preferences using a novel cell-free assay system to explore the carbon and energy sources of the apicoplast. The transporters exchange triose phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate for inorganic phosphate, demonstrating that the apicoplast taps into host-derived glucose to fuel its metabolism...|$|R

40|$|We {{formulate}} and estimate a small New Keynesian {{model for}} the Israeli economy. Our goal is to construct a small but still realistic model {{that can be used}} to support the inflation targeting process. The model contains three structural equations: An open economy Phillips curve for CPI inflation (excluding the <b>housing</b> <b>component),</b> an aggregate demand curve for the output gap and an interest parity condition for the nominal exchange rate. The model is closed with an interest rate reaction function (Taylor-type rule) and an ad hoc equation for the <b>housing</b> <b>component</b> of the CPI, which is dominated by exchange rate changes. In the specification of the model we had to pay special attention to the crucial role of the exchange rate in the transmission of monetary policy in Israel, which has a direct effect on almost 60 percent of the CPI. The model is estimated by the GMM method, using quarterly data for the period 1992 :I to 2005 :IV. In the estimation of the structural equations we tried to remain as close as possible to the theoretical formulation by restricting the dynamics to one lag at most. We use the model to characterize an "optimal" simple interest rate rule. We find that the monetary authority should respond to an hybrid backward-forward looking rate of inflation and does not benefit from direct reaction to exchange rate measures. ...|$|E
