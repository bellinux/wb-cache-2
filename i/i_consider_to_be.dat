No, no, no. Listen to the song. This guy is a loser."

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation, described the episode as [...] "very classic Trek". She {{was pleased to}} see that some character depth was being introduced into the new Xindi characters, and compared Gralik to Captain Dathon from the [...] episode [...] "Darmok" [...] but thought that Gralik didn't get developed quite enough {{to be on the same}} level. Overall, she described the episode as [...] "a very solid hour of entertainment, with very few nitpicks... a slick package with the values <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> real Trek". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] wasn't enthusiastic about a particularly [...] "lackluster" [...] action scene which he felt was a bad cross between [...] and Andromeda.

2500|$|During {{the dispute}} between King Henry and Thomas Becket, Bartholomew refused to {{cooperate}} with either side, which caused Becket to scold him as a bad friend. At {{the start of the}} dispute, Bartholomew was sent with a royal deputation to Sens to ask the pope to send papal legates to England to settle the quarrel. Thereafter, he avoided being drawn into the controversy, until 1170. When Roger of York crowned Henry the Young King in 1170, Bartholomew was said to be present. In September 1170, Pope Alexander III suspended Bartholomew from office for attending the coronation, along with a number of other bishops. Shortly after a settlement of the dispute was reached in 1172, Henry wrote to Bartholomew saying that [...] "I shall abolish all new customs introduced in my reign against the churches of my land (which <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> few or none)", which signaled Henry's intentions of mostly ignoring the settlement. Bartholomew was restored to his office before 21 December 1171, when he helped restore Canterbury Cathedral to use for religious ceremonies.|$|E

President Kennedy in a speech at the White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps and what this organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world that we have seen in recent years".

[...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time.
