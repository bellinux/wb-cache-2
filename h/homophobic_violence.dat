25|$|Because LGBT {{people have}} {{historically}} been marginalized as sexual minorities, {{coming out of the}} closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a backlash of heterosexist discrimination and <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{responding}} to the suicide of an LGBT youth because of homophobic bullying, Egale created the Report <b>Homophobic</b> <b>Violence,</b> Period (RHVP) program {{in conjunction with the}} Toronto Police Service. RHVP is a reporting, public awareness and education program that focuses on youth ages 13 to 25 and addresses the issue of homophobic and transphobic bullying and violence.|$|E
50|$|Very few {{countries}} have education sector policies that address <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence</b> or include sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in curricula or learning materials. In most countries, staff lack training {{and support to}} address sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and to prevent and respond to <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence.</b> Although many countries provide support for students who experience violence, services are often ill-equipped to deal with <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence.</b> Few countries collect data on the nature, prevalence or impact of <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence,</b> which contributes to low awareness {{of the problem and}} lack of evidence for planning effective responses.|$|R

25|$|BME LGB {{communities}} are disproportionately affected by <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence,</b> abuse and harassment. In {{a study conducted}} in London, BME LGB people {{were more likely to}} experience physical abuse, more likely to experience harassment from a stranger and were equally likely to have experienced verbal abuse as their White British LGB counterparts, and due to the pressures of discrimination and victimisation, {{are more likely to have}} poorer mental health.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights {{has responded}} to {{allegations}} of increasing <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence</b> by stating that its responses are limited {{by the fact that}} LGBT people are not a listed minority in Iraq, but has also emphasized that a number of cases of discrimination and violence against the LGBT community has been passed onto the interior ministry. Ali al-Dabbagh, Prime Minister Maliki's spokesperson has denied organized persecution against the LGBT community but has suggested that members of the community keep their homosexuality private in order to avoid persecution.|$|E
500|$|On 23 June, the British LGBT {{rights group}} OutRage! held a {{memorial}} vigil outside the High Commission of Jamaica in London. OutRage! leader Peter Tatchell attended the vigil, there proclaiming that the Jamaican Prime Minister, P. J. Patterson, [...] "shares {{responsibility for the}} wave of <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence,</b> culminating {{in the murder of}} Brian Williamson" [...] because he had failed to decriminalize same-sex sexual activity and clamp down on <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence</b> in Jamaican society.|$|E
50|$|<b>Homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence</b> in {{educational}} settings {{can be categorized}} as explicit and implicit. Explicit <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence</b> consists of overt acts that make subjects feel uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated or intimidated. Peers and educational staff are unlikely to intervene when witnessing these incidents. This contributes to normalizing such acts that become accepted as either a routine disciplinary measure or a means to resolve con icts among students. <b>Homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence</b> - as with all school-related gender-based violence - is acutely underreported due to subjects’ fear of retribution, combined with inadequate or non-existent reporting, support and redress systems. The absence of effective policies, protection or remedies contributes to a vicious cycle where incidents become increasingly normal.|$|R
50|$|Work {{conducted}} in countering violence in schools in general {{has shown that}} ‘school and system wide interventions’, {{often referred to as}} ‘whole school’ strategies or approaches, are particularly effective 124, 146.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Orizaba’s typical route had {{remained}} virtually the same, though Nassau and Tampico were dropped as ports of call. It {{was in this}} period that American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from Orizaba. At around noon on 27 April 1932, while the ship was headed to New York—some [...] north of Havana and [...] off the Florida coast—Crane, clad in pajamas and overcoat, climbed the rail at {{the stern of the}} ship and plunged into the ocean. The captain of Orizaba immediately stopped the ship and launched four lifeboats that searched in vain for two hours, but no trace of the poet was ever found. Before he jumped, Crane had been drinking and, the night before, had been the victim of <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence</b> after a pick-up attempt of a crewman ended with a severe beating.|$|E
500|$|The Kremlin's {{backing of}} the law appealed to the Russian {{nationalist}} far-right, but gained broad support among the Russian populace. The law was condemned by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe (of which Russia is a member), by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and by human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The statute was criticized for its broad and ambiguous wording (including the aforementioned [...] "raises interest in" [...] and [...] "among minors"), which many critics characterized as being an effective ban on publicly promoting the rights {{and culture of the}} LGBT community. The law was also criticized for leading to an increase and justification of <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence,</b> while the implications of the laws in relation to the then-upcoming Winter Olympics being hosted by Sochi were also cause for concern, as the Olympic Charter contains language explicitly barring various forms of discrimination.|$|E
500|$|On 25 July, the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays (J-FLAG), an LGBT rights organisation, {{issued a}} public {{statement}} expressing their [...] "deep concern" [...] regarding the case, and offering their condolences to Jones' friends and family. They encouraged local people {{to aid the}} police in locating the perpetrators of the attack, which they asserted was an affront to Jamaica's democracy. J-FLAG's director Dane Lewis later commented that despite an increase in <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence,</b> Jamaican society was becoming more tolerant toward LGBT people; he attributed this to the actions of individuals like Jones, who have helped improve the public visibility of LGBT people in Jamaican society. Another LGBT rights organisation, Quality of Citizenship Jamaica, issued a press release calling {{for the government and}} churches to engage with LGBT organisations to establish common ground which could be undergirded by the principle of [...] "true respect for all," [...] found in the nation's National Anthem. Human rights organisation Jamaicans for Justice called on Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and religious leaders to condemn the murder, also commenting on what they saw as a lack of media coverage and public outrage about the incident, adding that [...] "we must ask ourselves what this says about us as a people." ...|$|E
5000|$|Implicit <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence,</b> {{sometimes}} called ‘symbolic violence’ or ‘institutional’ violence, is subtler than explicit violence. It consists of pervasive representations or attitudes that sometimes feel harmless or natural {{to the school}} community, but that allow or encourage homophobia and transphobia, including perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Policies and guidelines can reinforce or embed these representations or attitudes, whether in an individual institution or across an entire education sector. This way, they can become part of everyday practices and rules guiding school behaviour. Examples of implicit <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence</b> include: ...|$|R

500|$|Action was {{leveraged}} directly against Olympic {{sponsors and}} partners as well; in late-August 2013, the Human Rights Campaign sent {{letters to the}} ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies, urging them to show opposition towards anti-LGBT laws, denounce <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence,</b> ask the IOC to obtain written commitments {{for the safety of}} LGBT athletes and attendees, and oppose future Olympic bids from countries that outlaw support for LGBT equality. In February 2014, prior to the games, a group of 40 human rights organizations (including Athlete Ally, Freedom House, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch and Russian LGBT network among others) also sent a joint letter to the Worldwide Olympic Partners, urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter, and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the human rights abuses of future host countries. On 3 February 2014, USOC sponsor AT issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games, becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws. Several major non-sponsors also made pro-LGBT statements to coincide {{with the opening of the}} Games; Google placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic-themed logo in the colours of the rainbow flag on its home page worldwide, while Channel 4 (who serves as the official British broadcaster of the Paralympics) adopted a rainbow-coloured logo and broadcast a [...] "celebratory", pro-LGBT advert entitled [...] "Gay Mountain" [...] on 7 February 2014, alongside an interview with former rugby union player and anti-homophobia activist Ben Cohen. As part of its Dispatches series, Channel 4 had also broadcast a documentary during the week of the Opening Ceremony entitled Hunted, which documented the violence and abuse against LGBT people in Russia in the wake of the law.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{described}} the document as teaching [...] "that a gay male or lesbian sexual identity {{is not to be}} celebrated, nor is it properly seen as a source of pride". The claims that accepting and legalizing homosexual behaviour leads to violence were seen as controversially blaming gay people for <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence</b> and encouraging <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence.</b> Referring to the AIDS epidemic, the letter, McNeill writes, blamed AIDS on gay rights activists and gay-accepting mental health professionals: [...] "Even when the practice of homosexuality may seriously threaten the lives and well-being {{of a large number of}} people, its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved". Andrew Sullivan called this comment [...] "extraordinary for its lack of compassion" [...] and added that [...] "some of [...] clauses read chillingly like comparable church documents produced in Europe in the 1930s".|$|E
2500|$|Violence against HIV {{positive}} {{people is}} commonplace, but legal repercussions for the aggressor are rare. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS representatives for Jamaica {{have described the}} blind-eye towards <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence</b> as [...] "legalised discrimination" [...] and have claimed that the violence has driven the HIV epidemic further underground, making access to treatment and outreach more difficult.|$|E
50|$|Hostile and non-inclusive {{curricula}} tend {{to exist}} in contexts where homophobia and transphobia are widespread. They do nothing to prevent or reduce violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. On the contrary, hostile curricula contribute to reinforcing stereotypical and patriarchal views of gender - indirectly leading to <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence.</b> Meanwhile, by not challenging these stereotypical and patriarchal views, non-inclusive curricula also contribute to <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence</b> in educational institutions. In contrast, inclusive or af rming curricula may discuss de nitions of masculinity and femininity and challenge existing stereotypes about gender and sexuality - contributing to increasing LGBTI students’ feeling of belonging and safety.|$|R
50|$|A {{comprehensive}} education sector {{response to}} <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>violence</b> encompasses {{all of the}} following elements: effective policies, relevant curricula and learning materials, training and support for staff, support for students and families information and strategic partnerships, and monitoring and evaluation.|$|R
50|$|In Peru, the General Law on Education (2003) {{establishes}} that integral sexuality {{education is}} part of the right to education.

2500|$|To {{avoid the}} death penalty for premeditated murder, Helvey pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of [...] "murder with intent to do great bodily harm." [...] On May 28, 1993, the Navy {{sentence}}d him to life in prison.

2500|$|Tatchell {{argues that}} murder is not legal in Jamaica, and glorification of murder {{is not a}} {{legitimate}} form of Afro-Caribbean culture. In response Tatchell received death threats and was labelled racist. He defended himself by noting that the campaign was {{at the behest of}} the Jamaican gay rights group J-Flag, and the UK-based Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, with which he works closely. He pointed to what he described as his life's work campaigning against racism and apartheid and stated that his campaigns against [...] "murder music" [...] and state-sanctioned <b>homophobic</b> <b>violence</b> in Jamaica were endorsed by black Jamaican gay rights activists such as Jamaican Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-FLAG), and by many straight human rights activists in Jamaica (male homosexuality remains illegal in Jamaica). The campaign has had positive effects with seven of eight original murder music singers signing the Reggae Compassion Act, which says that signatories will not [...] "make statements or perform songs" [...] that incite hatred or violence.|$|E

50|$|The second {{approach}} requires political leadership and a legal {{environment that is}} conducive {{to the protection of}} the rights of LGBTI people.

50|$|In Chile, Law 20.609 (2012) and the Law on Education (2009) are {{in place}} to counter {{discrimination}} in general and can also be applied to a school setting.

50|$|Several {{international}} human rights mechanisms mandate safe, accepting and supportive learning environments that are free from violence and discrimination for all students.
