5000|$|Given {{the quick}} <b>engagement</b> <b>times,</b> {{on the order}} of seconds, the Army decided that FAAD had to have {{semi-automatic}} actions. In combat, the operators would select targets on a long-range search radar and then simply say [...] "go" [...] to attack them. The system's fire control computer would slew the weapons and fire automatically as soon as they came in range.|$|R
50|$|Similar devices soon {{appeared}} in other navies {{and for other}} roles. The US Navy used a somewhat simpler device known as the Rangekeeper, but this also saw continual modification over time and eventually turned into a system of equal or greater sophistication to the UK versions. A similar calculator {{formed the basis of}} the Torpedo Data Computer, which solved the more demanding problem of the very long <b>engagement</b> <b>times</b> of torpedo fire.|$|R
50|$|As the Vigilante program continued, the Army {{decided that}} any gun-based system was hopeless as speeds {{increased}} and <b>engagement</b> <b>times</b> dropped. The Vigilante had a {{maximum effective range}} of about 3000 yd, and its shells took about 5 seconds to cross this distance. A jet aircraft flying at 500 mph would cover over a kilometer during those 5 seconds. By the time a radar-assisted sighting system could develop a firing solution, the target {{would be out of}} range.|$|R
50|$|The missile {{contained}} a small 1.4 kg warhead with a contact fuse and a single-stage solid-rocket motor that accelerated the missile to about 650 m/s (about Mach 2). <b>Engagement</b> <b>time</b> {{to the maximum}} effective range was about 13 seconds.

50|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, both Vickers and Sperry had {{developed}} predictors for use against high-altitude bombers. However, low-flying aircraft presented {{a very different}} problem, with very short <b>engagement</b> <b>times</b> and high angular rates of motion, {{but at the same}} time less need for ballistic accuracy. Machine guns had been the preferred weapon against these targets, aimed by eye and swung by hand, but these no longer had the performance needed to deal with the larger and faster aircraft of the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|The {{gun mount}} is fully automated, {{and can also}} be {{remotely}} controlled by an operator from either the control console or via a remotely mounted gunsight. It has a higher firing rate than both the Goalkeeper and Phalanx (Block 1 and older) CIWS models. They are often mounted in pairs, {{with as many as}} four pairs mounted on the larger ships, providing an effective point defence (last) layer. However, like all gun-based CIWS, they suffer from short <b>engagement</b> <b>times</b> and the need for multiple volleys to effectively eradicate a threat.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, attack helicopters had {{the ability}} to loiter near the front behind cover and pick their targets. They would then [...] "pop up", launch a missile, and return to cover as soon as the missile hit its target. Using fast-reacting wire-guided or radio-command missiles meant the total <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> was kept to a minimum, as there was little or no [...] "lock-on" [...] time required; the operator simply picked his target, fired, and adjusted its flight path while it flew.|$|E
5000|$|The Ikara missile was an Australian ship-{{launched}} anti-submarine missile, {{named after}} an Australian Aboriginal word for [...] "throwing stick". It launched an acoustic torpedo {{to a range}} of 10 nmi km, allowing fast-reaction attacks against submarines at ranges that would otherwise require the launching ship too close for attack, placing itself at risk. Also, by flying to the general area of the target, the <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> was dramatically reduced, giving the target less time to respond. Submariners referred to IKARA as [...] "Insufficient Knowledge And Random Action".|$|E
50|$|The United States Special Operations Command took {{interest}} in the SR-25, particularly its high magazine capacity and faster <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> compared to bolt-action rifles. After some modifications, SOCOM adopted the SR-25 as the Mk 11 Mod 0 in May 2000. Changes included a shorter 20 in barrel that could fire M118 and M118LR 7.62×51mm NATO rounds and had a quick detachable sound suppressor mount. An 11.35 in free-floating handguard rail system allowed mounting accessories. Flip-up front sights and adjustable back-up iron sights were added, and an M16A2 stock and pistol grip were used.|$|E
50|$|The Kerrison Predictor {{was one of}} {{the first}} fully {{automated}} anti-aircraft fire-control systems. The predictor could aim a gun at an aircraft based on simple inputs like the observed speed and the angle to the target. Such devices had been used on ships for gunnery control for some time, and versions such as the Vickers Predictor were available for larger anti-aircraft guns intended to be used against high-altitude bombers, but the Kerrison's electromechanical analog computer was the first to be fast enough to be used in the demanding high-speed low-altitude role, which involved very short <b>engagement</b> <b>times</b> and high angular rates.|$|R
5000|$|The US Army faced {{a similar}} problem {{defending}} against attacks by high-speed jet-powered attack aircraft. In this case the local horizon was generally even more limited, blocked by trees and hills, and <b>engagement</b> <b>times</b> could be measured in seconds. They concluded that a gun-based system was simply unusable in this role; {{by the time the}} radar had locked-on and the gunsight calculated proper [...] "lead" [...] there would be no time to shoot at the target while it was within a gun's relatively short range. Missiles, on the other hand, could progressively tune their approach while they were flying toward the target, and their proximity fuses meant they only needed to get [...] "close enough".|$|R

Preliminary testing showed the upgrades reduced target <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> from six seconds to three by allowing the commander and gunner to work more closely and collaborate better on target acquisition.|$|E

5000|$|The key {{threat in}} modern naval combat is the {{airborne}} cruise missile, {{which can be}} delivered from surface, subsurface or airborne platforms. With missile speeds ranging up to Mach 4, <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> may be only seconds and such missiles can be designed to [...] "skim the sea" [...] mere metres above the sea surface. The key to successful defence was argued to be to destroy the launch platform before it fires, thus removing a number of missile threats at once. This is not always possible so the anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) resources need to be balanced between the outer and inner air battles. Missile tactics are now mostly fire and forget {{in the manner of}} the Harpoon or Exocet or utilize over-the-horizon targeting, such as the Tomahawk or Silkworm. Close-range missile defence in the modern age depends heavily on close-in weapon systems (CIWS) such as the Phalanx or Goalkeeper.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark XX {{mounting}} permitted {{an increased}} elevation to 50 degrees (compared to 40 for previous marks). However, this still limited the <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> against enemy aircraft, although medium calibre guns posed little threat to dive bombers {{prior to the}} use of radar proximity fuzed ammunition. The Imperial Japanese Navy had already introduced a 5-inch (127 mm) gun with 70-degree elevation into service which had very poor performance [...] as an anti-aircraft weapon, while the United States Navy's 5"/38 cal Mark 32 mount could elevate to 85 degrees. The 4.5-inch (114 mm) guns fitted to Ark Royal were already in service and capable of elevations of 80 degrees, although the mountings were not suitable for a destroyer-size ship. Coupled with the lack of powered elevation, the Mark XX mounting was compromised in its chosen anti-aircraft role, although it compared favourably with any similar weapon in the Axis inventory.|$|E
50|$|The gun is {{electrically}} stabilized on two axes by the EADS computer aided {{stabilization system}}. The new stabilization system improves {{the accuracy of}} the main gun and reduces the target <b>engagement</b> <b>time,</b> turret temperature, noise, fire hazard and maintenance. The turret has RKS roller bearings to ensure a better stabilisation of the A308 gun. The gunner's day sight telescopic periscope features an integrated laser rangefinder (200 m to 5.000 m measurement distance) and an electronic reticle. Above the gun barrel there is a SAGEM MATIS passive thermal viewer designed to operate at wavelengths between 3 and 5 μm in the spectral band. Initially, the TR-85 M1 tanks had an inferior SAGEM ALIS passive thermal viewer (8-12 μm in the spectral band) for the gunner, now present in export configurations. The driver has an AONP-I passive night sight, which is also the standard night vision device for the gunner on the older TR-85 tanks. The commander has a SFIM (Société Française des Instruments de Mesure) EC2−55R panoramic sight with a second generation SAGEM image intensification system that can be independently directed to the target.|$|E

50|$|Currently pilots, forward air controllers, and JTACs {{must focus}} on one target {{at a time and}} rely on voice {{directions}} and paper maps to call in air support. This can take up to one hour to be arranged and have an aircraft arrive on station, which allows a target to relocate or attack first. PCAS is to digitally link aircraft with ground controllers to share real-time situational awareness, identify multiple targets simultaneously, jointly select the best precision-guided weapons for the situation, and reduce <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> to as little as six minutes. Pilots and JTACs will have digital messaging capabilities networked through software programmable radio, which wirelessly transmits IP packets of voice, video, and data. By using Android tablets on the ground and in an aircraft's cockpit they can both view and exchange targeting information using icons, digital maps, and display screens; a JTAC can view a pilot's targeting pod picture in the air and permits a pilot to view target-grid coordinates and other displays from a JTAC's tablet on the ground. Using smart launcher electronics, consisting of a GPS/INS unit, weapons and engagement management systems, high-speed data transfer systems, software and radios, and an Ethernet switch, it integrates software programmable radio with a processor and tablet in the cockpit. Autonomous decision aids also use algorithms to recommend which weapon might be best suited to attack a given target.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{actually}} two engagement times {{to consider in}} an electromagnetic coupling. The first one is {{the time it takes}} for a coil to develop a magnetic field, strong enough to pull in an armature. Within this, there are two factors to consider. The first one is the amount of ampere turns in a coil, which will determine the strength of a magnetic field. The second one is air gap, which is the space between the armature and the coil shell or rotor. Magnetic lines of flux diminish quickly in the air. The further away the attractive piece is from the coil, the longer it will take for that piece to actually develop enough magnetic force to be attracted and pull in to overcome the air gap. For very high cycle applications, floating armatures can be used that rest lightly against the coil shell or rotor. In this case, the air gap is zero; but, more importantly the response time is very consistent since there is no air gap to overcome. Air gap is an important consideration especially with a fixed armature design because as the unit wears over many cycles of engagement the armature and the rotor will create a larger air gap which will change the <b>engagement</b> <b>time</b> of the clutch. In high cycle applications, where registration is important, even the difference of 10-15 milliseconds can make a difference, in registration of a machine. Even in a normal cycle application, this is important because a new machine that has accurate timing can eventually see a [...] "drift" [...] in its accuracy as the machine gets older.|$|E
