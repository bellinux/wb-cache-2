5|$|As a freshman, James {{averaged}} 21 {{points and}} 6 rebounds per {{game for the}} St. Vincent-St. Mary varsity basketball team. The Fighting Irish finished the year 27–0, winning the Division III state title. As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions. For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to <b>do</b> <b>either.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to <b>do</b> <b>either.</b> He instead moved to New Hampshire and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel de Rojas {{was still}} in Olancho, and was told by native {{informants}} of new Spanish arrivals in Trujillo. He sent a letter and gifts with messengers, who met Gonzalo de Sandoval, who was imposing Spanish control over Papayeca at that time, then proceeded onwards to Cortés at Trujillo. Cortés at first responded in a friendly manner to Rojas' overtures. Rojas' party was attempting to expand Hernández de Córdoba's Nicaraguan territory; upon meeting native resistance his men began pillaging the district and enslaving the inhabitants. Upon receiving complaints from native informants, Cortés dispatched Sandoval with ten cavalry to hand papers to Rojas, ordering {{him out of the}} territory, and to release any Indians and their goods that he had seized. Sandoval was under orders to either capture Rojas, or expel him from Honduras, but in the event was unable to <b>do</b> <b>either,</b> due to the intervention of other Spaniards present who tried to calm the situation. While the two groups were still gathered, Rojas received orders from Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to return to Nicaragua to assist him against his rebellious captains, while Sandoval returned to face Cortés' displeasure.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{plans were}} that Barlow and Chambers conceal the drugs by {{inserting}} some packages into their anuses and swallowing the rest. Barlow refused to <b>do</b> <b>either,</b> the former {{for reasons of}} distaste, the latter due to health concerns with that method. Chambers relented and placed the several packages of drugs, which were within plastic carry bags and wrapped in newspaper, into a newly purchased maroon suitcase. Barlow had become very nervous after {{the collection of the}} drugs.|$|E
25|$|To {{make things}} a little more interesting, each team, no matter what type of {{exchange}} they are doing, has to perform their exchange in the distance of two pits. The action of slowing {{is not part of}} the exchange, but the first rider is not allowed to begin getting off the bike until one pit ahead of their team's and the second rider must have complete control of the bike by the end of the team's pit. For bike-to-bike exchanges, the second person CANNOT move until tagged by the first person and the first person MUST stop before end of her team's pit. Failure to <b>do</b> <b>either</b> of these things will result in a penalty for the team.|$|E

25|$|Since the 2004–05 season, {{penalties}} {{have existed}} for clubs entering financial administration during the season. If a club enters administration before 31 March {{of any given}} season, they will immediately be deducted 12 points; entering administration from 1 April onward will see the points deduction either held over {{until the end of}} the season (if the club finishes outside the relegation places), or applied the following season (if the club was relegated anyway). It is also required that a club exiting administration agree a Creditor's Voluntary Agreement, and pay in full any other footballing creditors. Failure to <b>do</b> <b>either</b> of these will result in a second, potentially unlimited (though in practise usually between 15 and 20) points deduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling {{might be taken}} to mean fractal dimensions measure density, {{but that is not}} so; the two are not strictly correlated. Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity. These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might {{hope to be able to}} measure their length or slope, as with ordinary lines. But we cannot <b>do</b> <b>either</b> of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary lines lack. The self-similarity lies in the infinite scaling, and the detail in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is undefined because the curves are theoretical constructs that never stop repeating themselves. Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be characterized by finding their lengths or slopes. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.|$|E

This he should proceed to do.|$|E
500|$|In 1563, Elizabeth told an {{imperial}} envoy: [...] "If I follow the inclination of my nature, it is this: beggar-woman and single, far rather than queen and married". Later in the year, following Elizabeth's illness with smallpox, the succession question became a heated issue in Parliament. They urged the queen to marry or nominate an heir, {{to prevent a}} civil war upon her death. She refused to <b>do</b> <b>either.</b> In April she prorogued the Parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in 1566.

500|$|Synge's {{first account}} {{of life in}} the Aran Islands was {{published}} in the New Ireland Review in 1898 and his book, , based largely on journals, was completed in 1901 and published in 1907 with illustrations by Jack Butler Yeats. Synge considered the book [...] "my first serious piece of work". When Lady Gregory read the manuscript she advised Synge to remove any direct naming of places and to add more folk stories, but he refused to <b>do</b> <b>either</b> because he wanted to create something more realistic. The book expresses Synge's belief that beneath the Catholicism of the islanders it was possible to detect a substratum of the pagan beliefs of their ancestors. His experiences in the Aran Islands were to form the basis for the plays about Irish rural life that Synge went on to write.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{begins to}} oppose other {{examples}} of common thievery all around her, even convincing Marge to pay the cost on two grapes she sampled in a grocery store. Lisa later pays a visit to Reverend Lovejoy at church, where he suggests that Lisa cannot turn her father in to the police for the illegal hook-up, since she must continue to [...] "Honour Thy Father and Thy Mother", according to the Fifth Commandment. He instead encourages Lisa to not watch anything on Homer's cable hook-up, setting a good example that he hopes others will follow. Marge pleads with Homer to either cut the cable or pay for it, but he refuses to <b>do</b> <b>either,</b> saying that the cable will {{stay as long as}} he desires. Meanwhile, Bart sets up posters on the back door for his showing of a porn channel for 50 cents, but he is caught a few seconds later by Homer, who forbids him from doing it.|$|E
