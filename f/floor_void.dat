5000|$|The water leak {{detection}} industry {{is small and}} specialized {{with only a few}} manufacturers operating worldwide. The original application was in the void created by [...] "computer room" [...] floors in the days of large main-frame computer systems. These use a modular, raised floor based around a structural [...] "floor tile" [...] usually 600 mm square and supported at the corners by pedestals. The void created gave easy access and routing for the mass of power, networking and other interconnecting cables associated with larger computer systems - processors, drives, routers etc. mainframe computers also generated large amounts of heat so a void under the floor could also used as a plenum to distribute and diffuse chilled air around the computer room. The void therefore was likely to have chilled water pipes running through it along with the drains for condensates associated with refrigeration plant. In addition, designers found the <b>floor</b> <b>void</b> a very convenient place to route other wet services feeding bathrooms, radiators and other facilities.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A {{conventional}} urodynamic study (UDS) {{is considered}} invasive while uroflowmetry is considered inadequate {{in the evaluation}} of children with lower urinary tract dysfunction. The aims of this study were to identify the role of uroflowmetry with electromyography (UFEMG) in this group. Methods: A cohort of 121 children (age 5 – 12 years; M:F = 2 : 3) with symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction underwent a detailed voiding history and clinical assessment. Those with evidence of neurological abnormality, obstructive uropathy or active urinary tract infection were not included. They were prospectively studied using UFEMG first, followed by UDS on the same day. Results: A total of 76 (63 %) children had abnormality on UFEMG while only 12 (10 %) had abnormality on UDS. UFEMG was significantly superior in picking up abnormality (P = 0. 03). Three types of UFEMG abnormalities were identified: (1) dysfunctional voiding (prolonged staccato trace with active pelvic <b>floor</b> and normal <b>voided</b> volume: n = 42), (2) idiopathic detrusor overactivity (shortened trace with quiet pelvic <b>floor</b> and reduced <b>voided</b> volume: n = 16) and (3) detrusor underutilization disorder (prolonged flat trace with quiet pelvic <b>floor</b> and large <b>voided</b> volume: n = 18). Conclusions: UFEMG is ideal non-invasive test in children with lower urinary tract dysfunction. It helps in identifying the different patterns and the appropriate treatment modality...|$|R

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 10 million suspended timber ground floor constructions in the UK and millions more globally. However, {{it is unknown}} {{how many of these}} floors are insulated and their performance has not been widely investigated. This study investigates the impact of retrofitting insulation on the thermal performance of suspended timber ground floors through the detailed investigation of a UK case study dwelling. Practical and buildable interventions were undertaken: fully-filling the <b>floor</b> <b>void</b> with EPS beads, and 100 mm woodfibre insulation between the joists. The performance of both interventions was monitored by high-resolution in-situ heat-flow monitoring in 27 floor locations, allowing for comparison with the uninsulated floor and with modelled results. While floors often remain uninsulated due to the disruption of retrospective works, this study highlighted potentially significant heat loss reductions: the mean whole floor U-value dropped by 65 % for woodfibre insulation and 92 % for bead-insulation which also benefited from sealed airbricks. A disparity between the in-situ measured and modelled performance was observed; this gap reduced the better insulated the floor was. The findings have implications for policy, retrofit decision-making and carbon emission reduction stock models, especially given the modelled underestimation of floor heat loss, impact of interventions and assumed financial payback for this study...|$|E

5000|$|As of 2016 {{most of the}} {{hospital}} buildings on the Storthes Hall site {{have been reduced to}} rubble. Of the original buildings remaining, the former administration building is surrounded by fencing and barbed wire, whilst [...] "the Arboretum" [...] acts as the refectory and bar serving the student village and one of the blocks serves as the main entrance foyer and offices. The hospital's mortuary is still intact, as are several other smaller buildings. In 1998 the 46 wards and various non-residential blocks on the site were all still standing, and nearly all of these buildings were originally linked the site main boiler block via a system of interconnected subways and service ducts, through which various services including steam pipes for heating, electrical supplies and a main cold water main passed. The cold water main was fed from and underground reservoir which remains under a field at the top of Storthes Hall Lane, and a water treatment block remains on the south corner in the same area. The original borehole for the sites water supply is further up on Farnley Moor to the north of Greenside Road and is marked by a brick built square folly. Bore hole No.2 replaced this and this still remains at the lower part of Storthes Hall Road on the north side accessed by a track. Prior to demolition of the site the University of Huddersfield commissioned an asbestos survey which was carried out during 1991 / 1992. The asbestos survey was to the entire site and was carried out by Simon Farrar PCS Asbestos Consultants Limited as lead surveyor for Bradley Environmental Consultants Ltd. During the asbestos survey all buildings were inspected and photographs taken, which were probably the last visual record of the site prior to the programme of asbestos removal and then demolition {{of the majority of the}} structures. Asbestos lagging to pipes of up to 14 inch diameter fed steam and hot water from the main boiler room via the service tunnels and subways which then in turn fed heating the various blocks. Heating pipes ran mainly under the <b>floors</b> in <b>voids</b> to cast iron radiators and via rising ducts to the first floors where heating pipes were mainly surface mounted. Following closure of the site in 1991 the asbestos lagging quickly deteriorated once the steam had been turned off. The Acute Hospital Wards 1 to 10 at the lower part of the site were closed several years before and contamination spread within the ducts, subways and <b>floor</b> <b>voids</b> throughout the site. Asbestos removal works took 18 months with up to 50 operatives on site; the asbestos removal project was also managed through to completion by Simon Farrar. The asbestos removal works were carried out by LAR Ltd of Stockport.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{the setting}} of the European Bladder Dysfunction Study, a multi-center, randomized, {{controlled}} trial of treatment options for functional incontinence in children, we assessed the concordance between reported and reviewed urodynamic scores. Materials and Methods: A total of 97 children with clinically diagnosed urge syndrome and 105 with clinically diagnosed dysfunctional voiding enrolled in the European Bladder Dysfunction Study and underwent full urodynamic studies before and immediately after treatment for urinary incontinence. Photocopies of 72 % of the original urodynamic recordings were available for blinded review. Results: The concordance for detrusor overactivity throughout the filling phase was 37 % in urge syndrome cases and for increased pelvic <b>floor</b> activity during <b>voiding</b> it was 81 % in dysfunctional voiding cases. Differences in original and reviewed scores were equally distributed among participating centers. Conclusions: Concordance between original and reviewed urodynamic scores was low for detrusor overactivity.

Numerous pit craters have been discovered on the Moon and Mars and are potential entrances to caves; the principal topographic features of pit craters are their visible internal floors and pits with vertical walls. We have devised two topographical models for investigating the relationship between the topographical characteristics and the inner void of pit craters. One of our models is a concave <b>floor</b> <b>void</b> model and the other is a convex floor tube model. For each model, optical photographs have been obtained under conditions similar to those in which optical photographs have been acquired for craters on the Moon and Mars. Brightness profiles were analyzed for determining the profile patterns of the void pit craters. The profile patterns were compared to the brightness profiles of Martian pit craters, because no good-quality images of lunar pit craters were available. In future studies, the model profile patterns will be compared to those of lunar pit craters, and the proposed method will likely become useful for finding lunar caves and consequently for planning lunar bases for manned lunar expeditions...|$|E
40|$|Air insulation, {{especially}} its efficiency, is often underestimated and most {{often it is}} recommended as combination of several methods by our experts. It is known that flowing air used to eliminate excessive humidity in lower construction is insignificantly promoted. Already our ancestors in ancient Rome had experience with implementation of air insulations. However, nowadays such design is connected with many doubts and it forces us to use sense, especially knowledge of construction physics. So it urges higher technical precision when designing functional ventilation system. Each building is actually a unique object, with regard to its position and used properties, that is why certain natural conditions must be accepted when designing. It is more complicated and figuratively speaking it can be written in c. 20 equations of twenty unknowns. Other problems arise in unknown coefficients to individual parameters and their effects. From another point of view it {{is the issue of}} changing air during the day, passing fronts, annual cycles and all of these in relation to internal environment of the building, materials used in the construction, land properties of rocks, and last but not least, relation to the terrain around the building. Then there are the effects of the building's altitudes etc. In total they are cycles with sine character of dampening and drying. The thesis discusses how to test the functionality of AIR insulations designed for the floor ventilation in historic buildings and follows on from the previously published articles. A flow analysis is being performed on an object of the city of Žirovnice which has been registered in the list of cultural monuments and was built as a brewery in the years 1589 - 1592 on the site of an older medieval building.

Thermal mass {{can be used in}} buildings to reduce the need for and dependence on mechanical heating and cooling systems whilst maintaining environmental comfort. Active thermal mass strategies further enhance the performance of thermal mass through integration with the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. For the design of new buildings to include active thermal mass strategies, experience from operational projects and design guidelines are normally used by engineers. However, dynamic thermal modelling is required in most cases to accurately determine the performance of its integration with the environmental systems of the building. Design decisions made in the preliminary stages of the design of a building often determine its final thermal characteristics. At this stage, reasons for not integrating active thermal mass strategies include the lack of knowledge about the performance of previous buildings and the time and resources required to carry out detailed modelling. In this research project a commercially available dynamic building thermal program has been used to construct models for active thermal mass strategies and compare the results with monitored temperatures in buildings incorporating the strategies in the UK. Four active thermal mass strategies are considered (a) hollow core slabs (HCS), (b) <b>floor</b> <b>void</b> with mass, (FVWM) (c) earth-to-air heat exchanger (ETAHE) and (d) thermal labyrinth (TL). The operational strategies and monitoring are presented and their modelling is described in terms of geometrical configuration and input parameters. The modelling results are compared with the measured parameters successfully. Using the calibrated model, an excel based tool (TMAir) was then developed that can be used at the concept design stages of a typical office building to determine the benefits of integrating an active thermal mass strategy. Key design parameters were identified for each system. These parameters can be split into two categories; fixed parameters and user selected parameters. The fixed parameters are pre-selected for the design tool and have to be a fair representation of the projects that the tool will be used for. The user selected parameters are chosen by the user to represent the way the building will be used, and to look at the effect of key design decisions on the performance of the building. The tool has an easy-to-use interface which allows direct comparison of the different active thermal mass strategies together with the effects of changing key design parameters. Results are presented in terms of thermal comfort and energy consumption. TMAir has then been used to carry out a series of parametric analyses. These have concluded the following:  There is only a benefit in integrating a HCS strategy when night cooling is introduced  There is no benefit in integrating a FVWM strategy when only one parameter is improved  An ETAHE and TL strategy will always provide a benefit, although the benefits are greater when night cooling is introduced, solar and internal gains are reduced and when the air change rate is increased. When all of the parametric improvements are applied to the test room the results show that all of the active thermal mass strategies can provide a reduction in annual overheating hours when compared to the Standard Strategy. Only a small benefit is found for the FVWM Strategy, however around a 25 % reduction is found for the HCS Strategy, over a 50 % reduction for the TL Strategy and nearly a 75 % reduction for the ETAHE Strategy. This demonstrates the importance of applying a low energy, passive approach when considering the application of active thermal mass strategies. The key results have shown that when comfort cooling is provided, adding a HCS or FVWM strategy always results in an increase in the annual cooling load. This is {{as a result of the}} temperature of the air being supplied into the cores or <b>floor</b> <b>void</b> being higher than that of the internal surface temperatures of the cores or void. This results in the supply air being heated, and less cooling provided to the test room per cooling energy delivered. Due to the pre cooling effect of the ETAHE and TL strategies, these strategies always result in a reduction in the annual cooling load. The key results have shown that the annual heating load is reduced by a small amount for the HCS and FVWM strategies unless the solar gains or internal gains are reduced, whereas the ETAHE and TL strategies always result in a around a 10 % reduction in annual heating load as a result of the preheating effect these strategies have on the supply air.

40|$|Abstract. Assembly-box {{concrete}} {{hollow floor}} {{is a new}} kind of cellular <b>voided</b> <b>floor</b> structure, in which a lot of prefabricated box-shaped interior forms are placed regularly on the formwork before the floor concrete is cast. The new type of box-shaped filler is termed assembly-box and could behave as load-bearing elements. Such floor system has many advantages, such as low self-weight, good mechanical behavior, equally flexural stiffness in two directions and high voided rate. The characteristic of this floor structure is the combination of precast assembly-box and cast-in orthogonal grids of ribs. For the purpose of understanding the behavior of this floor, a test has been carried out with three scale specimens under vertical loading. All experimental values provide essentially the same result that a typical flexural failure occurred under ultimate load and the structural system of assembly-box hollow could behave like an overall cast-in hollow floor. A part of the top plate in assembly-box could be viewed as the flange of rib beam during the process of structural design...|$|R

In neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to Multiple Sclerosis, many authors have suggested the possible use of pelvic floor rehabilitation as a treatment modality. Therefore, we designed an open prospective trial to look at the possible role of pelvic <b>floor</b> rehabilitation in <b>voiding</b> dysfunction due to MS, concentrating upon the clinical and neurological parameters in relation to the outcome. A new scoring system for pelvic floor dysfunction is introduced. Thirty female patients were evaluated. In 25, the strength of the pelvic floor was significantly improved after one month (p < 0. 001). In all patients but one the endurance score improved significantly (p < 0. 001) as did the exhaustibility score (p = 0. 01). The relaxation score on the other hand did not show any significant evolution despite intensive training. Cystometric findings after one month did not significantly differ from the initial cystometric findings. There was {{a significant increase in the}} mean functional bladder capacity as read from the voiding charts from 173. 8 cc +/- 53. 9 cc to 208. 5 cc +/- 57. 6 cc (p = 0. 005).
