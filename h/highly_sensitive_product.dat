In the food and pharmaceutical packaging industries, barrier films, which contain a single inorganic layer on top of a polymeric substrate, provide sufficient barrier. For the protection of more <b>sensitive</b> <b>products,</b> such as vacuum insulation panels, organic photovoltaic cells, or organic light emitting diodes, the barrier films are, however, not sufficient and multilayered structures of alternating inorganic and polymeric layers are required as encapsulation material to ensure sufficient product lifetime. One approach for the production of multilayered structures is the face-to-face lamination of two barrier films via lamination adhesives. Such multilayered structures are usually referred to as multilayered high-barrier laminates. Solvent-free, UV-curable, epoxy-based adhesives are promising candidates for multilayered high-barrier laminates. The adhesives best suited for multilayered high-barrier laminates are those that provide both high laminate bond strength as well as barrier performance. In this paper three different types of such adhesives are discussed in terms of their water vapor barrier and adhesion performance. The effects of the structural differences in the adhesives - chain mobility, crosslink density and surface energy - on the laminate bond strength and barrier performance are investigated. Laminate bond strength tests were performed and failure types and failure locations in the laminates were examined. The results suggest that the intrinsic barrier performance of the adhesive significantly affects the barrier performance of the laminate. On the other hand, the adhesive having the best barrier performance shows a weak adhesion performance. An appropriate adhesive was designed by adjusting the type of the flexibilizer and photoinitiator used in its formulation. This adhesive in combination with a barrier film having an enhanced surface energy shows {{at the same time a}} promising laminate bond strength as well as barrier performance...|$|R
40|$|Most {{analyses}} of the macroeconomic adjustment required to correct global imbalances ignore net exports of new varieties {{of goods and services}} and do not account for firms' entry in the product market. In this paper we revisit the macroeconomics of trade adjustment {{in the context of the}} classic 'transfer problem,' using a model where the set of exportables, importables and nontraded goods is endogenous. We show that exchange rate movements associated with adjustment are dramatically lower when the above features are accounted for, relative to traditional macromodels. We also find that, for reasonable parameterizations, consumption and employment (hence welfare) are not <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to <b>product</b> differentiation, and change little regardless of whether adjustment occurs through movements in relative prices or quantities. This result warns against interpreting the size of real depreciation associated with trade rebalancing as an index of macroeconomic distress. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} Korea Chile FTA {{focusing}} on the market access of goods and tries to draw policy implications for Korea's future FTA policy. Moreover, it analyzes problems involving the FTA negotiations with Chile and Korea's domestic ratification process, and suggests overall policy implications for Korea's FTA initiatives and appropriate future directions for each FTA now under consideration. Korea and Chile agreed to eliminate tariffs over all the industries including agriculture and tariffs on almost all the <b>products,</b> except some <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>products,</b> will be phased down to zero eventually. In consideration of reality of Korea's agriculture, rice, apples and pears {{were excluded from the}} tariff elimination list in order to minimize damages. On the other hand, tariffs on passenger and commercial vehicles and computers, which took up 67 % of Korea's total export to Chile, are eliminated immediately. Korea has experienced many trials and errors in the process of promoting the first Korea Chile FTA. It is because Korea had no experiences regarding FTAs at all and the severe protests of less competitive industries made it worse. The examples of problems in the process of the Korea Chile FTA are that parties supporting the FTA did not expand enough and that too much cost was paid to persuade the opposing farmers. Moreover, there were few coordinating activities on the political side for lack of strong leadership, even though the negotiations were in a stalemate for a long time. The policy directions that this paper suggests are first to make a plan for structural reforms of industries including agriculture and then to provide some measures and rational standards for supporting industries that are damaged due to FTAs. In addition, the FTA promotion system including related procedures is to be reinforced and consideration and implementation of ways to boost FTA supporting parties are required. At last, this paper emphasizes that the Korean government should arouse sympathy among the public for market opening, suggest its firm objectives and plans for trade liberalization, and provide realistic and concrete measures for promoting FTAs...|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} {{products}} in western consumer markets today are imported, increasingly from developing countries. Yet, as distances to suppliers increase, monitoring and tracing product and process qualities along global supply chains {{back to the}} source have become increasingly challenging tasks for companies at the downstream end of the chain. Particularly importers risk legal sanctions or negative media coverage in case products are non-compliant with local requirements. The problem of uncertainty becomes even more urgent as highly specific quality designations come into play. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute to this discussion by providing an improved understanding of how formal and informal institutions – analysed in particular through a Convention Theory (CT) lens - are employed by importers of <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> in mitigating uncertainties in cross-border relations with their suppliers. This is achieved through a comparative empirical case study of firms importing certified organic food into Germany and Australia. Article 1 in this collection, "'Sustainable Standards'? How Organic Standards in the EU and Australia Affect Local and Global Agrifood Production and Value Chains", contributes to literature on food and environmental standards and discusses the impact of (supra-) national organic standards effective in Germany and Australia on different actors along the value chain. Article 2, "Reassessing Supplier Reputation in International Trade Coordination. A German and Australian perspective of Global Organic Food Networks", deals with the multiple facets of reputation in international trade relations {{and how it can}} help to mitigate uncertainties across large distances. Article 3, "Conventions in Cross-Border Trade Coordination. The Case of Organic Food Imports to Germany and Australia", provides a comprehensive discussion of which conventions within the CT framework are employed by Australian and German importers to overcome quality-related uncertainties in cross-border trade. The final Article 4, "Australien als 'Global Food Superpower'? Landwirtschaft und Lebensmittelsektor Australiens im Wandel" (Global food superpower? Changes and current challenges in Australia's food industry), looks at Australia as a case of the changing global character of agricultural and food production and trade, using a value chain perspective to outline these processes. Furthermore, it discusses how the unique Australian environmental situation, related natural risks, and political as well as structural factors currently question Australia's future as the next Global Food Superpower. Overall, the empirical results affirm that formal institutions such as standards and third-party certification have gained increasing significance over the past two decades. Simultaneously, however, this study argues that these are not enough to overcome uncertainties in trade. Informal institutions like trust, reputation, values related to social and environmental welfare as well as business mentality and culture are likewise approaches that are employed. It is further shown that standards do not necessarily lead to reduced differences in product quality perceptions between suppliers and importers. Also, there seem to be changes in the interpretation of the organic designation, as particularly newer firms reduce the process standard more and more to product quality characteristics. At the same time, 'dedicated' companies with intensive holistic supplier relation management, unlike some decades ago, are not restricted to those that focus only on organic products. Conceptually, it is concluded that CT is a useful complementary approach to other frameworks for value chain and production network analyses, particularly due to its strengths to paint a differentiated picture of uncertainty as well as quality designations...|$|R

However, the original 3 -DE method has not been optimized and its specificity has not been demonstrated. The main goal {{of this study was}} to optimize the 3 -DE procedure and then compare it with 2 -DE. We developed a <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> 3 -DE method in which M-proteins are extracted from a first-dimension agarose gel, by diffusing into 150 mM NaCl, and the recovery of M-proteins was 90. 6 %. To validate the utility of the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> 3 -DE, we compared it with the original 3 -DE method. We found that <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> 3 -DE provided for greater M-protein recovery and was more effective in terms of detecting spots on SDS–PAGE gels than the original 3 -DE. Moreover, <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> 3 -DE separates residual normal IgG from M-proteins, which could not be done by 2 -DE. Applying the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> 3 -DE to clinical samples, we found that the characteristics of M-proteins vary tremendously between individuals. We believe that our <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> 3 -DE method described here will prove useful in further studies of the heterogeneity of M-proteins...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{vertebrate}} embryogenesis, the somites form by segmentation of {{the trunk}} mesoderm, lateral to the neural tube, in an anterior to posterior direction. Analysis of differential gene expression during somitogenesis has been problematic due to the limited amount of tissue available from early mouse embryos. To circumvent these problems, we developed a modified differential display PCR technique that is <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> and yields <b>products</b> {{that can be used}} directly as in situ hybridisation probes. Using this technique, we isolated NLRR- 1 as a gene expressed in the myotome of developing somites but not in the presomitic mesoderm. Detailed expression analysis showed that this gene was expressed in the skeletal muscle precursors of the myotome, branchial arches and limbs {{as well as in the}} developing nervous system. Somitic expression occurs in the earliest myoblasts that originate from the dorsal lip in a pattern reminiscent of the muscle determination gene Myf 5, but not at the ventral lip, indicating that NLRR- 1 is expressed in a subset of myotome cells. The NLRR genes comprise a three-gene family encoding glycosylated transmembrane proteins with external leucine-rich repeats, a fibronectin domain, an immunoglobulin domain and short intracellular tails capable of mediating protein–protein interaction. Analysis of NLRR- 3 expression revealed regulated expression in the neural system in developing ganglia and motor neurons. NLRR- 2 expression appears to be predominately confined to the adult. The regulated embryonic expression and cellular location of these proteins suggest important roles during mouse development in the control of cell adhesion, movement or signalling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{have shown}} that supply chain costs are a {{significant}} proportion of total programme costs. Nevertheless, the costs of delivering specific products are poorly understood and ballpark estimates are often used to inadequately plan for the budgetary implications of supply chain expenses. The purpose of this research was to estimate the country level costs of the public sector supply chain for artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) from the central to the peripheral levels in Benin and Kenya. Methods A micro-costing approach was used and primary data on the various cost components of the supply chain was collected at the central, intermediate, and facility levels between September and November 2013. Information sources included central warehouse databases, health facility records, transport schedules, and expenditure reports. Data from document reviews and semi-structured interviews were used to identify cost inputs and estimate actual costs. Sampling was purposive to isolate key variables of interest. Survey guides were developed and administered electronically. Data were extracted into Microsoft Excel®, and the supply chain cost per unit of ACT and RDT distributed by function and level of system was calculated. Results In Benin, supply chain costs added USD 0. 2011 to the initial acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0. 3375 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). In Kenya, they added USD 0. 2443 to the acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0. 1895 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). Total supply chain costs accounted for more than 30 % of the initial acquisition cost of the products in some cases and these costs were <b>highly</b> <b>sensitive</b> to <b>product</b> volumes. The major cost drivers were found to be labour, transport, and utilities with health facilities carrying the majority of the cost per unit of product. Conclusions Accurate cost estimates are needed to ensure adequate resources are available for supply chain activities. Product volumes should be considered when costing supply chain functions rather than dollar value. Further work is needed to develop extrapolative costing models that can be applied at country level without extensive micro-costing exercises.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how EU trade flows and production values {{are affected by}} introducing special treatment for developed countries’ <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> into a potential DDA agreement. In particular, it explores how the EU’s decisions regarding {{the size of the}} tariff cut (1 / 3, ½ or 2 / 3 of the cut according to the tiered formula of the Revised Draft Modalities (WTO, 2008 a)) and the corresponding size of TRQ expansion affect its levels of protection for individual products, as well as its own GDP and that of other countries and regions. It is assumed that the EU’s management of its <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> regime is motivated by the objective of maintaining farm incomes and production values, rather than that of minimising import access per se. A novelty of the paper is that it explores the extent to which optimal decisions by the EU depend on similar decisions taken by other developed countries, and aims to identify dominant strategies that are independent of other countries’ choice of market access parameters for their <b>sensitive</b> <b>products.</b> The simulation tool used to analyse thirteen scenarios, with a time horizon of 2020, is the global Computable General Equilibrium model GLOBE. The model incorporates various important developments in CGE trade modelling from the last 15 years (e. g. inclusion of preferential agreements, bilateral and multilateral TRQ, split of quota rents, flexible closure rules, etc.), and is calibrated with data from the Global Trade Analysis Project’s (GTAP) database version 7. 1. Our results indicate that the chosen combination of tariff cut and TRQ expansion for <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> matters, and the lowest tariff cuts for <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> may not necessary lead to the smallest decrease in agricultural production. Moreover, the interdependencies between the <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> choices of developed countries are considerable. Insofar as the decisions of other developed countries affect EU exports for both <b>sensitive</b> and non-sensitive <b>products,</b> the net impact of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>product</b> regime on EU farm production and income depends partly on decisions beyond the control of EU decision makers. The extent to which EU management decisions relating to <b>sensitive</b> <b>products</b> matter for the impact of a DDA agreement on third countries’ GDP is also examined. JRC.
