5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for movement of deposited snow: drifting of unsintered snow, avalanches of accumulated snow on steep slopes, snowmelt during thaw conditions, {{and the movement}} of glaciers after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into <b>glacier</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{studies have}} {{established}} that the lake has long had a permanent ice cover. Further, studies carried out during the austral summer confirm the lake's homogeneous characteristics, with thermal convection as the reason given for its hydro-geochemical and isotropical nature. It is replenished perennially by a process of underwater melting of the adjacent <b>glacier</b> <b>ice.</b> It is also stated that the lake existed during the Holocene period when it emerged from a melt-water pond.|$|E
5|$|Pine Island Glacier (PIG) {{is a large}} ice stream, and {{the fastest}} melting glacier in Antarctica, {{responsible}} for about 25% of Antarctica's ice loss. The <b>glacier</b> <b>ice</b> streams flow west-northwest along {{the south side of}} the Hudson Mountains into Pine Island Bay, Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy (USN) air photos, 1960–66, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in association with Pine Island Bay.|$|E
40|$|The term {{cryosphere}} is used {{to refer}} to all portions of the Earth surface where water appears in solid form.

5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support <b>glacier</b> <b>ice</b> from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

Some also {{go up to the}} glacier to spend the night. They cut blocks of <b>glacier</b> <b>ice</b> and carry them on their backs to their people at the festival in the valley. When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind. It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In Quechua mythology, ukukus are the offspring of a woman and a bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E
25|$|Glacial ice has a {{distinctive}} blue tint because it absorbs some red light {{due to an}} overtone of the infrared OH stretching mode of the water molecule. Liquid water is blue for the same reason. The blue of <b>glacier</b> <b>ice</b> is sometimes misattributed to Rayleigh scattering due to bubbles in the ice.|$|E

25|$|Frozen {{water is}} {{found on the}} Earth’s surface {{primarily}} as snow cover, freshwater ice in lakes and rivers, sea <b>ice,</b> <b>glaciers,</b> <b>ice</b> sheets, and frozen ground and permafrost (permanently frozen ground). The residence time of water {{in each of these}} cryospheric sub-systems varies widely. Snow cover and freshwater ice are essentially seasonal, and most sea ice, except for ice in the central Arctic, lasts only a few years if it is not seasonal. A given water particle in <b>glaciers,</b> <b>ice</b> sheets, or ground ice, however, may remain frozen for 10-100,000 years or longer, and deep ice in parts of East Antarctica may have an age approaching 1 million years.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{feedback}} processes {{may also}} potentially occur, as land ice melts and causes eustatic sea level rise, and also potentially induces earthquakes {{as a result}} of isostatic rebound, which further acts to disrupt <b>glaciers,</b> <b>ice</b> shelves, etc.|$|R
25|$|Villarrica, {{with its}} lava of basaltic-andesitic composition, {{is one of}} only five volcanoes {{worldwide}} known to have an active lava lake within its crater. The volcano usually generates strombolian eruptions, with ejection of incandescent pyroclasts and lava flows. Melting of snow and <b>glacier</b> <b>ice,</b> as well as rainfall, often causes massive lahars, such as during the eruptions of 1964 and 1971.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} glaciers, snow repeatedly freezes and thaws, changing into granular ice called firn. Under {{the pressure}} of the layers of ice and snow above it, this granular ice fuses into denser and denser firn. Over a period of years, layers of firn undergo further compaction and become glacial ice. <b>Glacier</b> <b>ice</b> is slightly less dense than ice formed from frozen water because it contains tiny trapped air bubbles.|$|E
25|$|A glacial lake {{outburst}} flood (GLOF) {{is a type}} of outburst flood {{that occurs}} when the dam containing a glacial lake fails. An event similar to a GLOF, where a body of water contained by a glacier melts or overflows the glacier, is called a Jökulhlaup. The dam can consist of <b>glacier</b> <b>ice</b> or a terminal moraine. Failure can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an avalanche of rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice, or if a large enough portion of a glacier breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base.|$|E
50|$|In {{geography}} and geology, fluvial processes {{are associated with}} rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with <b>glaciers,</b> <b>ice</b> sheets, or ice caps, the term glaciofluvial or fluvioglacial is used.|$|R

50|$|Warming {{temperatures}} lead to {{the melting}} of <b>glaciers</b> and <b>ice</b> sheets. IPCC (2007a:5) found that, on average, mountain glaciers and snow cover had decreased in both {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. This widespread decrease in <b>glaciers</b> and <b>ice</b> caps has contributed to observed sea level rise.|$|R
25|$|While glacier {{variations}} {{are likely}} to have minimal effects upon global climate, their recession may have contributed one third to one half of the observed 20th Century rise in sea level (Meier 1984; IPCC 1996). Furthermore, it is extremely likely that such extensive glacier recession as is currently observed in the Western Cordillera of North America, where runoff from glacierized basins is used for irrigation and hydropower, involves significant hydrological and ecosystem impacts. Effective water-resource planning and impact mitigation in such areas depends upon developing a sophisticated knowledge of the status of <b>glacier</b> <b>ice</b> and the mechanisms that cause it to change. Furthermore, a clear understanding of the mechanisms at work is crucial to interpreting the global-change signals that are contained in the time series of glacier mass balance records.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{an impact}} crater at the {{discovery}} site was only explained after the 1920's, with the new understanding about the Missoula Floods, {{one of the largest}} floods documented, caused by the collapse of an ice barrier during the last deglaciation. The meteorite presumably landed on an ice cap in what is now Montana or western Canada, and was transported as a glacial erratic (dragged by the <b>glacier</b> <b>ice)</b> to the vicinity of an ice barrier that formed across the Clark Fork River. This barrier had ponded a huge amount of water at the Lake Missoula right at the time when the meteorite reached the area and the ice barrier became unstable and breached. The resulting flood involved up to 10 million cubic meters per second of water discharge, with large blocks of ice rafting down the Columbia River and the Willamette Valley {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). Some of these ice rafts included boulders (named erratics by geologists) like the Willamette meteorite, which eventually sunk in the flood waters and settled where they were found by humans.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Antarctic Division {{conducted}} {{an expedition to}} Heard Island during the austral summer of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on avian and terrestrial biology and glaciology. Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, {{in an effort to}} determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable echo sounder, the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of Foehn winds on glacier mass balance. Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of <b>glacier</b> <b>ice</b> on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat GPS surface surveys revealed that the rate of loss of ice in both the ablation zone and the accumulation zone of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of ice loss suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching dynamic equilibrium. The retreat of Heard Island's glaciers is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E

500|$|After deposition, snow {{progresses}} {{on one of}} two {{paths that}} determine its fate, either ablation (mostly by melting) or transitioning from firn (multi-year snow) into <b>glacier</b> <b>ice.</b> During this transition, snow [...] "is a highly porous, sintered material {{made up of a}} continuous ice structure and a continuously connected pore space, forming together the snow microstructure". Almost always near its melting temperature, a snowpack is continually transforming these properties in a process, known as metamorphism, wherein all three phases of water may coexist, including liquid water partially filling the pore space. Starting as a powdery deposition, snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight, be blown by the wind, sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and refreezing. Water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals, known as hoar frost, during cold, still conditions.|$|E

Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, arêtes, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains. Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40–60 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.|$|E
