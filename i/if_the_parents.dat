5|$|The nest {{is usually}} a {{depression}} in the ground, {{which may or may}} not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E
5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E

5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> {{supposed}} to {{pay child support}} doesn't pay (or doesn't pay in time), the child may receive [...] "underhållsstöd" [...] from Försäkringskassan. This includes <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> pays less than 1273 SEK per month and doesn't provide equivalent support some other way. <b>The</b> <b>parent</b> not living with the child should repay the amount paid as far as his/her income allows this, and {{may have to pay}} interest on the debt to Försäkringskassan.|$|R
25|$|All {{children}} of a family have to receive the same non-hyphenated Nachname at birth, which may be either the mother's or the father's Nachname (traditionally it was the father's). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> adopted an Ehename this is the Nachname of the child. It is strictly forbidden to give children Doppelnamen {{if it is not}} the Ehename. The latter case can arise with traditional aristocratic Doppelnamen (e.g. Faber-Castell).|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the birth}} or {{adoption}} of a first child, married parents may choose by which surname the child will go (mother's or father's but not both). If no choice is made, the child automatically obtains the father's surname. Any further children will also go by this name. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of the child are not married, the children will automatically obtain their mother's name unless otherwise indicated.|$|E
25|$|Children become {{citizens}} through {{birth in}} Benin or birth {{to parents who}} are citizens of Benin. Many people's births have not been recorded, which can result in denial of education, health care, and other services. Primary school is compulsory, though many girls {{do not go to}} school. Child marriage is widespread, although marriage by children under 14 is technically illegal, with marriage of those between 14 and 17 permitted <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> give their consent.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>parent</b> {{is trying}} to {{maximize}} its number of grandchildren, while the offspring {{is trying to}} maximize the number of its own offspring equivalents (via offspring and nieces and nephews) it produces. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> cannot manipulate <b>the</b> offspring and therefore loses in the conflict, the grandparents with the fewest grandchildren seem to be selected for. In other words, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> has no influence on the offspring's behavior, grandparents with fewer grandchildren increase in frequency in the population.|$|R

25|$|Any {{children}} – whenever born – {{within a}} mixed marriage, {{as well as}} children from extramarital mixed relationships born until July 31, 1936, were discriminated against as Mischlinge. However, children later born to mixed parents, not yet married at passing the Nuremberg Laws, were to be discriminated against as Geltungsjuden, regardless <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> had meanwhile married abroad or remained unmarried. Any children who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation were also subject to discrimination as Geltungsjuden.|$|E
25|$|Malay and English are {{compulsory}} {{subjects in}} all schools. All schools {{use the same}} syllabus for non-language subjects regardless of the medium of instruction. The teaching of the Chinese language is compulsory in SJK(C), and Tamil language is compulsory in SJK(T). Additionally, a National School must provide the teaching of Chinese or Tamil language, as well as indigenous languages wherever practical, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of at least 15 pupils in the school request that the particular language to be taught.|$|E
25|$|Some newborns have a fine, downy body hair called lanugo. It may be {{particularly}} noticeable on the back, shoulders, forehead, ears and face of premature infants. Lanugo disappears within a few weeks. Infants may be born with full heads of hair; others, particularly caucasian infants, may have very fine hair or may even be bald. Amongst fair-skinned parents, this fine hair may be blonde, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> are not. The scalp may also be temporarily bruised or swollen, especially in hairless newborns, and {{the area around the}} eyes may be puffy.|$|E
50|$|To {{apply the}} law of concern to {{concerns}} involving German limited liability companies, the German courts have created the qualified de facto concern, beginning in the 1970s. This form of concern applies only in <b>parent</b> subsidiary relationships. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> is shown to have a long-standing and pervasive control over {{the affairs of the}} subsidiary, then there is a presumption that <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> was not acting {{in the best interests of}} <b>the</b> subsidiary. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> is unable to displace this presumption, then <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> is liable for all the obligations of the subsidiary.|$|R

25|$|All {{citizens}} of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen {{at the age of}} sixteen by the child's parents. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia, who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians. Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force. Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not. With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic antagonisms developed over the years.|$|E
25|$|However, gender {{equality}} law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, {{subject to the}} condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the Registro Civil (civil registry), {{but there have been}} legal exceptions. From 2013, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of a child were unable to agree on order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the default being the paternal name. Since June 2017, the paternal name in first order stopped being the default, and parents are required to sign an agreement where the name order is expressed explicitly. The law also grants a person the option, upon reaching adulthood, of reversing the order of their surnames. The law applies only to Spanish citizens; people of other nationalities get the surname indicated by the law in their original country.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{experience}} of economic instability throughout the 1990s, and {{the implementation of a}} free travel agreement with the EU, a great number of Romanians emigrated to Western Europe and North America, with particularly large communities in Italy and Spain. In 2008, the Romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over twomillion people. The cyclical nature of the world economy and economic disparities between Romania and advanced European economies has fueled further emigration from the country. The emigration has caused social changes in Romania, whereby the parents would leave for Western Europe to escape poverty and provide a better standard of living for their children, who have been left behind. Some children are left {{to be taken care of}} by grandparents and relatives; and some live alone, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> deem them to be reasonably self-sufficient. Subsequently, the youth began to be called Euro-orphans.|$|E

50|$|A common {{example of}} this is when a parent gets older and has {{previously}} lived alone. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent's</b> children are to be caregivers, then they may move in with <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> or have <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> move in with them.|$|R
25|$|In July 2008, {{local governments}} in the Sichuan Province coordinated a {{campaign}} to silence angry parents whose children died during the earthquake through monetary contracts. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> refused, officials threatened that they would receive nothing. Although Chinese officials have advocated a policy of openness in time before the Olympic Games, the pressure on parents to sign demonstrates that officials are determined to create an appearance of public harmony rather than investigate into the corruption or negligence {{of the construction of}} schools. The payment amounts vary by school but are roughly the same. In Hanwang, parents were offered a package valued at 8,800 USD in cash and a per-parent pension of nearly 5,600 USD. Many parents said they signed the contract, even if no real investigation ensues. Furthermore, officials have continued to use traditional methods of silencing: riot police officers have broken up protests by parents; the authorities have set up cordons around the schools; and officials have ordered the Chinese news media to stop reporting on school collapses.|$|E
25|$|Holý's field {{experience}} among the Berti people of Pakistan {{allowed him to}} undertake an extensive study of cousin marriage in their culture. Holý believed {{that many of his}} findings could generalize to other Middle Eastern groups. He noted that stated reasons for cousin marriage could be both pragmatic and symbolic. Stated pragmatic reasons for cousin marriage might be stated in terms of advantages for the husband such as warmer relations with his father-in-law, quicker entertainment of the husband's family by the wife {{in the case of a}} visit due to them being her relations, greater loyalty and devotion of the wife, and the ease of regaining a wife after a serious quarrel where she has withdrawn to the house of her own family. Stated pragmatic reasons for the parents included gaining access to the labor of a daughter's children by marrying her to a kinsman and thereby keeping her family close by, increased attentiveness on the part of a wife to her aging in-laws if she is related to them, and the ease of marital negotiations <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> are brothers, or in the next best case, if the mother of one child is the sister of the father of the other child.|$|E

The inside diameter of the finished nest is about [...] The rim is reinforced with bark bound by spiderwebs and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail.

500|$|Much {{more than}} earlier periods, the Tang era was renowned {{for the time}} {{reserved}} for leisure activity, especially {{for those in the}} upper classes. Many outdoor sports and activities were enjoyed during the Tang, including archery, hunting, horse polo, cuju football, cockfighting, and even tug of war. Government officials were granted vacations during their tenure in office. Officials were granted 30 days off every three years to visit their parents if they lived [...] away, or 15 days off <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> lived more than [...] away (travel time not included). Officials were granted nine days of vacation time for weddings of a son or daughter, and either five, three, or one days/day off for the nuptials of close relatives (travel time not included). Officials also received a total of three days off for their son's capping initiation rite into manhood, and one day off for the ceremony of initiation rite of a close relative's son.|$|E
500|$|The villagers would {{afterward}} {{return to}} the house of the widow, pull off her lamba and jewelery, uncomb her hair (a sign of mourning), dress her in an old lamba, require her to eat only using a broken spoon and plate they provided, and cover her in a rotting mat which she was forbidden to remove until nightfall. She was required to maintain this mourning state for at least eight months, during which time she was forbidden to wash or speak to others during daylight hours. [...] After this period she could abandon the mourning ritual and was considered [...] "divorced" [...] (i.e. free to remarry and visit her own parents and family members, previously forbidden); however, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of her deceased husband were still living, only they could declare her divorced, and she was indefinitely required to remain unmarried and forbidden from visiting family if this status was not granted by them. [...] This practice of declaring divorce, without the mourning ritual, was also applied in the event of separation from a living spouse.|$|E
500|$|When parents {{divorce and}} the {{children}} are in the picture, many problems will arise during the difficult process of determining custody. [...] For instance, {{if there is an}} argument regarding joint legal custody, the process to earn legal custody will take longer than anticipated and will ultimately impact the relationship of the parents {{and the children}}. [...] It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds, which, in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody. [...] Another criticism of having a joint legal custody arrangement {{is that it is a}} frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child's life (regardless of what the decree of joint legal custody states), which generally leads to conflict. Additionally, in a joint legal custody arrangement, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of the children do not get along, this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that needs to be made about their children, which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved, but also for the parents.|$|E
50|$|The {{transaction}} is logically smooth but unpredictable <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> guesses that <b>the</b> {{child will}} be returned, but a dilemma arises for <b>the</b> crocodile <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> guesses that <b>the</b> child will not be returned.

However, in the case that the crocodile decides to give back the child, he still violates his terms, even if this decision is based on the previous result: <b>the</b> <b>parent's</b> prediction has been falsified, and the child should not be returned. The question of what the crocodile should do is therefore paradoxical, and there is no justifiable solution.|$|R
