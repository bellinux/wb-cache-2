40|$|Objectives. We {{assessed}} {{associations between}} new-onset (post–September 11, 2001 [9 / 11]) lower respiratory symptoms reported on 2 surveys, administered 3 years apart, and acute and chronic 9 / 11 -related exposures among New York City World Trade Center–area residents and workers {{enrolled in the}} World Trade Center Health Registry. Methods. World Trade Center–area residents and workers were categorized as case participants or control participants {{on the basis of}} lower respiratory symptoms reported in surveys administered 2 to 3 and 5 to 6 years after 9 / 11. We created composite <b>exposure</b> <b>scales</b> after principal components analyses of detailed exposure histories obtained during face-to-face interviews.

Both acute and chronic exposures to the events of 9 / 11 were independently associated, often in a dose-dependent manner, with lower respiratory symptoms among individuals who lived and worked {{in the area of the}} World Trade Center. Conclusions. Study findings argue for detailed assessments of exposure during and after events in the future from which potentially toxic materials may be released and for rapid interventions to minimize exposures and screen for potential adverse health effects...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of color}} shifts, color film usually does {{not lend itself}} to {{variations}} in development time. Use of the Zone System with color film {{is similar to that}} with black-and-white roll film, except that the exposure range is somewhat less, so that there are fewer zones between black and white. The <b>exposure</b> <b>scale</b> of color reversal film is less than that of color negative film, and the procedure for exposure usually is different, favoring highlights rather than shadows; the shadow values then fall where they will. Whatever the exposure range, the meter indication results in a Zone V placement. Adams (1981, 95 - 97) described the application to color film, both negative and reversal.|$|E
50|$|The {{focusing}} screen of the Canon EF cannot {{be replaced by}} the user. Early models feature a microprism circle, the later a split image screen with a microprism ring around it. Typical of the era, all viewfinder information is provided by mechanical arrangements, which are projected into the viewfinder by optics inside the camera housing. The range of selectable shutter speeds are always visible {{at the bottom of the}} viewfinder, with a fork outlining the currently selected speed. To the right is a scale with the aperture setting, where a needle points at the aperture the camera's exposure meter selects, and also automatically sets, provided the FD lens or FD new lens is set to the green A symbol (or green on older lenses). The largest opening the used lens is capable of is always properly shown, by shifting the whole scale up or down. The range goes from 1.2 to 5.6, in order to suit lenses from the Canon FD 55 mm 1:1.2 ASPHERICAL S.S.C. to the Canon FD 300 mm 1:5.6 S.C. The smallest aperture is not adjusted for. The camera always displays apertures up to f/22, but with a red line down to f/16, to remind the user that some lenses, like the Canon FD 50 mm 1:1.4 S.S.C. has its smallest aperture at f/16, while some, like the Canon FD 135 mm 1:2.5 S.C. can stop down to f/22.Later, when the Canon FD new lenses became available, the camera couldn't properly represent the new smallest aperture, like f/32. You had to estimate along the scale.The <b>exposure</b> <b>scale</b> also has a stopped down metering mark, where the needle should be aligned when using stopped down metering. Due to corrections taken for proper exposure with full sperture metering, stopped down metering with larger apertures than f/2.8 was not reliable.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{the past}} three winters over 4000 km 2 of {{avalanche}} terrain in five mountain ranges in western Canada was zoned with the Avalanche Terrain <b>Exposure</b> <b>Scale</b> (Statham et al., 2006) at the basin-scale (100 m to 1 km). Because the current ATES system isn’t intended for this more deterministic application there are shortfalls with respect to subjectivity of terrain parameters {{and the lack of}} a non-avalanche terrain class. Although some digital terrain analysis was used to draw the initial ATES polygons, the methods relied primarily on the judgment of qualified field workers. This paper describes an approach and methodology for ATES zoning, and explores ideas for a more deterministic model including classification for non-avalanche terrain...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical methodology based on spectroradiometric measures is proposed to test if the reciprocity law is verified in digital photography. Taking {{into account that}} the spectral exposure H(λ) {{is proportional to the}} spectral radiance L e(λ) of the object and the photosite integration time t of the electronic shutter time and inversely proportional to the f-number N of the zoom-lens, this radiometric law declares that identical values of spectral exposure yield identical responses even if the fnumber N and/or the exposure time t change. Historically, the photochemical materials present some deviations to this law, {{but it is not clear}} if this law holds for the image sensors of digital cameras. The test is based on the new concept of the opto-electronic spectral function (OECSF), that is, the empirical relationship between the normalized digital output level of the camera and the spectral exposure obtained by a monochromator set-up. The transition curve that fits the OECSFs in the color channels for our digital image capture device is the sigmoid function with four parameters. Varying exclusively the f-number N, the OECSFs in some irradiance <b>scale</b> <b>exposure</b> series (L e(λ) and N free, t fixed) overlap in any color channel. The same occurs with time <b>scale</b> <b>exposure</b> series (L e(λ) and t free, N fixed) or mixed <b>scale</b> <b>exposure</b> series (L e(λ), N and t free).

5000|$|Starting 1954, the {{so-called}} <b>Exposure</b> Value <b>Scale</b> (EVS), originally known as Light Value Scale (LVS), {{was adopted by}} Rollei, Hasselblad, Voigtländer, Braun, Kodak, Seikosha, Aires, Konica, Olympus, Ricoh and others, introducing lenses with coupled shutters and apertures, such that, after setting the exposure value, adjusting either the shutter speed or aperture made a corresponding adjustment in the other to maintain a constant exposure. On some models, the coupling of shutter speed and aperture setting was optional, so that photographers could choose their preferred method of working depending on the situation.

40|$|Mavoglurant (MVG) is an {{antagonist}} at the metabotropic glutamate receptor- 5 {{currently under}} clinical development at Novartis Pharma AG {{for the treatment}} of central nervous system diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and optimise a population whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (WBPBPK) model for MVG, to predict the impact of drug–drug interaction (DDI) and age on its pharmacokinetics. In a first step, the model was fitted to intravenous (IV) data from a clinical study in adults using a Bayesian approach. In a second step, the optimised model was used together with a mechanistic absorption model for exploratory Monte Carlo simulations. The ability of the model to predict MVG pharmacokinetics when orally co-administered with ketoconazole in adults or administered alone in 3 – 11  year-old children was evaluated using data from three other clinical studies. The population model provided a good description of both the median trend and variability in MVG plasma pharmacokinetics following IV administration in adults. The Bayesian approach offered a continuous flow of information from pre-clinical to clinical studies. Prediction of the DDI with ketoconazole was consistent with the results of a non-compartmental analysis of the clinical data (threefold increase in systemic <b>exposure).</b> <b>Scaling</b> of the WBPBPK model allowed reasonable extrapolation of MVG pharmacokinetics from adults to children.

40|$|Exposure {{therapy is}} underutilized in the {{treatment}} of pathological anxiety and is often delivered in a suboptimal manner. Negative beliefs about exposure appear common among therapists and may pose a barrier to its dissemination.

The TBES demonstrated a clear single-factor structure, excellent internal consistency (αs. =. 90 -. 96), and exceptionally high six-month test-retest reliability (r=. 89). Negative beliefs about exposure therapy were associated with therapist demographic characteristics, negative reactions to a series of exposure therapy case vignettes, and the cautious delivery of exposure therapy {{in the treatment}} of a hypothetical client with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Modern communications make the experience of being away from home very different from the past, and it is likely that today’s migrants may be able to avoid many of the transformative experiences earlier migrants could not avoid.

Relocation can be and is used in other ways to avoid transformative action, eg remittances that allow people to remain in areas even when local livelihoods have collapsed.
