5000|$|An <b>extractor</b> <b>hood</b> {{consists}} of three main components: a skirt or capture panel to contain the rising gases (also known as the [...] "effluent plume"), one or more grease filters, and a fan or tangential blower for forced ventilation.|$|E
50|$|The {{device is}} known as an <b>extractor</b> <b>hood</b> in the UK, as a range hood in the United States, and as a rangehood in Australia. It is also called a kitchen, stove, exhaust, cooker, vent, or {{ventilation}} hood. Other names include cooking canopy, extractor fan, fume extractor, and electric chimney.|$|E
50|$|Exhaust hoods {{almost always}} include {{built-in}} lighting {{to illuminate the}} cooking surface. In addition, some manufacturers offer matching accessories, such as backsplash panels, pot racks, shelf units, or dish racks. The main advantage of an <b>extractor</b> <b>hood</b> {{is that it can}} easily filter the airflow, without harming the edible materials and can be easily installed if it is semi-automatic.|$|E
5000|$|Gas stove (British English) - uses natural gas, propane, butane, {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} or other flammable gas as a fuel source. Most modern stoves come in a unit with built-in <b>extractor</b> <b>hoods.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{farmhouse}} {{kitchen is}} an architectural {{term for a}} kitchen room designed for food preparation, dining and a sociable space. Typical of poorer farmhouses throughout the Middle Ages where rooms were limited, wealthier households would separate the smoke of the kitchen from the dining and entertaining areas. Farmhouse kitchens were also known as smoke kitchens before <b>Extractor</b> <b>hoods.</b> <b>Extractor</b> <b>hoods</b> and modern stoves have allowed the reintroduction of farmhouse kitchen to architecture {{it is now the}} most popular kitchen design with various island set ups used for dining and storage. [...] Household kitchen design often assumes that the functionality of the room includes cooking, dining and socialising [...] but the term 'kitchen' includes rooms dedicated to cooking.|$|R
50|$|Kitchen {{ventilation}} is {{the branch}} of ventilation that specialises {{in the treatment of}} air from kitchens. Kitchen ventilation presents the problems of grease, smoke and odours not usually found in other ventilation systems.Equipment used in kitchen ventilation uses an <b>extractor</b> <b>hood</b> or canopy and a filtering system. The fan for the ventilation system may be located within the kitchen or in the duct system nearby.|$|E
50|$|An exhaust hood, <b>extractor</b> <b>hood,</b> or {{range hood}} is a device {{containing}} a mechanical fan that hangs above the stove or cooktop in the kitchen. It removes airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, odors, heat, and steam {{from the air}} by evacuation {{of the air and}} filtration. In commercial kitchens exhaust hoods are often used in combination with fire suppression devices so that fumes from a grease fire are properly vented and the fire is put out quickly. Commercial vent hoods may also be combined with a fresh air fan that draws in exterior air, circulating it with the cooking fumes, which is then drawn out by the hood.|$|E
50|$|The Supercharged {{version of}} the S-281 was first {{introduced}} as an option for the New Edge Mustang in 1999 with a horsepower rating of 350 (261 kW). Designated as Saleen 281 CID SuperCharged, this designation was widely recognized as a separate model in 2000 with more options becoming available by Saleen. Notable internal differences of an S-281SC introduced a dual gauge instrument cluster above the dashboard, while the only external difference was a Saleen Heat <b>Extractor</b> <b>hood.</b> With {{the introduction of the}} Fifth-generation Ford Mustang, the supercharger was now installed in an upside-down configuration to provide better performance and a higher horsepower rating of 465 (347 kW).|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} stove {{or electric}} range is a stove with an integrated electrical heating device {{to cook and}} bake.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we propose a new, simple {{approach}} to small vocabulary word recognition. The methodology adopted is based on hybrid fuzzy learning. In particular, the application is based on the management of an <b>extractor</b> <b>hood</b> for a cooker by means of simple vocal messages. It therefore involves the recognition of isolated words from a limited vocabulary. Tests showed that the fuzzy system outputs follow a logic in line with the words uttered. The output of the matching block is a set of four values from four special fuzzy systems. Each fuzzy system is designed {{in such a way as}} to recognise a certain word (so there are four systems because there are four words to recognise). The degree of excitation of a system will measure the degree of recognition of the word. Experimental tests showed the validity of the new approach...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{configurations}} of extractor hoods: ducted (or vented) application, and ductless (or recirculating) application. In a ducted application, the output collar of the <b>extractor</b> <b>hood's</b> blower motor {{is attached to a}} duct system, which terminates outside the building. In a ductless application, a filter, often containing activated charcoal, removes odor and smoke particles from the air before releasing the cleaned air back into the kitchen.|$|R
50|$|Microwave ovens have {{a limited}} role in {{professional}} cooking, because the boiling-range temperatures produced in especially hydrous foods impede flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking. However, additional heat sources {{can be added to}} microwave ovens, or into combination microwave ovens, to produce these other heating effects, and microwave heating may cut the overall time needed to prepare such dishes. Some modern microwave ovens are part of over-the-range units with built-in <b>extractor</b> <b>hoods.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} two major purposes: (1) to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} introduction of energy labels on the consumers’ purchase decision when buying an <b>extractor</b> <b>hood</b> and (2) to identify which other criteria have an impact on this decision. The research is conducted with particular reference to Miele & Cie. KG with the aim of adjusting its product management in accordance with consumers’ demands. During the last years the European Union has revised the energy labels for domestic appliances which had been introduced in 1992 and has established additional labels concerning a wider range of goods. Since 01 January 2015 this energy label is also mandatory for extractor hoods. Thus Miele & Cie. KG - as a manufacturer of hoods - is highly interested in doing research on the development of consumers’ preferences regarding the purchase of an <b>extractor</b> <b>hood.</b> In a first step the thesis provides an overview of its purpose and background before establishing the basis for the research in a second step. This includes basic principles of market research as well as the characteristics of the market for hoods and the concept of energy labels. In the following the thesis describes the product area of hoods and the implementation of the regulations concerning the energy label at Miele & Cie KG. A detailed central section explains the research which has been conducted {{in the context of this}} thesis. The empirical part of this study draws on a research carried out in Germany in November and December 2014. Data for this research were collected among twenty consumers and six dealers selling household appliances from Miele. The author of the thesis conducted face-to-face interviews on the basis of an interview guide which was developed beforehand. Finally the results of these interviews are presented, compared and summarized to enable the development of a recommended course of action for the product management of hoods at Miele & Cie. KG. The results of the research reveal that the most important purchase criteria regarding an <b>extractor</b> <b>hood</b> are an attractive visual appearance of the hood, the performance of the fan, the quality of the active charcoal and grease filters, the acoustic power level, a satisfactory lighting and a simple cleaning of the appliance. This study indicates that the energy label is of secondary importance regarding the purchase decision of a hood. The average energy consumption of a hood is relatively low in comparison to other household appliances. Therefore the energy saving potential for consumers is limited in this area. As a consequence the performance of a hood is a lot more important to consumers than its energy efficiency expressed by the label. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that the necessary modifications in the product development by virtue of the establishment of energy labels for hoods are quite small. Taken as a whole, the objectives of the product development of hoods at Miele & Cie. KG correspond to the consumers’ demands...|$|E

5000|$|Gas stoves {{became less}} {{unwieldy}} when the oven was {{integrated into the}} base and the size was reduced to fit in better {{with the rest of}} the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light. This had the disadvantage of a continual consumption of gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match, and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, automatic timers for the oven and <b>extractor</b> <b>hoods</b> to remove fumes.|$|R
