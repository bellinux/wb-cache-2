It is a bold step, which was long overdue but it has brought tremendous responsibility on the teachers. There is no acceptable model of <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> in our country or abroad. Each institution, in fact each department within an institution, is following its own method. Even the MCI has stopped short of provid-ing any operational recommendations on the issue, in effect transferring the onus to the teachers concerned.

40|$|BACKGROUND Students of {{professional}} courses have to undergo <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> before taking up their Final University examinations, This <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> {{will make them}} to read subjects before appearing the University Examinations which will create confidence in their mind and time to improve their performance. It is part of curriculum in all the subjects. Every year, three or four <b>internal</b> <b>assessments</b> will be conducted in all the subjects and marks {{will be sent to}} the university. So this study is a comparative study in two colleges in two different subjects. In both subjects, students have shown improvement in their performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS <b>Internal</b> <b>Assessments</b> of First year M. B. B. S. Students were conducted both at ESIC Medical College and PGIMSR, Rajajinager, Bangalore in the Department of Biochemistry & at Sree Mookambika Institute of Medicine, Kulasekharam- 629101, Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu in the Department of Anatomy. Observations were made on their performance. Three internals were conducted. Even practicals and viva voce were conducted & marks were entered in 3 columns namely, Theory, Practicals and Viva voce. OBSERVATIONS It was observed that many students did fairly well in the <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> and these <b>internal</b> <b>assessments</b> made them to score very good marks in university examination. It was <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> examination that made them to cover the entire syllabus and created a self-confidence in their minds. Assessment was done in the class room to the portion what has been covered in the class. So it {{plays an important role in}} the progress and enables them to expose their skills. So <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> will be of paramount importance for the students. CONCLUSION <b>Internal</b> <b>assessment</b> is a boon to the students of Medicine which creates a great confidence in their minds before taking university examinations. ...|$|R
50|$|In June 2014 NZQA {{released}} a press {{statement saying that}} nearly 25% of the 2013 <b>internal</b> <b>assessments</b> were incorrectly marked.

In some schools nearly all the credits gained are from <b>internal</b> <b>assessments.</b> Physical Education, Religious Education and Level 3 Visual Art are completely assessed internally. Additionally, lower decile schools tend to both use <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> more and have larger gaps between internal and external achievement rates when compared to higher decile schools. NZQA said this was more mistakes than usual as new standards had been introduced during the ongoing realignment and teachers had not yet adjusted their marking.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{contribution}} from R. McGuire to discussion on <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> {{was an interesting}} one and did raise {{a number of important}} issues on the nature of <b>internal</b> <b>assessment,</b> especially as operating within Queensland and especially as relating to the teaching of English. There were many wideranging statements within the article from McGuire, and it does seem that these statements do warrant some response. The following discussion, therefore, attempts to respond to the arguments raised within the McGuire article, on the nature of <b>internal</b> <b>assessment,</b> and also {{on the nature of the}} teaching of English. McGuire commences the article with reference to previous discussion, and summarizes this as characterized by incorrect assumptions and misleading generalisations. Unfortunately, this is not supported in subsequent argumentation from McGuire, and thus it is difficult to respond to this in any detail. McGuire also commences by challenging the characterization of current <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> in Queensland as one with an emphasis on skills-based assessment, rather than norms-based assessment. However, this is precisely the characterization used in the official departmental introduction to current <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> in Queensland. It is one intended as characterization only, certainly not a detailed taxonomy of educational objectives. The initial problem within <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> was that of practicality and here the McGuire article suggests the utilization of a specific designated period of assessment. However. the very nature of exit assessment still demands a...|$|R

The ECAMP assessment is typically performed {{by a team of}} experts from the installation`s Major Command (MAJCOM) Headquarters, and is often augmented with technical contractor support. As directed by Air Force policy, an external ECAMP assessment is required at a minimum of every three years for each installation. In the intervening years, each installation is required to perform an <b>internal</b> ECAMP <b>assessment,</b> with its own personnel and resources. Even though team composition differs, the internal and external ECAMP assessments are likely to be very similar in scope, objectives, and deliverables.
