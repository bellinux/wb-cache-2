5|$|<b>Folk</b> <b>music</b> is {{sometimes}} divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system of three regions, southern, central and northern, proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated.

5|$|In {{the history}} of popular music, there are a {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming <b>folk</b> <b>music</b> into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and <b>folk</b> <b>music</b> was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of <b>folk</b> <b>music</b> that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it.|$|E
