5|$|By contrast, {{when the}} 63rd Street Subway opened, {{there were fewer}} service changes. The B and Q trains and the JFK Express were {{extended}} from 57th Street/Sixth Avenue in Manhattan to 21st Street–Queensbridge in Queens; the JFK Express would be eliminated {{less than six months}} later in 1990. The 2001 opening of the 63rd Street Connection resulted in more major service changes in the subway system, such as the reroute of the B and Q train away from the 63rd Street tunnel, the introduction of F express service between Queens Boulevard and the tunnel, the truncation of G service to Court Square during weekdays, and the creation of the V train to cover the portions of the IND Queens Boulevard Line that were formerly served by the <b>F</b> <b>and</b> <b>G</b> trains.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the North Korean 7th Division troops {{committed}} all {{of their}} effort into attacking the US 35th Infantry line. At 23:30 on August 31, a North Korean SU-76 self-propelled high-velocity gun from across the Nam fired shells into the position of G Company, 35th Infantry, overlooking the river. Within a few minutes, North Korean artillery was attacking all front-line rifle companies of the regiment from the Namji-ri bridge west. Under cover of this fire a reinforced regiment of the NK 7th Division crossed the Nam River and attacked <b>F</b> <b>and</b> <b>G</b> Companies, 35th Infantry. Other North Korean soldiers crossed the Nam on an underwater bridge {{in front of the}} paddy ground north of Komam-ni and near the boundary between the 2nd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins, Jr., holding the river front and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard G. Teeter's 1st Battalion holding the hill line that stretched from the Nam River to Sibidang-san and the Chinju-Masan highway. The 35th Infantry, facing shortages of equipment and reinforcements, was under-equipped but nonetheless prepared for an attack.|$|E
5|$|SR94 is an east–west freeway {{that begins}} at {{the eastern end of}} the one-way couplet of <b>F</b> <b>and</b> <b>G</b> streets in {{southeast}} San Diego. The freeway continues through an interchange with I-5 just east of downtown. Following this, the route goes through the neighborhoods of Sherman Heights, Grant Hill, Stockton, and Mount Hope, where there is an interchange with SR 15. Shortly thereafter, SR94 intersects I-805 in Chollas View before continuing east through Emerald Hills and Chollas Creek into the city of Lemon Grove. Passing by the Marketplace at the Grove Mall, the freeway forms the boundary between Lemon Grove to the south and La Mesa to the north, up to the SR 125 interchange where SR 94 turns east. At this point, SR94 leaves both cities and enters unincorporated Spring Valley and Casa de Oro.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy {{a series of}} electron shells (numbered shell 1, shell 2, and so on). Each shell consists {{of one or more}} subshells (named s, p, d, <b>f</b> <b>and</b> <b>g).</b> As atomic number increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the Madelung rule or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The {{electron configuration}} for neon, for example, is 1s2 2s2 2p6. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell—two in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by hydrogen and the alkali metals.|$|E
