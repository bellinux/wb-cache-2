40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with architectural and design practitioners involved in areas outside of their training: specifically, with the way designers embrace a <b>do-it-yourself</b> or <b>DIY</b> ethic to create experimental, ephemeral, collaborative environments not usually considered “architecture” in the professional sense. This happens because they become directly involved {{with a variety of}} methods, construction activities, project types and materials normally associated with amateur building. The thesis does not aim to contribute to more comprehensive solutions for architectural production (say, commercial practice), but rather focuses on a particular production opportunity. It attempts to draw forth qualities of process, practice and conceptualisation that are of relevance to architecture and could be the basis of future exploration in architecture.

5000|$|A popular way {{to resist}} the {{commoditization}} of craft is through the <b>Do-It-Yourself</b> or <b>DIY</b> movement. Popularized through [...] "zines" [...] of the 1990s, DIY inspires people to be self-sufficient and to rely less {{on the market for}} basic necessities that can easily be created on one's own. DIY is a resistance to both the capitalist nature of the fashion industry and pressures to conform and buy a style. An example of this is the Counterfeit Crochet Project, which seeks to [...] "debase and defile designer items one step at a time". Crafters have also subverted the market through the use of open source patterns and information sharing on the internet. Sites like Burdastyle allow crafters to upload and download sewing projects at no charge. Similarly, Cat Mazza's online software KnitPro allows users to download images into detailed knitting patterns at no charge.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} <b>DIY</b> (<b>do-it-yourself)</b> pervasive services that enable non-experts to establish pervasive computing environments for everyday life. The aim of this concept is that non-expert users can prepare the essential hardware and software for pervasive services, assemble them at appropriate positions, and use them practically. As the first approach, this concept has been implemented in the u-Texture II, which is a self-organizable panel created beforehand as a smart building block. The assembled u-Texture IIs create various pervasive computing environments and each environment provides suitable pervasive services without experts. ...|$|R

To achieve this, Bourriaud imports the language of the 1990s internet boom, using terminology such as user-friendliness, interactivity and <b>DIY</b> (<b>do-it-yourself).</b> In his 2002 book Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World, Bourriaud describes Relational Aesthetics as works that take as their point of departure the changing mental space opened by the internet.|$|R
