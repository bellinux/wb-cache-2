5|$|Near {{the end of}} 1974, Taylor {{began to}} lose patience. The band's {{situation}} made normal functioning complicated, with band members living in different countries, and legal barriers restricting where they could tour. In addition, drug use was starting to affect Richards' productivity, and Taylor <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> of his own creative contributions were going unrecognised. At the end of 1974, with a recording session already booked in Munich to record another album, Taylor quit the Rolling Stones.|$|E
5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually be asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever <b>felt).</b> <b>Some</b> patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Charles Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, and he also <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> dialogue was out of place.

50|$|Dyck {{was trained}} to crochet in the Salish style by a weaver in Prince Albert, Manitoba. After accidentally <b>felting</b> <b>some</b> of her woven work, she began to design felt sculptures, such as Close Knit ((1975‑1981)), Skirt Issue (1981) and Forest (1975‑1981), as well as sculptures that {{combined}} felt art with found objects, such as 23 Suitcases (1981).|$|R

5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes {{to have a sense of}} grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} fourth {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers in 2014, only the fourth Dodger ever to do so. This season the game was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia. Before his second start, Kershaw <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> pain in his back and {{was placed on the}} disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. He did not rejoin the Dodgers until early May. On June 18, he pitched a complete game no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies and struck out a career-high 15 batters. The only batter to reach base was due to an error in the top of the seventh inning, costing Kershaw a perfect game. He is one of two pitchers in MLB history, along with Max Scherzer, with 15 strikeouts in a game while allowing no hits and no walks. Kershaw was 6-0 with an 0.82 ERA in June and was awarded his third career Pitcher of the Month award. He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his fourth straight selection. He was the sixth Dodger pitcher, and the first since Fernando Valenzuela to make the All-Star team four years in a row.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including that backgrounds were pixilated, the movies and audio were of poor quality, and he also <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a remastered edition, {{in which they could}} add a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could offer as an interactive digital comic. On December 9, 2010, Revolution Software announced the release of Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered on Apple iOS devices, and was finally released on December 16, 2010. The new features include an exclusive interactive digital comic from Dave Gibbons, fully animated facial expressions, enhanced graphics, high quality music, a context-sensitive hint system, diary, and a Dropbox integration which facilitates a unique cross-platform save-game feature, enabling players to enjoy the same adventure simultaneously on multiple devices. It also featured full Game Center integration – including in-game achievements. The Mac and PC versions followed in early 2011.|$|E

This, adding to the recent death of Guan Yu, made Liu Bei grieve until he fell sick.|$|E

25|$|Maeno's suicide flight {{inspired}} {{a variety of}} reactions in Japan. According to an Associated Press article, many Japanese <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> sympathy with Maeno's actions because of the shame associated with the Lockheed scandal.

25|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1940 fall of France, French authorities in Tunisia supported the Vichy regime, which continued {{to govern the}} southern provinces of France after its capitulation to German forces. Many Tunisians had <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> satisfaction at France's defeat. In July, 1942, Moncef Bey acceded to the Husaynid throne. Immediately he took a nationalist position, asserting Tunisian rights against the new Resident General appointed by Vichy. He toured the country, dispensing with beylical protocol. Soon becoming very popular as the new voice of Tunisians, Moncef Bey had assumed {{the place of the}} leadership of the Destour and Neo-Destour parties, which remained effectively suppressed by the French.|$|E
25|$|Crisólogo and Legasto {{began the}} novena, {{and on the}} third and fourth day, Legasto {{reported}} that she experienced a very strange feeling. This sensation, she said, was as though something heavy was moving from {{the top of her head}} down through her body before leaving her. Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a benign tumor. She reported that she still <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E

25|$|Innes {{encouraged}} the Cape Colony {{to fund the}} British navy, and, unlike Merriman and Sauer, refused to support the 1898 vote of no-confidence in Gordon Sprigg's government – partly because he had wanted the government's redistribution bill to pass, but also because he <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> loyalty to Sprigg and his supporters, with whom he retained a measure of influence. And Innes never became fully pro-Boer; he was critical of President Kruger's illiberal Uitlander policy and firmly believed, even after the Jameson Raid, that South Africa's best hope was Union within the Empire. When Sprigg was re-elected as Prime Minister in June 1900, succeeding Schreiner, Innes was happy to accept appointment again as Attorney-General, the only non-Progressive in Sprigg's Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Heydrich {{had five}} children. His oldest, Peter Thomas Heydrich (1931–2000), was a {{well-known}} German cabaret singer, {{and wrote a}} book about his childhood, father, and uncle. In the book, Peter Heydrich describes how, as a youth, he enjoyed the fame of being a “crown prince,” the nephew of Reinhard Heydrich. During boyhood, he thought of his uncle as a successful sportsman and a sensitive musician. In Prague, Peter observed that his uncle had become a “high animal.” Peter derived many privileges from being Reinhard Heydrich’s nephew. Even after the war, Peter still <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> pride in the familial relationship, if not so openly. But finally, Peter Heydrich had to admit that Reinhard Heydrich was a protean schemer, who planned and executed the Holocaust and other crimes. Peter died on 22 November 2000, after a long illness.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{given the}} factions and jealousies {{that arise in}} any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the {{greatest}} monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, {{the greater part of}} the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives, mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, {{it is not possible to}} know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.|$|E

25|$|On April 2, 2016, the Lightning {{announced}} that Stamkos {{was diagnosed with}} thoracic outlet syndrome, {{which is the same}} injury that sidelined teammate Andrei Vasilevskiy {{at the start of the}} season. It is a condition that is rare among hockey players. Stamkos said that he first <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> discomfort in his arm after the game against the Montreal Canadiens. He is scheduled for surgery on Monday with Dr. Karl Illig, who performed Vasilevskiy's surgery. Lightning General Manager, Steve Yzerman, stated that there will be no long-term impact on Stamkos' health or his career. In addition, Yzerman indicated that Stamkos recovery time would be between one and three months, but they would have a better idea in a couple of weeks where he falls within that time frame. Yzerman also stated that the team's desire is for Stamkos to remain with the organization, which came after a question of whether Stamkos had played his last game in a Lightning uniform. On April 4, 2016, Stamkos had successful surgery at Tampa General Hospital. Stamkos' surgeon stated that they plan on evaluating him in approximately two weeks and that should clear up his prognosis. On May 26, 2016, Stamkos dressed for game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins despite still being on blood thinners following surgery. He registered five shot attempts during the game, but the Lightning ultimately lost 2-1 and were eliminated from the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} critic and Bruce Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, [...] "We Are the World" [...] was not widely {{accepted}} within the rock music community. The author {{revealed that the}} song was [...] "despised" [...] {{for what it was}} not: [...] "a rock record, a critique of the political policies that created the famine, a way of finding out how and why famines occur, an all-inclusive representation of the entire worldwide spectrum of post-Presley popular music". Marsh revealed that he <b>felt</b> <b>some</b> of the criticisms were right, while others were silly. He claimed that despite the sentimentality of the song, [...] "We Are the World" [...] was a large-scale pop event with serious political overtones.|$|E

Chase Magnett of Comics Bulletin described the ending as [...] "an anti-climax with no big showdown, revelations, or death", but went on to say that the [...] "sense of disappointment is exactly why it's great".
