Renwick also adapted four episodes for BBC Radio 2, which first aired between 21 January 1995 and 11 February 1995. The episodes are [...] "Alive and Buried", [...] "In Luton Airport, No One Can Hear You Scream", [...] "Timeless Time" [...] and [...] "The Beast in the Cage".

500|$|Conversion of Space Hulk into a {{video game}} was {{initiated}} in 1991 by video game company Electronics Arts, who also managed the project's development. [...] Instead of following Gremlin's approach and creating exact copies of the board games in digital form, Electronic Arts and Games Workshop opted to develop {{a video game}}, based on Space Hulk, with features that {{took advantage of the}} personal computer's technological advancements. [...] The interior walls of the space hulks were rendered by ray tracing, passing much of the graphical work to computers. [...] This method reduced the time needed to introduce new sets of walls into the game from two weeks to twelve hours. [...] Although <b>digital</b> <b>speech</b> was a relatively new technology at the time, the team made use of sound card technologies to produce alien screeches and roars that permeate the hulks, and warning cries from Marines under attack. [...] The game's opening tune, [...] "Get Out Of My Way", was recorded by British hard rock band D-Rok, with Brian May of Queen as guest guitarist. [...] Games Workshop helped Electronic Arts keep the game true to its Warhammer 40,000 roots by providing the writers with materials and answers on the fictional universe. [...] The development team created the tutorial missions, but adapted the other missions straight from the board game and the Deathwing Campaign expansion set.|$|E
