5|$|Though Ogbu's 1978 study's {{conclusion}} was widely discussed, a 2003 work also challenged its validity. In 2003, Karolyn Tyson, a sociologist, and William Darity, Jr., an economist, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, conducted an 18-month study at 11 North Carolina schools. The {{study concluded that}} white and black students have essentially the same attitudes about scholastic achievement; students in both groups want to succeed in school and show higher levels of self-esteem when they <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> school. They compared attitudes identified as acting white to the normal adolescent pains experienced in John Hughes' movies.|$|E
5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with {{a gathering of}} wealthy political allies. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert {{she did not want}} him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert is in love with him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand in a spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E

25|$|The {{pulp mill}} came {{off on a}} poor start, with declining pulp prices. Most of the pulp was {{exported}} and director Henry Melhuus therefore proposed that Saugbrugsforeningen establish a paper mill. He hoped to reduce the volatility in revenue and that the company would <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> poor times. This resulted in {{a plan for a}} paper mill with two paper machines with a combined capaicty of 10,000 tonnes, a new electrical pulp mill with an annual capacity of 12,000 tonnes, an expansion of the chemical pulp mill and an expansion of the power station. Total investments were NOK4 million.|$|E

25|$|Research on 'protective factors', {{which are}} {{characteristics}} of children or situations that particularly help {{children in the}} context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents). Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Pi Beta Phi began a {{partnership}} with a reading awareness program called Read Across America. Commenced by the National Education Association in early March 1998, Read Across America was created to stimulate reading motivation and awareness. It has been shown through extensive research {{that children who are}} more motivated to read in turn <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> school. A celebration of reading is head annually on March 2 in honor of the birthday of well-known and beloved children's book author, Dr. Seuss. Pi Beta Phi chapters across the country hold special literacy events and gatherings at their respective campuses that support and celebrate their partnership with Read Across America. Pi Beta Phi is also actively involved in and supports many other literacy programs such as First Book, Speed Read, Champions Are Readers, and Arrow In The Arctic, to name a few. Several philanthropic events and book drives are held at Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges across the country to help promote literacy and get kids excited about reading.|$|E
25|$|Mike Smith {{was called}} up as a {{makeshift}} opener against New Zealand in 1958, making 0 and 7 on debut {{on his home}} ground at Edgbaston in the First Test. In the Second Test at Lord's he took 230 minutes to make 47 in a match where England (269) beat New Zealand (47 and 74) by an innings on a poor wicket. In the Third Test at Headingley Smith made 3 and was dropped. Recalled as a top order batsman against India in 1959 he made his maiden Test century, exactly 100 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford followed by 98 in the Fifth Test at the Oval. He played his first full series in the West Indies in 1959–60, making 39 in the First Test, 108 in 350 minutes in England's 256 run victory in the Second Test, taking longer to reach three figures than the notorious stonewaller Ken Barrington. Thereafter his weakness against quality fast bowling was exposed by Wes Hall and Chester Watson with innings of 12, 0, 10, 0, 23 and 20, but he recovered with 96 in the second innings of the Fifth Test, adding 197 for the seventh wicket with the wicketkeeper Jim Parks. Against South Africa in 1960 he started well with 54 and 28 in the First Test and top-scoring with 99 in the Second Test, where England won by an innings on another poor wicket. This was followed by 0, 0 and 11 {{and the next year}} against Australia he was out for a duck in the First Test at Edgbaston when the part-time bowler Ken Mackay took 3 wickets in four balls and he was dropped {{for the rest of the}} summer. It was thought that Smith would <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> India and Pakistan on the MCC tour of 1961–62 and he made another 99 in the First Test against Pakistan, having come in at 21/2 and adding 192 with Ken Barrington. This stood him in good stead as he made three successive ducks against India before recovering with 73 when recalled for the Fifth Test. Despite his powerful run-making in the County Championship Smith's batting was classed as fragile and he was dropped from the England team for three years.|$|E

500|$|... "Original Song" [...] first {{aired on}} March 15, 2011, {{and is the}} sixteenth episode of the second season of the {{television}} series. The episode's plot revolves around McKinley High's glee club, New Directions, decides to prepare original songs for the Regionals competition. In order to <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> the competition, due to Rachel Berry (Lea Michele)'s assistance the group decided to sing original songs. [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] falls in line after Rachel performs her solo ballad [...] "Get It Right". In the performance the Glee club girls donned light-blue dresses tied with black ribbons, and black boots. The guys wore black dress shirts and slacks with black ties. During the performance, the group performs sectional and group choreography. Midway, it is received by a standing ovation led by Kurt (Chris Colfer). The performance ends with the club throwing slushie cups filled with confetti at the audience, alluding to the numerous slushie cups taken in the face by them earlier in the show.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't there and you have to dig in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they are not doing that. When you look at their two big players, Henry and Vieira, [...] must <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> future." [...] Arsenal ended the month in second, five points behind leaders Chelsea.|$|E

500|$|Whilst Lynette Porter {{thought that}} Gwen became a [...] "fallen woman" [...] through her affair with Owen, she {{observed}} that this made Gwen's role {{in relation to}} Jack in [...] "End of Days", analogous to that of Mary Magdalene to Jesus, reinforcing a prevalent biblical subtext. Gwen keeps a vigil at Jack's [...] "Torchwood tomb" [...] and like Magdalene is rewarded for her loyalty by being the first to lay eyes upon the risen saviour. Valerie Frankel surmised that [...] "Gwen's journey is one we all face [...] she discovers the dominant intuition within, and then embraces it within the darkest caves of her inner self". David Cornelius stated that Gwen's Torchwood adventures {{take her to the}} brink, and additionally show [...] "she's strong enough to pull herself back". Stephen James Walker also felt that Gwen is still a redeemable character because she recognises her own moral failings, as seen in [...] "Combat" [...] where she sits alone sobbing over pizza, before picking herself up and trying to <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> the future. On this track, Torchwood actor Kai Owen justified Gwen's treatment of Rhys in her darkest moments by arguing that Gwen's intentions always remained pure, no matter how badly she treated Rhys.|$|E

Males, however, tend to be superior in visual-spatial skills and mathematics, both of which may be important in engineering." [...] Deming wrote: There is significant scientific evidence that sex-based differences in spatial and mathematical abilities may be biological in origin. For example, male rats <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> mazes than females. I concede it is possible that those female rats performed poorly because they were distressed by the lack of proper role models, but somehow this seems implausible.|$|E
2500|$|It was Serling's {{decision}} {{to sell his}} share of the series back to the network that eventually allowed for a Twilight Zone revival. As an in-house production, CBS stood to earn more money producing The Twilight Zone than it could by purchasing a new series produced by an outside company. Even so, the network was slow to consider a revival, shooting down offers from the original production team of Rod Serling and Buck Houghton and later from American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Their hesitation stemmed from concerns familiar to the original series: The Twilight Zone had never been the breakaway hit CBS wanted, so they should not expect it to <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> a second run. [...] "We were looking at the success of the original series in syndication and the enormous popularity of the Steven Spielberg films," [...] said CBS program chief Harvey Shepard.
