40|$|The Kabanga deposit {{constitutes}} one of {{the most}} significant Ni sulfide discoveries of the last two decades (<b>indicated</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>resource</b> 23 Mt of ore at 2. 64 % Ni, inferred resource 28. 5 Mt at 2. 7 % Ni, November 2008). The sulfides are hosted by predominantly harzburgitic and orthopyroxenitic intrusions that crystallized from magnesian basaltic and picritic magmas. However, compared with other sulfide ores that segregated from such magmas (e. g., Jinchuan, Pechenga, Raglan), most Kabanga sulfides have low Ni (< 1 – 3 %), Cu (∼ 0. 1 – 0. 4 %), and PGE contents (≪ 1 ppm), high Ni/Cu (5 – 15), and low Ni/Co (10 – 15) and Pd/Ir (2 – 20). Sulfides with higher metal contents (up to ∼ 5 % Ni, 0. 8 % Cu, 10 ppm PGE) are found in only one unit from Kabanga North. The observed metal contents are consistent with segregation of magmatic sulfides from fertile to strongly metal-depleted magmas, at intermediate to very low mass ratios of silicate to sulfide liquid (R factors) of approximately 10 – 400. Sulfide saturation was triggered prior to final emplacement, by assimilation of up to 50 % of the total sulfur in the intrusions from sulfidebearing metasedimentary country rocks. Immiscible sulfide liquid was entrained by the magma and ultimately precipitated in dynamic magma conduits that formed tubular and sill-like mafic–ultramafic bodies characterized by abundant magmatic breccias, highly irregular layering, and frequent compositional reversals. The unusually large degree of crustal contamination and the low R factors render Kabanga an end-member in the spectrum of magmatic Ni sulfide ores...|$|E

In December 2005, Snowden Mining Industry Consultants completed a bankable feasibility study for Perkoa. Production was expected to be about 130,000 t/yr of concentrate at a grade of 53% zinc. Overall zinc recovery to concentrate was projected to be 93%, and contained zinc production, to average 68,000 t/yr; zinc concentrates would be transported by railway to the port of Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire and by road to the port of Tema in Ghana. The first shipment of zinc concentrate was expected to be delivered in 2008. In its 2006 annual report, AIM announced that it had signed letters of intent with Louis Dreyfus Commodities Metals Suisse S.A., Votorantim Metais of Brazil, and Switzerland-based Xstrata plc to finalize offtake agreements for the production of zinc concentrates from Perkoa. Xstrata planned to process Perkoa concentrates through either the San Juan de Nieva zinc smelter in Spain or the Nordenham zinc smelter in Germany.

40|$|The {{type and}} {{composition}} of freshwater and marine sediments are key factors in environmental research of (a) natural processes such as sediment transport and accumulation, biodiversity, and biogeochemical reactions within sediments and (b) evaluation of source and progress of contamination, as aquatic sediments act as a sink for nonorganic and organic toxic substances. Above certain levels, such substances could harm biological diversity and human health. Geochemical investigations of aquatic sediments in fluvial, lacustrine, estuarine, and marine environments are of fundamental interest {{for the assessment of}} natural ecosystems and the level of pollution that potentially harms them. Detailed determination of the chemical constituents of aquatic sediments assists in detecting sources of pollution as sewage, industry, agriculture, abandoned and active mines, landfills, harbor activities, and oil drilling [leakage].

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of the CRISCO family of International reporting Codes {{is a response to}} a number of mining industry “bubbles” e. g. Poseidon Nickel Boom and Bust of 1969 / 70 and Bre-X Scandal of 1997. Although the USA and Australians had started developing their codes (1988 and 1989 respectively), the international initiative to standardise reporting definitions for <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>mineral</b> reserves began at the 15 th Council of Mining and Metallurgical Institutions (CMMI) Congress at Sun City, South Africa in 1994. The ad-hoc International Definitions Group (later to become CRIRSCO) was provided with the primary objective of developing a set of international standard definitions for the reporting of <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>mineral</b> reserves. Deliberations continued with agreement being reached for the definitions of the two major categories, <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources</b> and <b>Mineral</b> Reserves, and their respective sub-categories Measured, <b>Indicated</b> and Inferred <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources,</b> and Proved and Probable Mineral Reserves under the Denver Accord in 1997. Following these agreements, an updated version of the JORC Code was released in Australia in 1999 and the first SAMREC Code was issued in 2000. In 2002, the Combined Reserves International Reporting Standards Committee (CRIRSCO, now known as the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards) was formed, replacing the CMMI International Definitions Group, with the mission to continue coordination between member countries of the {{development of}} international standards for the definition and reporting of Exploration Results, <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources</b> and <b>Mineral</b> Reserves. Subsequently various other codes have been developed based on the CRIRSCO template. These now include eight national representative organisations (NROs); namely Australasia (JORC), Canada (CIM), Chile (National Committee), Europe (National Committee PERC), Mongolia (MPIGM), Russia (NAEN), South Africa (SAMREC) and the USA (SME).

40|$|The Kabanga Ni sulfide deposit {{represents}} {{one of the most significant}} Ni sulfide discoveries of the last two decades, with current <b>indicated</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> of 23. 23 Mt at 2. 64 % Ni and inferred <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> of 28. 5 Mt at 2. 7 % Ni (Nov. 2008). The sulfides are hosted by a suite of ∼ 1. 4 Ga ultramafic–mafic, sill-like, and chonolithic intrusions that form part of the approximately 500 km long Kabanga–Musongati–Kapalagulu igneous belt in Tanzania and Burundi. The igneous bodies are up to about 1 km thick and 4 km long. They crystallized from several compositionally distinct magma pulses emplaced into sulfide-bearing pelitic schists. The first magma was a siliceous high-magnesium basalt (approximately 13. 3 % MgO) that formed a network of fine-grained acicular-textured gabbronoritic and orthopyroxenitic sills (Mg# opx 78 – 88, An plag 45 – 88). The magma was highly enriched in incompatible trace elements (LILE, LREE) and had pronounced negative Nb and Ta anomalies and heavy O isotopic signatures (δ 18 O + 6 to + 8). These compositional features are consistent with about 20 % contamination of primitive picrite with the sulfidic pelitic schists. Subsequent magma pulses were more magnesian (approximately 14 – 15 % MgO) and less contaminated (e. g., δ 18 O + 5. 1 to + 6. 6). They injected into the earlier sills, resulting in the formation of medium-grained harzburgites, olivine orthopyroxenites and orthopyroxenites (Fo 83 – 89, Mg# opx 86 – 89), and magmatic breccias consisting of gabbronorite–orthopyroxenite fragments within an olivine-rich matrix. All intrusions in the Kabanga area contain abundant sulfides (pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and minor chalcopyrite and pyrite). In the lower portions and the immediate footwall of two of the intrusions, namely Kabanga North and Kabanga Main, there occur numerous layers, lenses, and veins of massive Ni sulfides reaching a thickness of several meters. The largest amount of high grade, massive sulfide occurs in the smallest intrusion (Kabanga North). The sulfides have heavy S isotopic signatures (δ 34 S wr[*]=[*]+ 10 to + 24) that broadly overlap with those of the country rock sulfides, consistent with significant assimilation of external sulfur from the Karagwe–Ankolean sedimentary sequence. However, based partly on the relatively homogenous distribution of disseminated sulfides in many of the intrusive rocks, we propose that the Kabanga magmas reached sulfide saturation prior to final emplacement, in staging chambers or feeder conduits, followed by entrainment of the sulfides during continued magma ascent. Oxygen isotope data indicate that the mode of sulfide assimilation changed with time. The heavy δ 18 O ratios of the early magmas are consistent with ingestion of the sedimentary country rocks in bulk. The relatively light δ 18 O ratios of the later magmas indicate less bulk assimilation of the country rocks, but in addition the magmas selectively assimilated additional S, possibly through devolatization of the country rocks or through cannibalization of magmatic sulfides deposited in the conduits by preceding magma surges. The intrusions were tilted at ca. 1. 37 Ga, during the Kibaran orogeny and associated synkinematic granite plutonism. This caused solid-state mobilization of ductile sulfides into shear zones, notably along the base of the intrusions where sulfide-hornfels breccias and lenses and layers of massive sulfides may reach a thickness of > 10 m and can extend for several 10 s to > 100 m away from the intrusions. These horizons represent an important exploration target for additional nickel sulfide deposits...|$|R
