40|$|The {{presented}} diploma thesis {{deals with}} economic activities of {{regions of the}} Czech Republic with a special focus on funding of regional development; the region of Hradec Králové was taken as a concrete example for this purpose. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part of the thesis focuses on the issue of operating and funding of the regions of the Czech Republic with respect to the structure and development of incomes and expenses of regional budgets between the years 2001 and 2012. The second part of the thesis focuses on economic activities of the concrete region in relation to the regional development. The region of Hradec Králové was chosen for the analysis.

40|$|Sharia banking now has {{a strong}} legal {{framework}} {{with the presence of}} law number 21 of 2008 on sharia banking in Indonesia. This regulation enforces sharia banking to develop products to achieve the targeted market share of 5 %. In third-party fund products, more innovation is needed to attract people to entrust their funds in sharia banks. The visible data of mudharabah fund raising deposit products in March 2013 amounted to Rp 100. 746. 000. 000 and Rp 115. 728. 000. 000 in mudharabah deposits was visible on April 2014, which is an increase of less than 2 % each month. This research uses a qualitative descriptive methodology, and is focused on fund raising products in shari'ah banking, particularly in the form of mudharabah investments for a definitive result. The results show that sharia banking requires <b>innovative</b> <b>fund</b> raising for third-party products, such as mudharabah investment products. These investments provide certainty of results despite using mudharabah and are based on the certainty that projector financing has been agreed by the sharia with the creditor banks. This investment product can be offered to both individuals and groups/collectives. Keywords: sharia banking, investment, mudharaba...|$|E

Especially Luxembourg 2 ̆ 019 s ability to diversify its product range and to extend its product offers by creating new and <b>innovative</b> <b>fund</b> structures attracts potential investors and initiators. These unique circumstances have an impact on the Alternative Investment Fund Industry. The aim of this thesis is to provide a detailed and comprehensive overview of the relevant fund business and its related regulations in order to access the RAIF within the current market environment and to investigate if such a product can positively influence the growth of the local Alternative Investment Fund Market. The current role of the Luxembourg Alternative Investment Fund Industry and its potential as well as the outcomes, derived from the analysis of the RAIF in relation to other available fund products, will be presented and evaluated based on a SWOT analysis. The gained theoretical insights will be compared with the practical and current market view of the product derived from five expert interviews, each conducted with a specialist in the specific field of the Alternative Investment Fund Industry in Luxembourg. In a final conclusion the findings and results, gained from the theoretical and practical part of this thesis, will be presented. The RAIF has a significant potential to become a well-established fund structure in the Luxembourg market. It reflects the level of creativity, flexibility and diversity of a market and its players within in a fast changing environment...|$|E

We identify stressed banks and link them to a unique, manually constructed sample of 157 new ventures seeking equity crowdfunding. The sample comprises projects from all German equity crowdfunding platforms since 2011, which we compare with 200 ventures that do not use crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is significantly more likely for new ventures that interact with stressed banks. <b>Innovative</b> <b>funding</b> is thus particularly relevant when conventional financiers are facing crises.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to outline steps that the Obama Administration could take to help pass legislation for an <b>innovative</b> <b>funding</b> mechanism known as a National Infrastructure Bank (NIB). The recommended steps {{are based on a}} historical analysis of the leadership provided by Presidents Roosevelt and Eisenhower when passing the original bills that authorized the Interstate system. Key policy recommendations include: framing the need for an NIB as a means of economic growth and natural disaster resilience, building strategic stakeholder support through education, and engaging and compromising with Congress while developing the NIB proposal. If successfully applied, these lessons can contribute to enabling the creation of an NIB that would increase infrastructure investment by billions of dollars while rehabilitating the struggling economy and transportation network.
