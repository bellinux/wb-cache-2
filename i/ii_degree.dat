In October 2007, more birthday concerts took place in Moscow, at the State Grand Kremlin Palace, featuring Russian singers performing her songs.|$|E

40|$|Purpose — {{to develop}} a multidirectional  model  for {{detecting}} hidden  corneal  lesions  in patients after  chemical  and  thermal {{first or second degree}} burns  with predominant lesion of eyelid or cornea and  the  timely  emergency help with irrigation  systems. Patients and  methods. 110   patients with thermal and  chemical  eye  burns  were  examined.   All  patients underwent a  detailed  clinical and comprehensive ophthalmological  examination. According  to  results they  were  divided into groups, depending  on  the  cause of the first and  second degree burn.   Group 1 :  the  patients with thermal eye burn  (n = 45);  Group 2 :  the  patients with chemical  eye burn (n = 41). Group 3 :  the  patients after  an induced  chemical  burn  (alcohol deepithelization  with an 18 %  alcohol solution in LASEK) (n = 27). Group 4 :  healthy people  (n= 25).   We  used  computer corneotopography, topography  of the  cornea and  analysis of anterior eye chamber, counting  the  number of endothelial  cells,  optical coherence tomography of the  anterior segment, confocal  microscopy, all tests were determined before  and after  treatment with irrigation systems. Results. In cases of the I or <b>II</b> <b>degrees</b> chemical  burn with a predominant lesion of the cornea — irrigation system is for emergency treatment — a neutral  pH buffer solution is 4. 9 % phosphate salts, possessing amphoteric properties, neutralizing acids  and bases. In cases of the I or <b>II</b> <b>degrees</b> thermal burns  with predominant damage to the  eyelids and  conjunctiva — an irrigation system is sterile sodium  chloride solution 0. 9 %. Conclusions. The model of diagnostics and  treatment provides  high functional outcomes results in the  thermal and  chemical  burns  with predominant lesion of the eyelid or cornea with accurate timely diagnostics of the cornea and use  of optimal irrigation solutions  for emergency and targeted therapy. </p...|$|R
30|$|Complications {{included}} pin tract infection I and <b>II</b> <b>degrees</b> {{in accordance}} with Paley’s criteria [26]. This was treated by changing dressing and oral antibiotics. Maintained shortening of 1  cm in three patients was considered for conservative observation. The retarded consolidation was addressed by increasing the duration of fixation. The case with aseptic necrosis was missed to follow-up after {{one and a half}} years. We insist that clear postoperative care instructions should be given to the patients during hospital stay and after discharge to minimize the risk of complications, especially those related to weight bearing. We recommend that this technique be performed by pediatric orthopedic surgeons experienced with the Ilizarov technique. A larger number of patients and longer follow-up terms are needed in order to further verify the application of this method.|$|R

The aim of this workshop, therefore, will be to bring category change itself to the fore, as a phenomenon worthy of study in its own right. Adopting a rather broad definition of “category”, which includes both single words and multi-word units, we will explore how categories change and why some shifts are more frequent than others. In particular, we want to examine whether a constructional perspective enhances our understanding of category change. In our workshop, focus will be on three topics: (i) types of category change, (<b>ii)</b> <b>degrees</b> of gradualness and context-sensitivity, and (iii) directionality...|$|R

Possibility of stress echocardiography with physical loads usage to diagnose decrease of myocardial contractile reserve of the heart left ventricle was proved. It was found that increase in hemodynamic load during physical exercise leads to the disruption of adaptation and manifestation of systolic dysfunction in athletes with I and <b>II</b> <b>degrees</b> of mitral valve regurgitation.
