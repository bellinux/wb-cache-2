5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
5|$|Charles Heaphy VC (1820 – 3 August 1881) was an English-born New Zealand {{explorer}} and {{recipient of}} the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest military award for gallantry {{in the face of}} the <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first soldier of the New Zealand armed forces to be awarded the VC. He was also a noted artist and executed several works of early colonial life in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Keith Elliott, VC (25 April 1916 – 7 October 1989) was a New Zealand {{soldier who}} {{served with the}} New Zealand Military Forces during the Second World War. He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry {{in the face of}} the <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions in the First Battle of El Alamein.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} Julio-Claudian period, many {{auxiliary}} regiments raised in frontier provinces were stationed {{in or near}} their home provinces, except during periods of major crises such as the Cantabrian Wars, when they were deployed temporarily in theatre. This carried the obvious risk if their own tribe or ethnic group rebelled against Rome (or attacked the Roman frontier from outside the Empire), auxiliary troops could be tempted to make common cause with them. The Romans would then be faced by an <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> included units fully equipped and trained by themselves, thus losing their usual tactical advantages over tribal foes.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E

5|$|The game {{combines}} platformer, role-playing, {{and combat}} elements. Players move about several levels, including a forest and a castle, using precision jumping and puzzle solving {{to move about}} the level. Players can discover equipable weapons and armor that improves effectiveness in combat by exploring levels for chests. Combat {{takes the form of}} set piece battles, in which a number of enemies appear and must be defeated before the player can continue to progress through the area. These enemies include human outlaws, demons, werewolves, and other vampires. The game also contains boss battles, in which the player must defeat a significantly stronger <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> is aided by normal enemies.|$|E
5|$|William Ellis (Bill) Newton, VC (8June 1919– 29March 1943) was an Australian {{recipient}} of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry {{in the face of}} the <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> can be awarded to a member of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. He was honoured for his actions as a bomber pilot in Papua New Guinea during March 1943 when, despite intense anti-aircraft fire, he pressed home a series of attacks on the Salamaua Isthmus, the last of which saw him forced to ditch his aircraft in the sea. Newton was still officially posted as missing when the award was made in October 1943. It later emerged that he had been taken captive by the Japanese, and executed by beheading on 29March.|$|E
5|$|William Thomas Dartnell, VC (6 April 1885 – 3 September 1915), {{also known}} as Wilbur Taylor Dartnell, was an Australian-born soldier, actor and a {{recipient}} of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry {{in the face of}} the <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in Melbourne, he served in the Second Boer War as a teenager and later in the Bambatha Rebellion of 1906. He married, managed his own business and worked as a professional actor before immigrating to South Africa in 1912 or 1913.|$|E

5|$|General Alfred T. Torbert was {{commander}} of the union cavalry. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{was part of the}} 2nd Brigade (commanded by Colonel Powell), which was part of the 2nd Cavalry Division (commanded by General Averell). Powell's brigade was positioned on the northwest side of the battlefield between brigades led by Colonel James Schoonmaker and Colonel George Custer. During the battle, Powell sent the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry to the flank and rear of Confederate cavalry consisting of Virginians led by Colonel William H. F. Payne, which was facing Custer's brigade. Powell also sent the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry toward Payne's left flank. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry had been newly armed with 7-shot carbines, and found them very effective against an <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> was driven from the area in panic. During this time, Confederate General Fitzhugh Lee's horse was shot out from under him, but Lee escaped on another horse.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Mills-Roberts {{arrived from}} the United Kingdom {{to take over the}} unit, and he was in command when on 26 February 1943 they were {{involved}} in bitter fighting against two battalions of German parachute infantry with armoured support which attacked their position as part of an attempt to encircle the 1st Army by cutting the Medjez road. In a fight that lasted over five hours, against an <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> outnumbered them and had the advantage of heavy armoured support, the commandos, along with elements from the Reconnaissance Regiment, were able to stop the advance long enough for reinforcements to be brought up. In this action, No. 6 Commando incurred 11 killed, 34 wounded and 55 missing in action. This represented over 40 per cent of the unit's strength at the time, although later a number of those that were captured were recovered after the Germans withdrew.|$|E

5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{planned to}} produce sequels, but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game {{production}} {{for a few}} years. Prior to the full effects of the crash, Vid Kidz developed an official sequel, Blaster in 1983. The game {{is set in the}} same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons. Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation. The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers. It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64. In addition to the graphical update, the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles. Though the game features similar gameplay as the original, it was not as well received. Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the moving camera in the 3D environment a negative update. They felt the original format—an overhead perspective of a single screen—presented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player's skill. The moving camera angle, however, obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by an <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> suddenly appeared. Vince echoed similar statements, stating that the gameplay suffered from the loss of important aspects from the original. Rollings and Adams, however, attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron Xs release.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{colonel in}} 1913, Chauvel became the Australian {{representative}} on the Imperial General Staff but the First World War broke out {{while he was}} still en route to the United Kingdom. Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt, where he joined his new command, the 1st Light Horse Brigade, in December. In May 1915, it was sent dismounted to Gallipoli, where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous parts of the line. He took charge of the 1st Division that November. In March 1916, Chauvel became commander of the Anzac Mounted Division, gaining victories in the Battle of Romani in August and the Battle of Magdhaba in December, and nearly winning the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917. The following month, he took over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps, and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general. At Beersheba in October 1917, his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history's last great cavalry charges. By September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> won the Battle of Megiddo. He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} both iron and blood soon became apparent. By 1862, when Bismarck made his speech, {{the idea of}} a German {{nation-state}} in the peaceful spirit of Pan-Germanism had shifted from the liberal and democratic character of 1848 to accommodate Bismarck's more conservative Realpolitik. Ever the pragmatist, Bismarck understood the possibilities, obstacles, and advantages of a unified state. He also understood the importance of linking that state to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which for some historians remains one of Bismarck's primary contributions {{to the creation of the}} German Empire in 1871. While the conditions of the treaties binding the various German states to one another prohibited Bismarck from taking unilateral action, the politician and diplomat in him realized the impracticality of such an action. In order to get the German states to unify, Bismarck needed a single, outside <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> would declare war on one of the German states first, thus providing a casus belli to rally all Germans behind. This opportunity arose with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Historians have long debated Bismarck's role in the events leading up to the war. The traditional view, promulgated in large part by late 19th and early 20th century pro-Prussian historians, maintains that Bismarck's intent was always German unification. Post-1945 historians, however, see more short-term opportunism and cynicism in Bismarck's manipulation of the circumstances to create a war, rather than a grand scheme to unify a nation-state. Regardless, Bismarck was neither villain nor saint: by manipulating events of 1866 and 1870, he demonstrated the political and diplomatic skill that had caused Wilhelm to turn to him in 1862.|$|E
