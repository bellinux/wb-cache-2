5|$|Impala browse {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the <b>dicot</b> proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dicot</b> stems {{with primary}} growth have pith in the center, with {{vascular}} bundles forming a distinct ring visible when the stem is viewed in cross section. The {{outside of the}} stem is covered with an epidermis, which is covered by a waterproof cuticle. The epidermis also may contain stomata for gas exchange and multicellular stem hairs called trichomes. A cortex consisting of hypodermis (collenchyma cells) and endodermis (starch containing cells) is present above the pericycle and vascular bundles.|$|E
25|$|Vascular bundles {{are present}} {{throughout}} the monocot stem, although concentrated towards the outside. This {{differs from the}} <b>dicot</b> stem that has a ring of vascular bundles and often none in the center. The shoot apex in monocot stems is more elongated. Leaf sheathes grow up around it, protecting it. This is true to some extent of almost all monocots. Monocots rarely produce secondary growth and are therefore seldom woody, with Palms and Bamboo being notable exceptions. However, many monocot stems increase in diameter via anomalous secondary growth.|$|E
25|$|All {{gymnosperms}} are woody plants. Their stems {{are similar}} in structure to woody <b>dicots</b> except that most gymnosperms produce only tracheids in their xylem, not the vessels found in <b>dicots.</b> Gymnosperm wood also often contains resin ducts. Woody <b>dicots</b> are called hardwoods, e.g. oak, maple and walnut. In contrast, softwoods are gymnosperms, such as pine, spruce and fir.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} {{among the major}} angiosperm groups are modeled based on cladistic analyses primarily using RAPD technique. Phylogenetic trees of relationship derived from molecular data confirm <b>dicots</b> as the ancestral class of monocots, there seems no dicot-monocot split. <b>Dicots</b> form an ancestral class of magnoliids and the monocot lineage was derived {{from one of the}} basal magnoliids, since monocots share several synapomorphies <b>dicots</b> do not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor...|$|R
50|$|A major {{outcome of}} the {{classification}} was {{the disappearance of the}} traditional division of the flowering plants into two groups, monocots and <b>dicots.</b> The monocots were recognized as a clade, but the <b>dicots</b> were not, with a number of former <b>dicots</b> being placed in separate groups basal to both monocots and the remaining <b>dicots,</b> the eudicots or 'true dicots'. The overall scheme was relatively simple. This consisted of a grade consisting of isolated taxa (referred to as ANITA), followed by the major angiosperm radiation, clades of monocots, magnolids and eudicots. The last being a large clade with smaller subclades and two main groupings, rosids and asterids, each in turn having two major subclades.|$|R
25|$|How is the {{enormous}} {{diversity in the}} shape, color and sizes of flowers established? There is enormous variation in the developmental program in different plants. For example, monocots possess structures like lodicules and palea, that {{were believed to be}} analogous to the <b>dicot</b> petals and carpels respectively.It turns out that this is true, and the variation is due to slight changes in the MADS-box genes and their expression pattern in the monocots. Another example is that of the toad-flax, Linaria vulgaris, which has two kinds of flower symmetries: radial and bilateral. These symmetries are due to epigenetic changes in just one gene called CYCLOIDEA.|$|E
25|$|Favorite food plants include {{native and}} {{introduced}} species from {{all sorts of}} <b>dicot</b> families, such as Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae or Solanaceae. Magnoliidae fruit, for example of Duguetia furfuracea (Annonaceae) or avocados (Persea americana, Lauraceae) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat cereal grains, or monocots in general. However, the leaves of particular grass species like Brachiaria brizantha can be eaten in large quantities, and Liliaceae (e.g. the sarsaparilla Smilax brasiliensis) have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like tubers or thistles is eaten with relish. Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the greater rhea swallows pebbles which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.|$|E

40|$|Background: Seed storage {{proteins}} are a {{major source}} of dietary protein, and the content of such proteins determines both {{the quantity and quality of}} crop yield. Significantly, examination of the protein content in the seeds of crop plants shows a distinct difference between monocots and <b>dicots.</b> Thus, it is expected that there are different evolutionary patterns in the genes underlying protein synthesis in the seeds of these two groups of plants. Results: Gene duplication, evolutionary rate and positive selection of a major gene family of seed storage proteins (the 11 S globulin genes), were compared in <b>dicots</b> and monocots. The results, obtained from five species in each group, show more gene duplications, a higher evolutionary rate and positive selections of this gene family in <b>dicots,</b> which are rich in 11 S globulins, but not in the monocots. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence to support the suggestion that gene duplication and an accelerated evolutionary rate may be associated with higher protein synthesis in <b>dicots</b> as compared to monocots. ...|$|R

A few feed on foliage (the austral 'oxyacanine' genera which may drag foliage into their feeding tunnel: Nielsen et al., 2000: 825).

5000|$|The eudicots, Eudicotidae or eudicotyledons are a {{monophyletic}} clade {{of flowering}} plants {{that had been}} called tricolpates or non-magnoliid <b>dicots</b> by previous authors. The botanical terms were introduced in 1991 by evolutionary botanist James A. Doyle and paleobotanist Carol L. Hotton to emphasize the later evolutionary divergence of tricolpate <b>dicots</b> from earlier, less specialized, <b>dicots.</b> [...] The close relationships among flowering plants with tricolpate pollen grains was initially seen in morphological studies of shared derived characters. These plants have a distinct trait in their pollen grains of exhibiting three colpi or grooves paralleling the polar axis. Later molecular evidence confirmed the genetic basis for the evolutionary relationships among flowering plants with tricolpate pollen grains and dicotyledonous traits. The term means [...] "true dicotyledons", as it contains the majority of plants that have been considered <b>dicots</b> and have characteristics of the <b>dicots.</b> The term [...] "eudicots" [...] has subsequently been widely adopted in botany to refer {{to one of the}} two largest clades of angiosperms (constituting over 70% of the angiosperm species), monocots being the other. The remaining angiosperms include magnoliids and what are sometimes referred to as basal angiosperms or paleodicots, but these terms have not been widely or consistently adopted, as they do not refer to a monophyletic group.|$|R

The data were obtained from standardized screening tests on 38 British herbaceous species. Graminoid monocots had physically tougher leaves with higher silicon contents than did herbaceous <b>dicots,</b> and this corresponded with the lesser decomposibility of the former. Total base content of living leaves was a good predictor of litter decomposition rate, but the evolutionary and ecological basis for this relationship appeared to differ between graminoid monocots and herbaceous <b>dicots.</b> In the monocots, litter decomposition rate was strongly predicted by leaf potassium content, which appeared to reflect other growth- related plant attributes such as seedling maximum relative growth rate, foliar nitrogen and phosphorus content, specific leaf area and short leaf lifespan.
