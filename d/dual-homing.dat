40|$|Abstract — Dual homing is a {{fault-tolerance}} mechanism generally used in IP-based {{access networks}} {{to increase the}} survivability of the network. In a <b>dual-homing</b> architecture, a host is connected to two different access routers; therefore, {{it is unlikely that}} the host will be denied access to the network as the result of a failure in the access network, a failure of the access router, or congestion at the access router.

To provide survivability in the core network, optical protection and restoration techniques must be used. In the past, dual homing architectures and optical protection schemes have been studied independently of one another. This paper studies coordinated multi-layer survivability techniques that use both <b>dual-homing</b> schemes and optical protection schemes in an IP-based access network over a WDMbased optical core network. Specifically, we investigate the protection design problem in the WDM core network, given that a <b>dual-homing</b> infrastructure is implemented in the access network.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{scalable}} multicast protection {{scheme based on}} a <b>dual-homing</b> architecture where each destination host is connected to two edge routers. Under such an architecture, there are two paths from {{the source of a}} multicast session to each destination host, which provides a certain level of protection for the data traffic from the source to the destination host. The protection level varies from 0 percent to 100 percent against a single link failure, depending on the number of shared links between these two paths. The major advantage of the proposed scheme lies in its scalability {{due to the fact that}} the protection is provided by constructing a <b>dual-homing</b> architecture at the access network while keeping the routing protocols in the core network unchanged. The selection of dual edge routers plays an important role in enhancing the protection level. Two problems arise for the proposed <b>dual-homing</b> partial multicast protection scheme.

The other is to assign a pair of edge routers for each destination host such that the total survivability is maximized for the multicast session subject to the port number constraint of each edge router.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} the {{survivability}} problem in hierarchical wireless access networks with dual-homed end users, who {{are connected to}} two base stations (BSs), a primary BS and a backup BS. The dual homing mechanism is resilient to a single failure of a BS. However, if a failure occurs at the base station controller (BSC) layer or at the mobile switching center (MSC) layer, <b>dual-homing</b> may not prevent connection loss. We {{address the problem of}} routing from BSs to BSCs and from BSCs to MSCs, with the objective of minimizing the maximum number of connections lost due to a single failure of BS, BSC, or MSC. We first formulate the problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We then prove that this optimization problem is NP-hard by showing some of its subproblems with relaxed constraints are still NP-hard. A Tabu Search (TS) based heuristic is then proposed for the problem, which provides near optimal results in most cases. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{employed in}} monitoring applications require {{data collected by}} the sensors to be deposited at specific nodes, referred to as drains. To improve robustness in data collection, we consider a dual homing network in which two drains are employed and every node is required to send data to the two drains over link- or node-disjoint paths. One approach {{to reduce the number}} of routing table entries at a node is to construct two trees, namely red and blue, each rooted at a particular drain such that the paths from any node to the two drains on the trees are link- or node-disjoint. In this paper, we develop the first distributed algorithm for constructing colored trees in a <b>dual-homing</b> network whose running time is linear in the number of links. In addition, we show that the average path length may be optimized by employing the generalized low-point concept rather than the traditional low-point concept. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} purposes of sensing information is to immediately respond to any anomalies. In order to make an accurate and cognizant decision, there is a great need for a dependable wireless sensor network. Failure dependability relates to providing dependability against node and/or link failures. In multi-layered wireless sensor networks with data fusion, we observe that as the data propagates from the sensor node to the sink, the data packet represents an increasing number of sensor nodes (sub-tree) in the network. Hence, it is critical that this data packet reaches the sink, since the loss of a single packet eliminates the information sensed by a whole (possibly large) sub-tree of sensor nodes. We evaluate two dual-homed routing techniques for providing faulttolerance, namely 1 + 1 <b>dual-homing</b> and 1 : 1 dual homing. Based on extensive simulation results, we observe that 1 : 1 dual-homed routing minimizes packet loss, increases network throughput, and increases network lifetime compared to the 1 + 1 dual-homed routing and the traditional single-homed routing techniques.

In this manuscript, the authors apply a compound traffic engineering approach of the simulation techniques for a Managed Internet Protocol (IP) network to derive the route evaluation indexes to facilitate the facility deployment and hence, ensure the accomplishment of a better network Quality of Service (QoS). To this end, the results of this research will be of significance to the future development and construction of an effective & efficient network routing to meet the growing and fierce requirement for a better service standard. According to prior studies done with the experimental findings, this proposed design approach utilized by a Managed IP/MPLS (Multi- Protocol Label Switch) network and associated with the transmission of voice/fax/data packets was mainly to improve effectively the routing performance level. Moreover, a <b>dual-homing</b> traffic engineering strategy was addressed to increase the network system utility with the proposed simulated study...|$|E
40|$|Are exchanges natural monopolies? How {{much does}} liquidity, differentiation, intermediation, and {{multi-homing}} matter to exchange competition? We {{answer these questions}} by studying competition between two exchanges over the Bund contract.

Specifically, we study the determinants of traders’ exchange membership, using a novel panel dataset that contains traders ’ membership status at each exchange together with other trader characteristics and pricing, marketing and product portfolio strategies by each exchange. We find that horizontally differentiation was more important to membership decisions than liquidity preferences, a phenomenon we explain by the existence of intermediation in these markets, and which makes coexistence of different exchanges trading the same products more likely. We also find that this differentiation decreased over time, together with a change in the population of traders more favorable to the entrant. These developments may have explained why the market eventually tipped to the entrant, despite our surprising finding that <b>dual-homing</b> helped the incumbent membership more than the entrant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract —This short paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the MobilityFirst network architecture, which is a clean-slate project being conducted as part of the NSF Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program. The proposed architecture is intended to directly address the challenges of wireless access and mobility at scale, while also providing new multicast, anycast, multi-path and context-aware services needed for emerging mobile Internet application scenarios. Key protocol components of the proposed architecture are: (a) separation of naming from addressing; (b) public key based self-certifying names (called globally unique identifiers or GUIDs) for network-attached objects; (c) global name resolution service (GNRS) for dynamic name-to-address binding; (d) delay-tolerant and storage-aware routing (GSTAR) capable of dealing with wireless link quality fluctuations and disconnections; (e) hop-by-hop transport of large protocol data units; and (f) location or context-aware services. The basic operations of a MobilityFirst router are outlined and a simple example of how the protocol supports <b>dual-homing</b> and multi-path is given. This is followed by a discussion of ongoing proof-of-concept prototyping and experimental evaluation efforts for the MobilityFirst protocol stack. In conclusion, a brief description of an ongoing multi-site experimental deployment of the MobilityFirst protocol stack on the GENI testbed is provided.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The {{motivation}} behind {{this study is}} the essential need for survivability in the telecommunications networks. An optical signal should find its destination even if the network experiences an occasional fiber cut. We consider the design of a two-level survivable telecommunications network. Terminals compiling the access layer communicate through hubs forming the backbone layer. To hedge against single link failures in the network, we require the backbone subgraph to be two-edge connected and the terminal nodes to connect to the backbone layer in a dual-homed fashion, i. e., at two distinct hubs. The underlying design problem partitions a given set of nodes into hubs and terminals, chooses a set of connections between the hubs such that the resulting backbone network is two-edge connected, and for each terminal chooses two hubs to provide the <b>dual-homing</b> backbone access. All of these decisions are jointly made based on some cost considerations. We give alternative formulations using cut inequalities, compare these formulations, provide a polyhedral analysis of the smallsized formulation, describe valid inequalities, study the associated separation problems, and design variable fixing rules. All of these findings are then utilized in devising an efficient branch-and-cut algorithm to solve this network design problem...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{concentrate}} on topological planning process of large-scale communication networks {{such as those}} used by telecom operators. Such networks are usually spread over large geographical area, and finding an optimal topology is {{very important part of}} the planning process. Network equipment used in such network is very expensive, and two connection points can be hundreds of kilometers apart. These networks, in most cases, form a backbone network of telecom operator, meaning that majority of traffic is carried through high-speed communication links of such network. Any cable cuts or equipment malfunctions could result in huge data losses. Therefore, such networks require high degree of availability and fault resistance, which must be considered during the planning process. Network topology providing fault resistance should offer at least two separate communication paths between any pair of network nodes. Most important issue in network topology planning is finding topology with lowest possible overall network price, while keeping all requirements (such as fault tolerance, availability, maximal number of hops, maximal blocking probability etc.) satisfied. Network design process can be divided into three stages. First step is making decisions about which network elements (nodes, existing edges) should be included in a backbone network (for instance, one of sub-problems appearing in this phase is facility location problem). Second step includes selection of network topology, so that all elements selected in first step will be interconnected satisfying given requirements. Last phase is used to determine node and link capacities needed for successful traffic transport as well as routings of traffic demands, including protection. Depending on technologies used in network, different routing and protection mechanisms, as well as specific topology models, can be used (e. g. SDH/WDM SHR, mesh, <b>dual-homing</b> etc.) ...|$|E
