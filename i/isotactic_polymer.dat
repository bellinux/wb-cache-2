40|$|The {{monolayer}} {{behavior of}} some poly(methacrylates) with short ester side chains (methyl, ethyl, and isobutyl) is studied {{as a function}} of the tacticity. In all cases, the <b>isotactic</b> <b>polymers</b> are observed to form expanded monolayers, whereas the syndiotactic materials yield more condensed monolayers.

The anomalous temperature dependence of the <b>isotactic</b> <b>polymers</b> (a contraction of the monolayers at higher temperatures) can be interpreted in terms of an enhancement of these lateral cohesive interactions (a decrease of the solvent quality of the environment).

5000|$|When a monomer adds to {{a radical}} chain end, {{there are two}} factors to {{consider}} regarding its stereochemistry: 1) {{the interaction between the}} terminal chain carbon and the approaching monomer molecule and 2) the configuration of the penultimate repeating unit in the polymer chain.

There are two ways that a monomer molecule can approach the terminal carbon: the mirror approach (with like substituents on the same side) or the non-mirror approach (like substituents on opposite sides).

50|$|Natta {{first used}} {{polymerization}} catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity {{to a special}} feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in {{the picture on the}} left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −CH2−CHR−, like the CH3 groups in the figure.

A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic.

Within the present RE series, the complex of the largest ion (Dy 3 +) exhibits the highest activity, achieving a high turnover frequency of 390 min- 1, and also produces the highly <b>isotactic</b> <b>polymer</b> PβMMBL (mm = 91. 0 %). This stereoregular polymer is thermally robust, with a high glass-transition temperature of 280 C, and is resistant to all common organic solvents. Other half-sandwich RE catalysts of the series are also highly active and produce polymers with a similarly high isotacticity. Intriguingly, even simple homoleptic hydrocarbyl RE complexes, RE(CH 2 SiMe 3) 3 (THF) 2 (RE = Sc, Y, Dy, Lu), also afford highly <b>isotactic</b> <b>polymer</b> PβMMBL, despite their much lower polymerization activity, except for the Lu complex, which maintains its high activity for both types of complexes. Computational studies of both half-sandwich and simple hydrocarbyl yttrium complexes have revealed a stereocontrol mechanism that well explains the observed high stereoselectivity of βMMBL polymerization by both types of catalysts. Specifically, the experimental stereoselectivity can be well rationalized with a monometallic propagation mechanism through predominantly chain-end stereocontrol in the coordination-addition polymerization. In this mechanism, formation of an <b>isotactic</b> <b>polymer</b> chiefly originates from interactions between the methyl groups on the chiral β-C atom of the five-membered ring of both the coordinated monomer and the last inserted βMMBL unit of the chain, and the auxiliary ligand on the metal makes a negligible contribution to the stereocontrol of the polymerization. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E

The high hydrogen sensitivity of catalysts containing a diether donor is mainly due to chain transfer following the occasional regioirregular (2, 1 -) monomer insertion. The probability of regio- and stereoirregular insertion decreases with monomer concentration, indicating the presence of nonsymmetric active centres.
