5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> {{infection}} and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs {{during periods of}} severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E

5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) is {{the virus}} that – when the {{infection}} is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have been infected with the <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, including those who have died. AIDS is a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe 5 '-untranslated region (5 '-UTR) of the genomic RNA of <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> type- 1 (HIV- 1) and type- 2 (HIV- 2) is {{composed}} of highly structured RNA motifs essential for viral replication {{that are expected to}} interfere with Gag and Gag-Pol translation. Here, we have analyzed and compared the properties by which the viral 5 '-UTR drives translation from the genomic RNA of both <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses.</b> Our results showed that translation from the HIV- 2 gRNA was very poor compared to that of HIV- 1. This was rather due to the intrinsic structural motifs in their respective 5 '-UTR without involvement of any viral protein. Further investigation pointed to a different role of TAR RNA, which was much inhibitory for HIV- 2 translation. Altogether, these data highlight important structural and functional differences between these two human pathogens...|$|R

40|$|The CD 4 T-lymphocyte {{differentiation}} antigen {{is an essential}} component of the cell surface receptor for <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> (HIVs) causing AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) (refs 1 - 3). Peripheral blood lymphocytes of apes, New World and Old World monkeys express cell surface antigens homologous to CD 4 of human T-helper lymphocytes. The cells of several of these species can be infected in short term culture with diverse strains of the type- 1 or type- 2 <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>viruses</b> (HIV- 1 and HIV- 2). HIV- 1 is the prototype AIDS virus, and HIV- 2 is the second type of AIDS virus, prevalent in West Africa. Infection of the primate cells correlates with evolutionary conservation on CD 4 of one particular epitope cluster, and is inhibited by treatment of the cells with monoclonal antibodies to this epitope. The capacity of HIV to replicate in simian cells may provide a means for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccines...|$|R
5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 {{there were}} about 1,700 hospitals, of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{account for more than}} 25% of all deaths.

Despite the increase of HIV/AIDS cases from 12,000 in 2005 to 17,450 as of April 2014 with 5,965 people who were under anti-retroviral therapy, the country is still a low-HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.1% of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive.|$|E

5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> (HIV) is a {{lentivirus}} (a {{subgroup of}} retrovirus) that causes HIV infection {{and over time}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus</b> enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The <b>human</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>virus,</b> HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E
