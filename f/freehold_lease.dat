50|$|The {{idea of a}} hill resort {{located near}} Kuala Lumpur {{occurred}} to Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong during a business trip to the Cameron Highlands in 1964. He mooted this idea while enjoying the fresh and crisp air from the balcony of his hotel room.A private company called Genting Highlands Berhad was set up on 27 April 1965, with the late Tan Sri Haji Mohammed Noah bin Omar, Tan Sri Lim successfully obtained approval for the alienation of 12,000 acre and 2,800 acre of land from the Pahang and Selangor State Government respectively between the years 1965 and 1970. An anomaly happened during the obtaining of the land approvals. While the Pahang state government swiftly approved a <b>freehold</b> <b>lease,</b> the Selangor state reluctantly approved a 99-year lease. As a result, Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong met the then Menteri Besar of Selangor, Dato Harun Idris {{and told him that}} a <b>freehold</b> <b>lease</b> would be more feasible than a 99-year lease. Finally, the Selangor state government agreed to grant a <b>freehold</b> <b>lease.</b>|$|E

The [...] "Disputed Territory" [...] as it was termed between the surveyed border and the actual 141st meridian contained over 500 square miles (1295 km²) of land. By 1849, 47% of it had already been sold <b>freehold</b> or <b>leased</b> out by the Victorian Government. If the more accurate border were adopted, Victoria would not have owned the land to be able to sell or lease it.

40|$|Rural land {{holdings}} {{in a number}} of states in Australia can be freehold or leasehold. The actual type and tenure of the leasehold varies according to each state, but the underlying principles of ownership, transferability and farming and grazing rights are reasonably similar. There are rural areas that are all leasehold title such as the western lands in NSW, while rural land in some states and areas can be a mix of both <b>freehold</b> and <b>lease</b> hold rural property. Over the years many rural farming areas that were originally developed or granted as leasehold land have been converted to freehold title. In many instances the cost of purchasing perpetual leasehold property is similar to the equivalent freehold property despite the fact that an additional rental charge is applied to this form of ownership. Many of the current leasehold rural holdings are located in the more arid regions of the state and the prevailing agricultural farming system is either cattle or sheep grazing...|$|R
50|$|In 1870 John Barker and James Whitehead got {{together}} {{to open a}} small drapery business at 91-93 Kensington High Street. James Whitehead (a city merchant) was the investor, while John Barker ran the store. John Barker's plan was to start small and grow his business to a full line department store. He started by dealing direct with manufacturers {{to get the best}} price, and with the profits made he started buying up <b>freeholds</b> and <b>leases</b> of nearby properties. By the end of 1870 he had annexed 26-28 Ball Street, setting up millinery and dressmaking departments. By 1871, he had purchased 87 Kensington High Street and opened a men's tailoring and children's department. Within a year he had again grown by buying his neighbours' businesses at 89 Kensington High Street and 26 Ball Street. By 1880, he had extended his stores at 87-89 Kensington High Street and had bought an ironmongery business at 14-16 Ball Street and added 75-77 Kensington High Street and 12 Ball Street to his premises. By 1892, the business had swallowed up 63-71 Kensington High Street, 2-6 Young Street and 6 Ball Street and now operated over forty two departments and workshops.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Walker LJ {{held the}} purpose of s 79 was to remove the {{difficulty}} of expressing an intention to bind successors by allowing that intention to be presumed unless a contrary intention was expressed. However, other covenants within the conveyance {{made it clear that}} successors should be bound, and the absence of such words in the clause in question showed a contrary intention. The covenant was thus merely personal in nature and could not be enforced against successors in title. He said that Law of Property Act 1925, section 79 ‘extends the number of persons whose acts or omissions are within the reach of the covenant in the sense of making equitable remedies available, provided that the other conditions for equity’s intervention are satisfied.’ So it does not bind the successors, but says that the initial covenantor is responsible for the successors. He went on, saying, 'A’s duty is a duty not to make a particular use of A’s land; and A’s duty enhances B’s <b>Freehold</b> or <b>Lease</b> (i.e. benefits B’s land); and A’s duty, when created, is not intended to impose only a personal duty on A.' ...|$|R
50|$|The charity {{was formed}} in 1957 by Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, a writer, former MP and a high church Anglican, who became its first chairman; its {{executive}} committee included prominent politicians and architects. Initially the charity campaigned and obtained grants for the repair and restoration of churches within its remit. The 1968 Pastoral Measure established the Redundant Churches Fund (now called the Churches Conservation Trust), which it was thought would obviate {{the need for the}} Friends. However, the Church Commissioners turned down a number of buildings that the executive committee considered worthy of preservation, including Old St Matthew's Church, Lightcliffe, and St Peter's Church, Wickham Bishops. The charity therefore decided in 1972 to change its constitution, allowing it to acquire threatened buildings either by <b>freehold</b> or by <b>lease.</b> The tower of the church at Lightcliffe was the first property to be vested with the charity.|$|R

50|$|Arnold & Co had a lease of some {{business}} premises at 126 Gloucester Road, Kensington, London. It sold the lease to Matlodge Ltd, who promised Arnold & Co could remain for free in occupation as ‘licensees’ until any redevelopment on a quarter’s notice in writing, and that on redevelopment {{that they should}} get a lease of a shop in a prime position at the development with 1000 square metres and car parking. Then Cavendish Land Co Ltd acquired both the <b>freehold</b> and the <b>lease,</b> accepting the contractual duties to Arnold & Co.

If it was just a licence, it should bind anyway, under Errington v Errington or be a constructive trust.|$|R
50|$|The first Commissioner of the Protectorate, Sir Harry Johnston {{had hoped}} that the Shire Highlands would become an area for {{large-scale}} European settlement; he later considered it was too unhealthy and had a large African population who required a sufficient land for their own use, although his successors did not share this view. Further land alienations were much smaller. Around 250,000 acres of former Crown Lands were sold as <b>freehold</b> land or <b>leased,</b> and almost 400,000 acres more originally in Certificates of Claim were sold or leased in holdings whose average size was around 1,000 acres, many representing smaller farms of Europeans coming to Nyasaland after the First World War to grow tobacco. As late as 1920, a Land Commission {{set up by the}} Nyasaland authorities proposed further land alienation to promote the development of small to medium size European plantations from the 700,000 acres of Crown Land which it said were available after the present and future needs of the African people were met.

30|$|The {{communal}} {{grazing area}} around Ghanzi borders other contrasting land use systems, mainly private <b>freehold</b> and <b>leased</b> ranches, WMAs and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. With such {{close proximity to}} each other, the area experiences human-wildlife conflict. There is inevitable loss of livestock to predation by carnivores such as lions (Panthera leo), wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), brown hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea), spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). The livestock-carnivore conflict is undoubtedly an emotive issue. Tourism generates significant revenue for Botswana’s economy and {{is second only to}} the mining sector. Furthermore, wildlife tourism is seen as a viable diversification option away from the predominantly diamond mining-dependent economy. On the other hand, livestock are the backbone of subsistence pastoral livelihoods, and thus, losses, particularly from carnivore predation, are rarely tolerated or accepted (GoB 2005). To a small-scale farmer, loss of even one animal can translate into significant economic and social costs, while outsiders may view this simply on numerical terms and classify it as insignificant. All livestock are affected by predation, though calves, goats and sheep are particularly vulnerable and thus targeted. Also, it emerged that pastoral households whose animals are not protected at night by enclosures/kraals or those with kraals that are not predator-proof suffer the most losses. If kraals are not properly constructed or maintained, predators can find an opening in the perimeter lining, or dig under the kraal and gain access, or simply climb/leap over. Hyenas were the predators singled out for causing the most livestock losses, and households showed greater animosity towards them. On some occasions, animals are targeted during daylight if no herding is done due to lack of reliable labour or if no guard dogs are used.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} {{collection}} in this series, are {{the records of}} the Middlesex Deeds Register. By the Middlesex Registry Act 1708 a registry was established for the registration of all deeds, conveyances, wills, encumbrances etc., affecting <b>freehold</b> land and <b>leased</b> land for periods of 21 years or more, within the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto pieces of parchment called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and a description of the property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.|$|R
40|$|New Zealand has a {{total area}} of 66. 4 million acres, of which 44 million are {{classified}} as occupied farm land. More than 40 per cent of this latter area is held under leasehold tenure. The Crown is the landlord of 14. 9 million acres which are let under several forms of leasing arrangement. In recent years there have been marked increases in land prices throughout New Zealand. A result {{of this has been}} a substantial increase in rents, which has caused many farmers to become disaffected with leasehold tenure. The Committee of Investigation into Rentals and <b>Freeholding</b> of Crown <b>Leases</b> (1968), convened by the Minister of Lands, studied this problem and has forwarded to Parliament recommendations for an amendment to the 1948 Land Act. The subject of this study is Crown Renewable lease tenure and its effect on farm investment. It falls naturally into three parts: firstly, a descriptive section providing a resume of the history of land tenure in New Zealand, and defining the terms of Crown Renewable lease tenure. The second part investigates the micro-economic aspects of this form of tenancy. This section takes as given the terms of the lease and investigates various courses of action at the farm level. A case study approach is used to explore the economics of alternative investment opportunities open to an individual lessee. In the third part, macro-economic aspects of Crown Renewable lease tenure are investigated. This section examines whether or not this form of tenure promotes efficient resource allocation, and is concerned with the community's point of view rather than that of the individual...|$|R
40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} August 1987 Swaziland's Fourth National Development Plan advocates {{the development}} of outgrower schemes based on the example of Vuvulane Irrigated Farms as an alternative strategy for rural development (Swaziland government 1985 : 309). If this recommendation were to be adopted as agricultural policy, it would necessitate land reform in the areas where these schemes are to be established. This {{is because of the}} existing division in land ownership between Swazi Nation Land and freehold Title Deed Land. Swazi Nation Land is held by the King "in trust" for "the nation" and allocated through chiefs to Swazi subjects. Private property in land in Swaziland dates to the concessionary era when large scale concessions were made to European land speculators and prospective farmers {{in the late nineteenth century}} by King Mbandzeni. Contrary to what has been argued in much of the literature on Swaziland, this land division has not entailed {{the development of}} dualism in agriculture, with the "modern" agricultural sector based on freehold title deed land and the "traditional" sector on Swazi Nation Land (SNL). Rather, both the land division and dualism are products of the development of capitalist relations which have generated an uneven and differential development characterised by the evolution of large-scale multinational and South African dominated enterprises on freehold land, and the development of petty commodity production on SNL. One question arising out of the advocation of the development of outgrower schemes and various forms of contract farming in Swaziland relating to land tenure, is whether or not such schemes can be established on SNL. To put it more specifically: is private ownership in land a pre-requisite for the establishment of viable contract farming schemes? This study will show that while <b>freehold</b> land <b>leased</b> out to petty commodity producers is undoubtedly advantageous for the owners of capital, in terms of the extra control which can be exerted over petty commodity producers, this is by no means a pre-requisite for the development of outgrower schemes. While it will be demonstrated that land tenure is not indicative of the form of production which takes place in agriculture, the chief concern of this paper is to examine the extent to which outgrower schemes in Swaziland have succeeded in their stated objectives of bringing "commercial farming" to the peasantry. The key question which emerges is whether or not outgrower schemes facilitate peasant accumulation and create the conditions for the reproduction of a rich and/or middle peasantry. Answers to these questions will be sought through an examination of three outgrower schemes. Two of these, (Vuvulane Irrigated Farms and Mpetsheni Pineapple Settlement Scheme) are on freehold Title Deed Land, while one (Casalee Tobacco Project) is on both freehold and SNL where petty commodity producing participants are based. The paper argues that contract farming and outgrower schemes are best understood in the context of the social relations to which this form of capitalist development in agriculture gives rise. Such schemes have differentiating effects and create the conditions for the reproduction of a middle peasantry, as well as the potential for more systematic accumulation by peasant producers. In Swaziland land tenure both on SNL and freehold title deed land, through restricting the size of land holdings of scheme participants, may have constraining effects on the extent to which accumulation becomes possible for petty commodity producers on such schemes...|$|R
40|$|Photographs {{taken in}} the early 1900 's of 100 ft long Blue Gum piles {{produced}} by the Gray Brothers mills of " Quiet Corner" Adventure Bay, Bruny Island. The logs were destined for contracts to supply hewn Piles, 18 x 18 and 20 x 20, and up to lOO feet in length, for the Admiralty Harbour Works being carried out by Messrs. S. Pearson and Son. Ltd., at Dover, England, and for {{a contract with the}} firm of Sir John Jackson, Ltd., for similar Harbour Works at Simon's Town, South Africa. The Hobart Mercury of Monday 8 th June 1903 reported that the Gray Brothers, at their mill at Adventure Bay, which is on the open sea side of Bruni Island, have, of late, had their names prominently before the public in connection with several big contracts they executed, notably, their supply of piles and other timber for the great harbour works at Dover, England. The brothers (Messrs. Henty G. and Fred. Gray), with Mr. Fred. Gray as mill manager, have been operating here for about 15 years, having about 500 acres of <b>freehold</b> land, and <b>leased</b> over 1, 500 acres of immense beds of timber lands from the Crown, the trees being principally stringy bark and blue gum. Their tram lines branch into a dense forest, in different directions, for about two miles, some of the trees being 8 ft. in diameter, 250 ft. to 300 ft. high, from which a clear run of timber, without a limb, to the extent of over 100 ft., is often secured. As to the mill, it has powerful machinery. There are two immense vertical frames worked, one of which carries breakdown saw, and the other a set of "flitching" saws Then come the usual circular "bench" ripping saws, and a steam cross-cut, attachable to the log skids, which facilitates the cutting of large quantities of timber to any uniform length desired. A new Tangye engine, of 30 -horse power, has just been put down, for driving the machinery, whilst in the forest they have a powerful steam bush hauler at work, to pull the felled logs up to the tram line. About 30 hands are employed (for whom workmen's cottages are provided), and about 50, 000 ft. super. of sawn timber is the quantity put out in a week; but frequently great hewn piles for harbour works are also handled by the firm and shipped. The selection of these is a great point, and in this the lengthy experience and judgment of Messrs Gray Brothers (who {{have spent a lot of}} money in equipment and obtaining the necessary gear), stand them in good stead. For instance, the piles they sent to Dover (England), they were informed, gave great satisfaction, being well selected. They have recently been engaged in supplying great hewn logs and sawn timber for Simons- town (South Africa) Admiralty works, and have already despatched one cargo by the Lady Palmerston (1, 300 tons), and are now loading the ship Emily Reed (1, 500 tons), to be followed by a third cargo about September next, for England. Most of the hewn piles to supply this order are obtained from Flinder's Bay, on the peninsula. Timber of various kinds is also supplied for the Tasmanian and inter-state building trade. The deep water jetty has recently been lengthened to 500 ft, where vessels can come alongside, drawing over 16 ft of water, the jetty being capable of holding a stack of 400, 000 ft of timber. The bay is sheltered from most winds, and is a historical spot, having been the first landing place in Tasmania of the great circumnavigator, Captain Cook, and only the other day some relics of that memorable landing here were found. There are 16 workmen's cottages on the property, and stabling for 16 horses. Telephonic communication with Hobart (where the firm has its chief business office, in the charge of Mr. W. G. Andrewartha), and other centres, has recently been installed. The firm have just finished supplying large hewn timber for Stanley breakwater. It was from here that the Broken Hill Mining Company got a lot of their timber, and that piles for the Prince's Wharf extension and the Alexandra pier, Hobart, were obtained.
