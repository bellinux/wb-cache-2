40|$|A single-column {{method to}} purify the CP 43 and CP 47 pigment-protein {{complexes}} of photo-system (PS) II from higher plants is presented. To validate the isolation procedure, three different species were used (Spinacea oleracea, Beta vulgaris, and Glycine max), and the procedure worked similarly with all three. Oxygen-evolving core complex obtained from highly enriched PSII membrane fragments {{were used as}} the starting material. The core complex is treated with the chaotropic agent LiClO 4 and the nonionic detergent n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside. After dialysis against buffer with no detergent or chaotropic agent, the solubilized material is separated by weak anion-exchange chromatography using a TSK-GEL Toyopearl DEAE 650 s column. CP 43 complex does not bind to the column and elutes with the first pigmented fractions. When the eluate becomes colorless, the column is subjected to a 0 - 175 mM LiClO 4 linear gradient. The main pigment <b>elution</b> <b>band</b> corresponds to CP 47 complex. The last pigmented <b>elution</b> <b>band</b> contains both reaction center-CP 47 and reaction center complexes.

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} technique, two-dimensional correlation gel permeation chromatography (2 D correlation GPC), {{has been}} used to elucidate intricate details of the two-step (I and II) polymerization of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluoro-octyltriethoxysilane (PFOTES) catalyzed by 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 M HCl・H 2 O over a time period of 600 - 14400 s. The 2 D GPC correlation results demonstrate that each <b>elution</b> <b>band</b> (particularly, in step II) consists of two (reactive and nonreactive) components and that a higher HCl concentration enhances the correlation of the reactive component with other bands. It is suggested that rapid growth of the polymeric aggregates in step II may be caused by the appearance of these reactive components...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{models of}} both {{packed-bed}} and stacked-membrane chromatography typically attribute <b>elution</b> <b>band</b> broadening to non-idealities within the column. However, when the column length to diameter ratio is greatly reduced, as in stacked-membrane chromatography, variations in solute residence times within the feed-distribution (inlet) and eluent-collection (outlet) manifolds can {{also contribute to}} band broadening. We report on a new zonal rate model (ZRM) for stacked-membrane chromatography that improves on existing hold-up volume models that rely on one plug-flow reactor and one stirred-tank reactor in series to describe dispersion of solute during transport {{into and out of}} the column. The ZRM radially partitions the membrane stack and the hold-up volumes within the inlet and outlet manifolds into zones to better capture non-uniform flow distribution effects associated with the large column diameter to height ratio. Breakthrough curves from a scaled-down anion-exchange membrane chromatography module using ovalbumin as a model protein were collected at flow rates ranging from 1. 5 to 20 mL min(- 1) under non-binding conditions and used to evaluate the ZRM as well as previous models. The ZRM was shown to be significantly more accurate in describing protein dispersion and breakthrough. The model was then used to decompose breakthrough data, where it was found that variations in solute residence time distributions within the inlet and outlet manifolds make the dominant contribution to solute dispersion over the recommended range of feed flow rates. The ZRM therefore identifies manifold design as a critical contributor to separation quality within stacked-membrane chromatography units...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{behavior of}} proline under hydrophilic interaction chromatography conditions was investigated from six aqueous solutions of acetonitrile. Proline adsorption isotherms were recorded at each mobile phase composition by frontal analysis and inverse method. The BET model {{was found to}} be the best choice to describe the nonlinear behavior of proline adsorption under hydrophilic interaction chromatography conditions. The adsorption isotherm parameters were derived from two independent parameter estimation methods. The parameters derived from regression analysis of the frontal analysis data and from overloaded <b>elution</b> <b>bands</b> were found to be in good agreement with the excess isotherm of water. The mobile phase composition at which the maximum excess adsorption of water was observed corresponded to the maximum saturation capacity measured for proline...|$|R
40|$|A novel two-zone model (TZM) is {{presented}} to describe the rate of solute uptake by the stationary phase of a sorption-type chromatography column. The TZM divides the porous stationary-phase particle into an inner protein-free core and an outer protein-containing zone where intraparticle transport is limited by pore diffusion and binding follows Langmuir theory. The TZM and the classic pore-diffusion model (PDM) of chromatography are applied {{to the prediction of}} stationary-phase uptake and <b>elution</b> <b>bands</b> within a cellulose-based affinity chromatography column designed to selectively purify proteins genetically labelled with a CBM 9 (family 9 cellulose binding module) affinity tag. Under both linear and nonlinear loading conditions, the TZM closely matches rates of protein uptake within the stationary phase particles as measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy, while the PDM deviates from experiment in the linear-binding region. As a result, the TZM is shown to provide improved predictions of product breakthrough, including elution behavior from a bacterial lysate feed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} a large project {{initiated}} by the French Nuclear Agency, and concerns {{the development of a}} new electrolyte system for the separation of lanthanides by isotachophoresis. This new system is based on a leading electrolyte that incorporates 2 -hydroxy- 2 -methylbutyric acid as complexing agent. The optimization of separation conditions (complexing agent concentration, pH, capillary dimensions, injection conditions, and current intensity) performed by experiments on a commercial capillary instrument with contactless conductivity detection, which allows to improve the separation of 13 lanthanides (La to Lu, except Pm and Ho). We have also directly coupled the isotachophoresis to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to visualize the mono-elementary <b>elution</b> <b>bands</b> and demonstrate the potentiality of the method for isotope ratio measurements.

40|$|The Zonal Rate Model (ZRM) has {{previously}} been shown to accurately account for contributions to <b>elution</b> <b>band</b> broadening, including external flow nonidealities and radial concentration gradients, in ion-exchange membrane (IEXM) chromatography systems operated under nonbinding conditions. Here, we extend the ZRM to analyze and model the behavior of retained proteins by introducing terms for intra-column mass transfer resistances and intrinsic binding kinetics. Breakthrough curve (BTC) data from a scaled-down anion-exchange membrane chromatography module using ovalbumin as a model protein were collected at flow rates ranging from 1. 5 to 20 mL min(- 1). Through its careful accounting of transport nonidealities within and external to the membrane stack, the ZRM is shown to provide a useful framework for characterizing putative protein binding mechanisms and models, for predicting BTCs and complex elution behavior, including the common observation that the dynamic binding capacity can increase with linear velocity in IEXM systems, and for simulating and scaling separations using IEXM chromatography. Global fitting of model parameters is {{used to evaluate the}} performance of the Langmuir, bi-Langmuir, steric mass action (SMA), and spreading-type protein binding models in either correlating or fundamentally describing BTC data. When combined with the ZRM, the bi-Langmuir, and SMA models match the chromatography data, but require physically unrealistic regressed model parameters to do so. In contrast, for this system a spreading-type model is shown to accurately predict column performance while also providing a realistic fundamental explanation for observed trends, including an observed increase in dynamic binding capacity with flow rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{general rate}} model {{provides}} a reliable platform to predict <b>elution</b> <b>bands</b> in both linear and non-linear chromatography provided the required equilibrium functions and the coefficients quantifying the mass transfer {{in and around}} the particles are available. If further the variation of the equilibrium functions with changes in the mobile phase composition is known, this model is also able to predict gradient elution chromatography. Significant disadvantages of the model are the need to specify three kinetic coefficients and the amount of computing time required for the numerical solution of the underlying equations. Thus, several simplified models have been suggested lumping mass transfer resistances together. In this work the accuracy of predicting chromatographic bands based on the numerical solution of two lumped models has been analyzed. Elution profiles calculated by (a) the transport-dispersive and (b) the equilibrium-dispersive models were compared between each other and with the solution of the more detailed general rate model. In the analysis performed both linear and non-linear chromatography was considered under isocratic and gradient conditions. copyright 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Two major {{development}} {{areas in}} HPLC-NMR hyphenation are postcolumn solid-phase extraction (HPLC-SPE-NMR) and capillary separations with NMR detection {{by means of}} solenoidal microcoils (CapNMR). These two techniques were combined off-line into HPLC-SPE-CapNMR, which combines the advantage of high loadability of normal-bore HPLC columns with high mass sensitivity of capillary NMR probes with an active volume of 1. 5 mu L. The technique was used for rapid identification of complex sesquiterpene lactones and esterified phenylpropanoids present in an essentially crude plant extract (toluene fraction of an ethanolic extract of Thapsia garganica fruits). Elution profiles of 10 x 1 mm i. d. SPE cartridges filled with poly(divinylbenzene) resin {{were found to be}} only marginally broader than those observed upon direct injection of 6 -mu L samples into the probe. Thus, the technique focuses analytes emerging in the HPLC <b>elution</b> <b>bands</b> of 0. 5 - 1 mL into volumes of similar to 10 mu L, compatible with the CapNMR probe. Using this technique, nine natural products (1 - 9) present in the plant extract in amounts varying from 0. 1 to 20 % were identified by means of 1 D and 2 D NMR spectra, supported by parallel HPLC-ESIMS measurements. Therefore, HPLC-SPE-CapNMR should be regarded as an attractive alternative to other applications of CapNMR for mixture analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Marine {{biofouling}} on {{the surface}} of ship hull causes the hydrodynamic drag, fuel increase, and higher costs. In this case antifouling paint is often used to protect the submerged surface from marine organisms. In traditional antifouling paints, toxic biocides have been banned due to their severe environmental pollution. To develop novel environmental benign antifouling agents has been our pursuit, and among them, active substances from marine organism for antifouling application are our research focus. In the paper, a natural material in halobios was isolated from a kind of algae Ulva pertusa, which is the most common green alga. The antifouling activities of their extracts were screened by bioassays with two kinds of fouling organisms, diatom and mussel. The crude extract of ethyl acetate was found to be most active against diatom. Silica gel column chromatography (SGCC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to further isolate the extract of ethyl acetate. In the SGCC extraction, four <b>elution</b> <b>bands</b> were collected, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against diatom were determined. Among the four bands, the lowest MIC is 0. 7 mg/mL, related to the band YC-EA. The YC-EA band was separated into four parts, and the second part (EE 2) showed an inhibitive effect on the settlement of diatom and mussel. The natural product of EE 2 can be characterized by a coupled liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results demonstrated that there are antifouling active substances among extracts of Ulva pertusa. Compounds would be a potentially natural antifouling material, resulting in higher standards of environmental safety with outstanding antifouling performance...|$|R

Further purification to homogeneity resulted from gel <b>elution</b> of single <b>bands</b> from native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The identity of the polypeptide was confirmed in western blots using antibodies raised against soybean nodule sucrose synthase. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 6. 4 (cleavage direction) and an isoelectric point of 5. 5. The affinity of the enzyme for sucrose (Km) was estimated at 169 mm, and for UDP at 0. 2 mm.

40|$|Two {{immunogenic}} proteins from a crude extract of Nocardia brasiliensis were purified to homogeneity. A 61 -kDa protein (P 61) {{was isolated}} from a 50 % ammonium sulfate precipitate in two steps. Initially, P 61 {{was obtained by}} electroelution in a 10 % nondenatured preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). In a second step, the eluate from the nondenatured gel was run in a 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) preparative polyacrylamide gel.

Also, a 24 -kDa immunogenic protein (P 24) was isolated by gel filtration in a Sephadex G- 100 column and then by electroelution in a 12 % nondenatured polyacrylamide gel. In a previous paper, we showed by Western blot assays that these proteins are recognized by the sera of mycetoma patients and not by sera from mycobacterial-infected or healthy individuals.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether the large (5 - to 15 -fold) stimulation of synthesis of growth hormone (somatotropin) observed upon exposure of {{a strain of}} rat pituitary (GH 3) cells to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) arises from a stimulation of pregrowth hormone mRNA. A good agreement was observed between the stimulation of growth hormone synthesis and the stimulation of cytoplasmic levels of pregrowth hormone mRNA, assayed by translation in wheat germ extracts. Electrophoresis on formamide-acrylamide gels of oligo(dT) -treated membrane fraction RNA revealed a band that was induced by dexamethasone to about the same extent as was translatable pregrowth hormone mRNA. <b>Elution</b> of the <b>band</b> and translation in wheat germ extracts showed directly that it contained pregrowth hormone mRNA. These {{results suggest that the}} dexamethasone induction of growth hormone synthesis in GH 3 cells arises from an accumulation of pregrowth hormone mRNA in the cytoplasm of the cells.

40|$|In {{addition}} to ion exchange processes nowadays already considered as classical methods (determination of total salt content, eliminating of inter-fering ions, desalting etc.) ion exchange chromatography {{has become one}} of the most important field of modern analytics regarding both its wideranging applicability and its capacity. Ion exchange chromatography and modern instrumental analytics complete each other. Small quantities of ions and compounds haying similar behayiour and interfering effect to one another, by rapid and accurate deter-mination with optical, electrochemical and radiochemical methods, can be easily and most quickly separated by ion exchange chromatography. Principle of ion exchange chromatography is the following: A solution containing ions to be separated is poured on a column made of ion exchange resin in the npper part of which the ions will be bound. (In case of cations separation is performed on a cation exchange column.) Thereafter a solution of electrolyte containing from point of v-iew of the determination possibly indifferent ions is poured on the column. Dependent on the composition of poured solution there are two cases: The ions of poured electrolyte bind them-selyes on the column either stronger or less strongly than the ions to be sepa-rated. In the first case ions of the poured solutions displace the ions to be separated in succession due to the strength of binding. (Displacing chroma-tography.) In the other case the ions to be separated moye likewise on the effect of the eluent but with yarying rate. (<b>Elution</b> chromatography.) <b>Bands</b> deyeloping on the column are passing with yarious rate towards the end of the column, and stepping out of it ions appear one after the other. Wnile in the first case quantitatiye separation cannot be attained in principle, in the second case the bands arc separating completely by the use of adequate long column. Formation of bands depends on two important factors.

40|$|Different {{parts of}} the rice (Oryza sativa L.) plant at {{different}} growth stages were analyzed for sucrose synthase (SS) by enzyme activity assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay directly on the extracts or on the eluates from a gel filtration column. On a dry matter basis, the amount of soluble protein and SS activity decreased significantly, but the amount of enzyme protein changed little in growing leaves. In the grain, the SS activity was the highest at the early ripening stage and decreased later, but the amount of SS protein increased {{with the increase in}} maturity. In the root, a low activity of SS was detectable only in the tillering but not in other stages. Immunoblotting of SS protein extracted from different parts of rice showed two <b>bands.</b> <b>Elution</b> patterns of crude extracts from a gel filtration column showed the presence of several types of SS protein.

40|$|AbstractThe {{oligomeric}} {{state and}} function of band 3, purified by sulfhydryl affinity chromatography in reduced Triton X- 100, was investigated. Size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography showed that a homogeneous population of band 3 dimers could be purified from whole erythrocyte membranes. The <b>elution</b> profile of <b>band</b> 3 purified from membranes that had been stripped of its cytoskeleton before solubilization was a broad single peak describing a heterogeneous population of oligomers with a mean Stokes radius of 100 Å. Sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation analysis confirmed particle heterogeneity and further showed monomer/dimer/tetramer equilibrium self-association. Whether the conversion of dimer to the form described by a Stokes radius of 100 Å was initiated by removal of cytoskeletal components, alkali-induced changes in band 3 conformation, or alkali-induced loss of copurifying ligands remains unclear. After incubation at 20 °C for 24 h, both preparations of band 3 converted to a common form characterized by a mean Stokes radius of 114 Å. This form of the protein, examined by equilibrium sedimentation ultracentrifugation, is able to self-associate reversibly, and the self-association can be described by a dimer/tetramer/hexamer model, although the presence of higher oligomers cannot be discounted. The ability of the different forms of the protein to bind stilbene disulfonates revealed that the dimer had the highest inhibitor binding affinity, and the form characterized by a mean Stokes radius of 114 Å to have the lowest...|$|R
40|$|NAD(P) H {{dehydrogenase}} (EC 1. 6. 99. 2) purified from rat liver cytosol revealed three discrete bands, of mol. wts. about 27000, 18000 and 9000, when {{subjected to}} polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis {{in the presence}} of sodium dodecyl sulphate. <b>Elution</b> of the <b>bands</b> from the gel and individual re-electrophoresis on separate gels showed that the 27000 -mol. wt. band yielded three bands similar to those obtained with the intact enzyme, whereas the 18000 -mol. wt. band retained its characteristic mobility. Amino acid analysis of native enzyme and protein extracted from each of the three bands from sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gels suggests that the native enzyme is composed of two subunits and that each subunit consists of two dissimilar non-covalently bound polypeptides, so that altogether the enzyme is composed of four polypeptides, two of mol. wt. 18000 and two of mol. wt. 9000. NAD(P) H dehydrogenase was active over a wide pH range with no sharp optimum. The same Km value for NADH but different values for Vmax. were obtained for the enzyme purified from Sprague–Dawley and Wistar rats. In immunodiffusion, however, the enzymes from the two rat strains showed a reaction of complete identity. NAD(P) H dehydrogenase was effectively inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents, indicating that the activity is dependent on free thiol group(s). By amino acid analysis six cysteine residues were found per mol of enzyme. Guanidino-group- and amino-group-selective reagents had only moderate inactivating effects on the enzyme activity...|$|R
