40|$|OBJECTIVE: Development {{of methods}} for {{building}} concept models to support structured data entry and image retrieval in chest radiography. DESIGN: An organizing model for chest-radiographic reporting {{was built by}} analyzing manually a set of natural-language chest-radiograph reports. During model building, clinician-informaticians judged alternative conceptual structures according to four criteria: content of clinically relevant <b>detail,</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> semantic constraints, <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> canonical forms, and simplicity. The organizing model was applied in representing three sample reports in their entirety. To explore the potential for automatic model discovery, the representation of one sample report was compared with the noun phrases derived from the same report by the CLARIT natural-language processing system. RESULTS: The organizing model for chest-radiographic reporting consists of 62 concept types and 17 relations, arranged in an inheritance network. The broadest types in the model include finding, anatomic locus, procedure, attribute, and status. Diagnoses are modeled as a subtype of finding. Representing three sample reports in their entirety added 79 narrower concept types. Some CLARIT noun phrases suggested valid associations among subtypes of finding, status, and anatomic locus. CONCLUSIONS: A manual modeling process utilizing explicitly stated criteria for making modeling decisions produced an organizing model that showed consistency in early testing. A combination of top-down and bottom-up modeling was required. Natural-language processing may inform model building, but algorithms that would replace manual modeling were not discovered. Further progress in modeling will require methods for objective model evaluation and tools for formalizing the model-building process...|$|R
40|$|Current {{building}} {{regulations for}} design against progressive collapse normally use prescriptive rules and risk based qualitative scales which are insufficient to cover current needs in design. Structural robustness of concrete flat slab structures is examined using different theoretical models {{to capture the}} dynamic behavior under accidental events. In such extreme events, the large dynamic reactions at the connections could potentially lead to punching and progressive collapse. Punching formulae based on load-deformation response relationships such as the Critical Shear Crack Theory (CSCT) are particularly useful in dynamic situations. The Ductility-Centred Robustness Assessment developed at Imperial College London is also used in this paper to derive simple design formulae to assess punching of adjacent columns in the sudden column removal scenario which is commonly adopted in practice. The approach can be extended to assess flat slab systems upon considering membrane action in the slab and post-punching behavior in the connections. Analytical models for tensile membrane are used {{in combination with the}} CSCT to demonstrate that the tying forces required in codes of practice cannot be achieved without prior punching of the connections. It is also shown that numerical modelling of post-punching is a promising tool to review <b>detailing</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> integrity reinforcement...|$|R

30|$|Surface {{coal mines}} prior to 1950 in the United States were {{generally}} left {{with little to}} no reclamation. As government regulations progressed, mining companies were required to backfill the area and plant grasses or trees (Gorman et al. 2001; Skousen et al. 2006). During the ensuing 30  years, more requirements were instituted to promote reclamation and some states had more stringent laws and regulations, and some had a reclamation bond. When the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was passed in 1977 (SMCRA), the United States mining companies were required to post a reclamation bond {{as part of the}} mining permit to ensure that the regulatory authority would have sufficient funds to reclaim the site if the company failed to complete the reclamation plan approved in the permit. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established the legal requirement of reclamation bonds and created a federal agency to implement the provisions of the act (Code of Federal Regulations Title 30, Chapter 25, Section  1259). This federal agency, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), has established <b>detailed</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> reclamation bonds (Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 2000 a, b). ‘Primacy’ means that a state assumes the primary enforcement responsibility.
