5|$|After this, No. 6 Commando was put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> mobile {{reserve in}} an effort to {{maintain}} the unit's integrity and spare it from incurring further losses that might render it unable to remain in the line. Nevertheless, throughout March and into April they continued to carry out patrol operations around Goubellat and Ben Arada. Finally, in early April {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the commandos from the fighting in North Africa. Lacking the administrative support and reinforcements of regular infantry units, the unit's strength had fallen to just 150 men and as a result it was no longer considered effective. On 7 April, No. 6 Commando arrived in Algiers, where it remained for two weeks before embarking on HMT Staffordshire on 24 April. After a short voyage, it arrived back in the United Kingdom on 2 May 1943 to begin preparations for the invasion of German-occupied France.|$|E
5|$|Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As {{he settled}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> archbishop, {{he seems to}} have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his reign, Caracalla {{declared}} divine support for Egyptian deity Serapisa god of healing. The Iseum et Serapeum in Alexandria was apparently renovated during Caracalla's co-rule with his father Septimius Severus. The evidence for this exists in two inscriptions found near the temple that appear to bear their names. Additional archaeological evidence exists for this {{in the form of}} two papyrii that have been dated to the Severan period and also two statues associated with the temple that have been dated to around 200AD. Upon Caracalla's ascension to sole ruler in 212, the imperial mint began striking coins bearing Serapis' image. This was a reflection of the god's central role during Caracalla's reign. After Geta's death, the weapon that had killed him was dedicated to Serapis by Caracalla. This was most likely done to cast Serapis <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> Caracalla's protector from treachery.|$|E

5|$|The Sonderweg {{hypothesis}} attributed Germany's difficult 20th {{century to}} the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire. The Prussian landed elites, the Junkers, retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state. The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed their power {{to the absence of}} a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes, or by peasants in combination with the urban workers, in 1848 and again in 1871. Recent research <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a social group. This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the industrial leadership (the latter particularly important in the Rhineland) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire.|$|E

5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E

40|$|Plant {{epidermal}} trichomes are {{as varied}} in morphology {{as they are}} in function. In the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, specialized trichomes called epidermal bladder cells (EBC) line the surface of leaves and stems, and increase dramatically in size and volume upon plant salt-treatment. These cells have been proposed to have roles in plant defense and UV protection, but primarily in sodium sequestration and as water reservoirs. To gain further understanding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> EBC, a cell-type-specific proteomics approach was taken in which precision single-cell sampling of cell sap from individual EBC was combined with shotgun peptide sequencing (LC-MS/MS). Identified proteins showed diverse biological functions and cellular locations, with a high representation of proteins involved in H+-transport, carbohydrate metabolism, and photosynthesis. The proteome of EBC provides insight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> these cells in ion and water homeostasis and raises the possibility that they are photosynthetically active and functioning in Crassulacean acid metabolism...|$|R

Doctor’s dissertation, ISSN 1652 - 6880, ISBN 978 - 91 - 576 - 7380 - 0 <b>The</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> {{plant hormones}} in wood {{development has been}} studied for decades, and their crosstalk in many biological processes {{is the subject of}} increasing focus. In this thesis, modern biological tools have been used to provide novel insights <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins and ethylene in wood formation in the model tree Populus tremula x tremuloides. A new idea describing the crosstalk between gibberellins (GAs) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) is presented. It is demonstrated that GAs stimulate polar IAA transport in secondary stems of Populus, a stimuli likely to be caused by the enhanced expression of the auxin efflux carrier PttPIN 1. Extensive crosstalk between the two hormones is also suggested from global gene transcript analysis of GA and IAA regulated genes in Populus stem tissues. Most genes that were induced by GA were similarly induced by IAA, suggestin...|$|R
