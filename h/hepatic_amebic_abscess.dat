40|$|Seven {{patients}} with amebic liver abscess presenting as pleuropulmonary disease were admitted to hospital initially because of pulmonary symptoms and {{were found to}} have amebic liver disease. Three categories of pleuropulmonary involvement included reactive inflammation of the pleura or lung, rupture of a hepatic abscess into the pleural space and rupture of a hepatic abscess into the bronchial airways. The preferred medical treatment is with metronidazole, but rupture of <b>hepatic</b> <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess</b> into the pleural space requires drainage in addition to medical therapy. In contrast, rupture into the bronchus may provide spontaneous drainage so that only medical therapy is needed. Recovery from amebiasis in all three categories is generally complete. Morbidity and mortality increase with failure to correctly identify amebic infection of the liver as the underlying cause. Because, in new cases, no findings specifically suggest that pleuropulmonary disease is a complication of <b>hepatic</b> <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess,</b> this possibility needs to be considered, especially in persons who are at risk of having been infected with amebae...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} five years, ten {{documented}} cases of <b>hepatic</b> <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess</b> have required surgical intervention at Olive View Hospital, Van Nuys, California. Three of the patients underwent laparotomy when an hepatic abscess ruptured into the peritoneal cavity, and two required surgical intervention when an abscess invaded adjacent organs. Another abscess continued to enlarge despite metronidazole therapy and still another became superinfected with bacteria. In the remaining three patients, surgical procedure would have been avoided if the correct diagnosis had been made. In fact, the preoperative diagnosis in five cases was acute appendicitis. All patients survived. The incidence of Entamoeba histolytica infestation is increasing in our community. Although most patients rapidly improve with metronidazole therapy, surgical complications do arise and diagnoses are missed. This series of cases emphasizes the need for surgeons working in Southern California to familiarize themselves with the clinical features, complications and appropriate surgical treatment of amebiasis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Amoebic liver abscess is {{the most}} common manifestation of extra-intestinal amebiasis. Although a high {{prevalence}} of intestinal amebiasis is reported in Ethiopia, information about the prevalence of confirmed <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> is very scanty. Our previous study using the molecular technique proved that there is a considerable over diagnosis of intestinal amebiasis by using microscopy alone, while cases of truly invasive Entamoeba histolytica appear to be very rare. Objective: To assess the occurrence of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> among admitted patients at Tikur Anbessa Hospital. Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted from clinical records of patients who were admitted to the medical wards of Tikur Anbessa Hospital, on suspeced cases of liver abscess over a 20 year period, from 1982 to 2002. Results: Only 47 suspected liver abscess cases; (2 suspected liver abscess per 5854 patients per year) were admitted and treated in Tikur Anbessa Hospital in the past 20 years. Liver abscess appears to be rare among patients admitted in the hospital. The most frequent diagnosis of liver <b>abscess</b> was of <b>amebic</b> origin 35 (74 %). Conclusion: The total number of <b>hepatic</b> <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> is extremely low considering the high number of reported intestinal amebiasis cases by microscopy in routine laboratory diagnosis, suggesting overdiagnosis.

40|$|The human immune {{mechanisms}} {{effective against}} the destructive parasite Entamoeba histolytica {{have not been}} established.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Amebiasis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Entamoeba histolytica. It most commonly results in asymptomatic colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, but some patients develop intestinal invasive or extra-intestinal diseases. Liver abscess {{is the most}} common extra-intestinal manifestation. The large number of clinical presentations of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> makes the diagnosis very challenging in non-endemic countries. Late diagnosis of the <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess</b> may lead to perforation and amebic peritonitis, resulting in high mortality rates. Case presentation This report describes a 37 -year-old white man, suffering from hepatitis B, with a gigantic <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> presenting as an acute abdomen due to its rupture. Rapid deterioration of the patient's condition and acute abdomen led to an emergency operation. A large volume of free fluid together with debris was found at the moment of entry into the peritoneal cavity because of a rupture of the hepatic abscess at the position of the segment VIII. Surgical drainage of the hepatic abscess was performed; two wide drains were placed in the remaining hepatic cavities and one on the right hemithorax. The patient was hospitalized in the ICU for 14 days and for another 14 days in our department. The diagnosis of <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess</b> was made by the pathologists who identified E. histolytica in the debris. Conclusion Acute abdomen due to a ruptured <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> is extremely rare in western countries where the parasite is not endemic. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are fundamental to preserving the patient's life since the mortality rates remain extremely high when untreated, even nowadays. </p...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytes from {{patients}} cured of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> proliferate and produce gamma interferon upon incubation with soluble Entamoeba histolytica antigen: however, <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> exhibit a relentless progression without treatment. To determine whether suppressive factors {{are present in}} sera, we studied T-lymphocyte responses to total soluble E. histolytica antigen by using cells from five patients treated for <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> {{in the presence of}} 15 different immune sera and 10 control sera. In the presence of immune sera, E. histolytica antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation decreased by 63 % and production of gamma interferon was reduced by 93. 2 % (P less than 0. 01). Immune sera had no effect on the mitogenic responses of patient lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin or on the proliferative responses of control lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin or tetanus toxoid. The suppressive activity of immune sera diminished as the time between therapy for <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> and serum collection increased (P less than 0. 05). Suppressive activity did not correlate with the titers of serum anti-amebic antibody and was not affected when serum was absorbed with viable amebic trophozoites. In conclusion, soluble factors present in the sera of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients suppressed in vitro lymphocyte responses to E. histolytica antigen and {{may have contributed to the}} lack of development of effective in vivo cell-mediated immune responses following the onset of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: The non {{invasive}} {{diagnosis of}} <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> allows {{the use of}} empirical therapy without the requirement of invasive diagnostic procedures. Aim: To determine the discriminatory capacity of clinical, laboratory and ultrasound studies for the etiological diagnosis of liver abscess. Patients and methods: Sixty one patients were initially included in this prospective study, but 12 did not comply with the inclusion criteria. Of the rest, 29 (59 %) had an <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess,</b> 16 (33 %) had a pyogenic liver abscess and four (8 %) had an abscess of mixed etiology. Blood cultures were done in 42 patients. Ultrasound guided needle aspiration was done in 7 patients with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and 13 patients with non <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Results: The clinical picture and ultrasound fndings were similar in all types of <b>amebic</b> <b>abscess.</b> ELISA test for IgG anti-Entamoeba histolytica antibodies were positive in 100 % of patients with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Antibodies measured by gel diffusion were positive in 93 %.

Here, we study the clinical presentations of 62 Thai patients with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> We also compare the clinical presentations of Anti HIV seronegative and Anti HIV seropositive patients. Methods A retrospective case review was carried out for 62 Thai patients who had been diagnosed with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Clinical information was collected, including symptoms and signs, location and number of abscesses. The Anti HIV serology laboratory investigation was also reviewed. Results According to our study, the common clinical symptoms and signs are abdominal pain (85. 5 %), fever and chills (74. 2 %), and abdominal tenderness (69. 4 %). The location of the abscess was predominantly in the right lobe (74. 2 %), and most of patients had a single abscess (77. 4 %). Similar trends in clinical presentations were observed in both Anti HIV seropositive and Anti HIV seronegative subjects. Conclusions In conclusion, the clinical presentations of our <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients were similar to those in previous reports.

40|$|A noninvasive {{diagnostic}} test for <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> is needed, because <b>amebic</b> and bacterial <b>abscesses</b> appear identical on ultrasound or computer tomography {{and because it}} is rarely possible to identify Entamoeba histolytica in stool specimens from patients with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Here we report a method of detection in serum of circulating E. histolytica Gal/GalNAc lectin to diagnose <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess,</b> which was used in patients from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The TechLab E. histolytica II test (which differentiates the true pathogen E. histolytica from Entamoeba dispar) detected Gal/GalNAc lectin in the sera of 22 of 23 (96 %) <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients tested prior to treatment with the antiamebic drug metronidazole and 0 of 70 (0 %) controls. After 1 week of treatment with metronidazole, 9 of 11 (82 %) patients became serum lectin antigen negative. The sensitivity of the E. histolytica II antigen detection test for intestinal infection was also evaluated. Antigen detection identified E. histolytica infection in 50 samples from 1, 164 asymptomatic preschool children aged 2 to 5 years, including 16 of 16 (100 %) culture-positive specimens. PCR analysis of stool specimens was used to confirm that most antigen-positive but culture-negative specimens were true-positive: PCR identified parasite DNA in 27 of 34 (79 %) of the antigen-positive, culture-negative stool specimens. Antigen detection was a more sensitive test for infection than antilectin antibodies, which were detected in only 76 of 98 (78 %) <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients and in 26 of 50 (52 %) patients with intestinal infection.

A total of 98 <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and 28 <b>amebic</b> colitis patients and 43 control subjects were examined. The real-time PCR assay detected E. histolytica DNA in 49 %, 77 %, and 69 % of blood, urine, and saliva specimens from the <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> patients. For <b>amebic</b> colitis the sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay for detection of E. histolytica DNA in blood, urine, and saliva was 36 %, 61 %, and 64 %, respectively.

40|$|The goal of {{our study}} was to obtain a highly conserved Entamoeba histolytica {{recombinant}} antigen for study as a subunit amebiasis vaccine. We screened a Uni-Zap cDNA library of E. histolytica (strain HM 1 :IMSS) with human immune sera and isolated a dominant 804 -bp cDNA clone. A 33 -kDa fusion protein expressed from the cDNA clone was determined by monoclonal antibody binding, DNA hybridization, and nucleotide sequence to be the complete E. histolytica 29 -kDa antigen. Serum antibodies to the recombinant protein were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 80 % of subjects from Egypt and South Africa with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Similar results were found with the native 29 -kDa protein. Native and recombinant 29 -kDa antigens induced proliferation of lymphocytes harvested from patients with <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> (P < 0. 01 compared with controls). Intraperitoneal immunization of gerbils with the recombinant fusion protein (10 mg) with Titermax adjuvant elicited an antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin G antibody response and was partially protective (54 %) against intrahepatic challenge with 5 3 105 virulent axenic trophozoites (strain HM 1 :IMSS). In summary, the recombinant form of the E. histolytica 29 -kDa antigen demonstrated serologic specificity for <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess,</b> exhibited conserved T-cell epitopes, and was effective as a subunit vaccine in an experimental animal model of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Entamoeba histolytica is a widespread enteric protozoan tha...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Men {{are more}} than 7 {{times more likely to}} develop <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> or <b>amebic</b> {{dysentery}} caused by Entamoeba histolytica than women. Because the complement system could {{play a key role in}} controlling amebiasis, we determined whether serum from men and women differ in the ability to kill amebic trophozoites. We found that serum from women was significantly more effective in killing E. histolytica trophozoites than serum from men, and this killing was complement dependent. Our results provide a possible explanation for the differential susceptibility of men and women to <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and <b>amebic</b> colitis. Amebic dysentery and <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 Interestingly, the prevalence of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and <b>amebic</b> dysentery is between 5 - and 7 -fold higher in men than women. 2 The reason for the greater susceptibility to disease in men is un-known, particularly because there does not seem to be a dif-ference between men and women in the rates of intestinal colonization by E. histolytica. 2 To invade through the intesti-nal mucosa and survive within the portal circulation to estab-lish infection within the liver, E. histolytica trophozoites must resist killing by complement. 1 We tested the hypothesis that differences between men and women in the efficiency of complement-mediated killing of amebic trophozoites might explain the varying susceptibility of the sexes to <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and <b>amebic</b> colitis. We obtained serum samples from 100 consecutively en-rolled healthy volunteers from an area that is not endemic for amebiasis, and examined the efficiency of their sera in killing amebic trophozoites.

We used affinity-purified antibodies against a recombinant E. histolytica cysteine proteinase to demonstrate that the proteinase is present extracellularly in <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses</b> in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID mice). Treatment of E. histolytica trophozoites with specific cysteine proteinase inhibitor E- 64 blocked or greatly reduced liver abscess formation at 48 h in SCID mice. Our study suggests an important role for a functional cysteine proteinase in <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> formation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> is {{characterized}} by extensive areas of dead hepatocytes that form cavities surrounded by a thin rim of inflammatory cells and few Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. E. histolytica produces pore-forming proteins and proteinases, but how trophozoites actually kill host cells has been unclear. Here, we report that E. histolytica induces apoptosis in both inflammatory cells and hepatocytes in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> By studying infection in C 57 /BL 6. lpr and C 57 /BL 6. gld mice, we found that E. histolytica-induced apoptosis {{does not require the}} Fas/Fas ligand pathway of apoptosis, and by using mice with a targeted deletion of the tumor necrosis factor receptor I gene, we have shown that E. histolytica-induced apoptosis is not mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Our data indicate that apoptosis plays a prominent role in the host cell death seen in <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> in a mouse model of disease and suggest that E. histolytica induces cell death without using two common pathways for apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Entamoeba histolytica causes extensive {{morbidity and}} mortality through intestinal infection and <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess.</b> Here we show that immunization of gerbils with a single keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled 25 -mer peptide derived from the 170 -kDa subunit of the E. histolytica galactose-binding adhesin is sufficient to confer substantial protection against experimentally induced <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscesses.</b> Vaccination provided total protection in 5 of 15 immunized gerbils, and abscesses were significantly smaller (P < 0. 01) in the remaining vaccinated animals. The degree of protection correlated with the titer of antibodies to the peptide, and results of passive transfer experiments performed with SCID mice were consistent with a role for antibodies in protection. In addition, parenteral or oral vaccination of gerbils with 13 -amino-acid subfragments of the peptide N-terminally fused to the B subunit of cholera toxin also significantly inhibited liver abscess formation (P < 0. 05). These data indicate that small peptides derived from the galactose-binding adhesin administered by the parenteral or oral route can provide protection against <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> and {{should be considered as}} components of a subunit vaccine against invasive amoebiasis...|$|R
30|$|Based on the anamnestic, {{clinical}} and ultrasound findings, a presumptive diagnosis of <b>amebic</b> liver <b>abscess</b> was made. The treatment with intravenous metronidazole was started. Clinical condition gradually improved with {{the disappearance of}} fever and pain. The patient was discharged on hospital day 10.|$|R
