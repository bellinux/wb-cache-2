If the decontamination treatment is not applied properly, the untreated areas of the carcass will still have high bacterial loads present and could be a source for recontamination of the areas that have been treated. A sanitizer spraying system (sanitizing halo system) was designed and assembled. The sanitizing halo system was tested at the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center, Texas A&M University. Thirteen carcasses were split in halves. Thirteen halves were sampled and used as control after knife trimming and water wash; then they were sprayed with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C with the sanitizing halo system. The other 13 halves were sprayed by the RMSTC employees utilizing a <b>hand</b> held <b>sprayer.</b> Counts of aerobic and mesophilic bacteria obtained from carcasses sprayed with the sanitizing halo system and the <b>hand</b> held <b>sprayer</b> were both {{significantly lower than the}} control counts. In addition, coliforms counts were below the detectable limit for the sanitizing halo system and the <b>hand</b> held <b>sprayer.</b> After testing, the sanitizing halo system was installed at two small commercial slaughter plants processing beef and pork carcasses. At each slaughter plant, 24 carcass halves were treated with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C using the sanitizing halo system, and the other 24 halves were used as control. Mesophilic bacteria populations were reduced in beef and pork carcasses by 2. 9 and 1. 9 log cycles, respectively, after the lactic acid treatment.

Some applications includes pest control: mosquito control, bird control, agricultural applications such as grain storage, disinfectant purposes such as hospitals and laboratories, mold control and surface decontamination. A specific application for ULV machines that have been well researched is protecting avocado trees from different diseases. The most common diseases that these trees are prone to suffer from includes Cercospora spot, anthracnose and stem-end rot. The diseases affecting the avocado trees are controlled by applying high volume copper oxychloride fungicides to the trees. The original application techniques included the use of a <b>hand</b> gun <b>sprayer.</b> This technique posed the problem of high run-off of the formulation. The use of ULV machines for the application of the pesticide formulation yielded more than 80 percent healthy fruit that was free from Cercospora spot.

Rough-leaved dogwood is difficult to control with a single herbicide application, but treatments exist that will substantially reduce stands. Tebuthiuron pellets (Spike 20 P) are another control measure recommended for rough-leaved dogwood. Treatments of 4. 4 kg ai/ha (3 / 4 oz per 100 square feet) tebuthiuron pellets were applied in December 2004. A visual estimate of control indicated tebuthiuron reduced dogwood cover by 65 % compared to a 3 % decrease on untreated plots. Dogwood density was reduced by 2. 2 stems/m 2 (P< 0. 08). Total woody plant cover increased on untreated plots by 6. 2 percentage units, but was decreased by 20. 9 percentage units on tebuthiuron treated plots.

An experiment was conducted to check the foliar application of NAA on growth and yield components of cotton variety Bt. 121 under field condition at research area of agriculture farm near Cholistan Institute of Desert Studies (CIDS), The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan. The experiment was comprised of foliar application of NAA (1 %) viz. T 0 (control), T 1 (One spray of NAA), T 2 (Two sprays of NAA), T 3 (Three sprays of NAA), T 4 (Four sprays of NAA). The first foliar spray was applied at 45 days after sowing (DAS) and later on it was continued with 15 days interval with skilled labour by <b>hand</b> pump <b>sprayer.</b> The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design and each treatment was replicated three times. Data recorded on growth, chlorophyll contents, yield and yield components showed a significant increase with the application of NAA. Furthermore, earliness index, mean maturity date and production rate index were also influenced with foliar application of NAA. On the basis of growth and yield parameters {{it can be concluded}} that four spray of NAA (1 %) can be applied commercially under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying dermal {{exposure}} to pesticides in farming systems {{in developing countries}} is of special interest for the estimation of potential health risks, especially {{when there is a}} lack of occupational hygiene regulations. In this paper we present the results of a {{dermal exposure}} assessment for the potato farming system in the highlands of Colombia, where farmers apply pesticides with <b>hand</b> pressure <b>sprayers</b> without any personal protective equipment. The fractioning of the pesticide, in terms of potential and actual dermal exposure, was determined via the whole-body dosimetry methodology, using the tracer uranine as pesticide surrogate, and luminescence spectrometry as analytical method. We assessed the three activities involved in pesticide management: preparation, application, and cleaning; analyzed three types of nozzles: one with a standard discharge and two modified by farmers to increase the discharge; and derived the protection factor given by work clothing. Our results suggest that to reduce the health risk, three aspects have to be considered: (i) avoiding the modification of nozzles, which affects the droplet size spectrum and increases the level of dermal exposure; (ii) using adequate work clothing made of thick fabrics, especially on the upper body parts; and (iii) cleaning properly the tank sprayer before the application activity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Small scale farmers, in {{developing}} and in some developed countries, are faced to actual difficulties of applying pesticides accurately and safely on vegetables crops. They mainly use <b>hand</b> operated <b>sprayers.</b> As an issue, a small direct injection system based on a five meter's parallel boom layout was designed to improve chemical application. The boom layout was optimised to obtain the same minimal lag time response for the ten nozzles. The dynamic of the system was modelled using SimulinkTM as first order model with delay. Two control strategies were implemented using PID feedback control loops to monitor tracer injection (fluorescing) proportionally to simulated forward speed (from 0. 6 to 1. 2 m/s) and to control the constant operating pressure (constant carrier flow strategy) or the variable operating pressure proportionally to the injected chemical amount (variable total flow strategy). Different forward speed changes were induced using steps up and down, ramps, sine waves and sweeps solicitations to evaluate the control feedback. The system stability was tested {{for its ability to}} maintain the expected concentration and application rate. The results show that the lag time remains less than 3 s (dead time < 2 s, time constant < 1 s) and the syste...|$|R
30|$|Whole and {{fractionated}} {{samples were}} tested for plant response using a foliar application on corn (Zea mays L.) seeds {{treated with a}} pesticide package (to give healthy, pathogen-free seeds). Planting pots (18  cm diameter) filled with a vermiculite (grade 2, ULINE) substrate media were used, and 8 seeds were planted per pot. There were 3 replicate pots per treatment (including the control). Emergence was allowed to progress for 6  days, and then seedlings were thinned (to allow more space for root growth), from 24 to 10 seedlings per treatment. The seedlings continued to grow for another 8  days, and then the foliar treatment was applied. The DOC concentrations of all 8 samples (whole, acid-insoluble, acid-soluble, and the 5 filtrate : retentate ratios of 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100) were normalized, and then 2 DOC rates {{were used for the}} foliar application: 0.01 and 0.1  mg/L C (UHQ water was used for the control). By using the same number of sprays from a <b>hand</b> <b>sprayer</b> containing the specified DOC value of each sample, 7  mL of each sample at each concentration were sprayed onto the plant foliage of each pot, ensuring adequate and uniform coverage of the plant leaves without inducing dripping or runoff of the product from the leaf margins. The plants continued to grow for another 7  days, and then the plants were harvested to evaluate their response to the treatment. Previous experiments (data not shown) have indicated that 7  days is the optimal amount of time post foliar application for this pot size. This time frame is long enough for the root system to grow and respond without the occurrence of root knotting but not so long that the plants become stressed {{due to the lack of}} macronutrients.|$|E
40|$|Broad {{host range}} of entomopathogenic fungi {{may have a}} {{commercial}} advantage for biological control industry. In addition, all entomopathogenic fungi rely {{on a combination of}} different enzymes to penetrate their hosts and these enzymes {{play an important role in}} the host range of fungal isolates. The aim of this study is to determine the potential of three Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vull. isolates in control of Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) and to determine their lipase, chitinase, and protease activities. For this purpose, B. bassiana (PaF 04, PaF 09 and PaF 76) isolates, which was previously demonstrated to have entomopathogenic activity against Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera were chosen. T. urticae was used as the test organisms. Three different suspensions (1 x 106, 1 x 107 and 1 x 108 conidia ml- 1) were prepared in Tween 80. 2 ml suspension of a single dose was sprayed onto down sides of bean leaf discs using <b>hand</b> <b>sprayer.</b> Mortality rates of T. urticae, in terms of LT 50 values, were recorded daily for 5 days. Enzyme activities were investigated by petri plate assays and clear zones formed around the colonies indicated enzymatic activities. All tested fungal isolates were pathogenic to the T. urticae causing mortality between 64. 2 ± 5. 6 % and 100 % on the 5 th day after the application. LT 50 values varied between 3. 16 ± 0. 2 and 3. 72 ± 0. 5 days. Mortality caused by PaF 04 isolate was found to be significantly different (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, PaF isolates of B. bassiana have been determined to have potential to suppress T. urticae, in addition to their potential in control of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera. The present results showed that the isolates used, especially PaF 04, have a broad host range...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Safe working {{conditions}} {{are essential for}} healthy living and for ensuring food security among farmers and farm communities in developing countries. There is limited research on this topic, and documentation is essential to understand and change patterns of human health and safety. Methods: In May 2014, six male and female farmers on four dairy farms in Uganda and a female veterinarian were interviewed about their awareness and attitudes to agricultural risk factors, health, and safety. In addition, transect walks were conducted on the four dairy farms. Results: The dairy farmers reported health and safety concerns, e. g., diarrhea, coughs, fever, cuts while using machetes in plantations, bruises when handling animals, and dizziness and poisoning symptoms from using different agrochemicals, and considered these an occupational hazard. The most important topic mentioned {{was the use of}} agrochemicals and drugs on livestock. The farmers spray their animals with insecticides to prevent ticks, lice, tsetse flies, and other biting nuisance flies, using a backpack or <b>hand</b> <b>sprayer.</b> Spraying is conducted without personal protection equipment, which is considered too expensive and difficult to obtain. The farmers reported that they usually feel dizzy, vomit, and have pain and a burning feeling in their face and eyes after spraying. The symptoms are sometimes so severe that they require treatment. In such cases, the farmers buy medication without a prescription at the local drugstore, where the storekeeper often has limited or no knowledge of agrochemicals or drugs except for dosage. Agricultural health and safety training in the region is non-existent, and the farmers expressed a need and desire for improvements in this area. Conclusion: The level of knowledge and awareness of agricultural health and safety risks, disease, and injury prevention among the Ugandan dairy farmers interviewed was low. The farmers mentioned few agriculture-related complaints, injuries, or diseases except poisoning from using agrochemicals. Training on health and safety in Ugandan agriculture is urgently needed...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to establish the}} extent of pesticide exposure in a farming community. Cholinesterase (ChE) activity in whole blood {{was used as a}} marker for assessing exposure to pesticides. Complete data were gathered for 63 farmers at Akumadan (exposed) and 58 control subjects at Tono, both prominent vegetable farming communities in Ghana, by means of a questionnaire and blood cholinesterase analyses (acetylcholine-assay). Although whole blood ChE was significantly lower in the exposed than the control participants, it was not significantly correlated with either confounders of age, sex, body weight, and height or high risks practices. The high risks practices revealed during the survey included lack of use of personal protective clothing, short re-entry intervals, and wrong direction of spraying of pesticides by <b>hand</b> or knapsack <b>sprayer.</b> About 97 % of exposed participants had experienced symptoms attributable to pesticide exposure. The frequent symptoms were reported as weakness and headache. There is the need to review safety precautions in the use and application of pesticides in Ghana...|$|R
