After seducing Kratos, Aphrodite directed him to her estranged husband. She is the only god that Kratos did not kill that was present <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War III.

5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. <b>In</b> <b>God</b> of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him aside in the Underworld. <b>In</b> <b>God</b> of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche.

5000|$|Suk and Tamargo {{suggested}} that Michelangelo concealed a sophisticated {{image of the}} undersurface of the brainstem <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> neck and that by following Michelangelo's lines <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> neck, one can outline an anatomically correct image of the brainstem, cerebellum, temporal lobes, and optic chiasm. In addition, they {{suggested that}} Michelangelo also included an anterior view of the spinal cord <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> chest and {{an image of the}} optic nerves and globes <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> abdomen. They showed how a [...] "shadow analysis" [...] of the unusual lines <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> neck correspond to specific spaces around the brainstem known as the [...] "arachnoid cisterns," [...] which were described in detail much later in 1875 but which Michelangelo inadvertently depicted <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> neck since he was able to render images with almost photographic accuracy. They concluded that [...] "being a painter of genius, a master anatomist, and a deeply religious man, Michelangelo cleverly enhanced his depiction of <b>God</b> <b>in</b> the iconographically critical panels on the Sistine Chapel vault with concealed images of the brain and in this way celebrated not only the glory of God, but also that of His most magnificent creation." ...|$|R

5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War. Gold orbs found <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War II and Ascension, and white orbs <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E
5|$|Hera– Zeus' jaded {{wife and}} former Queen of the Gods. In Betrayal, Hera's giant pet Argos {{was sent by}} the Gods to stop Kratos' rampage across Greece. <b>In</b> <b>God</b> of War III, the drunken goddess ordered the demigod Hercules to kill Kratos, but Kratos killed Hercules. When {{encountered}} in her gardens, a drunken Hera insulted Pandora, resulting in Kratos killing her, which ended all plant life.

Hermes participated in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Danaus to be his champion. <b>In</b> <b>God</b> of War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about murdering his family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia. Kratos eventually caught Hermes off guard, killed him, which released a plague on the world, and took his boots, the Boots of Hermes, as his own. The character was voiced by Greg Ellis <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War III.|$|E

50|$|However, the Gaon and Elyashiv {{held that}} tzimtzum only took place <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> will (Ratzon), {{but that it}} is {{impossible}} to say anything at all about God himself (Atzmus). Thus, they did not actually believe in a literal tzimtzum <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> essence. Luria's Etz Chaim itself, however, in the First Shaar, is ambivalent: in one place it speaks of a literal tzimtzum <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> essence and self, then it changes a few lines later to a tzimtzum in the Divine Light (an emanated, hence created and not part of God's self, energy).|$|R
5|$|Medusa– The former Queen of the Gorgons. She was decapitated by Kratos <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War at the {{directive}} of Aphrodite; Kratos took {{her head as}} a weapon to turn enemies to stone.|$|E

5|$|Poseidon– The former God of the Sea. Poseidon {{also participated}} in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Herodius as his champion. Herodius was killed by Kratos, causing Poseidon to release his hippocampus to destroy Kratos' ship, but Kratos and his men managed to escape. After becoming the champion of the gods, Poseidon later tasked Kratos with slaying the Hydra <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War and granted him the magic, Poseidon's Rage. Poseidon came to resent Kratos {{for his role in}} the destruction of Atlantis in Ghost of Sparta, and, <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War III, he was killed by Kratos during the Spartan's assault on Olympus, which caused the oceans to flood the world. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Poseidon is one of the four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was originally voiced by Fred Tatasciore <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War. Gideon Emery took over the role <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War III, and continued it in Ghost of Sparta and Ascension.|$|E

5|$|The Titan Oceanus was sketched by Erik San Juan and was {{originally}} intended to appear <b>in</b> <b>God</b> of War II in a completely watery form with no feet.
