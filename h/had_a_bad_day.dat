5|$|England {{maintained}} their newly confident approach, being on top {{for most of}} the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day</b> and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match.|$|E

2500|$|In stage 5, Pinotti and Sivtsov both {{finished}} with the first large group on the road, over the numerous unpaved or 'white' roads into Orvieto. Their group afforded solo stage winner Pieter Weening sufficient time that he took the next pink jersey, but the two HTC-Highroad men remained extremely well-placed in second and third overall, just two seconds back. Pinotti <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day</b> on Etna in stage 9, finishing five minutes back of stage winner, new race leader, and eventual Giro champion Alberto Contador, and between three and four minutes behind the race's other top riders. The result dropped him to 25th overall, but Sivtsov remained in second place, the only rider within a minute of Contador. This difficult mountain stage nearly brought Cavendish's Giro to an end as well, as his group, which also contained Raboň, Rasmussen, and Renshaw, finished just 30 seconds inside the minimum survival time based on the stage winner's time. Rival sprinter Francisco Ventoso from [...] claimed that Cavendish should have been disqualified anyway, saying that the Manxman had illegally used the race caravan for slipstreams on his ascent of Etna. Stage 10 after the rest day {{was one of the}} few seemingly straightforward sprint stages in this Giro. When former race leader David Millar attacked out of the peloton just outside the [...] to go marker, HTC-Highroad was the team to chase him down. While they did successfully bring him back, this left their vaunted leadout train disorganized. Only Cavendish, Sivtsov, and Pinotti {{finished with}} the front group. Nonetheless, Cavendish was able to surge past Petacchi, who had been left for an early sprint by his leadout man Danilo Hondo, to claim his first victory of the race. He took the opportunity after the stage to address Ventoso's remarks, claiming that because of his star status he is always led by race officials and photographers, even when at the very back of the race. Cavendish added another win in stage 12, the last flat stage before a crushingly difficult final week and a half. He was very nearly caught in the sprint by 's Davide Appollonio, but he edged out the young Italian for a second stage victory. Cavendish, and several other sprinters, left the Giro the next day.|$|E

6000|$|I had {{a friend}} once, an angler, who in winter was fond of another sport. He liked to cast his louis into the green baize pond at Monte Carlo, and, on the whole, he was {{generally}} [...] "broken." [...] He seldom landed the golden fish of the old man's dream in Theocritus. When the croupier had gaffed all his money he would repent and say, [...] "Now, that would have kept me at Loch Leven for a fortnight." [...] One used to wonder whether a fortnight of Loch Leven was worth an afternoon of the pleasure of losing at Monte Carlo. The loch has a name for being cockneyfied, beset by whole fleets of competitive anglers from various angling clubs in Scotland. That men should competitively angle shows, indeed, a great want of true angling sentiment. To fish in a crowd is odious, to work hard for prizes of flasks and creels and fly-books is to mistake {{the true meaning of}} the pastime. However, in this crowded age men are so constituted that they like to turn a contemplative exercise into a kind of Bank Holiday. There is no use in arguing with such persons; the worst of their pleasure is that it tends to change a Scotch loch into something like the pond of the Welsh Harp, at Hendon. It is always good news to read in the papers how the Dundee Walton Society <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day,</b> and how the first prize was won by Mr. Macneesh, with five trout weighing three pounds and three quarters. Loch Leven, then, is crowded and cockneyfied by competitions; it has also no great name for beauty of landscape. Every one to his own taste in natural beauty, but in this respect I think Loch Leven is better than its reputation. It is certainly more pictorial, so to speak, than some remote moor lochs up near Cape Wrath; Forsinard in particular, where the scenery looks like one gigantic series of brown [...] "baps," [...] flat Scotch scones, all of low elevation, all precisely similar to each other.|$|E
