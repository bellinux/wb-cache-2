40|$|The {{selectivity}} {{characteristics of}} 4 juvenile fish <b>escape</b> <b>panel</b> designs and their utility for {{the regulation of}} a multi-species demersal trap fishery were evaluated using a suite of objective socio-economic and biological criteria. The panel designs consisted of a control (type A) which had a hexagonal mesh size which {{was the same as}} that of the body of the trap (3. 5 cm), a rectangular mesh (type B) which was representative of the current regulation (5. 0 x 7. 6 cm) and 2 escape panels with square meshes of 7. 5 x 7. 5 cm (type C) and 10. 0 x 10. 0 cm (type D). The results demonstrated that there was only a limited reduction in the proportion of juvenile fish and by-catch retained for the existing juvenile <b>escape</b> <b>panel</b> design (type B). Furthermore, as the selectivity characteristics for the key species (Epinephelus coioides and Diagramma pictum) were similar to the control type, the predicted increases in yields, revenues and spawning stock biomass were small by comparison. The <b>escape</b> <b>panel</b> with the largest mesh size (type D) retained the least un-utilized and discarded by-catch. Whilst simulations predicted the highest spawner biomass per recruit, long term yields and revenues for the key species, its use was associated with a dramatic short-term decline in revenues which were 23. 3 % of the value of the control type. Traps fitted with the type C which had a square mesh of 7. 5 x 7. 5 cm had the lowest juvenile retention and the highest overall score for all the assessment criteria combined. The study provides an empirical basis for gear regulations for the demersal trap fishery of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the wider Arabian Gulf region...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the reduction in bycatch and the loss of target catch in trawl hauls for three commercial crustacean species (yellow squat lobster, Cervimunida johni, nylon shrimp, Heterocarpus reedi, and red squat lobster, Pleuroncodes monodon) in central Chile. Two experiments were carried out using the covered codend method; the first used different mesh sizes (56 and 70 mm, knot-centre to knot-centre) and shapes (diamond and square), and the second tested different reduction devices (<b>escape</b> <b>panel</b> and sorting grid). We analysed the escape proportions of the species caught and the size frequency distributions of the target species and Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi), the main commercial bycatch species. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to significantly reduce bycatch while keeping losses within acceptable ranges. In particular, the best option for yellow squat lobster was the combination of a 70 -mm diamond mesh with an <b>escape</b> <b>panel</b> that reduced non-target and target catches by 48 % and 7 %, respectively. For nylon shrimp, the best option was the use of a 56 -mm diamond mesh with a sorting grid that reduced non-target and target catches by 41 % and 11 %, respectively. Although the results for red squat lobster were not as promising, they will help to guide future research...|$|E
40|$|Though the {{commercial}} value per pound of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) {{is greater than}} that of most target species in trawl fisheries off Alaska, halibut retention is prohibited for trawlers and individual groundfish target trawl fisheries are subject to closure if they attain either their seasonal or annual limit of allowed halibut bycatch mortality. Although all groundfish fisheries catch considerable amounts of halibut as bycatch, only longline fishermen holding quota share in the individual fishing quota (IFQ) program are allowed to retain halibut in the federally managed fisheries off Alaska. To avoid catching halibut, trawl fishermen voluntarily developed a rigid grate system and <b>escape</b> <b>panel</b> which are installed ahead of the trawl “codend”. The bycatch reduction device was then formally tested by an industry trade association in conjunction with a National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) fishing gear researcher under an Experimental Fishing Permit in 1998. Results from the experiment showed the device excluded 94 % of the halibut while only releasing 38 % of the target flatfish. Linear simulations of the fishery were developed to estimate the potential benefit of the grate. Results indicated that fleet-wide use of the grate would result in a 171 % increase in the duration of the fishery, a 61 % increase in target flatfish catch, and a 71 % reduction in overall halibut bycatch. Other simulations demonstrated a high incentive for individual noncompliance. Factors affecting incentives for voluntary or regulatory use of bycatch reduction devices are explored in detail {{within the context of the}} highly regulated flatfish fisheries under federal management off Alaska...|$|E

40|$|The discard of finfish bycatch in the Gulf of Maine, {{northern}} shrimp trawl fishery {{is considered a}} serious problem. The species specific discard rate varied from 17 % for winter flounder to 95 % for silver hake in fifty tows made by commercial trawlers during the period 1985 - 1989 (Howell and Langan, 1990). Studies by Jean (1963) and Howell and Langan (1987) suggest a very high mortality for discarded finfish in the Western North Atlantic fisheries. The discard problem has two major facets: direct wastage in throwing back fish into the sea and loss of future catches of larger animals through the mortality of small individuals (Saila 1983). Given the perceived problem of discarded bycatch in the Gulf of Maine shrimp fishery, {{the objective of this}} project was to experiment with several design modifications to existing traditional trawls that would reduce the juvenile finfish bycatch. The concept of selective shrimp trawls is not novel. Trawl design modifications have been evaluated in shrimp fisheries to separate the finfish from the shrimp with varying success. The techniques utilize behavioral and size differences between shrimp and finfish, and include horizontal separator twine <b>panels,</b> large mesh <b>escape</b> <b>panels,</b> deflecting grids, accelerator funnels, and others. In this project, the northern style shrimp trawls served as the control nets. The basic modifications evaluated were: large mesh in belly area and a funnel accelerator ahead of the trawl cod-end...|$|R
40|$|The {{off-shore}} demersal trap {{fishery in}} the southern Arabian Gulf has been managed by gear regulations and effort constraints which were aimed at rebuilding depleted stocks. In order to evaluate {{the success of these}} regulations, a variety of selectivity and other fishery metrics were compared for the key species (Diagramma pictum, Epinephelus coioides and Lethrinus nebulosus) before and after their introduction. With the exception of a minor increase in the mean age at first capture from 1. 3 yrs to 1. 9 yrs for E. coioides, there were no significant changes in the values or trends in juvenile retention, mean size or the mean sizes and ages at first capture. The comparison of selectivity ogives with data derived independently through an experimental fishing program indicated that the failure of juvenile <b>escape</b> <b>panels</b> to modify the selectivity characteristics of the fishery could not be attributed to a lack of compliance. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in fishing mortality rates, harvest rates, catch, effort, yield per recruit and relative spawner biomass per recruit following the introduction of the management regulations. Age structures were highly truncated and the management measures had failed to increase the relative proportion of older age classes. Stock status indicators suggested that all species were heavily over-exploited with evidence of both growth and recruitment over-fishing. Given the failure of existing regulations to modify gear selectivity, reduce effort and rebuild stocks, {{the results of the study}} suggest that management authorities should consider alternative measures including a moratorium on the use of traps in the off-shore demersal fishery of Abu Dhabi...|$|R
40|$|Allegations {{of growth}} {{overfishing}} of the already depleted snapper (Pagrus auratus) stock in Denham Sound, Shark Bay, Western Australia, due to prawn trawling, and concerns for by-catch species generally, {{led to the}} investigation of size-related catchability and cod-end selectivity of juvenile snapper and western butterfish (Pentapodus vitta). The cod-end selectivity of prawn trawling was investigated by fitting a fine-mesh cod-end cover to commercial trawl nets to measure the size of fish passing through the cod-end. A Leslie-Delury depletion experiment involving trawling the same area over four consecutive nights {{was used to determine}} the catchability coefficients of snapper and butterfish. The size of snapper and butterfish caught on the trawlable grounds ranged from 3 to 18 and 5 to 20 cm fork length (FL), respectively. Ontogenetic changes in habitat preference meant that snapper were susceptible to commercial trawling only between approximately 9 - 17 months of age. Retention of snapper and butterfish in the trawl nets increased with increasing length, with the deeper-bodied snapper retained at smaller lengths. Catchability coefficients also increased with fish length. A single trawl pass was estimated to remove up to 57 % and 52 % of juvenile snapper and butterfish, respectively. The rate of natural mortality (M) for juvenile snapper was estimated to be high; mean M = 2. 58 (92 % year- 1). Catchability of butterfish was low prior to their sexual maturation and trawling is assessed not to be a threat to this species. To reduce the impact of prawn trawling on snapper recruitment in Denham Sound, restricting trawling from areas where juvenile snapper are in high abundance, combined with fish <b>escape</b> <b>panels,</b> would be preferable to increasing mesh size in commercial trawl gear...|$|R

Yacht travel to Antarctica is also popular, with nearly all itineraries in the Antarctic Peninsula, and using Ushuaia, Argentina as a port. 3. 4. c. Pinnipeds There is potential for competition between Antarctic fur seals and the krill fishery. Krill (Euphausia superba) are a primary component of fur seal diet in Antarctic waters and depletion of krill or entanglement in trawls represent potential threats to fur seal populations. Fur seals also prey on myctophid fish and less commonly on other finfish species and cephalapods. Observers (UK) placed on krill fishing vessels fishing in CCAMLR Subarea 48. 3 in 2003 observed Antarctic fur seals taken as by-catch in the krill fishery. The take, however, was attributed {{to the absence of}} effective mitigation measures (<b>escape</b> <b>panels</b> in the nets) and lack of experience of crews new to the fishery. Experienced vessels, employing effective mitigation measures, caught no seals. The only pinniped species shown to have dietary overlap or toothfish in its diet is the southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina (SES). Studies, however, have shown toothfish to be only a minor component of elephant seal diet (Slip 1995, Van den Hoff et al. 2002, Bradshaw et al. 2003, Daneri & Carlini 2002, Daneri et al. 2000). Toothfish and SES may also compete for particular species of fish and cephalapods (Goldsworthy et al. 2001). Depletion of toothfish could potentially benefit SES. Caution should be taken in considering any information on SES diet. Studies of elephant seal diet are necessarily biased due to the long distances and time traveled between visits to shore for breeding and molting and therefore warrant caution when interpreting any trophic links between toothfish and elephant seals (Hindell et al. 2003, Reid & Nevitt 1998). All other Antarctic pinniped species are associated with ice. Fishery exploitation is confined to ice-free environments. Thus ice can be considered a refugia from fishing for pagophilic pinnipeds. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{fishery in}} the Baltic Sea requires fishing gear that fishes selectively {{and at the}} same time excludes raiding seals. A successful type of trap recently developed in response to the seal problem is the pontoon fish chamber, which significantly decreases damage to gear and catch losses caused by grey seals. However, a common problem with traps is the bycatch of juvenile and non-marketable fish which constitutes a threat to the sustainability of the fishery and a time-consuming problem for the fishers. This thesis deal with bycatch reduction of young herring, whitefish and perch in pontoon traps. Rigid grids and square mesh panels were installed in traps during commercial fishing operations and continuously monitored with underwater cameras. The selection efficiencies were calculated for different species and selection panel designs. The importance of abiotic and biotic factors for the selection efficiency, the diurnal activity levels of species, and the positions of escape through a selection panel were analysed. This thesis also addresses the survival changes of herring after being released from a trap and the potential size-structuring effects on the herring stock after a size-selective fishery. The results showed that several tonnes of young fish were able to <b>escape</b> through selection <b>panels</b> from the traps during a season. 70 - 80...|$|R
