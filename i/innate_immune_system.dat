5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} genes, as {{components of}} the antiviral <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> in many eukaryotes, are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells, particularly for plant viruses. Studies of evolutionary rates in Drosophila have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong directional selection and are among the fastest-evolving genes in the Drosophila genome.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and {{adaptive}} immune system.

Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E

5|$|Several {{invertebrate}} {{systems are}} considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens.

Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E

5|$|An evasion {{strategy}} used {{by several}} pathogens {{to avoid the}} <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms {{to protect themselves from}} the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).|$|E
5|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) {{possess an}} {{alternative}} T-cell receptor (TCR) {{as opposed to}} CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets {{are also part of}} the <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens.

A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E

We have also successfully revealed that an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), a member of mitogen-activated protein kinases, is located in an upstream of NF-kB activation induced by KLH. Furthermore, a Syk phosphorylation inhibitor partially suppressed the Erk activation in KLH-stimulated THP- 1. These results suggest that both Syk and Erk associate with the KLH-induced NF-kB activation in the human monocyte...|$|R

Interferon also activates the adaptive immune system, which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The antigen receptors on {{cells of}} <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> {{recognize}} broadly expressed markers on non-host cells while the receptors on lymphocytes of the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> display {{a higher level}} of specificity. Adaptive immunity, with its exquisite specificity and immunological memory, has only been found in the jawed vertebrates, which also display innate immunity. Jawless fishes and invertebrates only have innate immunity. In the adaptive immune response, T and B-lymphocytes detect foreign agents or antigens using T cell receptors (TCR) or immunoglobulins (Ig), respectively. While Ig can bind free intact antigens, TCR only binds processed antigenic fragments that are presented on molecules encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC molecules display variation through allelic polymorphism. A diverse repertoire of Ig and TCR molecules is generated by gene rearrangement and junctional diversity, processes carried out by the recombinase activating gene (RAG) products and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Thus, the molecules that define adaptive immunity are TCR, Ig, MHC molecules, RAG products and TdT. No direct predecessors of these molecules have been found in the jawless fishes or invertebrates. In contrast, the complement cascade can be activated by either adaptive or <b>innate</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> and contains examples of molecules that gradually evolved from non-immune functions to being part of the innate and then adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper we examine the molecules of the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and speculate on the existence of direct predecessors that were part of innate immunity...|$|R
