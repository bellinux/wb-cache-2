6000|$|... "Well; yes; she <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> I came {{to try and}} get {{you back}} to England. If you remain here, the climate and {{solitude}} together will kill you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, [...] "it is true {{that the}} two jailers who brought me here <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this, though whether those men are present I cannot say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That love is {{as strong}} a passion, at any rate, as {{drinking}} or gambling. You <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> {{and sent me}} away, and rebuked me because of that tradesman's daughter." ...|$|E
60|$|OCTAVIUS. [eagerly] About Ann! Oh, <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that, Mr Ramsden.|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. <b>Do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> your reasons. They would {{interest}} me enormously.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. [Going over to her.] What has happened? <b>Do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Joan at last, {{pleased with}} her success; [...] "another {{could have done}} it no betternot as well, I think. Tell mewhat is it you <b>did?</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> all." ...|$|E
60|$|PATRICIA. [Thinking.] Yes, you <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> a {{great deal}} of the truth. You told me {{hundreds}} and thousands of truths. But you never told me the truth that one wants to know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you well?" [...] said Amelia. [...] "I {{dare say}} you are. You don't love your husband. You {{would not be}} here if you <b>did.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> Rebecca, did I ever do you {{anything}} but kindness?" ...|$|E
60|$|P. S. <b>Do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{what kind}} of perfume does your wife use. I want to know.|$|R
25|$|CLI. O my Syrus, did you hear, <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me!</b> SYR. How could I not? I {{was there}} with you.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ponder it," [...] said he. [...] "It {{is an easy}} matter to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what I should <b>do.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> rather, {{how it should be}} done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did you {{not tell}} me about it, Bullen? It was a splendid thing to do. You <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> I remember, how you got the V.C. by helping to get an officer out of the grasp of the Afridis, but you gave no details." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I come {{to think}} of it, you <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> a curious story about a mysterious silver lode," [...] Stormont agreed. [...] "Somewhere in the North, wasn't it? Anyhow, I didn't give the thing much attention. You can hear tales of that kind in any miners' saloon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well she <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} about her," [...] Mrs. Thorpe-Satchell said, slowly, [...] "but, unfortunately, {{it will not}} help your friend. She only told me when I had promised unconditionally and upon my honour to keep her information a profound secret. So I am sorry, Francis, but even to you----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Pendleton! Oh, <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{all about}} him!" [...] flashed out Yerba, suddenly, with clasped hands and eager girlish breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--ah! The bishop wouldn't like it--wouldn't he? Now, <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> sir, {{what would}} the bishop do {{to you if you}} did hunt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What! You {{did not go}} with Lady Martindale and Theodora? I {{should like}} to have seen them dressed. <b>Do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how they looked.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Tell," [...] said Gessler, [...] "I cannot {{take that}} answer as the truth. I {{know there was}} some other meaning in what you <b>did.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> the reason without concealment. Why was it? Your life is safe, {{whatever}} it was, so speak out. Why did you take out that second arrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Rachel, who is he? I don't {{even know}} his name. I didn't believe it, when Dorothea told me; only as she <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I thought I ought to mention it. Oh dear, oh dear! I hope {{there is nothing}} wrong. You were always so good;--I can't believe {{anything}} wrong of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did not say; but he <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that when}} he returns he will have friends with him--a lady and two little children. They will be hungry and cold. I {{believe that they are}} in great danger now, and that the brave English gentleman means to take them away from this awful Paris to a place of safety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O aunt! <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what it was, and {{all about}} it," [...] said Mary, {{following}} her aunt, who went around dusting the furniture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who was there? I quite long to {{know all}} about it. I saw some account of it. Everything seemed to go off so well. <b>Do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who was there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, in short, Monsieur, now I {{think of}} it, you must live somewhere? <b>Do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where; and what {{establishment}} of servants do you keep?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think," [...] Father Adrian {{commenced}} slowly, [...] "that your {{father told me}} {{the whole history of}} his life. It was one episode only, the memory of which weighed heavily upon him as death drew near. He did not tell me all concerning it; what he <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I will try and repeat to you.|$|E
60|$|Railing for railing, I {{will not}} render, though {{one of these}} opposers, Mr. Dan. by name, <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> that Mr. Paul's reply when it came out, would {{sufficiently}} provoke me to so beastly a work: {{but what is the}} reason of his so writing, if not the peevishness of his own spirit, or the want of better matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "You spoke so lightly just now, sir, {{of dying}} in a ditch or palace," [...] Cornelius Beresteyn was saying, [...] "but you <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that day in Haarlem that you had kith and kindred in England. Where is that father of whom you spoke, and your mother who is a saint? Your irresponsible vagabondage will leave her in {{perpetual}} loneliness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{good people}} <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that you are}} one Doctors Hartley, sir. Now, my friend and I do not know Doctors Hartley at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{about the}} friend whom {{you were going}} to meet," [...] she said, smiling gaily at him, [...] "I hope--you really must not <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Blatherwick, that it was a lady!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Eva Gilson {{had been}} in Brooklyn within the month, and in a passion of remembrance of home, Claire cried, [...] "Oh, <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about everybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|The puffy {{features}} lighted up into warmth. 'Little Miss Gillian! And I {{am proud}} to see you! My little Maura <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that Miss Valetta was in her class at the High School; but I thought {{there was no one}} now who would come near the poor widow. And is your dear mamma here, Miss Gillian, and are she and your papa quite well?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did," [...] cried Cecil. [...] "He <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that {{he could}} not begin in {{freshness}} and warmth, like a young man; but I thought it only meant that we were too sensible to care about nonsense, and liked him for it. He always must have been staid and reserved--he could never have been different, Camilla. Don't smile in that way! Tell me what you mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They haven't {{all your}} courage, dear Briton," [...] she remarked, [...] "and if they <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so, I {{am not sure}} that I should be convinced. You see, most of my friends have lived so long and lived so quickly that they have learned to play with words until one never knows whether the things they speak come from their hearts. With you it is different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pray, <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me!</b> Why {{are they}} to be pacified? What is the matter? Do they think they shan't like me? Ought I to do anything?' ...|$|R
60|$|MARTHA--Yes--but I didn't {{mean he was}} a rough scene. He {{was very}} mild even in those days. <b>Do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what he was like at Cornell.|$|R
6000|$|Wife.--Nay, don't put me {{off with}} an answer that signifies nothing; <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what is the matter, for I am sure {{something}} extraordinary is the case--tell <b>me,</b> I say, <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> [Then she kisses him.] ...|$|R
