5000|$|... 1934: {{commencement}} of a geodetic survey triangulation program to connect Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia into one coherent network. All theodolites were Cooke, Troughton and Sims Tavistock 5 1/2 inch reading direct to half-second for first order work and 3 1/2 inch reading direct to one second for second order work. Baselines {{of four to}} six miles in length were placed every 200 to 250 miles and measured with <b>invar</b> <b>tapes</b> standardised by steel bands and the method of temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of measuring tapes. This method was first used near Millicent, South Australia after development by Professor Grant of University of Adelaide, research which was acknowledged as world class science and development.|$|R
40|$|The SPEAR {{machine was}} {{completed}} in 1972. It consists of a single ring about 80 meters in diameter and started its very productive life as a positron-electron collider circulating beams up to 4 GeV. Synchrotron radiation research began almost immediately parasitically, then as half the program in the 1980 s, and then became the whole program in 1991. The original network surveys used optical theodolites and <b>invar</b> <b>tapes</b> to place ring monuments in their ideal positions at constant offsets from the lines of ring quadrupoles. Optical tooling techniques were used to reference the monuments and survey offset targets on fixtures attached to the magnets. For more than 20 years neither the monuments nor magnets were restored to their ideal positions; the obvious discrepancies were simply ''feathered''. In 1992 SLC technology {{was used for the}} first time to re-measure the network and map the magnets. The discovery of many multiple-millimeter problems spurred planning for a 1995 global re-alignment. In 1995, all storage ring magnets and beamlines were mapped and moved. The band of displacements from ideal was reduced from about +/- 5 mm to +/- 0. 5 mm. Upon start-up, beam stored without correctors...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{concepts}} of precision surveying are briefly reviewed, and an historical account is given of instruments and techniques {{used during the}} construction of the Proton Synchrotron (1954 - 59), the Intersecting Storage Rings (1966 - 71), and the Super Proton Synchrotron (1971). A nylon wire device, distinvar, <b>invar</b> wire and <b>tape,</b> and recent automation of the gyrotheodolite and distinvar as well as auxiliary equipment (polyurethane jacks, Centipede) are discussed in detail. The paper ends summarizing the present accuracy in accelerator metrology, giving an outlook of possible improvement, and some aspects of staffing for the CERN Survey Group. (0 refs) ...|$|R
