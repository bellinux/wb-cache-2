At last, he called for a meeting on August 30, 1990, in Bristol, UK, with the presence of all the three major cue sports representatives, namely, carom, pool and snooker. As a result, it was decided to form the World Confederation of Billiard Sports (WCBS), an umbrella organization encompassing all billiards sports, and a three-man committee consisting of Gagnaux himself for Carom, Jorgen Sandman for Pool and Mark Wildman for Snooker was appointed in order to work out the first constitution, to serve as a guideline for this new body.
