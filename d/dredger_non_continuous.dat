That is, those defined through the {{expressions}} I(x, y) = S(N(x), T (x, y)) and I(x, y) = S(T (N(x), N(y)), y) respectively, where T is a t-norm, S is a t-conorm and N is a strong negation. Special attention {{is due to the}} relation between both kinds of implications. In the continuous case, the study of these implications is focused in some of their properties (mainly the contrapositive symmetry and the exchange principle). Finally, the case of <b>non</b> <b>continuous</b> t-norms or <b>non</b> <b>continuous</b> t-conorms is studied, deriving new implications of both kinds and showing that they remain strongly connected...|$|R

A new connectionist {{model for}} the {{solution}} of piecewise linear regression problems is introduced; {{it is able to}} reconstruct both <b>continuous</b> and <b>non</b> <b>continuous</b> real valued mappings starting from a finite set of possibly noisy samples. The approximating function can assume a different linear behavior in each region of an unknown polyhedral partition of the input domain. The proposed learning technique combines local estimation, clustering in weight space, multicategory classification and linear regression in order to achieve the desired result. Through this approach piecewise affine solutions for general nonlinear regression problems can also be found. ...|$|R

We establish this result by showing that a well-posedness criterion provided by Kreiss fails to hold for this theory, and using a theorem provided by Strang.

Thus, the Force-free evolution is <b>non</b> <b>continuous</b> in that norm with respect to the initial data. We furthermore prove that this problem is also ill-posed in the Leray-Ohya sense.
