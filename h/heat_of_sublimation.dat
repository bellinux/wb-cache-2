Vapor pressure predictions {{are required to}} determine the gas-particle partitioning of such organic compounds. We present here a method based on atomistic simulations combined with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to predict the liquid vapor pressure, enthalpies <b>of</b> vaporization, and <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric organic compounds. The resulting temperature-dependent vapor pressure equation is a function <b>of</b> the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> vaporization at the normal boiling point [¢Hvap(Tb) ], normal boiling point (Tb), and the change in heat capacity (liquid to gas) of the compound upon phase change [¢Cp(Tb) ]. We show that <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> vaporization can be estimated from calculated cohesive energy densities (CED) of the pure compound obtained from multiple sampling molecular dynamics. The simulation method (CED) uses a generic force field (Dreiding) and molecular models with atomic charges determined from quantum mechanics. The <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> vaporization of five dicarboxylic acids [malonic (C 3), succinic (C 4), glutaric (C 5), adipic (C 6), and pimelic (C 7) ] are calculated at 500 K.

Predictions are compared to literature data, and the overall accuracy is considered satisfactory given the simplicity of the equations. Quantum mechanical methods were also used to investigate the thermodynamic feasibility of various acid-catalyzed aerosol-phase heterogeneous chemical reactions. A stepwise procedure is presented to determine physical properties such as <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation, standard entropies, Gibbs free energies of formation, and solvation energies from quantum mechanics, for various short-chain aldehydes and ketones. Equilibrium constants of hydration reactions and aldol condensation are then reported; predictions are in qualitatively agreement with previous studies. We have shown that quantum methods can serve as useful tools for first approximation, especially for species with no available data, in determining the thermodynamic properties of multifunctional oxygenates. We also present an atmospheric aerosol phase equilibrium model to determine the aerosol phase equilibrium of aqueous systems. Phase diagrams for a number of organic/water systems characteristic of both primary and secondary organic aerosols are computed. Effects of organics on the deliquescence behavior of electrolytes are also shown in the inorganic/organic/water phase diagrams. Finally, we evaluate the performance of four recent activity coefficient models developed for inorganic-organic-water mixtures typical of atmospheric aerosols. Based on the comparison on water activities, it is found that models that include ion-organic mixture parameters (referred to as coupled models) do not necessarily produce more accurate predictions than those models that utilizes additive approaches (referred to as decoupled models). Since the chemical composition and physical properties of the organic fraction is largely unknown, the additive approaches of the decoupled models are more feasible than the coupled model. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation,</b> vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|R

40|$|The gaseous alkali halide {{molecules}} are {{of interest}} because they constitute a group particularly susceptible to theoretical interpretation. It {{does not seem to}} be too far from the truth to regard them as systems of simple polarizable ions. An important molecular property is the dissociation energy, D(MX). In the case of the alkali halides, this may be determined either by spectroscopic or by thermochemical methods. However, although analyses of their ultraviolet absorption spectra have given fair estimates of the dissociation energies, the method of analysis is here liable to systematic errors and is best used to get relative values. The most reliable estimates of the energies of dissociation are therefore to be obtained from the thermochemical cycle which may be written D(MX) = - Q f (MX) - Δ s H(MX) + Δ s H(M) + &frac 12;D(X) [...] . (1) The quantities least well known in equations (1) for the alkali halides are often the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>sublimation,</b> Δ s H 298 (MX), of the salts. There is at present available in several cases information only on the vapour pressure above the liquids at relatively high temperatures, and the corrections to give Δ s H 298 are large and uncertain, and more so since the only values commonly known for the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> fusion are derived from rather scanty information on freezing points in binary systems. On these grounds, the merits of determining Δ s H 298 by measuring the vapour pressures above the crystal at relatively low temperatures are obvious, in addition it has recently become clear that the interpretation of measurements at higher pressures is not simple. There is now good evidence, both from electron impact studies, and from the observations of molecular beams, that the vapours of the alkali halides consist by no means exclusively of monomers, MX, but also contain appreciable proportions of polymers, especially of (MX) 2. It would be expected that at the low vapour pressures obtaining above the crystal, dimerisation would be relatively unimportant, and that reliable values of Δ s H 298 for the monomer species might be obtained by simple treatments. In fact, the results given below may be taken to indicate that this is the situation for caesium and rubidium fluorides, but that in lithium, sodium, and, to a larger extent in potassium fluorides, dimerisation is significant even at pressures in the range 10 - 4 to 10 - 2 mm.

The influence of the carrier gas composition on the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>sublimation</b> has been analyzed.
