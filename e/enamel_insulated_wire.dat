5000|$|By 1943, compact delay {{lines with}} {{distributed}} capacitance and inductance were devised. Typical early designs involved winding an <b>enamel</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> on an insulating core and then surrounding {{that with a}} grounded conductive jacket. Richard Nelson of General Electric filed a patent for such a line that year. [...] Other GE employees, John Rubel and Roy Troell, concluded that the insulated wire could be wound around a conducting core {{to achieve the same}} effect. [...] Much of the development of delay lines during World War II was motivated by the problems encountered in radar systems.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} sliding {{friction}} and the forming behaviour of <b>enamel</b> <b>insulated</b> copper <b>wire</b> during the die-forming process. It also aims to determine potential damage mechanisms {{to the wire}} during bending process for electric motor coils. In this investigation a wire-bending machine was designed and built in order to simulate the wire forming process in a laboratory scale. Bending angle of the wire and the bending radii were used to control the strain on the wire surface. The effect of speed on COF was investigated for different speeds of of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm/s. A positive correlation was observed between the COF and the testing speed. Additionally, the effect of strain on COF was studied for 2 % and 23 % to determine its influence on the COF. A general trend was observed of decreased COF with increased strain in wires. Finally, {{the ability of the}} enamel coating to resist external damage and wire strain was investigated by tensile testing of pre-scratched magnet wire. The results showed that wire enamel can withstand significant surface damage prior to breach and failure. The insulating polymer coating failed under the scratch tests at 20 N load using a Rockwell indenter and at 5 N load using a 90 ° conical steel indenter. Additional tests, such as tensile testing, scratch testing and reciprocating friction testing, were used to characterize the mechanical and tribological properties of the <b>enamel</b> <b>insulated</b> copper <b>wire...</b>|$|R
40|$|The auther has {{attempt to}} study the {{propagating}} mechanism of the excitement, which can be thought as {{the origin of the}} epileptic convulsion. The action potential has been recorded from cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, nucleus of midbrain and muscles of extremities during convulsion, which precipitated by intravenous administration of metrazol (10 % solution of Cardiazol) on cats. Needle electrodes (200 <b>enamel</b> <b>insulated</b> steel <b>wire)</b> were used as recording electrodes, and the spike wave (duration 20 to 60 msec. amplitude 50 to 100 μV by abovementioned electrode) was applicated as an indication of the excitement. 1) Motor cortex, caudate and pallidum, thalamus and black substance have demonstrated their important function in the propagating mechanism of the excitement. And motor cortex has been more sensitive than other structures. 2) On the occasion of metrazol convulsion, the spike wave is detected in the first place at cerebral cortex. The spiking at cerebral cortex propagates to basal ganglia with some seconds delay time, and then the spiking propagate also to basal ganglia. Moreover, the spiking at basal ganglia propagate to mid-brain nucleus. The onset of a convulsive movement is earlier than the beginning of the spiking at basal ganglia, and is delayed {{from the beginning of the}} spiking at cerebral cortex. The convulsive pattern of muscles change from former clonic convulsion to tonic convulsion in the course of propagation of the spiking to basal ganglia. 3) The auther has presumed that a typical epileptic convulsion, which has clonic-, tonic-and clonic stadium a its components, should have above mentioned propagating mechanism of the excitemnent from electroencephalographical findings...|$|R
40|$|Stator {{windings}} of {{low voltage}} electrical motors are usually insulated {{by means of}} organic enamels. If motors are used in particular industrial plants or in nuclear applications, the <b>enamel</b> adopted to <b>insulate</b> the motor stator windings may be exposed to very intense gamma photonic irradiation fields. In this research activity, attention {{has been focused on}} the potential influence of gamma irradiation dose on the performances of an electrical insulation system based on enameled wires having a thermosetting matrix. The aim of this research activity is to assess the prospects of exploitation of such insulating materials inside electromechanical devices intended to operate in presence of gamma photonic fields as in the frame of nuclear plant dismantling or, in general, of the manipulation of radioactive products. Suitable specimens, insulated by the considered enamel, have been set-up using enameled wire exposed to gamma photonic irradiation within a panoramic irradiator endowed with Co 60 gamma sources. These pre-aged specimens have been subjected to electrical aging tests up to the enamel breakdown condition, chosen as end-point criterion, in order to study the electrical performances of the considered wires. The peak to peak voltage amplitude of the considered waveform has been set higher than the partial discharges inception voltage level in order to work in presence of surface partial discharges activity. Enamel life curve has been plotted in order to point out gamma irradiation dose influence on the performances of the considered insulating material. The obtained results show the significant effects of the exposure to a gamma irradiation field on the performances of the considered <b>insulating</b> <b>enameled</b> <b>wire...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{dealt with}} the issue of {{breakdowns}} detection of isolated hanging wires on the medium-voltage transmission. The main aim of article is to describe the function of created breakdowns detector and evaluation its. The breakdowns detector is created based in indicators of faults such as touch between tree limbs and <b>insulated</b> <b>wire,</b> touch tree limbs with several phases or fall <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> on the ground. Breakdowns detector has been created because today digital protection was not able to detect the aforementioned faults (e. g. a fault between ground and <b>insulated</b> <b>wire</b> is not a complete ground fault).
