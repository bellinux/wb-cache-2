500|$|There is a {{documented}} {{controversy about}} {{the location and}} names of the Civil War fortifications at Randolph, Fort Wright and Fort Randolph. A publication dated 1868 mentions Fort Wright and claims that it was formerly named Fort Pillow and was located on the first Chickasaw Bluff, the author treats Fort Randolph as a separate fortification on the second Chickasaw Bluff. The known location of Fort Pillow [...] {{and the location of}} Randolph [...] are about [...] apart. A recent publication dated 2009 suggests that only one fortification existed at Randolph which was first named Fort Randolph and later became known as Fort Wright. Different sources give different locations for both fortifications. The Tipton County Property Assessor's <b>Interactive</b> <b>Mapping</b> System provides the location [...] for the parcel ID 084055 02500, named [...] "Fort Wright Historical". This is also the location of the powder magazine that is still intact as of 2008. [...] For Fort Randolph, other sources give the location , the exact locations provided for Fort Randolph differ from each other due to rounding after the fifth decimal place of the coordinates. The two locations provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph are about [...] apart.|$|E

The risk regions were modelled in 2008 by an <b>interactive</b> <b>map,</b> showing the monthly potential risk of transmission of F. hepatica in Switzerland. As this map {{is based on}} a mathematical model, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the <b>interactive</b> <b>map</b> by means of a field survey taking different data sources into account. It was found that the <b>interactive</b> <b>map</b> has a sensitivity of 40. 7 - 88. 9 %, a specificity of 11. 4 - 18. 8 %, a positive predictive value of 26. 7 - 51. 4 %, and a negative predictive value of 13. 1 - 83. 6 %, depending on the source of the data.

The <b>interactive</b> disease <b>map</b> can be used for visualizing information on the map during disease outbreak situations. An engineering approach was used for system design, development and testing. Three different inputs, Microsoft Virtual Earth, population data and epidemiological data formed the <b>interactive</b> <b>map</b> system. The <b>interactive</b> disease <b>map</b> framework extract data from database and was integrate with geo‐spatial information and presented as an <b>interactive</b> <b>map</b> system. The system integrates population data and epidemiological data with virtual earth and is present in a Silverlight presentation. The system user can interact with the system during run time and search zip code area of Norway, once the system match the zip code of Norway, the area is located on a <b>map.</b> The <b>interactive</b> <b>maps</b> integrate the population and epidemiological data with zip code and presents it as a Silverlight presentation. We have demonstrated the <b>interactive</b> disease <b>map</b> by integrating the population and epidemiological data with Microsoft Virtual earth and present it using a Silverlight presentation.
