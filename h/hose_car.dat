The station was home to horse drawn <b>hose</b> <b>car.</b> The clock tower, that quickly became a symbol of the neighbourhood, was added in 1899. From the top of the tower a lookout would watch for fires. It was also useful for hanging hoses to dry. In 1911 it received the city's first motorized fire engine.|$|E

5000|$|Sound-proofing screens {{were later}} erected around the theatre in {{response}} to complaints {{from a group of}} Garsington residents living near the Manor. In 1996, they won £1,000 compensation for noise disturbance caused by the operas. When the award was overturned on appeal, local resident Monica Waud led her neighbours in a civil disobedience campaign during the 1997 performance of Haydn's Le Pescatrici. The protesters simultaneously began cutting their lawns with electric lawnmowers and diesel tractors, trimming their hedges, and turning on their <b>hoses.</b> <b>Car</b> alarms were set off and as a grand finale a private plane piloted by Miss Waud's companion flew overhead. In 2001 the protesters tried unsuccessfully to use the Human Rights Act to block Garsington Opera performances, claiming that they denied them the right to the [...] "peaceful enjoyment of their possessions". The South Oxfordshire environmental health service undertook in-house monitoring of opera performances in each season from 2000 through 2005, but on each occasion concluded that there was no statutory noise nuisance.|$|R

25|$|The {{pressurized}} air {{comes from an}} air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each <b>car</b> and <b>hoses</b> between <b>cars.</b> The principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence {{the loss of the}} force applying the brakes. This could easily cause a runaway train. Straight air brakes are still used on locomotives, although as a dual circuit system, usually with each bogie (truck) having its own circuit.|$|R
50|$|In the past, before air-quality {{regulations}} and catalytic converters, suicide by {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} would often be achieved by running a car's engine in a closed space such as a garage, or by redirecting a running car's exhaust back inside the cabin with a <b>hose.</b> Motor <b>car</b> exhaust may have contained up to 25% carbon monoxide. However, catalytic converters found on all modern automobiles eliminate over 99% of carbon monoxide produced. As a further complication, the amount of unburned gasoline in emissions can make exhaust unbearable to breathe well before losing consciousness.|$|R

The Brazilian was also released {{into the path of}} Adrian Sutil, who narrowly avoided the Ferrari. Massa went the full length of the pitlane before stopping just before the exit. Massa rejoined {{at the back of the}} field after the Ferrari mechanics ran down the pitlane and removed the <b>hose</b> from the <b>car.</b> Cars who had either pitted before the safety car or were on one stop strategies were now in front. Rosberg now led from Trulli, Fisichella, Kubica, Alonso, Webber, Coulthard and Hamilton.|$|R
500|$|White {{committed}} suicide by {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} on October 21, 1985. He connected a rubber <b>hose</b> to his <b>car's</b> exhaust system and routed it to {{the interior of the}} vehicle, which he let fill with carbon monoxide. Mayor Feinstein said, [...] "This latest tragedy should close a very sad chapter in this city's history." [...] According to Orange County lawyer Jeff Walsworth, White had expressed remorse for the killings in February 1984. White reportedly stated that it would always cause him inner turmoil. Inspector Falzone said the contrary, however, commenting that at no time did White express remorse in any form at the deaths of Moscone and Milk.|$|R
50|$|At {{one point}} in this second chase, Mann observes a {{black-and-white}} car. Thinking that the vehicle is a police car, he skids to a stop, only for him {{to realize that the}} vehicle is actually a pest control vehicle. He speeds off as the driver of the pest control vehicle scarpers onto his own vehicle's hood as the chase continues. The truck then chases Mann up a mountain ascent, before the radiator <b>hose</b> of Mann's <b>car</b> falls off, causing the car to quickly overheat. He barely makes the summit before coasting his car downhill in neutral to cool the temperature of his vehicle's engine as the truck gradually bears down on him.|$|R
50|$|Under {{clear blue}} New York skies, Carl Edwards led {{the field to}} the green flag at 2:53 p.m. The race {{proceeded}} orderly {{for the first five}} laps before Jeff Gordon sent Austin Dillon spinning in the inner loop on the fifth lap. The race continued under green. Debris in the outer loop brought out the first caution of the race on lap 11. The debris was a piece of <b>hose.</b> A few <b>cars</b> opted to pit under the caution. Aric Almirola and Kasey Kahne were tagged for their crews being over the wall too soon, and Regan Smith was tagged for speeding. All three restarted from {{the tail end of the}} field.|$|R

In the episode [...] "Too Many Chiefs" [...] (Season one), Max tells Tanya, the KAOS {{informer}} {{whom he is}} protecting, that if anyone breaks in {{to pick up the}} house phone, dial 1-1-7, and press the trigger on the handset, which converts it to a gun. The phone-gun is only used that once, but Max once carried a gun-phone, a revolver with a rotary dial built into the cylinder. In the episode [...] "Satan Place", Max simultaneously holds conversations on seven different phones — the shoe, his tie, his belt, his wallet, a garter, a handkerchief and a pair of eyeglasses. Other unusual locations include a garden <b>hose,</b> a <b>car</b> cigarette lighter (hidden in the car phone), a bottle of perfume (Max complains of smelling like a woman), the steering wheel of his car, a painting of Agent 99, the headboard of his bed, a cheese sandwich, lab test tubes (Max grabs the wrong one and splashes himself), a Bunsen burner (Max puts out the flame anytime he pronounces a [...] "p"), a plant in a planter beside the real working phone (operated by the dial of the working phone), and inside another full-sized working phone.|$|R
25|$|Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell {{dominated}} the Wilson Security Sandown 500, securing pole position and leading 150 of the 161 laps {{on their way}} to victory. The two Holden Racing Team cars filled the podium, with James Courtney and Greg Murphy finishing ahead of Garth Tander and Warren Luff. Mark Winterbottom fell to third in the championship standings behind Craig Lowndes, after Winterbottom and Steve Owen could only finish tenth while Lowndes and Steven Richards finished fourth. Lee Holdsworth had a high-speed crash when his car suffered a mechanical failure {{at the end of the}} back straight, resulting in heavy contact with the tyre barrier. A wheel was torn off in the accident, which was collected by Jason Bright, forcing he and Andrew Jones out of the race. The only other retirement was the car of James Moffat and Taz Douglas, whose car was retired when the team were unable to disconnect the fuel <b>hose</b> from the <b>car</b> during their first pit stop.|$|R
50|$|Production for {{the film}} began on February 10, 1997 in {{downtown}} Los Angeles. The first shoot was set in the historic Mayan Theater, refurbished as a trendy nightclub and cast with hundreds of extras {{for the film}}'s opening scene. The eight-story, nearly condemned Giant Penny building {{in the middle of}} LA served as the location for a police station interior, a hotel room, and Meg Coburn's office. A chaotic gunfight was filmed amid the spray, brushes, and <b>hoses</b> of Joe's <b>Car</b> Wash, also in LA. A Chinatown-like streetscape of damp, narrow alleys and blinking red neon lights was created for the night-time finale, where Yun-Fat shot off 546 rounds of two-fisted shooting; the repetitive action left his hands blistered and shaking. More gunplay took place ina video arcade replicated at the original Lawry's California Center (now the Los Angeles River Center and Gardens), just north of downtown LA. Lee's tranquil Buddhist temple was fashioned under this same roof.|$|R
30|$|Cyanoacrylate fuming {{method was}} used to develop latent {{fingerprints}} on bullet casings by Babin (2010). Fieldhouse (2011) suggested the use of cyanoacrylate fuming method for developing both fresh and aged latent fingerprints on smooth and textured plastics. Amata et al. (2015) reported {{a case in which}} cyanoacrylate fuming method {{was used to}} develop latent fingermarks on the trigger of firearm. In another study, the use of cyanoacrylate fuming method was suggested to develop latent fingermarks on the duct tape (Olenik 1984). Tissier et al. (1999) reported a case in which latent fingermarks were developed inside a vehicle by cyanoacrylate fuming method. Vapors of cyanoacrylate were fed into <b>car</b> through a <b>hose</b> and <b>car</b> itself acts as a fumigation chamber. Matthias (2016) used cyanoacrylate fuming method to develop latent fingermarks on both adhesive and non-adhesive sides of different kinds of tapes (black electrical tape, packaging tape, grey duct tape, masking tape) which were previously treated with Un-Du liquid. It was observed that use of Un-Du liquid did not affect the quality of developed prints and also did not interfere in processing of items with cyanoacrylate fuming method. Lam et al. (2014) recommended the sequential processing with cyanoacrylate fuming, vacuum metal deposition and fluorescent dye staining to develop latent fingermarks on Canadian polymer banknotes. They suggested the immediate processing of banknotes with cyanoacrylate fuming in order to minimize the print degradation. In another study, Lam (2014) recommended the use of oblique light to examine and photograph cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints on Canadian polymer banknotes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{general manager}} of the company was Charles T. Crantham, pioneer of the cotton duck {{industry}} in Canada and responsible for the creation of the Imperial Cotton Company Ltd. From Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Grantham was the bookkeeper for a cotton duck mill in 1883 to fix the company's books. Four years after his employment, he resigned to open a rival company in Hamilton, Ontario; bringing with him many workers and experts. Grantham had the help of John Patterson of the [...] "5 Johns" [...] to fund his cotton mill venture and build the cotton mill on the land that he owned. It was also decided that his brother Edmond Patterson [...] would be the architect. By, 1900, the Imperial Cotton Company was born and looked after by James M. Young, the first President, who was the son of John Young, an original investor with the Dundas Cotton Company (1860-1891) and a now distant relative of Bob Young, the current owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.The Imperial Cotton Company at 270 Sherman was the second largest cotton mill in the city and attracted customers from the around the world. Orders were taken from using the telegraphic system and codebook that can be found in Hamilton’s Public Library to date. The Imperial Cotton codebook helped workers simplify orders and organize classes of cotton. The company manufactures heavy grades of cotton duck, used for making vessel sails, mechanical belting and <b>hose,</b> railway <b>car</b> roofing, binder canvasses, tarpaulins, tents, awnings, filters and cotton paper dryers. The products of the company are sold mainly to manufacturers, cutters-up, railways, implement and paper makers.|$|R
2500|$|Chapman {{joined his}} girlfriend, Jessica Blankenship, {{as a student}} at Covenant College, an evangelical Presbyterian liberal arts college in Lookout Mountain, Georgia. However, Chapman fell behind in his studies and became obsessed with guilt over having an affair. [...] He started having suicidal {{thoughts}} and began to feel like a failure. He dropped out of Covenant College after just one semester and his girlfriend broke off their relationship soon after. He returned to work at the resettlement camp but left after an argument. Chapman worked as a security guard, eventually taking a week-long course to qualify as an armed guard. He again attempted college but dropped out. He went to Hawaii and then began contemplating suicide. In 1977, Chapman attempted suicide by carbon monoxide asphyxiation. He connected a <b>hose</b> to his <b>car's</b> exhaust pipe but the hose melted and the attempt failed. A psychiatrist admitted him to Castle Memorial Hospital for clinical depression. Upon his release, he began working at the hospital. His parents began divorce proceedings and his mother joined Chapman in Hawaii.|$|R
30|$|A handbag design {{slated for}} re-birth can follow a similar {{collaboration}} {{process and the}} entire life cycle of the product is vital in both instances (Lee and DeLong 2016 c, 2018). However, there are some important differences from the apparel previously slated for re-birth. For example, the materials of the fashion handbag are harder to redesign {{because they are more}} rigid in structure and sometimes less resilient and thus more difficult to reuse. Fashion handbags going through re-birth design are one type of bag used for upcycling. Wang (2014) characterised the types of waste materials used in upcycling for various types of bags: (1) textiles such as truck covers, placards, signboards, remnants of cloth, clothes, military uniforms, blankets, tents, parachutes, fire <b>hoses,</b> seat belts, <b>car</b> sheets, plane seats, and coffee sacks; (2) plastic including doggie bags and plastic bags; (3) leather such as old leather garments, remnants of leather shoes, a belt, car sheets, waste furniture, and gymnastic gear; (4) paper such as magazines, catalogues, and coated newspapers; (5) tires such as inner tubes that are developed into glossy high quality leather-like fabrics (Wang 2014).|$|R

Adrian wants {{to hang out with}} the hippies, but Jack insists they keep going. They stop at a service station so Jack can have a busted water <b>hose</b> on his <b>car</b> replaced. As Jack deals with the attendant, Adrian browses a pet store called the Creepy Crawly Zoo. The owner, Harliss, shows Adrian a Gila Monster, which uses its viselike bite to inject a neurotoxin into the bloodstream. Back in the car, with Jack behind the wheel, Adrian uses the Gila Monster to reassert his power over Jack by throwing the monster onto Jacks lap while he drives. Jack struggles to maintain his composure, and appears frozen by fear and anxiety. To compound matters, Adrian then slams his foot onto the accelerator and the car almost loses control at speed and eventually shudders to a grinding halt before Adrian lets the Gila monster go, and warns Jack on his previous disobedience, and tells Jack he is [...] "one crazy motherfucker" ...|$|R
50|$|The opening lap was {{dominated}} by three separate incidents. Heikki Kovalainen made contact with Sebastian Vettel {{coming out of the}} Senna 'S', and while Vettel emerged unscathed, Kovalainen ran out of road and very nearly collected Fisichella, who was forced to go the long way around. The second incident took place just two corners later when Jarno Trulli tangled with Adrian Sutil while trying to make a pass coming out of the fifth corner. Both the Toyota and the Force India were eliminated, with Sutil taking out Fernando Alonso in the process when the Renault driver was unable to avoid his out-of-control Force India, an incident which caused the deployment of the safety car. The third and final incident took place in the pit lane; after his encounter with Vettel, Heikki Kovalainen pitted, followed closely by Kimi Räikkönen, the latter having damaged his front wing after light contact with Mark Webber. Kovalainen was released from his pit while the fuel hose was still attached, taking it with him and with it, a spray of fuel. Räikkönen's exhaust ignited the spilt fuel in a fireball, but no one was injured and both drivers were able to continue once Brawn mechanics extricated the McLaren fuel <b>hose</b> from Kovalainen's <b>car.</b>|$|R
