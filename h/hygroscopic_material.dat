60|$|The {{revolution}} {{that is in}} progress from the old war to a new war, different in its entire nature from the old, is marked primarily by the steady progress in range and efficiency of the rifle and of the field-gun--and more particularly of the rifle. The rifle develops persistently from a clumsy implement, that any clown may learn to use in half a day, towards a very intricate mechanism, easily put out of order and easily misused, but {{of the most extraordinary}} possibilities in the hands of men of courage, character, and high intelligence. Its precision at long range has made the business of its care, loading and aim subsidiary to the far more intricate matter of its use in relation to the contour of the ground within its reach. Even its elaboration as an instrument is probably still incomplete. One can conceive it provided in the future with cross-thread telescopic sights, the focussing of which, corrected by some ingenious use of <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>material,</b> might even find the range, and so enable it to be used with assurance up to a mile or more. It will probably also take on some of the characters of the machine-gun. It will be used either for single shots or to quiver and send a spray of almost simultaneous bullets out of a magazine evenly and certainly, over any small area the rifleman thinks advisable. It will probably be portable by one man, but there is no reason really, except the bayonet tradition, the demands of which may be met in other ways, why it should be the instrument of one sole man. It will, just as probably, be slung with its ammunition and equipment upon bicycle wheels, and be the common care of two or more associated soldiers. Equipped with such a weapon, a single couple of marksmen even, by reason of smokeless powder and carefully chosen cover, might make themselves practically invisible, and capable of surprising, stopping, and destroying a visible enemy in quite considerable numbers who blundered within a mile of them. And a series of such groups of marksmen so arranged as to cover the arrival of reliefs, provisions, and fresh ammunition from the rear, might hold out against any visible attack for an indefinite period, unless the ground they occupied was searched very ably and subtly by some sort of gun having a range in excess of their rifle fire. If the ground they occupied were to be properly tunnelled and trenched, even that might not avail, and there would be nothing for it but to attack them by an advance under cover either of the night or of darkness caused by smoke-shells, or by the burning of cover about their position. Even then they might be deadly with magazine fire at close quarters. Save for their liability to such attacks, a few hundreds of such men could hold positions of a quite vast extent, and a few thousand might hold a frontier. Assuredly a mere handful of such men could stop the most multitudinous attack or cover the most disorderly retreat in the world, and even when some ingenious, daring, and lucky night assault had at last ejected them from a position, dawn would simply restore to them the prospect of reconstituting in new positions their enormous advantage of defence.|$|E

The NMF including amino acids which are hydrolyzed on skin matrix protein (e.g. Filament aggregating protein), {{pyrrolidone carboxylic acid}} (PCA), lactic acid and urocanic acid (UCA) can retain moisture of skin. Gamma PGA is the only effective ingredient that is known till now to induce the production of NMF to 130% of the normal level. Gamma PGA can lock the moisture in inner skin by promoting the growth of fibroblast and increasing the content of NMF in horn cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{equilibrium}} moisture content (EMC) of a <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>material</b> surrounded at least partially by air is the moisture content at which the material is neither gaining nor losing moisture. The value of the EMC depends on the material and the relative humidity and temperature of the air with which it is in contact. The {{speed with which it}} is approached depends on the properties of the material, the surface-area-to-volume ratio of its shape, and the speed with which humidity is carried away or towards the material (e.g. diffusion in stagnant air or convection in moving air).|$|E

30|$|Awareness of the {{influence}} of <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>materials</b> on reducing ventilation loads in buildings—and thus saving energy—is growing. The moisture-buffering capacity of <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>materials,</b> has been analyzed in several studies [1 – 4]. Recently, a new material property, the so-called ‘moisture buffer value’ (MBV), was developed [5] and describes the ability of building materials and systems of materials to exchange moisture with the indoor environment. The MBV of wood is triple that of concrete and brick, double that of gypsum and about 20  % higher than cellular concrete [5]. Rode and Grau [3] showed that hygroscopic wall surfaces provide a noticeable effect on damping of indoor humidity variations; the higher the MBV of a material the greater the damping.|$|R
50|$|Wood is a <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>material,</b> {{which means}} it {{naturally}} absorbs and releases water to balance its internal moisture content with the surrounding environment. The moisture content of wood {{is measured by the}} weight of water {{as a percentage of the}} oven-dry weight of the wood fiber. The key to controlling decay is controlling moisture. Once decay fungi are established, the minimum moisture content for decay to propagate is 22 to 24 percent, so building experts recommend 19 percent as the maximum safe moisture content for untreated wood in service. Water by itself does not harm the wood, but rather, wood with consistently high moisture content enables fungal organisms to grow.|$|E

When the relative humidity it too high is can cause warping and swelling of the ivory. If the relative humidity exceeds 60% for a sustained time there is a chance that mold can develop on the ivory. It will be a white and greenish fuzzy growth that will require particular care and cleaning.|$|E

While not a new technique, hygroscopic seeding for enhancement of rainfall in warm clouds is enjoying a revival, based on some positive indications from research in South Africa, Mexico, and elsewhere. The <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>material</b> most commonly used is table salt. It is postulated that hygroscopic seeding causes the droplet size spectrum in clouds to become more maritime (bigger drops) and less continental, stimulating rainfall through coalescence. From March 1967 until July 1972, the US military's Operation Popeye cloud-seeded silver iodide to extend the monsoon season over North Vietnam, specifically the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

Today there are advanced hygrothermal simulation models available that enable us to quantify the temperature and relative humidity fluctuations of the air inside the museum display cases, provided that we know the climate in the exhibition rooms, the degree of ventilation of the display case and the constitution of its surroundings.

Even though {{a large number of}} studies have been conducted to investigate the moisture buffering effect, additional studies are still required for several major questions including: 1) How to evaluate the impact of different parameters on moisture buffering potential under different conditions? 2) Is the local moisture buffering of surface materials influenced by non-uniform indoor conditions? 3) Can <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>materials</b> be categorized and ranked in order to achieve a better moisture buffering application? Aiming to answer these questions, this research is developed and carried out to define an index to quantitatively evaluate the impact of different parameters on moisture buffering potential of interior surface materials and furniture, to investigate moisture buffering of surface materials under non-uniform indoor conditions and to classify <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>materials.</b> These objectives are achieved through both experiments and simulations including 1) analysis of the moisture balance established in a full-scale experimental testing (28 cases) and whole building Heat, Air and Moisture (HAM) simulations (54 cases BSim simulations); 2) investigation of local moisture buffering of interior surface (WUFI) applied on test walls; and 3) analyses of moisture buffering capacity at material level using WUFI simulations. A new index, maximum accumulated moisture buffering value (MAMBV), is developed to quantify the impact of different parameters on the moisture buffering effect. The great advantage of this index is that it can provide a direct comparison of moisture buffering potential in different test scenarios. The parameters investigated include daily moisture load rate and schemes, ventilation rates, supply air conditions, volume rates, and different interior surface materials and furniture.
