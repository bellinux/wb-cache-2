40|$|In spin electronics, {{the spin}} {{degree of freedom}} is used to {{transmit}} and store information. To this end {{the ability to create}} pure spin currents—that is, without net charge transfer—is essential. When the magnetization vector in a ferromagnet–normal metal junction is excited, the spin pumping effect leads to the injection of pure spin currents into the normal metal. The polarization of this spin current is time-dependent and contains a very small d. c. component. Here we show that the large a. c. component of the spin currents can be detected efficiently using the inverse spin Hall effect. The observed a. c. -inverse spin <b>Hall</b> <b>voltages</b> are one order of magnitude larger than the conventional d. c. -inverse spin <b>Hall</b> <b>voltages</b> measured on the same device.

For this purpose we measure the in-plane angular dependence of the generated voltages on the external static magnetic field and we apply a model to separate the spin pumping signal from the one generated by the spin rectification effect in the magnetic layer. Our results reveal a dominating role of anomalous Hall effect for the spin rectification effect with CoFeB and a lack of correlation between g^↑↓_ eff and inverse spin <b>Hall</b> <b>voltages</b> pointing to a strong role of the magnetic proximity effect in Pt in understanding the observed increased damping.
