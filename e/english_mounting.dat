500|$|Demoralised by {{the loss}} of its admiral and seriously short of food, the fleet {{returned}} to Plymouth. Thomas Howard, elder brother of Edward, was assigned the new Lord Admiral, and was set to the task of arranging another attack on Brittany. The fleet was not able to mount the planned attack because of adverse winds and great difficulties in supplying the ships adequately and the Mary Rose took up winter quarters in Southampton. In August the Scots joined France in war against England, but were dealt a crushing defeat at the Battle of Flodden on [...] 1513. A follow-up attack in early 1514 was supported by a naval force that included the Mary Rose, but without any known engagements. The French and <b>English</b> <b>mounted</b> raids on each other throughout that summer, but achieved little, and both sides were by then exhausted. By autumn the war was over and a peace treaty was sealed by the marriage of Henry's sister, Mary, to French king LouisXII.|$|R
40|$|Test suites are {{a useful}} {{evaluation}} tool for developers and users of NLP products. The paper gives {{an overview of}} the tsnlp design and methodology and describes how the tsnlp data and methodology can be used in practice to provide a reliable assessment method of the linguistic capabilities of NLP products. 1 Introduction Test suites have long been recognized as a useful evaluation tool for NLP products, especially for the developer. Until recently, however, there have been few publicly available test suites or guidelines for their construction and use. The EU-funded project tsnlp (Test Suites for Natural Language Processing, LRE 62 - 089), 1 has filled that gap by providing a methodology for the construction of test suites, a substantial multilingual test suite (over 4, 500 test items in each of its three languages, French, German and <b>English),</b> <b>mounted</b> on a database, and a number of tools for use and construction. The test data are general purpose, i. e. not specific to a particular do [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1001, a Danish fleet - {{perhaps the}} same fleet from 1000 - {{returned}} and ravaged west Sussex. During its movements, the fleet regularly {{returned to its}} base in the Isle of Wight. There was later an attempted attack {{in the south of}} Devon, though the <b>English</b> <b>mounted</b> a successful defence at Exeter. Nevertheless, Æthelred must have felt at a loss, and, in the Spring of 1002, the English bought a truce for £24,000. Æthelred's frequent payments of immense Danegelds are often held up as exemplary of the incompetency of his government and his own short-sightedness. However, Keynes points out that such payments had been practice for at least a century, and had been adopted by Alfred the Great, Charles the Bald and many others. Indeed, in some cases it [...] "may have seemed the best available way of protecting the people against loss of life, shelter, livestock and crops. Though undeniably burdensome, it constituted a measure for which the king could rely on widespread support." ...|$|R

60|$|But {{whatever}} {{may have}} been his feelings of general hostility and his particular indignation at the treatment of his brother, he suppressed them for the present, renewed the contract with the settlers, and resided peaceably for many years at Pokanoket, or as, it was called by the <b>English,</b> <b>Mount</b> Hope,* the ancient seat of dominion of his tribe. Suspicions, however, which were at first but vague and indefinite, began to acquire form and substance, and he was at length charged with attempting to instigate the various eastern tribes to rise at once, and by a simultaneous effort to throw off the yoke of their oppressors. It is difficult at this distant period to assign the proper credit due to these early accusations against the Indians. There was a proneness to suspicion and an aptness to acts of violence {{on the part of}} the whites that gave weight and importance to every idle tale. Informers abounded where tale-bearing met with countenance and reward, and the sword was readily unsheathed when its success was certain and it carved out empire.|$|R
