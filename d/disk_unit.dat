An example of a graph {{that is not a}} <b>unit</b> <b>disk</b> graph is the star K1,7 with one central node connected to seven leaves: if each of seven <b>unit</b> <b>disks</b> touches a common <b>unit</b> <b>disk,</b> some two of the seven disks must touch each other (as the kissing number in the plane is 6).

40|$|A <b>unit</b> <b>disk</b> graph is the {{intersection}} graph of disks of equal radii in the plane.

Further we use these results to investigate structure of co-bipartite <b>unit</b> <b>disk</b> graphs. In particular, we give structural characterization of those co-bipartite <b>unit</b> <b>disk</b> graphs whose edges between parts form a C 4 -free bipartite graph, and show that bipartite complements of these graphs are also <b>unit</b> <b>disk</b> graphs.

5000|$|During Cary's {{tenure as}} CEO, the company {{continued}} to dominate in hardware. The IBM System/370 {{was introduced in}} 1970 as IBM's new mainframe. The S/370 did not prove as technologically revolutionary as its predecessor, the System/360. From a revenue perspective, it more than sustained the cash cow status of the 360. A less successful effort to replicate the 360 mainframe revolution was the Future Systems project. Between 1971 and 1975, IBM investigated the feasibility of a new revolutionary line of products designed to make obsolete all existing products in order to re-establish its technical supremacy. This effort was terminated by IBM's top management in 1975. But by then it had consumed most of the high-level technical planning and design resources, thus jeopardizing progress of the existing product lines (although some elements of FS were later incorporated into actual products). Other IBM innovations during the early 1970s included the IBM 3340 <b>disk</b> <b>unit</b> - introduced in 1973 and known as [...] "Winchester" [...] after IBM's internal project name — was an advanced storage technology which more than doubled the information density on disk surfaces.

40|$|Although the false-twisting {{by means}} of a {{friction}} <b>disk</b> <b>unit</b> is an efficient technique widely applied to manufacture the synthetic fiber yarns conventionally called `textured yarns', the fundamental mechanics operating in the processing, especially the relationship between frictional and extensional forces and paths which a yarn experiences when twisted, is not sufficiently in vestigated to date. This series of reports aims to establish a theory that describes the mechanical behaviors of a yarn in the false-twisting process using a friction <b>disk</b> <b>unit,</b> and to obtain basic information about the yarn path and the frictional forces acting on the yarn. In the theoretical part of this article, the forces balance equations, which determined a yarn path contacting with the toric surface of a single false-twisting-disk unit, were developed on the basis of differential geometry of curved surfaces. In the experimental part, the path shape of a yarn contacting with the toric surface of twisting disk was photographed and simultaneously the yarn tension was measured under several combinations of processing conditions : the yarn entrance direction and feed velocity, the rotational speed of the twisting disk, etc. The data obtained coincided fairly with analytical estimations and the presented scheme was confirmed to be valid for predicting the behaviors of a yarn in the false-twisting processing using a friction <b>disk</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E
