5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut costs, the Kentucky State Police {{announced}} in May 2009 that it would only offer the state driving test in English beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> thing to do.

He added that the operators took advice from experts, and CART's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph Heitzler rejected suggestions that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> decision to hold the race {{in the month of}} September as he had been informed that the month was one of the driest of the year. Carpentier was vocal in his criticism of the organisation of the track, saying that the track personnel should have been ready a month before the race was held, while Kanaan admitted that he was concerned, feeling that the situation was not good for everyone. The 15,000 spectators who were in attendance on Thursday were issued cash refunds.|$|E

Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else.

[...] He illustrates by pointing out that steroids in a baseball player's system do not cause home runs all by themselves but do make home runs more likely. Meteorologist Kerry Emanuel stressed that no individual weather event, such as Hurricane Sandy, can be attributed to climate change, or any specific cause, for that matter.|$|R

He later regretted writing Jo in this way, as he felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> characterization for a female character on Supernatural. However, Jo grows throughout the second season as she rebels against her mother by running away to be a hunter, which Kripke believed made her harder and tougher. Regarding her character's capture by a vengeful spirit in [...] "No Exit", actress Alona Tal felt that Jo was a [...] "badass" [...] who handled the situation well.

500|$|On 24 January 2013, it was {{announced}} McCall would join the backroom staff of new Scotland national football team manager Gordon Strachan. During the 2012/13 season, the club managed {{to stay in the}} top-six. On 28 March 2013, McCall signed a new two-year contract with Motherwell. In April 2013, McCall was awarded March's SPL manager of month for helping the club win three and draw one of their games during the month. At the end of the season, Motherwell finished second for the first time, their highest league position since 1994-95 season, which he described as [...] "incredible". As a result, McCall won Clydesdale Bank Manager of the Year. On 22 May 2013, it was reported that he was set to open talks with Sheffield United about their managerial vacancy in the next 24 hours and that he had cut short a family holiday to intend the interview. Eventually, McCall rejected a move to Sheffield United, following talks between the two and was happy to continue as manager of Motherwell, claiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time to join United.|$|E
500|$|In the end, {{none of the}} {{senators}} was charged with any crime. Instead, the Senate Ethics Committee investigated them. [...] Robert S. Bennett, who was the special investigator for the committee, wanted to drop any action against McCain and Senator John Glenn, {{on the grounds of}} insufficient evidence, but the committee disagreed. [...] After public hearings, McCain was mildly rebuked by the committee for exercising [...] "poor judgment" [...] in intervening with the federal regulators on Keating's behalf, but its 1991 report said that McCain's [...] "actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him....Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate." [...] (In later years, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated a contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target.) [...] On his Keating Five experience, McCain said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong.

40|$|Heart failure with {{preserved}} {{ejection fraction}} (HF-PEF) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> clinical syndrome {{of heart failure}} associated with normal or near-normal systolic function.

In this review, we examine the current evidence about treatment of HF-PEF, with particular emphasis on reviewing the literature for large-scale randomized clinical studies. The lack of significant benefit with neurohormonal antagonism in HF-PEF suggests that this condition might not involve neurohormonal activation as a critical pathophysiologic mechanism.

500|$|McCain became {{embroiled in}} a scandal during the 1980s, as one of five United States {{senators}} comprising the so-called Keating Five. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating's jets that McCain belatedly repaid, in 1989. In 1987, McCain {{was one of the}} five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln. In 1999, McCain said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence.

[...] In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising [...] "poor judgment". In his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue, and he won handily, gaining 56percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor, Evan Mecham.|$|E

It's a song which makes the most of Nicole's unwholesome sexiness– as opposed to wholesome, you understand, I'm not saying there's anything gross about her– and has drama and fury on its side." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an (ahem) debut single". He described the song's busy production as [...] "having a whiff of the Berline [...] "teknoklub" [...] that is a [...] "racket in the best possible way". Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song, awarding it five out of five stars. He gave [...] "Poison" [...] a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger's previous attempt, [...] "Baby Love" [...] (2007), which he only awarded three out of five stars, stating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> single to launch the career of a world-class superstar.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} {{solution to the}} insurance puzzle.

The puzzle why in-surance contracts exist is traditionally resolved by appealing to utility theory, asymmetric information, or a mix of both. Here we note that <b>the</b> expectation value <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> starting point – a legacy {{from the early days}} of probability theory. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> starting point because not even the most basic models of wealth (random walks) are stationary, and what the individual experiences over time <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> expectation value.

5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> thing to do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. <b>The</b> series <b>is</b> considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs {{can be found in}} science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|R
