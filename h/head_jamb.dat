E., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST DIRECTED BY: D. CHARLIE CURCIJA Buildings in USA consume {{close to}} 40 % of overall energy used and {{fenestration}} products (e. g. windows, doors, glazed-wall etc.) {{are the largest}} components of energy loss from buildings. Accurate evaluation of thermal performances of fenestration systems is critical in predicting the overall building energy use, and improving the product performance. Typically, two-dimensional (2 -D) heat transfer analysis is used to evaluate their thermal performance as the 3 -D analysis is highly complex process requiring significantly more time, effort, and cost compared to 2 -D analysis. Another method of evaluation e. g. physical test in a hotbox is not possible for each product as they are too expensive. Heat transfer in fenestration products is a 3 -D process and their effects on overall heat transfer need to be investigated. This thesis investigated 3 -D heat transfer effects in fenestration systems {{in comparison to the}} 2 -D results. No significant work has been done previously in terms of 3 -D modeling of windows, which included all the three forms of heat transfer e. g. conduction, convection and radiation. Detailed 2 -D and 3 -D results were obtained for broad range of fenestration products in the market with a range of frame materials, spacers, insulated glass units (IGU), and sizes. All 2 -D results were obtained with Therm 5 /Window 5 (e. g. currently standard method of evaluating thermal performance) and GAMBIT/FLUENT while all 3 -D results were obtained with GAMBIT/FLUENT. All the three modes of heat transfer mechanism were incorporated in the heat transfer modeling. The study showed that the overall 3 -D heat transfer effects are relatively small (less than 3 %) for present day framing and glazing systems. Though at individual component level (e. g. sill, <b>head,</b> <b>Jamb)</b> 3 -D effects were quite significant (~ 10 %) but they are cancelled by their opposite sign of variation when overall fenestration system effect is calculated. These 3 -D heat transfer effects are higher for low conducting or more energy efficient glazing and framing systems and for smaller size products. The spacer systems did not have much impact on the 3 -D effects on heat transfer. As the market transforms towards more insulating and higher performance fenestration products, 3 -D effects on heat transfer would be an important factor to consider which it may require correlations to be applied to 2 -D models, or may necessitate the development of dedicated 3 -D fenestration heat transfer computer programs...|$|E

60|$|As his {{exhaustion}} vanished {{he began}} to note things. The men had secured the boom; but the schooner's bows looked bare and he remembered the jibs had blown away. The foresail was torn and half-lowered, and the gaff at its <b>head</b> was <b>jambed.</b> The torn canvas kept the vessel from falling off the wind, but would not bring her up {{enough for her to}} lie to. Masts and deck were horribly slanted, the windward bulwark was hove high up, and luminous spray drove across its top. It looked as if she were going over and there was an appalling din, for the scream of the tornado pierced the thunder.|$|R
5000|$|Only 0.6 mi {{north of}} the village, reached by the road at {{the east end of}} the churchyard, is Brewerstreet Farm and the old Rectory, parts of which date {{from the end of the}} 17th century. [...] The house is a two-storey, partly slate-roofed {{structure}} that underwent a complete transformation about the middle of the 18th century. In one of the upper rooms is a stone fireplace with a moulded four-centred <b>head</b> and <b>jambs.</b> Grade II listed, the house has three diagonal 17th century chimney stacks to the old left section at the point where it meets the new. In keeping, its central doubled glazed doors has a Doric fluted pilaster (column) surround under flat porch hood.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows of}} the north aisle are all of 14th century date, that at the east end being of three trefoiled lights with modern {{reticulated}} tracery, the others of two lights with quatrefoil in the head. On {{each side of the}} east window is a moulded corbel for a statue. In the south aisle the east window is of three tall trefoiled lights, with slight piercings, c. 1280, and near it, in the usual position, is a pointed piscina with fluted bowl and inner trefoil arch on plain corbels. The other windows are later and of two cinquefoiled lights. Both doorways have continuous moulded <b>head</b> and <b>jambs,</b> and there is a pseudo-Gothic plaster ribbed ceiling to the porch. At the west end of the south aisle is a stone wallbench. The clearstory windows are square-headed and of two trefoiled lights.|$|R
50|$|St Leonard's {{sits on a}} {{piece of}} high ground close to the banks of both the River Ribble and the River Darwen. It is {{constructed}} of stone in the Perpendicular style; its roofs are slate. The plan consists of a nave, chancel, transepts, a west tower and a north porch. The tower is of four stages and has angled buttresses and a crenellated parapet. On the west side there is a three-light, four-centred, arched window with Perpendicular tracery. There are three-light belfry louvres, also with tracery. There are clock faces on the south and west walls. The tower is entered through a pointed door to the west that has mouldings at the <b>head</b> and door <b>jambs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in flint rubble, and contains some freestone and puddingstone. The dressings are in clunch and re-used Roman bricks. The roofs are tiled. The plan {{consists of a}} nave and chancel, with a south porch and a north vestry. At the west end is a wooden belfry and spire, {{both of which are}} weatherboarded. The east window dates from the 19th century and has three lights containing Decorated-style tracery. In the north wall of the chancel are two two-light windows from the 15th century, and between them is a blocked doorway. There are similar windows in the south wall, and a 15th-century doorway. In the north wall of the nave are two 12th-century windows with semicircular heads, and a doorway from the same period. The doorway contains a door with 12th-century scrolled ironwork. In the south wall are three windows in different styles; a 13th-century lancet window, a 14th-century two-light window, and a small window dating from the 12th century. The south porch is weatherboarded and it leads to a 12th-century doorway with a semicircular <b>head</b> and <b>jambs</b> in stone and Roman brick. The west window has a semicircular brick head, which probably dates from the 17th century.|$|R
50|$|At {{the western}} end of the south wall of the chancel, there is a second lower window which dates from the 13th century, with a pointed trefoil <b>head</b> and rebated <b>jambs.</b> This {{contains}} the only stained glass in the church, the work of James Powell, installed in 1896 to commemorate Rev. Richard Drummond Ash. The image represents Richard de Wych who was Bishop of Chichester from 1244 to 1253, although the face is that of Richard Durnford, the Bishop of the Diocese who had recently died. The inscription below the window reads:In memory of Richard Robert Drummond Ash, M.A. rector of this parish for 28 years A.D. 1860-1888. He entered into rest June 14, 1896 aged 67. In the same year, when the chancel was restored, this window was dedicated by his friends and parishioners. On the northern wall of the chancel is the door to the vestry. This dates from 1896 and has a plain pointed arch. To the right of this, is the Easter sepulchre. This has a large central finial above the inner trefoil-headed arch, with smaller pinnacles at the sides emerging from carved heads. This dates from about 1300 and is possibly the oldest in Sussex.|$|R
50|$|After 1200 {{the north}} aisle was built and the {{original}} north wall pierced to form the existing arcade. The now blocked off south door was cut at about this time. In the <b>head</b> of the <b>jamb</b> is a scratch dial or primitive sundial. A little later the chancel was rebuilt, extended to create the sanctuary and the porch to the north door constructed. At what point the Norman chancel arch was removed is unclear, possibly {{at the time of}} the rebuilding but certainly prior to the erection of the rood screen. The 14th century saw the construction of the vestry, Lady chapel and buttressing of the south and west walls. The existing rood screen probably dates to this period. There is no rood loft but the stairs leading to one are still visible. The stairs lead out of what is now the vestry but was originally the north chapel. This was a 14th-century extension of the north aisle eastwards. Within the vestry is the remains of an aumbry or secure cupboard for holding books and valuable plate. The 19th and 20th centuries have also left their marks. The former saw heavy restoration including a complete reroofing of the nave (including reraftering) and heavy pointing of the exterior. The later has seen necessary restoration to the west end which was damaged by a bomb during World War II.|$|R
