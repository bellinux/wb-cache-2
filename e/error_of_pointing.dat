We have proposed “Attentive Workbench (AWB), ” a deskwork support system that helps a user from both physical and informational viewpoint. The objective of this study is to realize a support system that delivers necessary objects to a user (Fig. 1). To meet this end, the system must estimate the target that the user intends. In this study, we adopt following 3 approaches: (1) To improve the accuracy of recognition of the direction of pointing by estimating the user’s subjective pointing direction from little information (Fig. 2). (2) To decrease the influence of the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> gesture by integrating the spatial information from sensors with the temporal information from the user’s action sequences based on the dynamic Bayesian network.

The nature and quality of this representation can be probed experimentally by studying spatial tasks like distance and bearing estimation. We investigated pointing accuracy in an outdoor environment {{as part of a larger}} project in which we compare spatial behaviour in real environments with that in virtual environments (virtual reality). We carried out experiments in the centre of Tübingen (ca 600 m × 400 m). Standing near one of eleven well-known landmarks, subjects had to turn a pointer in the estimated direction of each of the other ten invisible (occluded) landmarks (all ten subjects had lived in Tübingen for at least two years). The estimated directions were read by the experimenter from a hidden compass and later compared with the actual directions. This procedure was repeated from all eleven locations along the subjects' route through the town. The mean absolute angular <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> was 10. 8 °, while the individual subject's means ranged from 9. 1 ° to 15. 0 °. We found highly significant differences in pointing accuracy for the different locations; mean absolute error ranged from 6. 3 ° to 15. 8 ° (n= 10). Systematic asymmetries in pointing from one landmark to another and back were not found. The pointing accuracy found in this study is clearly better than that found in most other studies, which might relate to the familiarity and the size of the environment. The apparent absence of an asymmetry in the pointing directions between two locations is consistent with the notion of a metric mental map...|$|E

This work proposes a block-to-point fine registration approach to correct the <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>point</b> clouds from TLS and of geodetic networks observed using total stations. Based on a reference coordinate system, the block-to-point estimation is performed to obtain representative points. Then, fine registration with a six-parameter transformation is performed with the help of an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. For comparisons, fine registration with a seven-parameter transformation is introduced by applying a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The proposed method not only corrects the registration errors between a geodetic network and the scans, but also considers the errors among the scans.

More precisely, in the first stage, by a multistep adjustment, we reconstruct an unbiased model based on the correlation information between the covariates; in the second stage, we further reduce the adjusted model by a semiparametric variable selection method and get a new estimator of the parameter of interest simultaneously. Its convergence rate and asymptotic normality are also obtained.

For most body segments, the estimated trajectories of segment Euler angles have less than 5 ° RMSE (in each dimension) with 5 -point cubic spline interpolation when there is no measurement <b>error</b> <b>of</b> interpolation <b>points.</b> Sensitivity analysis indicates that when the measurement error exists, the root mean square <b>error</b> (RMSE) <b>of</b> estimated trajectories increases.

40|$|Multiple {{imputation}} (MI) is {{a popular}} method for repairing and analyzing data with missing values. MI replaces missing values {{with a sample of}} random values drawn from an imputation model. The most popular form of MI, which we call posterior draw multiple imputation (PDMI), draws the parameters of the imputation model from a Bayesian posterior distribution. The advantage of PDMI is that it supports Bayesian analysis of the imputed data. The disadvantages are that PDMI can be computationally demanding and slightly reduces the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>point</b> estimates. We consider an alternative, which we call maximum likelihood multiple imputation (MLMI), that estimates the parameters of the imputation model using maximum likelihood (or equivalent).

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{demonstrate}} that, when evaluating a method for determining prediction intervals, interval size matters more than coverage because the latter can be fixed at a chosen confidence level with good reliability. To achieve the desired coverage, we employ a simple non-parametric method to compute prediction intervals by calibrating estimated prediction errors, and we extend the basic method with a continuum correction to deal with small data sets. In our experiments on a collection of several NIR data sets, we evaluate several existing methods of computing prediction intervals for partial least-squares (PLS) regression.
