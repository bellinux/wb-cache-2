40|$|Although {{simulations}} of impact on structures have been extensively performed using finite element codes, their use still presents challenges to researchers and designers. The present paper reports on {{work that has}} been carried out within the MARSTRUCT network of excellence, aiming on one hand to define simulation techniques that may be used to perform realistic simulations and, on the other hand to determine the reactions of the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> structures of <b>tankers</b> to grounding actions. An extensive series of simulations have been performed independently by the MARTSRUCT partners NTUA and NTNU in order to investigate the effect of the user selected parameters on the results and ultimately, to examine if widely accepted modeling techniques may be used to produce reliable results. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is a {{degradation}} of material properties and strength due to {{interactions with the}} environment. This dissertation details the analyses of corrosion effects on two failure modes: ductile fracture and bending strength of membranes, plates and shells. Furthermore, corrosion induced stress or strain concentration effects are incorporated in reliability studies. Annular elastic membrane deformation is studied analytically. Large out-of-plane ship hull deformation in ship grounding or collision is often analyzed by using membrane theory. It {{has been found that}} older ships with corrosion are more susceptible to fracture in grounding or collision. Therefore, corrosion effects on ductile fracture initiation are studied next. Corrosion effects inducing strain localization are revealed by a 3 D model based on the finite element method. The relationship between local and overall strain and model size effects are examined for a rectangular plate under uniaxial and biaxial tension. The ductile fracture of corroded plates is also studied under different pit intensities, distributions and loading conditions. Corrosion also degrades the bending capacity of pipelines. Previous research focused mainly on burst capacity of corroded pipelines. Key points of finite element analyses of corroded pipelines in bending are addressed in detail. An experimental testing program is fully reported and validates the finite element analysis results. Bending strength reduction because of corrosion has been revealed. Secondary effects in the experimental testing are also discussed. Finally, corrosion induced high local stress and strain levels are evaluated by means of stress and strain concentrations. Both analytical and numerical analyses are performed including the use of Neuber’s stress concentration theory. Such studies are further incorporated into the reliability analyses of corroded plates. Structural failure probability and partial safety factors are calculated by considering the randomness of corrosion geometry and of the applied nominal strain. A reliability study is applied on a corroded bottom shell of a <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> oil <b>tanker</b> in ship grounding...|$|R
40|$|In 1990, the US {{adopted the}} OPA 90 in {{response}} to the Exxon Valdez grounding outside the Alaskan coast in 1989. The OPA 90 was the first legislation demanding double hull on oil tankers in order to prevent the spillage of oil in case of a grounding or collision. The IMO adopted amendments to MARPOL 73 / 78 in 1992, which for example required all new tankers of 600 dwt and above to have double sides or <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> and <b>tankers</b> of 5, 000 dwt and above to have both <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> and <b>double</b> sides. The Erika accident outside the French coast shook the EU and a stricter regulation, in comparison with the MARPOL, on double hull tankers was adopted. The Prestige accident in 2002 further spurred the EU to put pressure on the IMO to implement the same accelerated phase out scheme of single hulled tankers as the EU had already adopted. This developed into a battle between the EU and the IMO on the jurisdictional right to prevent marine pollution by phasing out single hulled tankers. The thesis is a descriptive and analytical study of the development of the MARPOL and EU phase out schemes. By presenting the relevant UNCLOS articles it is analyzed how unilateral legislation may prevent single hulled tankers by using the jurisdiction of flag, port, and coastal states. The EU has taken an independent initiative to regulate the phase out stricter than the IMO and chapter 2 examines the jurisdiction of the EU in the field of maritime pollution prevention. The study shows that the EU member states may, by using their flag and port state jurisdiction given to them by the UNCLOS, implement the EU regulation. Chapter 3 describes how the MARPOL and EU schemes on the phasing out of single hulled tankers developed. These schemes came about during a process lasting a decade when both organizations wanted to prove their efficiency to respond quickly to the problems of oil pollution. Finally, the EU, after political pressure from the EU member states and the public opinion, had the IMO adopting the same phase out scheme as the EU but with some exemptions. The shipping industry is vulnerable to unilateral legislation since shipping is an international business and EU politicians are not considered to be as competent in the maritime field as experts of the IMO. Therefore, the IMO needs to take the initiative back from the EU on all matters concerning marine legislation. The last chapter analyzes the possible consequences for the shipping industry due to the phasing out of single hulled tankers. The phase out require, among other things, new tonnage to be built and old tonnage to be scrapped. There are many consequences for the shipping industry when new legislation is made and some of them may be very costly for some of the actors in the shipping industry...|$|R

The progressive failure of the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> is investigated in terms of plastic deformation and also the evolution of damage including material rupture.

40|$|Achieving the <b>Double</b> <b>Bottom</b> Line: A Framework for Corporations Seeking to Deliver Profits and Public Services {{argues that}} many people who object to for-profit {{corporations}} that deliver public services, such as kindergarten through 12 th grade education or foster care, have greatly exaggerated {{the extent to which}} the for-profit regime will compel such corporations to subordinate the delivery of those services to financial considerations. Because of this over-exaggeration, these opponents have not focused on designing a framework that would assist these entities in meeting their <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line—achieving profit for their shareholders while also delivering a high quality public service. The Article seeks to remedy this failure. The Article therefore proposes that <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line corporations be required to have an independent committee, similar to the audit committee, which would focus not on financial issues, but rather on issues pertaining to the attainment of the entities’ public goals. By providing for both committees within the corporate framework, this proposal makes it more likely that <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line corporations actually achieve their dual objectives...|$|R
