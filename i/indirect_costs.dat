5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} a university 2 ̆ 7 s <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rate and its level of federal research funding. Both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> funding are examined. The data used in the analyses include unpublished institutional level data for all doctoral and research universities on funding and <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates obtained from the National Science Foundation for the fiscal years 1988 to 1997 period. Our major finding is that higher <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates are associated with higher levels of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> funding for institutions that initially are among the largest recipients of federal funding. In contrast, for universities initially in the lower tail of funding recipients, higher <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates are associated with lower levels of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> funding. This pattern of results is hypothesized to be based upon an institution 2 ̆ 7 s <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rate serving primarily as a 2 ̆ 2 price 2 ̆ 2 of research for lesser institutions but serving primarily as a proxy for the quality of the institution 2 ̆ 7 s research infrastructure for the major recipients of federal funds. Our findings are consistent with the observation that since 1990 both <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates and shares of research funding for major private research universities have tended to decline. We find no evidence that faculty at major research universities are disadvantaged in their quests for external research funding by high <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} {{study was to examine}} the relationship between state-level funded support for higher education and political control with institutional <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates at select United States colleges and universities. A correlational research design was utilized using a MLR model to investigate if a relationship exists between institutional <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates, state political control, state funded support for higher education, and select institutional characteristics. Datum for this study was archival retrieved from the Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERD), Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO), and National Conference of State Legislature (NCSL) on select United States colleges and universities. The findings from this study revealed that (a) <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates were not significantly affected by which party dominated the legislative and executive branches (b) state funded support for higher education was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates, and (c) the model developed in this study was found to be a significant predictor of <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates. Select institutional characteristics in this study indicated that the five Carnegie Classifications used in this study indicated no difference in <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates. However, increases in federal institutionally financed research and development funding support for research by colleges and universities were found to predict higher <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> rates, while full time equivalent (FTE) ratios were not found to be associated with <b>indirect</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

5|$|The President of Honduras {{estimated}} that Mitch set back 50years of economic development. The storm wrecked about 35,000houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5million people homeless, or about 20% of the country's population. Mitch directly caused $2.005billion in damage, {{with an additional}} $1.8billion in <b>indirect</b> <b>costs.</b> Most of the damage was ruined crops, and cash crop exports were cut by 9.4% in 1999, {{largely due to the}} storm. Over 70% of the transportation infrastructure was damaged, mostly damaged highways and bridges. Widespread areas experienced power outages, and about 70% of the country lost water after the storm. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, a large landslide affected three neighborhoods and formed a temporary dam. Floods in the city damaged buildings that were over 350years old. Throughout the country, there were at least 7,000fatalities, some reported in each department.|$|E

40|$|Occupational injury {{has sparked}} more {{concern to the}} {{manufacturing}} industry since it may give an impact to the organization especially on financial viewpoint. However, there is lack of consensus between researchers in identifying occupational accident <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> components. This study proposed {{an assessment of the}} <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> model by using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In total, there are 344 cases (which occurred between 2008 and 2013) were considered in developing the model and those cases were obtained from six different sectors in manufacturing industry. Data collection process involves reviewing previous accident record in that particular company. Besides, several interview sessions with site safety officers, representatives from human resource and account department, supervisors and operators were conducted in order to estimate each of <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> components. Both approaches also known as local specific approach. Then, CFA is performed to validate the model proposed by examining the relationship between observed variable and its latent construct. The observed variables are productivity loss, worker replacement cost, administration and legal cost, investigation cost, machine and equipment damage cost and product damage cost whereas latent construct used in this study is accident <b>indirect</b> <b>cost.</b> The CFA result shows that the occupational accident <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> model has acceptable goodness of fit. In conclusion, <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> components are productivity loss, worker replacement cost, administration and legal cost, investigation cost, machine and equipment damage cost and product damage cost...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{is one of}} {{the chronic}} {{diseases}} with a high prevalence and consequently a substantial socio-economic burden in Arab countries. In this paper, we propose for the first time an estimation of the <b>indirect</b> economic <b>cost</b> of diabetes incurred by the loss of productivity caused by disability and premature mortality due to diabetes in the Arab region. The 21 countries were divided into three income groups and the <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> of diabetes was estimated in each group. The total <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> was estimated to be around USD 72 billion whereas the average per capita <b>indirect</b> <b>cost</b> was estimated to be USD 2770, varying from USD 423 in group 3 to USD 7959 in Group 1.

25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>costs.</b> Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is going to depend on a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E

25|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>costs</b> {{are those}} that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual {{coercion}} does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice {{and can lead to}} their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not. Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.|$|E
