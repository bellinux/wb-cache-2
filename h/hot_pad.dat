50|$|Three {{years later}} VMF-333 {{became the first}} Marine Corps {{squadron}} to receive the F-8 Crusader.On 14 August 1962, the squadron performed a non-stop air refuelled deployment to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico and Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Of the 22 aircraft in the squadron 4 were initially stationed at Gitmo as armed <b>Hot</b> <b>Pad</b> Alert aircraft. The rest of the reinforced squadron (parts of Marine Air Base Squadron 32 and Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 32 were attached) at Roosevelt Roads engaged in advanced tactics, gunnery and missile training while living in a tent city {{that served as a}} deployment test site. The squadron was already in position when the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted in October 1962 and the aircraft numbers at Gitmo were reinforced should the need have arisen to strike targets in Cuba. During the crisis, VMF-333 was joined by Marine Attack Squadron 331 and assumed tactical command over the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's F-86 aircraft as a combined Puerto Rico Air Defense Command. Trip Tree returned to MCAS Beaufort in December of that year after the crisis was resolved.|$|E

To {{illustrate}} {{the difference in}} cold/hot natural properties and therapeutic effect of coptis-evodia herb couples by using cold/hot plate differentiating technology and microcalorimetry combined with material basis analysis in vivo and in vitro. It showed that animal retention ratio in <b>hot</b> <b>pad</b> significantly decreased along with the decrease in coptis proportion in coptis-evodia herb couples. In addition, Zuojin wan markedly reduced the retention ratio of gastritis mice in the <b>hot</b> <b>pad,</b> while Fanzuojin wan displayed an opposite result. Further, Mg 2 +-ATPase, Ca 2 +-ATPase, and T-AOC activity significantly weakened in coptis-treated group in the livers of the mice. In the gastric cells from the gastritis mice, Fanzuojin wan remarkably increased calorific value for growth and metabolism, while Zuojin wan significantly reduced the calorigenic effect. It suggested that {{the changes in the}} major chemical compositions (especially alkaloids) were the material base-induced transformation between “cold” and “hot” syndromes. The material basis which affected the transformation between “cold” and “hot” syndromes might be X 2, X 3, X 4, X 8, epiberberine hydrochloride, jatrorrhizine hydrochloride, coptisine sulphate, palmatine hydrochloride, and berberine hydrochloride.

40|$|Aim to {{investigate}} the prevalence of pain {{and the use of}} analgesic drug and non-drug therapy among older persons in nursing homes. This was a cross-sectional study. Six nursing homes were approached,and a total of 365 older persons interviewed. Information collected regarding their demographic data, pain situation and use of analgesic drug and non-drug methods as pain relief. Results: There were 365 older adult participants (248 female and 117 male, mean age 84. 7 ± 6. 73). Among them, 249 (i. e. 70 %) had experienced pain over the previous 3 months, with a pain score of 4. 45 ± 2. 44 (on a 10 -point scale); pain location was mainly in the hip, ankle and knee; and over 40 % indicated having suffered pain at all. Fifty percent had taken oral analgesics for pain control, and around 50 % used non-pharmacological methods such as applying topical ointment, massage, and use of cold or <b>hot</b> <b>pads</b> in treating pain. Only 40 % of them used both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods of pain control. Disturbingly, 14. 5 % of participants were suffering from pain but had not received any form of pain control. Discussion: The problem of older persons with pain is serious in nursing homes. Education on the appropriate use of analgesics should be given to the elderly to reduce their worries regarding adverse drug effects. Also, older persons can be introduced to non-drug therapy such as physiotherapy, acupressure and distraction.

30|$|After surgery, each animal {{together}} with a recirculating <b>hot</b> water <b>pad</b> was wrapped with linen blankets, maintained on 2 – 3 % isoflurane, and 30 – 40  min were allowed for baseline physiological parameters to stabilize before the nasopharyngeal brain cooling was started. Two successive experiments were performed on each animal. In the first experiment, nasopharyngeal brain cooling was initiated by blowing room temperature air (21  °C[*]±[*] 1  °C and relative humidity (RH) of 15 – 20 %), delivered from a hospital medical air outlet, at a flow rate of 14 – 15  L/min as measured by a flow meter (VWR Flow Meters Acrylic, FR 4500 series with accuracy of ±[*] 3 %, VWR International Inc) into both nostrils for 60  min (group I). The brain was then allowed to gradually rewarm to baseline temperature by turning off the hospital air supply. In the second experiment, brain cooling was accomplished by blowing cold air (−[*] 7  °C, RH 15 – 20 %) at the same flow rate as the first experiment for 60  min. Once the brain temperature stabilized, the flow rate and air temperature were adjusted to maintain the brain temperature and reach for another 60  min while core body temperature was maintained above 36  °C using the recirculating <b>hot</b> water <b>pad</b> and by packing gloves filled with hot water around the body (group II). Cold air was generated by the vortex tube, as discussed in detail in the following section. During cooling, {{the mouth of the}} animal was kept open so that air can escape from mouth and nostrils.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{three-dimensional}} model of recovery phase storm hot plasmas to explore the signatures of pitch angle distributions (PADS) in global fast atom imagery of the magnetosphere. The model computes mass, energy, and position-dependent PADs based on drift effects, charge exchange losses, and Coulomb drag. The <b>hot</b> plasma <b>PAD</b> strongly influences both the storm current system carried by the hot plasma and its time evolution. In turn, the PAD is strongly influenced by plasma waves through pitch angle diffusion, a microscale effect. We report the first simulated neutral atom images that account for anisotropic <b>PADs</b> within the <b>hot</b> plasma. They exhibit spatial distribution features that correspond directly to the PADs {{along the lines of}} sight. We investigate the use of image brightness distributions along tangent-shell field lines to infer equatorial PADS. In tangent-shell regions with minimal spatial gradients, reasonably accurate PADs are inferred from simulated images. They demonstrate the importance of modeling PADs for image inversion and show that comparisons of models with real storm plasma images will reveal the global effects of these microscale processes...|$|R

5000|$|A {{good example}} of where laser {{engraving}} technology has been adopted into the industry norm is the production line. In this particular setup, the laser beam is directed towards a rotating or vibrating mirror. The mirror moves in a manner which may trace out numbers and letters onto the surface being marked. This is particularly useful for printing dates, expiry codes, and lot numbering of products traveling along a production line. Laser marking allows materials made of plastic and glass to be marked [...] "on the move". The location where the marking takes place is called a [...] "marking laser station", an entity often found in packaging and bottling plants. Older, slower technologies such as <b>hot</b> stamping and <b>pad</b> printing have largely been phased out and replaced with laser engraving.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A novel {{technique}} and a non-thermal soldering method {{to improve the}} performance of AgHT- 8 transparent polymer antennas are proposed in this paper. The proposed technique involves {{the removal of the}} coating layer at areas on the CPW ground and feed line where the connectors of the coaxial feed or legs of the SMA connectors will be attached, and applying a coat of silver paint on the exposed areas before cold soldering the coaxial connections or SMA connector legs. The non-thermal or cold soldering using electrically conductive paste enables direct soldering of the co-axial feed points or connector legs which cannot otherwise be done with hot or thermal soldering. This type of connection greatly enhances the performance of the AgHT- 8 polymer antennas compared to coaxial feed point connections through <b>hot</b> soldered copper <b>pads</b> glued {{to the surface of the}} polymer coating.

40|$|Four conductively coupled {{thermoelectric}} cells, developed {{under the}} SP 100 program, have been life tested. These cells, {{referred to as}} TOC (Task Order Contract) cells, were fourth generation cells, and incorporated design improvements to extend operating life. GS 526 glass had been added to suppress the loss of Ge from the MoGe bond between the SiGe and the barrier graphite. The previous generation was life limited by the degradation of this electrical bond at the SiGe to graphite hot side interface due to the Ge loss. This led to abnormal internal resistance trends. The TOC cell test data and post test diagnostic have confirmed {{the effectiveness of the}} perimeter glass. Three of the four cells demonstrated normal electrical performance trends. The fourth cell (No. 139) tested at JPL showed an abnormal increase in internal resistance and a shift in temperature levels at 12, 400 hours following a facility shutdown and restart. When the cell was removed from the test fixture, separation occurred between the <b>hot</b> side compliant <b>pad</b> facesheet and the niobium filament bundles. No degradation of the bond between the SiGe and the barrier graphite was found and the change in slope of the internal resistance was attributed to changes in the rate of dopant precipitation caused by the shift in temperature levels...|$|R

40|$|Measured and {{predicted}} static and dynamic characteristics are provided for a four-pad, rocker-pivot, tilting-pad journal bearing in the load-on-pad and load-between-pad orientations. The bearing has the following characteristics: 4 pads,. 57 pad pivot offset, 0. 6 L/D ratio, 60. 33 mm (2. 375 in) pad axial length, 0. 08255 mm (0. 00325 in) radial clearance in the load-on-pad orientation, and 0. 1189 mm (0. 00468 in) radial clearance in the load-between-pad orientation. Tests {{were conducted on}} a floating test bearing design with unit loads ranging from 0 to 2903 kPa (421. 1 psi) and speeds from 6. 8 to 13. 2 krpm. For all rotor speeds, hot-clearance measurements were taken to show the reduction in bearing clearance due to thermal expansion of the shaft and pads during testing. As the testing conditions get <b>hotter,</b> the rotor, <b>pads,</b> and bearing expand, decreasing radial bearing clearance. Hot-clearance measurements showed a 16 - 25 % decrease in clearance compared to a clearance measurement at room temperature. For all test conditions, dynamic tests were performed over a range of excitation frequencies to obtain complex dynamic stiffness coefficients {{as a function of}} frequency. The direct real dynamic stiffness coefficients were then fitted with a quadratic function with respect to frequency. From the curve fit, the frequency dependence was captured by including a virtual-mass matrix [M] to produce a frequency independent [K][C][M] model. The direct dynamic stiffness coefficients for the load-on-pad orientation showed significant orthotropy, while the load-between-pad did not. The load-between-pad showed slight orthotropy as load increased. Experimental cross-coupled stiffness coefficients were measured in both load orientations, but were of the same sign and significantly less than direct stiffness coefficients. In both orientations the imaginary part of the measured dynamic stiffness increased linearly with increasing frequency, allowing for frequency independent direct damping coefficients. Rotordynamic coefficients presented were compared to predictions from two different Reynolds-based models. Both models showed the importance of taking into account pivot flexibility and different pad geometries (due to the reduction in bearing clearance during testing) in predicting rotordynamic coefficients. If either of these two inputs were incorrect, then predictions for the bearings impedance coefficients were very inaccurate. The main difference between prediction codes {{is that one of the}} codes incorporates pad flexibility in predicting the impedance coefficients for a tilting-pad journal bearing. To look at the effects that pad flexibility has on predicting the impedance coefficients, a series of predictions were created by changing the magnitude of the pad's bending stiffness. Increasing the bending stiffness used in predictions by a factor of 10 typically caused a 3 - 11 % increase in predicted Kxx and Kyy, and a 10 - 24 % increase in predicted Cxx and Cyy. In all cases, increasing the calculated bending stiffness from ten to a hundred times the calculated value caused slight if any change in Kxx, Kyy, Cxx, and Cyy. For a flexible pad an increase in bending stiffness can have a large effect on predictions; however, for a more rigid pad an increase in pad bending stiffness will have a much lesser effect. Results showed that the pad's structural bending stiffness can be an important factor in predicting impedance coefficients. Even though the pads tested in this thesis are extremely stiff, changes are still seen in predictions when the magnitude of the pad?s bending stiffness is increased, especially in Cxx, and Cyy. The code without pad flexibility predicted Kxx and Kyy much more accurately than the code with pad flexibility. The code with pad flexibility predicts Cxx more accurately, while the code without pad flexibility predicted Cyy more accurately. Regardless of prediction Code used, the Kxx and Kyy were over-predicted at low loads, but predicted more accurately as load increased. Cxx, and Cyy were modeled very well in the load-on-pad orientation, while slightly overpredicted in the load-between-pad orientation. For solid pads, like the ones tested here, both codes do a decent job at predicting impedance coefficient...|$|R
