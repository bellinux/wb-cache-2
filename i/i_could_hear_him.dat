2500|$|In August 1900, Taylor {{was called}} up to the major leagues {{to play for the}} New York Giants. [...] He made his major league debut on August 27, 1900. [...] In his first game for the Giants, five Boston players tried to take {{advantage}} of Taylor's deafness by trying to steal third base. [...] Interviewed in 1942, Taylor recalled with pride, [...] "I nailed each one. [...] I walked over to (Herman) Long, the last man caught, and let him know by signs <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> stealing." [...] Appearing in 11 games for the 1900 Giants, Taylor compiled a 4–3 record with a 2.45 earned run average (ERA).|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> holding Garm's nose {{as the dog}} {{threw it}} up to the stars.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} see him any more, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> choking and {{strangling}} and coughing. The audience kept a death-like silence. I crouched {{on the lip of}} the entrance and waited. The strangling and coughing died down, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> now and again clearing his throat. A little later he began to climb down. He went very quietly, pausing every moment or so to stretch his neck or to feel it with his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} how {{relieved}} I am," [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> plainly <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> saying to Neil, [...] "that the lad has finished with the fish patrol without accident." ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{minutes passed}} before Jack {{could go on}} with his story. This rush of {{emotions}} {{was too much for}} me for a while. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> or attend to him, so deeply did it stir me.|$|R
60|$|At length we {{were within}} about forty yards of that dying fire and, {{afraid to go}} further, came to a stand--or rather, a lie-still--behind some bushes until we knew more. Hans lifted his head and sniffed with his broad nostrils; then he whispered into my ear, but so low that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|That evening, as I sat in {{the saloon}} after dinner, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> muttering {{continuously}} in his room. Ransome, who was clearing the table, said to me: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's all yourn, Em'ly,' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> say. 'I haven't nowt {{in all the}} wureld that ain't yourn, my dear. It ain't of no {{delight to}} me, except for you!' ...|$|E
60|$|Fred's {{door was}} shut, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> snoring. I {{scratched}} gently, and then harder, till I heard the snores stop. He {{got out of}} bed and opened the door.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He will aye {{be drunk}} {{when the wind}} blaws,' {{returned}} Rorie in the same high key, {{and it was all}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I succeeded--I {{generally}} do--in securing one of {{the front}} seats among the audience, and was already comfortably installed in my place in court when through the trap door I saw {{the head of the}} prisoner emerge. She was very becomingly dressed in deep black, and, led by two policemen, she took her place in the dock. Sir James Fenwick shook hands with her very warmly, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> instilling words of comfort into her.|$|R
6000|$|The old man laughed. [...] "I let {{him look}} down," [...] said he, [...] "but he didn't see nothin'. I was laughin' at {{him all the}} time he was at work. He had his {{instruments}} with him, and he was turnin' down his different kinds of lights, thinkin', of course, that he could see through any kind of coverin' that we put over our machines; but, bless you! he couldn't do nothin', and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> swear as he rubbed his eyes after he had been lookin' down for a little while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, good, excellent--for the interior." [...] The little Mexican {{retreated into}} his shack and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> murmuring, [...] "For the interior, excellent," [...] {{as he moved}} to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> murmuring beside me, [...] "Short--short, {{your life}} is short"; till {{the sound of it}} seemed to mingle with the {{measured}} ticking of a clock somewhere in the silent house.|$|E
6000|$|... “Look at ’im run! Look at ’im run!” <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> crying. “An’ with a gyme leg at that! Come on back, you pore little mamma’s darling. I won’t ’it yer; no, I won’t.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 78. Nay, thought I, now I grow {{worse and}} worse: now I am farther from {{conversion}} than ever I was before. Wherefore I began to sink greatly in my soul, {{and began to}} entertain such discouragement in my heart, as laid me as low as hell. If now I should have burned at the stake, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not believe that Christ had love for me: alas! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> neither <b>hear</b> <b>Him,</b> nor see Him, nor feel Him, nor favour any of His things; I was driven as with a tempest, my heart would be unclean, and the Canaanites would dwell in the land.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{as he was}} {{too small}} for a great school, <b>I</b> thought Clive <b>could</b> not do better than stay with his old aunt and have his Uncle Charles for a tutor, {{who is one of}} the finest {{scholars}} in the world. <b>I</b> wish you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> in the pulpit. His delivery is grander and more impressive than any divine now in England. His sermons you have subscribed for, and likewise his book of elegant poems, which are pronounced to be very fine.|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{taking a}} very great liberty with your private door. But the object {{justified}} it. The object justified everything. You will not be angry when you know everything--at least, {{you will not be}} angry with me. I had a key to your side door and also to the museum door. I did not give them up when I left. And so you see it was not difficult for me to let myself into the museum. I used to come in early before the crowd had cleared from the street. Then I hid myself in the mummy-case, and took refuge there whenever Simpson came round. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> coming. <b>I</b> used to leave {{in the same way as}} I came." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{less than}} three times were these words repeated, I reading them from the motion of his lips, for {{as a matter of}} course he did not dare to speak so loud that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{were riding}} {{in the shadow of}} the trees at the time, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> {{slapping}} his riding-whip against his boot, and taking pinch after pinch of snuff, as was his way when he was excited.|$|E
6000|$|But when I got {{him into}} his bunk he again {{buried his face in}} his hands, {{covering}} his eyes, and as I turned to go <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> murmuring, “I am a sick man, a very sick man.” ...|$|E
60|$|Unhappily, I {{missed my}} footing in the obscure light, {{and fell on}} the open ground beyond the stream. When I had gained my feet once more, Stanwick had {{disappeared}} among the trees which marked the boundary of the park beyond me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see nothing of <b>him,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing of <b>him,</b> when I {{came out on the}} high-road. There I met with a laboring man who showed me the way to the village. From the inn I sent a letter to Miss Laroche's aunt, explaining what had happened, and asking leave to call at the Hall on the next day.|$|R
60|$|Alas! {{think what}} I suffered, at being obliged {{to keep up}} an ineffectual chase after my Columbine through whole pantomimes; to see her carried off in the {{vigorous}} arms of the happy Harlequin; and to be obliged, instead of snatching her from him, to tumble sprawling with Pantaloon and the clown; and bear the infernal and degrading thwacks of my rival's weapon of lath; which, may heaven confound him! (excuse my passion) the villain laid on with a malicious good-will; nay, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> absolutely <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> chuckle and laugh beneath his accursed mask--I beg pardon for growing a little warm in my narration. I wish to be cool, but these recollections will sometimes agitate me. I have heard and read of many desperate and deplorable situations of lovers; but none, I think, in which true love was ever exposed to so severe and peculiar a trial.|$|R
5000|$|Given Shepherd {{started playing}} bass trying to replace Hiro Yamamoto, he {{considers}} his Soundgarden predecessor a major influence, particularly as Yamamoto differed from bassists [...] "relegated to a role of following along", {{even if his}} bass [...] "was mixed so damn quietly on the recordings that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> well enough to develop a deep understanding of his fluidity or his textures." [...] Shepherd followed a fingerstyle playing based on Yamamoto, Chuck Dukowski from Black Flag, and Mike Watt, and listened to Charles Mingus [...] "because I wanted {{to learn how to}} play some dirty, weird shit." [...] Certain songs have Shepherd using a pick to provide [...] "different textures". Shepherd considers that he approaches guitars [...] "like a horn section", split between rhythm and lead, while [...] "Bass is more fluid; you're a lot more free to do stuff because it's a song within a song". His preference is to play the bass along to the vocals, as [...] "it helps to harmonize." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He be d----d," [...] muttered the plain-speaking Injin, {{as long as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> As soon as {{released}} from his presence, Streak o' Lightning continued his examination, though a little vexed at the undramatical character of the interruption.|$|E
6000|$|Benita {{shook her}} head. [...] "He was alive {{a few hours}} ago, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> raving and {{shouting}} outside the wall we built. But, father, it has all come back to me; I believe that I have found it." ...|$|E
60|$|No one was present. Even Phil Jones was away; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> {{talking to}} the cook in the galley. I had the place all to myself, and now was {{the chance to do}} the work I wished to accomplish.|$|E
60|$|The next Day my Friend came to me, {{and talking}} {{of it in}} Confidence to me, I am afraid, says he, I am going to marry a She Devil, and so told me the Story; I took no Notice to him, but finding out his Mistress, and taking proper Measures, with some of my {{particular}} Skill, I soon found {{out that it was}} really so, that she was a mere Apparition; and {{had it not been for}} that accidental Disorder of her Passions, which discover'd her Inside, she might indeed have cheated any Man, for she was a lovely Devil as ever was seen; she talk'd like an Angel, sung like a Syren, did every thing, and said every thing that was taking and charming: But what then? it was all Apparition, for she was a mere Devil. It is true, my Friend marry'd her, and tho' she was a Devil without doubt, yet either she behav'd so well, or he was so good, <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> find Fault with her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> say so, {{but though}} {{secretly}} it pleased me, yet it so closely touched me another way that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not refrain sighing, and sometimes tears; and {{one time in}} particular it so affected me that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not conceal it from him; but when he saw tears run down my face, there was no concealing the occasion from him; he was too importunate to be denied in a thing of that moment; so I frankly answered, [...] "It sensibly affects me, my lord," [...] said I, [...] "that, whatever the merit of this little creature may be, he must always have a bend on his arms. The disaster of his birth will be always, not a blot only to his honour, but a bar to his fortunes in the world. Our affection will be ever his affliction, and his mother's crime be the son's reproach. The blot can never be wiped out by the most glorious action; nay, if it lives to raise a family," [...] said I, [...] "the infamy must descend even to its innocent posterity." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{day after}} Davis' death, the Raiders played the Houston Texans. Oakland {{was leading the}} game 25-20 late in the fourth quarter. On the final play of the game, Raider free safety Michael Huff intercepted Texan quarterback Matt Schaub {{in the end zone}} to {{preserve}} the victory. The Raiders had only 10 defensive players on the field for the play. The play was referred to as the [...] "Divine Interception" [...] with media speculating that Davis was the 11th player on the field in spirit. Raiders coach Hue Jackson said Al Davis [...] "had his hand on that ball." [...] Jackson was highly emotional in victory, as well as Davis's son Mark Davis. Jackson said, [...] "One thing coach (Davis) always taught me was he said: 'Hue, don't believe in plays. Believe in players and eventually the players will make plays for you.' And that's what <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> saying that to me the whole time. Believe in your players and not the plays." [...] "We know he's looking down on us right now," [...] Huff said. [...] "This win is for him. I appreciate everything he's done for this organization. He's never gone in our eyes. We'll never let him go. He's with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nearer {{he came to}} {{the line}} of my property, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> making little moaning, whimpering noises as he licked the damp wood. It was like {{listening}} to an animal grazing pasture-grass at night and ever grazing nearer.|$|E
6000|$|The {{carriage}} was bouncing, swaying and lurching {{around corners}} {{at such a}} wild pace as to make conversation impossible. Besides, {{there was nothing to}} say. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> muttering over and over, [...] "And I never knew. I never knew." ...|$|E
60|$|Fully a {{score of}} the hunters were under the tree, {{discharging}} arrows into it. They always picked up their arrows when they fell back to earth. I could not see Red-Eye, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> howling {{from somewhere in the}} tree.|$|E
6000|$|Dinner-time came. I hoped, the stout gentleman might dine in the travellers'-room, {{and that}} I might at length get {{a view of}} his person; but no--he had dinner served in his own room. What could be {{the meaning of this}} {{solitude}} and mystery? He could not be a radical; there was something too aristocratical in thus keeping himself apart {{from the rest of the}} world, and condemning himself to his own dull company throughout a rainy day. And then, too, he lived too well for a discontented politician. He seemed to expatiate on a variety of dishes, and to sit over his wine like a jolly friend of good living. Indeed, my doubts on this head were soon at an end; for he could not have finished his first bottle before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> faintly <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> humming a tune; and on listening, I found it to be [...] "God save the King." [...] 'Twas plain, then, he was no radical, but a faithful subject; one that grew loyal over his bottle, and was ready to stand by king and constitution, when he could stand by nothing else. But who could he be? My conjectures began to run wild. Was he not some personage of distinction, traveling incog.? [...] "God knows!" [...] said I, at my wit's end; [...] "it may be one of the royal family for aught I know, for they are all stout gentlemen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you why, Mr. Hartley," [...] he said, in a loud voice. [...] "It is because, {{for the purpose of}} the war in this country, they know {{infinitely}} more than the officers of our army. They talk the languages, they know the men. These blacks will follow them anywhere, to the death. As for Mr. Hilliard, he has performed feats that any officer in the army, whatever his rank, would be proud to have done. He went in disguise into the Dervish camp at Metemmeh, before Hunter's advance began, and obtained invaluable information. He jumped overboard from a gunboat to save a drowning Dervish woman, although to do so involved almost certain capture and death {{at the hands of the}} Dervishes. In point of fact, his escape was a remarkable one, for he was tied to a tree in the first line of the Dervish defences at Atbara, and was only saved by what was almost a miracle. He may not be heir to an earldom, Mr. Hartley, but he would do more credit to the title than many <b>I</b> <b>could</b> name. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> well spoken of, by everyone, as an indefatigable worker, and as having performed the most valuable services. Captain Keppel, on whose gunboat he served for two or three months, spoke to me of him in the highest terms; and General Hunter has done the same.|$|R
60|$|Upstairs they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> moaning. The girl {{listened with}} pitiful face.|$|R
