40|$|Hubble Space Telescope/Faint Object Spectrograph (HST/FOS) and <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Observatory</b> (ESO) 3. 6 -m/CASPEC {{observations}} {{have been}} made of 18 stars ranging in spectral type from O 3 through B 0. 5 Ia, half of them {{in each of the}} Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, in order to investigate massive stellar winds and evolution as a function of metallicity. The spectroscopic data are initially presented and described here in an atlas format. The relative weakness of the stellar-wind features in the SMC early O V spectra, due to their metal deficiency, is remarkable. Because of their unsaturated profiles, discrete absorption components can be detected in many of them, which is generally not possible in LMC and Galactic counterparts at such early types, or even in SMC giants and supergiants. On the other hand, an O 3 III spectrum in the SMC has a weak C IV but strong N V wind profile, possibly indicating the presence of processed material. Wind terminal velocities are also given and intercompared between similar spectral types in the two galaxies. In general, the terminal velocities of the SMC stars are smaller, in qualitative agreement with the predictions of radiation-driven wind theory. Further analyses in progress will provide atmospheric and wind parameters for these stars, which will be relevant to evolutionary models and the interpretation of composite starburst spectra...|$|E
