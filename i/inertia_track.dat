40|$|Hydraulic {{engine mounts}} {{are applied to}} the {{automotive}} applications to isolate the chassis from the high frequency noise and vibration generated by the engine {{as well as to}} limit the engine shake motions resulting at low frequencies. In this paper, a new hydraulic engine mount with a controllable <b>inertia</b> <b>track</b> profile is proposed and its dynamic behavior is investigated. The profile of the <b>inertia</b> <b>track</b> is varied by applying a controlled force to a cylindrical rubber disk, placed in the <b>inertia</b> <b>track.</b> This design provides a hydraulic engine mount design with an adjustable notch frequency location and also damping characteristics in shake motions. By using a simple control strategy, the efficiency of the proposed hydraulic engine mount in two-mode operation meaning isolating mode in the highway driving condition and damping mode in the shock motions, is investigated...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{modifications of}} the hydraulic engine mount prediction program, HEMPP, {{which is currently}} used in the automotive industry to match the mount to the experimental results by predicting the dynamic stiffness and phase angle of the mount. The main focuses of this thesis are the identification, simulation, and verification of a new model for measuring pressure drop fluctuations of periodically fluctuating flow inside the <b>inertia</b> <b>track</b> of the hydraulic engine mount and its resistance. Moreover, to achieve a new model for resistance, the friction factor of fluid under frequency excitation, which is a main cause of discrepancies between simulation and experimental results, has been investigated. Two major findings were explored in previous studies {{have been used in}} this research: First, the friction coefficient in oscillatory and reciprocating flow inside a finite length of pipe depends on the kinetic Reynolds number and the dimensionless oscillation amplitude of the fluid; and second, the linear model and the equations of the typical engine mount have been significantly examined. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted using two test apparatuses to provide numerical data. One examined the effect of a pipe’s geometrical parameters such as cross sectional area and roughness on the frequency response of the pressure difference between the entrance and exit of the finite length pipe. The second test apparatus has been employed to validate the equations of pressure drop in the <b>inertia</b> <b>track</b> of an engine mount. Finally, a new model of resistance was implemented in the old version of the prediction program, showing that the frequency responses of dynamic stiffness simulated by this modified prediction program agreed with the experimental results. This new model could be employed to predict the hydraulic engine mount performance in order to create products confirming more closely to customer needs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{characteristics}} of a prototype active engine mount (AEM), designed {{on the basis of}} a hydraulic engine mount, have been investigated and an adaptive controller for the AEM has been designed. An equivalent mass–spring–damper AEM model is proposed, and the transfer function that describes the dynamic {{characteristics of}} the AEM is deduced from mathematical analysis of the model. The damping coecient of the model is derived by considering the non-linear ow eect in the <b>inertia</b> <b>track.</b> Experiments conrmed that the model precisely describes the dynamic characteristics of the AEM. An adaptive controller using the ltered-X LMS algorithm is designed to cancel the force transmitted through the AEM.

DQMOM is a very efficient model because the weights and abscissas appear directly in the transport equations alleviating any need for moment construction and inversion. When dealing with low <b>inertia</b> particles where <b>tracking</b> few passive variables is of concern, DQMOM is very advantageous; however, because a large set of unknowns (abscissas and weights) is solved simultaneously, the matrix inversions cannot guaranteed realizable results in some circumstances, even with expensive iterative processes.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} a rigid body, with unknown <b>inertia</b> parameter, <b>tracking</b> a desired angular ve-locity {{trajectory}} is addressed using adaptive feedback control. An adaptive controller is developed for a planar rotating body tracking a desired angular velocity command. Lyapunov analysis is used to show that tracking is achieved globally. Furthermore, sufficient conditions on the reference signal for estimation of inertia are proven. The adaptive controller is implemented on a triaxial attitude control testbed with fan thrusters. A lack of convergence of the inertia estimate indicates {{the presence of an}} input nonlinearity. To account for this effect, a piecewise linear approximation of the nonlinearity is inverted to obtain improved angular velocity <b>tracking</b> and <b>inertia</b> identifica-tion.

40|$|Passive fluid mounts are {{commonly}} used in the automotive and aerospace applications to isolate the cabin from the engine noise and vibration. Due to manufacturing and material variabilities, no two identical fluid mount designs act the same. So, fluid mounts are tuned one by one before it is shipped out to customers. In some cases, for a batch of fluid mounts manufactured at the same time, one is tuned {{and the rest is}} set to the same settings. In some cases they are shipped as is with its notch frequency not being in its most optimum location. Since none of the passive fluid mount parameters are controllable, the only way to tune the mount is to redesign the mount by changing fluid, changing <b>inertia</b> <b>track</b> length or diameter, or changing rubber stiffness. This trial and error manufacturing process is very costly. To reduce the fluid mount notch frequency tuning cycle time, a new fluid mount design is proposed. In this new fluid mount design, the notch frequency can be easily modified without the need for any redesigns. In this paper, the new design concept, and its mathematical model and simulation results will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The Variable Displacement Engine (VDE) {{is a new}} {{generation}} of engines that are designed to decrease the fuel consumption at the cruise speed of a vehicle. The isolation of the VDE's new vibration pattern is beyond the capabilities of conventional mounts and bushings. Consequently, in this thesis, novel active and semi-active solutions are proposed to develop various semi-active and active hydraulic bushing proof-of-concept systems that may solve the isolation problem in a VDE system. The dynamic stiffness response, which is the transfer function that relates the engine displacement to the transmitted force, is normally used as the key design criterion for engine mounts and bushings. In this thesis, a linear mathematical model of a conventional hydraulic bushing is purposed. The validity of the mathematical model is confirmed by an experimental analysis, and the various parameters in the dynamic stiffness equation are evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the dynamic stiffness frequency response of the conventional hydraulic bushing has both soft and stiff regions. The soft region is limited to low frequencies. For the VDE isolation, the goal is to provide a soft bushing for a wider range of frequencies than a conventional bushing can accommodate. Addition of a short <b>inertia</b> <b>track,</b> similar to a decoupler used in conventional hydraulic engine mounts, may be used to extend the soft region of a conventional hydraulic bushing, and the experimental results validate it. Since the short <b>inertia</b> <b>track</b> provides no additional damping, a supplementary Magnetorheological (MR) valve is also devised. The MR valve has the advantage to minimize the amount of MR fluid used, which significantly reduces the cost of the overall system. The novel valve allows the damping coefficient of the bushing assembly to be controlled by varying the electrical current input to a solenoid coil. A mathematical model is derived for the MR bushing, and is validated experimentally. In addition, an active bushing to solve the VDE isolation problem is purposed in this thesis. In this bushing, a magnetic actuator, composed of a permanent magnet and a solenoid coil, is included in the active bushing. This active chamber affects the dynamic stiffness response of the bushing by altering the bushing's internal pressure. The nonlinear equation of motion of the permanent magnet is linearized and is incorporated into the new mathematical model of the system. The new purposed model for the active bushing is in good agreement with the experimental results. This active chamber is also proved capable of producing complex dynamic stiffness frequency response. The conclusion is that the proposals in this thesis can contribute to the isolation of the vibration pattern, imposed by the application of a VDE system...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to design a {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (MR) hydraulic bushing. The semi-active bushing {{is intended to be}} used to isolate a cylinder deactivating engine. Cylinder deactivation causes high transient torsional loading in addition to changing the magnitude and mode of engine vibrations requiring an adaptive or controllable isolator. Practical and simple semi-active control strategies are inspired by investigating the optimization of linear and slightly cubic nonlinear single degree of freedom isolators. Experimental verification of the optimization technique, which minimizes the root mean square (RMS) of engine acceleration frequency response and RMS of the force transmitted frequency response, shows that this method can be implemented on real linear systems to isolate the engine from harmonic inputs.

This consensus algorithm is applied on the group level to estimate the time-varying group trajectory information in a distributed manner. The proposed strategy only requires local neighbor-to-neighbor information exchange between manipulators and does not assume the existence of any explicit leaders in the team. The interaction topology of a network of agents is represented using an indirected graph.

40|$|M. Phil. This study {{identifies}} and evaluates dynamic models used to characterise {{the dynamic}} stiffness and phase angle of hydraulic elastomeric mounts that are primarily used as engine and operator cab isolators in vehicular applications. Linear models developed for hydraulic elastomeric mounts are analysed for their suitability {{to be used}} to characterise the dynamic stiffness and its phase angle in the low and high frequency range. A sensitivity analysis provides insight into the parameters {{with a high level of}} sensitivity to changes in model parameters. The models selected from the linear analysis are enhanced and updated by performing a quasi-linear analysis to compensate for the dynamic behaviour of certain parameters. Non-linear dynamic behaviour of the decoupler is also investigated. These models are then verified experimentally. To set-up an analytical model that can be used to predict the dynamic characteristics of the hydraulic elastomeric mount it is necessary to develop a physical model from which the system differential equations are extracted. From the physical model flow continuity equations and fluid momentum equations are developed to obtain an expression that describe the fluid response in the <b>inertia</b> <b>track</b> and decoupler respectively. Lumped parameter mechanical models are developed next from which equivalent differential equations are derived to describe the internal dynamics of the hydraulic mount. These differential equations along with the transmitted force equation directly derived from the physical model are used to develop the dynamic stiffness transfer function. Time domain input displacement and output transmitted force data are taken at a specific frequency and amplitude, and are used to generate hysteresis loops to extract the dynamic stiffness and phase angles. For most of the computational effort, both analytical and experimental, MATLAB programs are written to perform curve fitting, FFT calculation, numerical integration and dynamical simulation. Emphasis is placed on the dynamic considerations of hydraulic mount design in the automotive industry and where machines are subjected to shock and vibration. The results and techniques used to model and the mounts are useful to designers in the field of shock and vibration isolation. Finally, the aim of the work is to keep the dynamic models as simple as possible, to be used effectively in the identification of the structural dynamic characteristics of hydraulic elastomeric mounts. To avoid complexity two models are used to describe the dynamics of the mount, one model for the low frequency, large amplitude conditions and one for the high frequency, small amplitude conditions. The information is then used to determine how the mount will respond under certain dynamical conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{statistical}} temporal scales {{involved in}} inertia particle dispersion are analyzed numerically. The numerical method of large eddy simulation, solving a filtered Navier–Stokes equation, is utilized to calculate fully developed turbulent channel flows with Reynolds numbers of 180 and 640, and the particle Lagrangian trajectory method is employed to <b>track</b> <b>inertia</b> particles {{released into the}} flow fields. The Lagrangian and Eulerian temporal scales are obtained statistically for fluid tracer particles and three different inertia particles with Stokes numbers of 1, 10 and 100. The Eulerian temporal scales, decreasing with the velocity of advection from the wall to the channel central plane, are smaller than the Lagrangian ones. The Lagrangian temporal scales of inertia particles increase with the particle Stokes number. The Lagrangian temporal scales of the fluid phase ‘seen’ by inertia particles are separate {{from those of the}} fluid phase, where inertia particles travel in turbulent vortices, due to the particle inertia and particle trajectory crossing effects. The effects of the Reynolds number on the integral temporal scales are also discussed.

40|$|Two {{models for}} {{simulation}} of dynamic interaction between train and turnout are developed. The {{first one is}} derived using a commercial software for dynamics of multi-body systems. The second {{is based on a}} detailed model of track dynamics and a multi-body dynamics formulation that accounts for excitation in an extended frequency range (up to several hundred Hz). Using a finite element model of a standard turnout design, a complex-valued modal superposition of track dynamics is applied to account for the structural receptance of the track components. The variations in rail profile, track stiffness and <b>track</b> <b>inertia</b> along the turnout, and contact between the back of the wheel flange and the check rail, are considered. Hertzian theory and FASTSIM are used for the normal and tangential wheel–rail rolling contact. Stochastic analysis methods are integrated with the dynamic simulation model. For one given nominal layout of the turnout, the influence of several parameters on wear and rolling contact fatigue is investigated. Four parameters (axle load, wheel–rail friction coefficient, and wheel and rail profiles) are identified to be the most significant. Random distributions of the transverse wheel profile and of a set of transverse rail profiles along the switch panel are accounted for by use of the Karhunen–Loève expansion technique. To determine input data for the turnout model (rail pad stiffness, ballast stiffness and modal damping), impact load testing for measurement of track receptance was performed in the field. Lateral and vertical wheel–rail contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheelset to validate the mathematical models. Good agreement between measured and calculated contact forces is observed. The influence of train speed, moving direction and route on the measured wheel–rail contact forces is quantified...|$|R
