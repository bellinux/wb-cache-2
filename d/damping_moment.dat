40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{responses of}} ship rolling motion {{characterized by a}} roll <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> are {{of great interest to}} naval architects and ocean engineers. Modeling and identification of the nonlinear <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> are essential to incorporate the inherent nonlinearity in design, analysis, and control of a ship. A stochastic nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear damping in the general mechanical system has been presented in the literature (Han and Kinoshits 2012). The method has been also applied to identification of the nonlinear <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> of a ship at zero-forward speed (Han and Kinoshits 2013). In the presence of forward speed, however, the characteristic of roll <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> of a ship is significantly changed due to the lift effect. In this paper, the stochastic inverse method is applied to identification of the nonlinear <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> of a ship moving at nonzero-forward speed. The workability and validity of the method are verified with laboratory tests under controlled conditions. In experimental trials, two different types of ship rolling motion are considered: time-dependent transient motion and frequency-dependent periodic motion. It is shown that this method enables the inherent nonlinearity in <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> to be estimated, including its reliability analysis...|$|E
40|$|Bilge keels are {{effective}} passive devices in mitigating the rolling motion, and {{the usage of}} them covers almost all the sea going vessels. This paper focuses on the viscous effect of the bilge keel, ignored {{the effect of the}} free surface and the effect of the ship hull, for the general viscous characteristic of the bilge keel. In order to investigate the viscous effect of the bilge keel on the total <b>damping</b> <b>moment,</b> a special 2 dimensional numerical model, which includes a submerged cylinder with and without bilge keels, is designed for the simulation of forced rolling. Three important factors such as bilge keels width, rolling periods, as well as maximal rolling angles are taken into account, and the viscous flow field around the cylinder is simulated by some codes based on the viscous method in different conditions, in which the three factors are coupled. Verification and validation based on the ITTC method are performed for the cylinder without bilge keels in the conditions of different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. The primary calculation of <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> induced by the cylinder with 0 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm width bilge keels shows some interesting results, and a systematic analysis is conducted. The analysis of the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> components suggests there is phase difference between the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> induced by the cylinder and the bilge keels, and when the bilge keels width reaches a special size, the total <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> is mitigated. The calculation of the damping moments induced by the cylinder with some larger bilge keels are also performed, and the results suggest that, the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> induced by the bilge keels is increased rapidly and becomes the dominant part in the total <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> while the width of the bilge keels are increased, but the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> induced by the cylinder is not changed significantly. Some illustration of the vortices formation and shedding is included, which is the mechanism of the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> caused by the bilge keels.

Using a dynamic bending machine, the angular stiffness (Nmrad " 1) and damping coefficient (kgm 2 rad ~ 2 s ~ 1) of the intervertebral joints were measured over a range of bending frequencies, amplitudes and positions along the backbone. Angular stiffness increases with increasing bending amplitude, but, for some joints, {{the rate at which}} it changes with increasing bending frequency is negative. The precaudal intervertebral joints are less stiff than the caudal joints. The damping coefficient, which also shows regional variation, does not change with amplitude but does decrease with increasing bending frequency in joint positions three and five. Stiffness moments along the vertebral column, given the same amount of bending at each joint, are always greater than the <b>damping</b> <b>moments.</b> However, <b>damping</b> <b>moments</b> increase by an order of magnitude with an increase in bending frequency from 0. 5 to 5. 0 Hz.

The tests’ results revealed that the lag in asymmetric twin vortices over the forebody switching from the left vortice pattern to the right one exhibits a hysteresis evolvement during the wing rock motion; the asymmetric triple vortices over the forebody interacted with the flowfield over wings appeared to induce the instability and <b>damping</b> <b>moments.</b> The main flow phenomena responsible for wing rock of wing body configuration were completely determined by the forebody vortices.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, 2 D {{nonlinear}} {{viscous flow}} caused by rolling motion of submerged cylinder {{with and without}} bilge keels are simulated using the finite-volume method in order to investigate {{the relationship between the}} <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> induced by the bilge keel and the width of the bilge keel. The cylinder is submerged far away from the free surface to eliminate the interaction of the cylinder and the surface wave induced by the motion of it, and in this way, the damping moments obtained are caused by the cylinder and the bilge keels only. Verification and validation of the numerical results are performed in the conditions of different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. Three parameters such as the width of the bilge keel, the rolling period and the maximal rolling angle are taken into account, and the effect of the width of the bilge keel is discussed. The analysis of the numerical result shows that there is a minimum effective width of the bilge keel, so the further research is performed, in which a result that the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> of the cylinder with the given bilge keels is less than the one without bilge keels is discovered. The calculation data is analyzed in detail, and the reason is discussed by the investigation of the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> components in the different conditions. After that, the damping moments of the cylinder with different bilge keel width in different conditions are calculated and compared. The result of the systematic research shows that the <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> of the submerged cylinder with bilge keels increases nonlinearly while the width of the bilge keel increases linearly when the width of bilge keel is larger than the minimum effective width...|$|E

Having developed what they considered a proper theoretical criterion for determining the value of aerodynamic damping, the authors have conducted an experimental investigation of an airfoil oscillating system having one degree of freedom, {{in an attempt to}} verify the theoretical criterion. It was concluded that for small oscillations the theoretical values of aerodynamic <b>damping</b> <b>moment</b> are correct except for hinge positions near the leading edge.

The factors were of two classes, mass distribution effects and aerodynamic effects. The study indicated that mass extended along the longitudinal axis has no detrimental effect or is even slightly beneficial, mass extended along the lateral axis is detrimental if the airplane spins with the inner wing tip far down, and mass extended along the normal axis, if of considerable magnitude, has a strong favorable effect. The aerodynamic effects considered in terms of rolling, pitching, and yawing moments added to those for a conventional airplane showed that added stable rolling moment could contribute favorable effect on the spin only in decreasing the amount of inward sideslip required for equilibrium. Negative pitching moment of moderate magnitude has unfavorable effect on a high-angle-of-attack spin, and stable yawing moment has pronounced beneficial effect on the spin. Experimental data from various sources were available to verify nearly all the deductions resulting from the study of the curves. When these results were considered for the purpose of deciding upon the best means to be developed for controlling the spin, the yawing-moment equilibrium was found to offer the most promising field for research.
