5|$|It is {{generally}} not common for licensed gun owners to commit violent crimes with their guns, {{and most of the}} gun crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are beyond the control of the law. Annually, police investigate about 500 cases of illegal arming (with or without <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> committing other crime).|$|E
5|$|Major railway routes through Sheffield {{railway station}} include the Midland Main Line, which links {{the city to}} London via the East Midlands, the Cross Country Route which links the East of Scotland and Northeast of England with the West Midlands and the Southwest, and the lines linking Liverpool and Manchester with Hull and East Anglia. With the {{redevelopment}} of London St Pancras station (now St Pancras International) complete, Sheffield has a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> continental Europe. East Midlands Trains run services to St Pancras International and Eurostar run services from there to France and Belgium. The Master Cutler, a named passenger express train running from Sheffield railway station to London St Pancras, provides a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the capital.|$|E

5|$|Chiswick is {{situated}} {{at the start of}} the North Circular Road (A406), South Circular Road (A205) and the M4 motorway, the latter providing a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> Heathrow Airport and the M25 motorway. The Great West Road (A4) runs eastwards into central London via the Hogarth Roundabout where it meets the Great Chertsey Road (A316) which runs south-west, eventually joining the M3 motorway.|$|E
5|$|Seven sequels {{have since}} followed. Michael Myers is the {{antagonist}} {{in all of}} the films except , the story of which has no <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> any other film in the series. In 2007, writer-director Rob Zombie made a remake of the 1978 film. A direct sequel to the 2007 remake was released two years later. An 11th film, directed by David Gordon Green, is set to be released in October 2018.|$|E
5|$|The Staten Island Railway {{originally}} {{consisted of}} three lines, but of the three, only the north-south Main Line is in passenger service. The terminal station at St. George provides a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the Staten Island Ferry. At St. George there are twelve tracks, only ten of which are presently used for service. At Tottenville, there is a three track yard, with two tracks {{on either side of}} a concrete station platform.|$|E
50|$|These {{services}} are operated with FLIRT 2 electric multiple units in coupled sets. The operation of coupled sets allowed {{the number of}} <b>direct</b> <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> Hagen to be doubled and additional <b>direct</b> <b>connections</b> were created <b>to</b> the central Ruhr area.|$|R

50|$|Some {{services}} {{continue through}} Manchester and provide <b>direct</b> <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> significant destinations. But most work into just {{one side of}} Manchester, with no <b>direct</b> <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> another side of Manchester. The largest single contribution to alleviating this problem {{is likely to be}} the relocation (or redevelopment) of Salford Crescent. Other, less substantial, interventions include reinstating a bay platform at Salford Central allowing Rochdale corridor trains to continue beyond Victoria.|$|R
5|$|A {{transfer}} will {{be constructed}} {{at the eastern}} end of the 125th Street station to connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 125th Street station. A new lower-level mezzanine will house the connection between the two stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the staircases to the upper level will be rebuilt. At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built to connect to the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. An elevator, stairs, and escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met {{found it hard to}} raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an extension of time to carry out the works. In July 1855, an Act to make a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, the Morgantown {{interchange}} was {{relocated to}} provide a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> I-176; the overhead interchange lights at the new exit were a nuisance to nearby residents. An interchange was also proposed in 1990 with PA 743 between Elizabethtown and Hershey, but a study in 1993 determined {{that it would not}} improve traffic flow on area roads. The turnpike commission celebrated the highway's 50th anniversary in 1990. $300,000 was spent to promote the turnpike through various means including a videotape, souvenirs, and a private party attended by politicians and companies that work with the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, later renamed to Sound Transit, began {{planning}} the routing {{of the light}} rail line and placement of stations in 1998. Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle requested that the line be routed along International Boulevard to serve the airport's hotel area, while other officials {{from the city of}} SeaTac favored a station inside the current Sea-Tac Airport terminal to the west. Sound Transit selected their preferred route for the light rail line in 1999, choosing to serve the Port of Seattle's planned North End Airport Terminal, a multi-modal facility with a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the airport's Satellite Transit System, and a potential station at South 184th Street to serve the city center.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of Marylebone is tied into the Great Central Railway (GCR)'s Great Central Main Line (GCML) {{extension}} into London. When Sir Edward Watkin became chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS) in 1864, the line was not particularly lucrative as it had no <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> London. Watkin was unhappy about transferring traffic to the Great Northern Railway, and when he became chairman of the Metropolitan Railway in 1872, he decided to build a dedicated line between the MS and Central London.|$|E

5|$|The ispáns of the Transylvanian {{counties}} of Doboka, Hunyad, Kolozs, Küküllő and Torda were not listed among the witnesses of royal charters {{from the beginning}} of the 13thcentury, hinting that their <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the monarchs had by that time been interrupted. Thereafter they were employed by the voivode who appointed and dismissed them at will. Only the heads of Szolnok County remained directly connected to the monarchs for a longer period, until their office was united with the voivodeship in the 1260s. Similarly, the voivodes were simultaneously the ispáns of the nearby Arad County between 1321 and 1412.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} was {{cited by the}} AEC for violations of its reactor-operating license {{in connection with the}} incident, but none in <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the immediate cause. The incident resulted in an investigation by the Nuclear Reactor Advisory Committee into its review processes for reactor experiments, after the AEC determined there was inadequate review of the UW experiment. The staff were praised by the AEC for their actions to avoid endangering the public, by sealing the materials and evacuating the building for six hours.|$|E
5|$|Coach {{services}} {{running through}} Sheffield are operated by National Express {{and to a}} lesser extent Megabus, part of the Stagecoach Group. National Express services call at Sheffield Interchange, Meadowhall Interchange and Meadowhead Bus Stop. Megabus services only call at Meadowhall. National Express services 564, 560, 350, 320, 310 and 240 call at Sheffield, as do others on a less frequent basis. The 560/564 service is a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> London Victoria Coach Station via Chesterfield and Milton Keynes, operating 12 times a day in both directions. The 350 and 240 services connect Sheffield to Manchester Airport and Heathrow/Gatwick Airports respectively. Two Megabus services, the M12 and M20, call at Sheffield en route to London from Newcastle upon Tyne and Inverness respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, VisualArt's {{created the}} record label Key Sounds Label (KSL). The music albums and singles {{released}} by Key after this were put under this label, meaning {{that this does}} not include the first two albums and one single which were released before it was officially formed. The first album on this label was Humanity..., though the only <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> Key's works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to Air. The albums under the label are mainly composed by Key's signature composers: Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi. Three of the singles feature songs sung by Lia and one album, Love Song, features the singer Riya from Eufonius. Three drama CDs have been released as well.|$|E
5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
