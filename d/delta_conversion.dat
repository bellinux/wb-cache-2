In this paper, we describe a novel architecture for analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion that combines sigma <b>delta</b> <b>conversion</b> with the spatial data compression in a single module. The architecture called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sigma-delta is based on a min-max gradient descent optimization of a regularized cost function that naturally leads to an A/D formulation. Experimental results with simulated and recorded multi-channel data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture to eliminate cross-channel redundancy in high density microelectrode data, thus superceding the performance of parallel independent data converters in terms of its energy efficiency.

40|$|The {{classical}} Sweet-Parker {{approach to}} steady-state magnetic reconnection is extended into {{the regime of}} large resistivity (small magnetic Reynolds or Lundquist number) when the aspect ratio between the outflow and inflow scale, delta = d/L, approaches unity. In a previous paper {{the vicinity of the}} dissipation site ("diffusion region") was investigated. In this paper, the approach is extended to cover larger sites, in which the energy transfer and conversion is not confined to the diffusion region. Consistent with the results of Paper I, we find that increasing aspect ratio delta is associated with increasing compression, increasing reconnect ion rate for low Beta, but slightly decreasing rate for higher Beta, decreasing outflow speed, and increasing outflow magnetic field. These trends are stronger for lower Beta. Deviations from the traditional Sweet-Parker limit delta approaches 0 become significant for R(sub m) approx < 10, where R(sub m) is the magnetic Reynolds number (Lundquist number) based on the half-thickness of the current layer responsible for the Ohmic dissipation. They are also more significant for small gamma, that is, for increasing compressibility. In contrast to the results of Paper I, but consistent with earlier results for delta much < 1,nu(sub A) we find that in this limit the outflow speed is given by the Alfven speed nu(sub A) in the inflow region and the energy conversion is given by an even split of Poynting flux into enthalpy flux and bulk kinetic energy flux. However, with increasing <b>delta</b> the <b>conversion</b> to enthalpy flux becomes more and more dominant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sigma–delta {{modulation}} is {{the most}} popular form of analog-to-digital conversion used in audio applications. The sigma <b>delta</b> <b>conversion</b> technique has been in existence for many years, but recent technological advances now make the devices practical and now area of usage becoming very large. The main thing of these converters is that they are the only low cost conversion method which provides both high dynamic range and flexibility in converting low bandwidth input signals. In this paper we explain how performance is improved using genetic algorithm (GA). In particular, the proposed converter makes use of low-distortion swing suppression SDM architecture which is highly suitable for low oversampling ratios to attain high linearity over a wide bandwidth. GA- based search engine is a stochastic search method which can find the optimum solution within the given constraints...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Photovoltaic (PV) {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to generate}} electrical energy from solar irradiation incident on PV modules. PV modules are connected either in series or parallel to get high output power. Each PV cell has its own Maximum Power Point (MPP). This MPP varies with illumination, temperature, radiation and partial shading. Due to partial shading, difference between output powers of various PV modules exists. This difference leads to voltage drop in PV output power. Hence system efficiency decreases. <b>Delta</b> <b>Conversion</b> concept is introduced to overcome this problem which increases the output voltage of PV by means of using DC/DC Converter.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order that}} signals can be stored, {{transmitted}} or processed {{it is necessary}} that they first be converted into digital form. This, in turn, raises {{the problem of how to}} digitize data so as to achieve the best trade-off between data load and performance, i. e., “how to make the most out of a little”. Two issues are involved in this problem, namely temporal quantization (i. e., sampling) and spatial quantization. These two problems have traditionally been addressed separately. Indeed, there exists substantial literature dealing with the temporal quantization problem, covering both band-limited and non-band-limited signals. The usual underlying paradigm is that of an analysis filter, followed by a sampler, followed by a reconstruction filter. Various parts of this architecture can be optimized once other parts have been specified. On the other hand, spatial quantization has been studied extensively for a given sampling strategy, particularly in the framework of sigma <b>delta</b> <b>conversion.</b> Finally, it is also possible to formulate the joint design problem for sampling and spatial quantization. This typically leads to enhanced performance compared to that achievable by considering the two aspects separately. This paper will survey the general area of sampling and quantization and analyze methods for achieving efficient data representations for signal processing and control applications. We will show how, on the one hand, contemporary control theory can contribute to the design of sampling and quantization systems and, on the other hand, how these systems impact on the performance of modern feedback control systems...|$|E
