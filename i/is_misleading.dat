5|$|Scholars {{agree that}} there are no {{completely}} reliable methods of determining the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity <b>is</b> <b>misleading,</b> since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early slit drums involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.|$|E
5|$|The later evolved commelinids have {{various kinds}} of flower, few of which are 'lily-like'. In the order Poales, {{comprising}} grasses, rushes and sedges, flowers are either petal-less or have small, unshowy petals. Many Zingiberales species have brightly coloured and showy flowers. However, their apparent structure <b>is</b> <b>misleading.</b> For example, the six tepals of cannas are small and hidden under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble petals and may be mistaken for them.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{knowledge}} fallacy that case-hardening was done with bone but this <b>is</b> <b>misleading.</b> Although bone was used, the main carbon donor was hoof and horn. Bone contains some carbonates but is mainly calcium phosphate (as hydroxylapatite). This {{does not have the}} beneficial effect of encouraging CO production and it can also introduce phosphorus as an impurity into the steel alloy.|$|E
25|$|Franco-Provençal's {{name would}} suggest it is a bridge dialect between French and the Provençal dialect of Occitan, but this <b>is</b> <b>misleading.</b> More precisely, Franco-Provençal is a {{separate}} Gallo-Romance language that transitions into the Oïl languages Morvandiau and Franc-Comtois to the northwest, into Romansh to the east, into the Gallo-Italic language Piemontese to the southeast, and finally into the Vivaro-Alpine dialect of Occitan to the southwest.|$|E

Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for government-mandated network neutrality.|$|E

25|$|In addition, as hand axes can be recycled, resharpened and remade, {{they could}} have been used for varied tasks. For this reason it <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> to think of them as axes, {{they could have}} been used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, {{piercing}} and hammering. In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a lithic core to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through retouching.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey {{states that}} investors {{can get a}} 12% average annual return {{and this is the}} number he uses in {{financial}} analyses. Critics state that using an average annual return rate <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> and that the compound annual growth rate is a better measurement when planning investments. Most individuals are unaware of this difference. Critics have also stated that a 12% return is unrealistic. According to the Motley Fool, following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.|$|E
25|$|Calcination of {{limestone}} using charcoal fires to produce quicklime has been practiced since antiquity by cultures {{all over the}} world. The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825°C, but stating an absolute threshold <b>is</b> <b>misleading.</b> Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and carbon dioxide at any temperature. At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium CO2 pressure is {{only a tiny fraction}} of the partial CO2 pressure in air, which is about 0.035 kPa.|$|E

25|$|One notable feature, {{related to}} the number of simple bivectors and so {{rotation}} planes, is that in odd dimensions every rotation has a fixed axis – it <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> to call it an axis of rotation as in higher dimensions rotations are taking place in multiple planes orthogonal to it. This is related to bivectors, as bivectors in odd dimensions decompose into the same number of bivectors as the even dimension below, so have the same number of planes, but one extra dimension. As each plane generates rotations in two dimensions in odd dimensions there must be one dimension, that is an axis, that is not being rotated.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial stage}} of their {{development}} which included simple recumbent plates or slabs isn't specific for the region, {{yet it is}} of broad West Mediterranean origin, and as such the term stećak (implying the chest and ridge form) <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> for all tombstone forms. The slabs type of burial was a typical kind of burial of the West Mediterranean world in the 14-15th century, but which had special method of production and ornamentation in the Balkan, customized according to the stonemasonry skills and microenvironment. The dated monuments indicate they were initially made by/for the feudal nobility, while later this tradition was embraced and adopted by the indigenous Vlachs who have almost exclusively raised them from the mid-15th century.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Sobeknefru, the throne may have passed to Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep, though in older studies Wegaf, who had {{previously}} been the Great Overseer of Troops, was thought to have reigned next. Beginning with this reign, Egypt was ruled {{by a series of}} ephemeral kings for about ten to fifteen years. Ancient Egyptian sources regard these as the first kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty, though the term dynasty <b>is</b> <b>misleading,</b> as most kings of the thirteenth dynasty were not related. The names of these short-lived kings are attested on a few monuments and graffiti, and their succession order is only known from the Turin Canon, although even this is not fully trusted.|$|E

25|$|Since 1990, {{the rate}} of {{deforestation}} in the DRC has remained constant at 0.20%, which equates {{to the loss of}} 311,000 hectares, or roughly 1,200 square miles, annually. This amounts to destroying forests the size of Delaware every two years. The fact that {{the rate of}} deforestation has remained constant over the last twenty years <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> as one might believe that government or non-government organizations (NGO) interventions have been responsible for the decline, but reports indicate otherwise. Three reasons have been postulated as to why deforestation rates have remained relatively low: 1) the road network within the country has been gradually in decline making access to more remote areas more difficult, 2) political and regulatory changes have disincentivized investment in the country, and 3) agriculture has expanded outside of forest areas.|$|E
25|$|Later, Saddam Hussein, {{looking to}} build {{fighting}} power against Iran {{soon after the}} outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War doubled the size of the Iraqi army from 1981, when it numbered 200,000 soldiers in 12 divisions and 3 independent brigades, to 1985, when it had 500,000 men in 23 divisions and nine brigades. The first new divisions were created in 1981 when the 11th and 12th Border Guard Divisions were converted into infantry formations and the 14th Infantry Division was formed. Yet the rise in number of divisions <b>is</b> <b>misleading,</b> because during the war Iraqi divisions abandoned a standard organisation with permanent ('organic') brigades assigned to each division. Instead division headquarters were assigned a mission or sector and then assigned brigades to carry out the task - up to eight to ten brigades on some occasions.|$|E
25|$|Arrow's death-of-a-candidate example (1963, page 26) {{suggests}} that the agenda (the set of feasible alternatives) shrinks from, say, X = {a, b, c} to S = {a, b} because {{of the death of}} candidate c. This example <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> since it can give the reader an impression that IIA is a condition involving two agenda and one profile. The fact is that IIA involves just one agendum ({x, y} in case of pairwise independence) but two profiles. If the condition is applied to this confusing example, it requires this: Suppose an aggregation rule satisfying IIA chooses b from the agenda {a, b} when the profile is given by (cab, cba), that is, individual 1 prefers c to a to b, 2 prefers c to b to a. Then, it must still choose b from {a, b} if the profile were, say: (abc, bac); (acb, bca); (acb, cba); or (abc, cba).|$|E
