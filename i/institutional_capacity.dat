The National Constitution established the State with responsibility and obligation to regulate the handling of natural resources.

The Code states that the consumption of water for irrigation purposes is not regulated and the extraction of groundwater is free. The last water bill was presented to the National Assembly for approval in the working agenda in 1999.

25|$|The {{government}} of Peru is currently undertaking a major transformation of its {{water resources management}} from a centralized approach focused on irrigation development in the coastal area to a river basin integrated water resources management for the entire country. The 2009 Water Resources Law (Ley de Recursos Hídricos) and the draft National Water Resources Management Strategy of 2004 (Estrategia Nacional para la Gestión de los Recursos Hídricos Continentales del Perú) contain the necessary elements for Integrated Water Resources Management as stated in international good practices namely, integration of sectoral policies, participation of stakeholders, decentralization of management to the river basin level and recognition of water as a social and economic good. Despite the new law, several key challenges remain, including limited <b>institutional</b> <b>capacity,</b> increasing water stress in the coastal region, deteriorating water quality, poor efficiency in the irrigation sector, as well as inadequate access to and poor quality of water supply and sanitation.|$|E

25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Saudi Arabia {{is characterized by}} challenges and achievements. One of the main challenges is water scarcity. In order to overcome water scarcity, substantial investments have been undertaken in seawater desalination, water distribution, sewerage and wastewater treatment. Today about 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and only 10% from surface water in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital Riyadh, located {{in the heart of}} the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the Persian Gulf over a distance of 467km. Water is provided almost for free to residential users. Despite improvements, service quality remains poor, for example in terms of continuity of supply. Another challenge is weak <b>institutional</b> <b>capacity</b> and governance, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Among the achievements is a significant increase in desalination, and in access to water, the expansion of wastewater treatment, as well as the use of treated effluent for the irrigation of urban green spaces, and for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The Roadmap for the Integration of ASEAN in Finance is {{the latest}} {{regional}} initiative, which aims to strengthen regional self-help and support mechanisms. The implementation of the roadmap {{will contribute to the}} realisation of the ASEAN Economic Community that was launched by the ASEAN leaders in October 2003 in Bali. The AEC is the end-goal of economic integration as outlined in the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the Bali Concord II to establish a single market and production base, characterised by the free movement of goods, services, investment, and a freer flow of capital. The AEC will also facilitate the movement of business professionals, skilled labour, and talent within the region. As in the EU, adoption of an ASEAN common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the ASEAN Economic Community. Under the roadmap, approaches and milestones have been identified in areas deemed crucial to financial and monetary integration, namely: (a) capital market development, (b) capital account liberalisation, (c) financial services liberalisation, and (d) ASEAN currency co-operation. Capital market development entails promoting <b>institutional</b> <b>capacity,</b> including the legal and regulatory framework, as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets in the region. Orderly capital account liberalisation will be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency co-operation would involve exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.|$|E
500|$|However, certain {{matters are}} {{regarded}} as impervious to judicial review owing to limitations in the courts' <b>institutional</b> <b>capacity.</b> Courts are generally reluctant {{to get involved in}} affairs relating to national security, leaving this role to the Government.

(2007). This case held that courts would exclude matters involving [...] "high policy" [...] from their purview, but still analyse cases carefully {{to determine whether or not}} they truly fell within areas of executive immunity. Also, limitations on the role of the court have led to the rational conclusion that certain other areas are to be excluded from judicial review.

Drawing on a review of the secondary literature and on-going field work, the evidence suggests that the current mix of statecentric and self-regulatory traditions will be as important in determining the implementation and final outcomes of EU-rules as the new rules themselves. EU directives redesign rules, but they do not necessarily lead to institutional change, create <b>institutional</b> <b>capacities,</b> or alter old practices in the short term.

500|$|In 1988, the Singapore courts {{undertook}} {{the enormous}} task of clearing their extremely large backlogs {{in order to}} facilitate Singapore's future development as an international business and finance centre. A multifaceted approach was adopted to dispose of cases expeditiously, including, among other things, the appointment of more judges and judicial commissioners, the use of information technology, electronic filing of documents and promoting the use of alternative dispute resolution. Such efforts significantly expedited the management of cases, both in the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts. In particular, specialized courts such as small claims tribunals, the Family Court and the Night Court were set up for better distribution of cases and have also helped to significantly reduce court fees. Over and above increasing the <b>institutional</b> <b>capacity</b> and efficiency of the courts, improving access to justice in Singapore has also meant a need for a corresponding increase in the quality of justice administered. Efforts to achieve this goal centre mainly on the appointment of the [...] "best and brightest officers" [...] and in particular, the constant upgrading of their skills and knowledge for judicial excellence. For this purpose, the Judicial Education Board was set up to provide guidance, training programmes and workshops for members of the judiciary, and is supported by a training unit within the Strategic Planning and Training Division of the Subordinate Courts. Such efforts aim to upgrade the competence of judges and equip them with the requisite knowledge for handling increasingly complex cases.|$|E
