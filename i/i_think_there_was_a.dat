500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|The Naval Academy and the University of Maryland are {{separated}} by about 30 miles {{in the state of}} Maryland. The schools by their nature, a Federal service academy and a public university, differ radically in terms of culture and lifestyle. For many years, the University of Maryland possessed the reputation of a blue-collar, working-class school. Some students viewed the Naval Academy, with its strictly regimented culture, as elitist. A former Terrapins linebacker, Jerry Fishman, believed that many Midshipmen [...] "thought they were far superior to the Maryland redneck coal miners." [...] A former Navy fullback, Pat Donnelly, said that compared to a [...] "public institution, [...] was night and day. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> feeling of mutual dislike, but it wasn’t personal, it was more institutional." ...|$|E
500|$|GoldenEye 007 {{introduced}} stealth elements {{not seen}} in previous first-person shooter games. Doak explained how this was implemented: [...] "Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within {{a certain amount of}} time, it did a larger radius test and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset". Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though decidedly unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to covertly spy on enemies. The game's multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis described it as [...] "a complete afterthought". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who [...] "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same month, Ciara {{said that}} there was no release date for the album. She instead said [...] "I think I'm almost done. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> date December 4 that was {{supposedly}} put in the universe, but the date was never ever confirmed, not from my mouth, but they can definitely look out for this album this winter. I'll be telling you soon. Stay tuned. You know what? I'm giving you guys my video [...] on my birthday, so you never know what could happen around Christmas-time. I love giving gifts." [...] After the premiere of the [...] "Got Me Good" [...] video, the album was slated to drop in early 2013. On April 15, 2013, Ciara revealed the official tracklist for the album and confirmed that it is now titled Ciara. Additionally, she stated that it would be released on June 4, 2013. The album was then postponed to July 9, 2013. The aforementioned singles were swept aside from the album and subsequently under the title Ciara, the album is now led by the single [...] "Body Party". The album artwork features a mirror-flipped image of Ciara.|$|E

60|$|In {{the evening}} I {{went to the}} {{promenade}} in the Exhibition of Pictures, which was splendidly lighted up and filled with fashionable company. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> want of beauty,--or perhaps the gas-lights were unfavourable to the ladies' looks.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think it}} was true. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great flood, and I think that some people did escape, and that they saved their beasts, just as {{we should try to}} save Nigger and the Monkstown cocks and hens if we were flooded out. Then they were able to start again when the waters went down, and they were {{naturally}} very grateful to God for their escape." ...|$|E
60|$|When we went {{also from}} the House Beautiful, down the hill into the Valley of Humiliation, he went down as well as ever I saw a man in my life: for he cared not how mean he was, so he might be happy at last.

[...] He broke off for a moment as a light dawned on him and then went on: [...] "It's a sure thing I haven't met you, but, when <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> young lad {{something}} like you among others in blanket-coats in a photograph a sergeant brought me. Montreal snowshoe or toboggan club, I guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{did have}} a beard, sir," [...] replied Dorcas, smiling. [...] "And well I know it, for he {{borrowed}} two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And I'm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn't know as there was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> red wig, I know, but nothing else {{in the way of}} hair. Burnt corks they use mostly--though 'tis messy getting it off again. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{these are}} not the pantomimes we really saw; but one {{description}} will do as well as another. The plots, you see, are a little intricate and difficult to understand in pantomimes; and I may have mixed up one with another. That I was at the theatre on Boxing-night is certain -- but the pit was so full that I could only see fairy legs glittering in the distance, as I stood at the door. And if I was badly off, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> young gentleman behind me worse off still. I own that he has good reason (though others have not) to speak ill of me behind my back, and hereby beg his pardon.|$|E

6000|$|I {{think we}} all loved him. Even after he mismanaged {{the affairs of the}} Amity Ditch Company, we commiserated him, {{although}} most of us were stockholders, and lost heavily. I remember that the blacksmith {{went so far as to}} say that [...] "them chaps as put that responsibility on the old man oughter be lynched." [...] But the blacksmith was not a stockholder; and the expression was looked upon as the excusable extravagance of a large, sympathizing nature, that, when combined with a powerful frame, was unworthy of notice. At least, that was the way they put it. Yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> general feeling of regret that this misfortune would interfere with the old man's long-cherished plan of [...] "going home." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have taken}} a long walk this forenoon along the Needham road, and across the bridge, thence {{pursuing}} a cross-road through the woods, parallel with the river, which I crossed again at Dedham. Most of the road lay through a growth of young oaks principally. They still retain their verdure, though, looking closely in among them, one perceives the broken sunshine falling on a few sere or bright-hued tufts of shrubbery. In low, marshy spots, {{on the verge of}} the meadows or along the river-side, there is a much more marked autumnal change. Whole ranges of bushes are there painted with many variegated lines, not of the brightest tint, but of a sober cheerfulness. I suppose this is owing more to the late rains than to the frost; for a heavy rain changes the foliage somewhat at this season. The first marked frost was seen last Saturday morning. Soon after sunrise it lay, white as snow, over all the grass, and on the tops of the fences, and in the yard, on the heap of firewood. On Sunday, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fall of snow, which, however, did not lie on the ground a moment.|$|E
60|$|And if such be the {{attitude}} of the uneducated man towards the permanent terrors of nature, what will it be towards those which are sudden and seemingly capricious?--towards storms, earthquakes, floods, blights, pestilences? We know too well what it has been-- one of blind, and therefore often cruel, fear. How could it be otherwise? Was Theophrastus's superstitious man so very foolish for pouring oil on every round stone? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great deal to be said for him. This worship of Baetyli was rational enough. They were aerolites, fallen from heaven. Was it not as well to be civil to such messengers from above?--to testify by homage to them due awe of the being who had thrown them at men, and who though he had missed his shot that time might not miss it the next? I think if we, knowing nothing of either gunpowder, astronomy, or Christianity, saw an Armstrong bolt fall within five miles of London, we should be inclined to be very respectful to it indeed. So the aerolites, or glacial boulders, or polished stone weapons of an extinct race, which looked like aerolites, were the children of Ouranos the heaven, and had souls in them. One, by one of those strange transformations in which the logic of unreason indulges, the image of Diana of the Ephesians, which fell down from Jupiter; another was the Ancile, the holy shield which fell from the same place in the days of Numa Pompilius, and was the guardian genius of Rome; and several more became notable for ages.|$|E
