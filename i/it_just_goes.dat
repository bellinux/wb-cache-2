25|$|Following a {{first round}} series win as the Calgary Flames {{eliminated}} the Vancouver Canucks in game 6 {{of the series}} at the Scotiabank Saddledome, fans flocked to the Red Mile once again. There was between 10,000 and 12,000 fans on the stretch of 17th Avenue in Calgary. Police in Calgary had limited reports of open alcohol and minor property damage, but overall it {{was said to have}} been a peaceful celebration. Staff Sgt. Steve Ellefson of the Calgary Police Service said fans behaved well: “When you have 10 to 12,000 fans out, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> to show the class of the Flames fans enjoying a win”.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News said, [...] "Although it's called Captain America: Civil War, {{the latest}} Marvel movie is {{actually}} a supersized Avengers picture—overstuffed to bursting. And sometimes during its {{two and a half}} hour running time, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> bust." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "As a work of thought, Civil War is compromised, but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence—the action scenes are a bit flat." [...] Andrew O'Hehir writing for Salon said, [...] "Much of Captain America: Civil War is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from Captain America: The Winter Soldier two summers ago." [...] While Nicholas Barber of BBC gave the film a generally favorable review, praising both its visuals and action sequences, he criticized {{the fact that there was}} [...] "no cogent reason for any of [...] to be on one side or the other, which is why their inevitable dust-up feels like a game of dodgeball in a school playground." [...] Mark Millar, writer of the [...] "Civil War" [...] comic storyline on which the film was based, felt the film [...] "had a good opening twenty , but then I honestly can’t remember what the movie was about." [...] He also felt the film lacked levity, especially considering the Russo brothers' background in comedy.|$|E
500|$|Marina Galperina of AOL's The Boombox said [...] "from her neon nails, scintillating bathing suits, {{sequined}} mini-dresses, big hair, bright make-up to {{the sexy}} shimmying of her still slim physique, {{all eyes are}} on Beyonce as she serenades a promise to 'give it all away, just don't tell nobody tomorrow.'" [...] Jenna Gregory of Marie Claire wrote that Beyoncé shows an [...] "amazing bod in parely-there clothes which you definitely wouldn't find in the maternity section." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound found a 1980s vibe similar to the song's sound, adding that the only thing the [...] "family affair is missing is Jay-Z wearing sunscreen on his nose and a shirt from Tommy Bahama." [...] Ted Maider of the same publication, noted that Beyoncé [...] "adds some luster to the rusty surroundings, shining through as the beautiful pop icon that she has become. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> to show it doesn't matter where Beyonce is, or where her music is playing, she can turn any spot into a rager." [...] A writer of OK! said that Beyoncé [...] "don an unbelievable amount of cool oufits, all of which we need in our lives." [...] Rap-Up commented [...] "Summer may be over, but Beyoncé gives us another reason to celebrate with the vibrant video" [...] adding [...] "This is one party you won't want to miss." [...] Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine described [...] "Party"'s video as a [...] "fittingly shindig-centric affair." [...] Jessica Misener of The Huffington Post praised the fashion used in the video saying that Beyoncé had a lot of [...] "chic looks". Another writer of the same publication praised the decision to make a simple party set. He further described the video as [...] "a gorgeous boast of her beauty as well as a helpful reminder that, even in these down economic times, one can party like a rock star." [...] At the 2012 BET Awards, Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson won in the category for Video Director of the Year after they collaborated on the music video for [...] "Party".|$|E

According to public personal financial disclosures, Schilling's restaurant has dropped in value from a range of $100,000 to $250,000 down to between $50,000–$100,000.

2500|$|A {{study done}} in 2000, [...] {{identified}} as a key study that taken part and examined two natures of relationships (friends and family) and at what age does the support switch importance {{from one to the}} other.

Through the family [...] relationship and friendships [...] the character of the individual was built to forgive and learn from the experience in the family. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> to show that to have a good base {{at the start of a}} young age, will train the person to have good better well-being with outside interactions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrator is}} {{met by the}} writer George MacDonald, whom he hails as his mentor, just as Dante did when encountering Virgil in the Divine Comedy; and MacDonald becomes the narrator's guide in his journey, just as Virgil became Dante's. MacDonald {{explains}} {{that it is possible}} for a soul to choose to remain in Heaven despite having been in the grey town; for such souls, the goodness of Heaven will work backwards into their lives, turning even their worst sorrows into joy, and changing their experience on Earth to an extension of Heaven. Conversely, the evil of Hell works so that if a soul remains in, or returns to, the grey town, even its happiness on Earth will lose its meaning, and its experience on Earth would have been Hell. Few of the ghosts realize that the grey town is, in fact, Hell. Indeed, it is not that much different from the life they led on Earth: joyless, friendless and uncomfortable. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> on forever, and gets worse and worse, with some characters whispering their fear of the [...] "night" [...] that is eventually to come.|$|E

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E

Now, take this for instance: The King of--Bavaria? I think it was Bavaria--yes, Bavaria, it was--in 1862, March, 1862, he issued a proclamation against public grazing of live-stock.

The thing is told us--like any old scandal--at school. For all practical purposes we forget it. Practically we all live in a world as flat as a pancake. Where time never ends and nothing changes. Who really believes in any world outside the circle of the horizon? Here we are and visibly nothing is changing. And so we go on to--nothing will ever change. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> on--in space, in time. If we could realise that round world beyond, then indeed we should go circumspectly.... If the world were like a whispering gallery, what whispers might we not hear now--from India, from Africa, from Germany, warnings from the past, intimations of the future....|$|E

Only once before in my life have I come across that precise shade of green. When I was twelve I had a little beaver hat of it, and all the girls in school were wild over it. Well, as soon as I saw this hat I felt that I simply must have it--and have it I did. The price was dreadful.
