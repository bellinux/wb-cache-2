40|$|Surface phonon-polaritons (SPP) are <b>hybrid</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> {{that are}} the result of the {{coupling}} between photons and phonons at the interface between two different media [1, 2]. Taking into account that the surface effects predominate over the volumetric ones due to the high surface area/volume ratio in nanomaterials, the energy transport by SPP is expected to be particularly important in nano-sized polar media, whose bulk thermal conductivity is usually low and decreases as the size is scaled down. The potential applications of these surface waves to improve the thermal performance of nanoscale devices have been attracting significant research efforts {{in the last few years}} [3], however the contribution of the SPP to the thermal conductivity of these materials is not well understood to date, especially at nanoscale. The objective of this work is to quantify and optimize this contribution in nanotubes of circular cross section. Based on the Boltzmann transport equation, the following expression for the SPP thermal conductivity κ along the axis of the nanotube is obtained 1 6 " 2 !!!"...|$|R

The SW that sustains the discharge is the eigen wave of discharge structure, therefore axial distribution of discharge parameters are mainly determined by {{the properties of the}} wave that sustains the discharge. Until recently, the SW propagation and, therefore, axial gas discharge structure, were studied with the assumption of uniform radial plasma density profile. However, in real systems plasma density is always heterogeneous in radial direction and the conditions of plasma or hybrid resonances may take place at the periphery of discharge vessels [1]. It is necessary to note, that transverse <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are slightly damping waves in weakly collisional discharge plasma. But efficiency of energy transfer can be increased substantially in the regions of <b>hybrid</b> resonances, where <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> transforms into plasma waves [2]. The purpose of this report is to determine properties of the nonsymmetric potential SW (wavelength, spatial damping rate and SW radial field distribution) in magnetized plasma column with radially heterogeneous plasma electron density, and, finally, to determine plasma density axial structure in the discharges sustained by such waves in diffusion controlled regime.

In contrast to intuitive expectations that rather strong traveling waves can destroy the soliton, it occurs that the soliton survives during its interaction with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> of arbitrary amplitude and profile, but its parameters begin to evolve under the influence of this interaction. If a traveling <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> possesses a finite duration, the soliton parameters after interaction take constant values again, but these values in general are different from those before the interaction.
