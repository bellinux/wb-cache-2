40|$|The {{production}} cycle (PC) time, {{as a very}} important economic indicator of <b>freezing</b> <b>current</b> assets, involves {{the time needed to}} manufacture a unit or a series of units, from putting them into production until they are put into storage; and yet it is rarely discussed in the literature, even though it should be also analysed and be made as short as possible. The goal {{of this article is to}} survey and control the methodology of reducing the PC time of components in the metalworking industry, grouped by factor analysis into the factors of production and non-production components, observed by a modified method of current observations, and viewed as a process whose effectiveness was monitored using control charts. The survey is based on data collected through 1, 576 observations in a Serbian company that manufactures electrical and electronic equipment for motor vehicles. The 2012 results, when compared with those of 2011, indicate that the PC time is significantly reduced by 93 minutes, or by 28. 53 per cent, and the manufacturing time by 46 minutes, or by 19. 17 per cent. The results furnish empirical findings that provide insights into a number of managerial issues concerning investment decisions in product-specific cycle time improvements and reductions, together with process redesigns...|$|E

Reviewing the published papers in this context revealed that both citizens and employees do not understand the current status of this program. The majority of these papers measure the quality of e-services presented by e-government. However, according to the minister of Communication and Information Technologies (MOCIT), only three e-services are provided by this program up to writing this paper. Moreover, he decided to <b>freeze</b> the <b>current</b> working on e-government programme. These facts drove the authors to conduct this research. General review of the existing literature concerning e-government implementation in Jordan was applied, then a qualitative research was utilised to uncover the reasons behind the failure of the e-government program in Jordan. The collected data then was analysed using Strauss and Corbin's method of grounded theory. This paper illustrates that Jordanian government need to exert strenuous efforts to move from the first stage of e-government implementation into an interactive one after fourteen years of launching the program, considering that only three e-services are presented up to October 2013. Reasons behind the failure of e-government in Jordan have also been identified. Keywords—e-government; grounded theory; Jordan; total failure I...|$|R
40|$|The 4 -month {{drift of}} Ice Station Weddell (ISW) {{produced}} over 2000 h of nearly continuous measurements in the atmospheric surface layer {{and in the}} snow and sea ice in the western Weddell Sea. This paper reports simulations, based on these data, of processes in the air, snow, and sea ice at ISW using SNTHERM, a one-dimensional mass and energy balance model. An earlier version of SNTHERM had to be adapted, however, to treat the flooding that often occurs on sea ice in the western Weddell Sea. To treat this layer of slush and brine, SNTHERM holds the brine salinity constant at its initial value of 31. 5 psu until 80 % of this slush layer <b>freezes.</b> The <b>current</b> version of SNTHERM also incorporates a new parameterization for the roughness length for wind speed, z 0, derived from analyses of ISW eddy-covariance data. SNTHERM’s simulations are validated with temperature measurements within the ice and snow and with eddy-covariance measurements of the surface momentum and sensible and latent heat fluxes. The simulated turbulent fluxes agree fairly well with the measured fluxes, except the simulated sensible heat flux is biased low by 4 – 5 W m 22 for both stable and unstable stratification. The simulated temperature profiles {{in the snow and}} ice also agree well with the measured tem-peratures. In particular, allowing seawater to flush the slush layer until it is 80 % frozen delays the freezing of this layer such that its behavior mirrors the data. 1...|$|R

All equipment {{in the vicinity of the}} worksite must be powered off to maintain a safe environment for the astronauts. Because heater power will be unavailable, several critical components will now be at risk of freezing and permanent damage. If an impending thermal violation is detected, Mission Control will have very limited time to react.
