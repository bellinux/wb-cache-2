5|$|Contador {{continued}} to be troubled by his injury during stage 8, which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese. The stage was won by Beñat Intxausti (Movistar), {{who was in the}} day's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb. Astana again rode <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> pressure on the other riders; eventually a group formed of Contador, Aru, Porte and Landa. Landa then attacked and finished second on the stage, 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders. He therefore moved up into fifth place overall, while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint. Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway: Paolo Tiralongo (Astana) took a solo victory. Aru, Contador, Porte and Landa were again alone in a group {{towards the end of the}} stage; although they came to the finish together, Aru took a second out of the others in the sprint. This moved him to three seconds behind Contador. The following day was the first rest day of the race.|$|E

25|$|Their {{music has}} been largely a {{collaboration}} between producer Tamio Okuda, American singer-songwriter Andy Sturmer, and Ami and Yumi themselves. Ami and Yumi's vocals have been likened to U.S. vocal sister group The Roches. They often sing whole songs together with harmonies and their sound borrows heavily from The Beatles and other artists such as ABBA, The Who, and The Carpenters. Both Ami and Yumi themselves have openly admitted that their music is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> into just one genre because of the many different influences.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissolution}} of the DPJ is mainly attributed {{to the fact that}} the reforms that the DPJ advocated for were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> into place because of electoral restrictions, economic restrictions, and the fact that the reforms that would reduce the power of the bureaucracy would help deprive the DPJ of the power to implement their other reforms. Other factors that affected the {{dissolution of}} the party were the internal conflicts that paralyzed the DPJ and the fact that the DPJ aligned itself with the foreign policy of the LDP.|$|E

[...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc was an opportunity to use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in the past eight or nine years, but never put on albums because they never seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, because sometimes it mucks up the sequence." [...] The tracks include Grohl's first composition [...] "Friend of a Friend" [...] – done in 1990, and previously recorded under the pseudonym 'Late!' on the cassette Pocketwatch; [...] "Razor", which Grohl wrote for a benefit concert at the Wiltern Theatre; and drummer Taylor Hawkins' composition [...] "Cold Day in the Sun", which after an attempt to do an electric version became an unplugged track, featuring Hawkins on vocals and tambourine and Grohl in the drums.|$|E

According to Leone, each weapon [...] "adds a lot of depth to the combat system." [...] Christian Donlan of Eurogamer {{said that the}} [...] "combat system, level flow, and pacing of bosses and puzzles remains largely untouched. But everything's bigger, grander and more elaborate." [...] He praised the weapons' accessibility, {{saying that it is}} easy to quickly switch between them. According to Tom McShea of GameSpot, the combat and scale [...] "have been pushed further than ever before... creating an experience so focused and explosively fun that it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down, and even harder to forget." [...] McShea said that regardless of repetition, [...] "the brutality of combat {{is one of the most}} satisfying aspects of God of War III." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer called God of War III [...] "visceral" [...] and [...] "brutal", and Kratos [...] "the undisputed king of the genre." [...] Jackson, however, said the core gameplay's familiarity [...] "makes it feel less than the very, very best", and according to Roper, two of the three additional weapons are similar to the main blades; they [...] "have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large they're more of the same." ...|$|E

500|$|Writers for Famitsu {{praised the}} mix of {{seriousness}} and comedy, and liked the characters' quirkiness and the pacing of the conversations. John Walker at Eurogamer called the game [...] "splendidly crazy as ever" [...] and [...] "the most joyfully daft fun imaginable". Tom East at Official Nintendo Magazine called the script fantastic. Joe Juba at Game Informer found the game entertaining, calling the writing hilarious and the problem-solving clever, with the two aspects complimenting each other well. Aaron Thomas at GameSpot liked the game, praising the game's story and calling the characters its greatest strength. He thought that the pacing {{was better than the}} first Ace Attorneys, but still found the game to be a step back: he felt that the game often reuses the same kinds of twists from the first. Gerald Villoria at GameSpy called the episodes well structured and stronger than the ones in first game, and called the dialogue sharp. Mikel Reparaz at GamesRadar said that the script, while entertaining, contains [...] "long stretches of meaningless dialogue" [...] and tends to leave the player knowing what happened and how to prove it before Phoenix does. He initially liked the new rival character Franziska, but thought that she only becomes increasingly obnoxious. Craig Harris at IGN said that the episodes are well written, with enthusiasm and personality, making them <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down.|$|E
500|$|The Commodore 64 and Atari ST {{versions}} of Wonder Boy in Monster Land also received similar praise from gaming magazines. The Games Machine praised the AtariST version but criticized the Commodore64 version. The reviewers {{said the former}} [...] "is not only playable, but the graphics are the nearest to the arcade machine you're going to get"; however, they said the graphics in the latter, while colorful, were too block-like and ruined its overall presentation. Reviewers from Zzap!64 criticized the Commodore64 version, saying that this version is only slightly better and more playable than the Amiga version. Moreover, they said this version also suffered from repetitive gameplay and [...] "inefficient multi-load", though an improvement from the Amiga version. Zero gave a fair assessment of the AtariST version, appreciating the [...] "cutesy" [...] and cartoon-like graphics and addicting gameplay, which the reviewer said is [...] "very easy to get into and very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down"; they criticized the game's lack of any save features, saying {{that some of the}} gameplay gets repetitive after a while. Swedish magazine [...] acclaimed the Commodore64 version in most aspects. They lauded its graphics for being simplistic but clean, but they noted that they were not sensational. They criticized the game for its music, which they said can become annoying after a while, and for its lack of save points. Overall, they gave a positive review, saying that it [...] "is a perfect example of how to make a game that is fairly simple to play but still is fairly advanced".|$|E

40|$|This paper extends Lucas (1978) to a {{production}} economy with two capital goods. It is an RBC {{model in which}} each unit of investment requires a new idea, an "option". When options are scarce, new capital is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in place {{and the value of}} old capital rises. Thus the stock market and Tobin's Q are negative indexes of intangibles. During a boom, Q rises gradually, as options are used up. Because investment represents an exercise of options, it has an intertemporal substitution tradeoff that is absent in the adjustment-cost model. Equilibrium may be efficient even without markets for knowledge; the stock market may suffice. ...|$|R

[...] Both Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from the ABC show At The Movies gave the film five stars, making No Country for Old Men the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2007. Both praised the film for its visual language and suspense, David commenting that [...] "Hitchcock wouldn't have done the suspense better".|$|E
