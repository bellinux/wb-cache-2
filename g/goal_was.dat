5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of {{creating}} a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead {{at the end of}} the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2017, Walker, who {{was still}} {{recovering}} from the injury sustained while playing in India, signed a 18 month long deal with Scottish League Two club Edinburgh City. He scored his first goal for the club in a league match against Montrose in February. The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> his fifteenth goal of his career. He said that the <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the better}} goals of his career. Walker was appointed as the club captain in May. He also simultaneously signed a contract keeping him in the club till May 2020.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{scheduler}} and controller co-design for real-time control systems. The overall <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> higher resource utilization and better control performance. One <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> {{to minimize the}} performance loss due to jitter and control delays. Another <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to relax the nominal requirements on hard deadlines and fixed worst-case execution times. A third <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to provide a co-simulation environment for real-time control systems...|$|R

5|$|After impressing in {{his first}} season at City, Barton was offered a new one-year {{contract}} at the club by manager Kevin Keegan, which he signed in April 2003. He featured in the first team more regularly during the 2003–04 season and, following a second Premiership <b>goal,</b> <b>was</b> rewarded with a call-up to the England U21 squad for their 2004 European Championship qualifiers against Macedonia and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Although one of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction is central to the film, Carruth's <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner.

5|$|An Alert Force was {{established}} at Loring AFB in October 1957. The wing began supporting the force with six B-52s in January 1958. In {{response to a}} conflict in Lebanon, the Alert Force was expanded to include the entire bombardment wing in July 1958, when the SAC bomber force went to full alert status. SAC's overall <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> achieved in 1960.|$|E
50|$|The term goal {{may also}} {{refer to the}} {{structure}} in which <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> scored. The ice hockey <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> rectangular in shape; the front frame of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> made of steel tube painted red (or another color depending on the league) and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar. A net {{is attached to the}} back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind. The entire <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> considered an inbounds area of the playing surface, and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal. Under NHL rules, the opening of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 72 in wide by 48 in tall, and the footprint of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 44 in deep.|$|R
5000|$|Using a values {{approach}} to goal pursuit, Heath et al. (1999) assert that proximal <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to}} result in successful outcomes. [...] When a <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> proximal, value for each step of progress is greater than if the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> distal given diminishing sensitivity. One way to transform a distal goal to a more proximal <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to set subgoals. Therefore, Heath et al. (1999) assert that setting subgoals is an effective strategy to motivate successful goal pursuit.|$|R
500|$|The longer {{boundary}} {{lines are}} touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> placed) <b>are</b> <b>goal</b> lines. A rectangular <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> positioned {{at the middle}} of each goal line. The inner edges of the vertical <b>goal</b> posts must <b>be</b> [...] apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the <b>goal</b> posts must <b>be</b> [...] above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the <b>goal,</b> but <b>are</b> not required by the Laws.|$|R
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the bench to ensure the <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E

Brahmousin are now bred in the USA, Indonesia, El Salvador and Australia.|$|E

5|$|Drogba {{started the}} 2005–06 season by scoring two {{goals in a}} Community Shield win over Arsenal. His {{reputation}} was marred amidst accusations of cheating during Chelsea's 2–0 win over Manchester City.

This occurred just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where the <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> disallowed.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life.

5|$|During the {{following}} off-season, Kings Dominion widened the first high-speed turn {{to lower the}} amount of G-force experienced on the ride.

5|$|Former {{incumbent}} Milton Obote won the 1980 Ugandan general election. Museveni {{disputed the}} result, {{and he and}} his followers withdrew from the new government in protest.

The army's <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to overthrow Obote's government, in {{what became known as the}} Ugandan Bush War.|$|E
50|$|One of Ramang's famous <b>goals</b> <b>was</b> against China PR in the 1958 FIFA World Cup qualification, where Indonesia won 2-0, {{and one of}} the <b>goals</b> <b>was</b> done by bicycle kick.|$|R
