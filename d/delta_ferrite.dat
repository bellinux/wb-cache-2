5000|$|Beta ferrite (β-Fe) and {{beta iron}} (β-iron) are {{obsolete}} terms for the paramagnetic form of alpha ferrite (α-Fe). The primary phase of low-carbon or mild steel and most cast irons {{at room temperature}} is ferromagnetic ferrite (α-Fe). As iron or ferritic steel is heated above the critical temperature A2 or Curie temperature of 771 °C (1044K or 1420 °F), the random thermal agitation of the atoms exceeds the oriented magnetic moment of the unpaired electron spins in the 3d shell. The A2 forms the low-temperature boundary of the beta iron field in the phase diagram in Figure 1. Beta ferrite is crystallographically identical to alpha ferrite, except for magnetic domains and the expanded body-centered cubic lattice parameter {{as a function of}} temperature, and is therefore of only minor importance in steel heat treating. For this reason, the beta [...] "phase" [...] is not usually considered a distinct phase but merely the high-temperature end of the alpha phase field. Similarly, the A2 is of only minor importance compared to the A1 (eutectoid), A3 and Acm critical temperatures. The Acm, where austenite is in equilibrium with cementite + γ-Fe, is beyond the right edge in Fig. 1. The α + γ phase field is, technically, the β + γ field above the A2. The beta designation maintains continuity of the Greek-letter progression of phases in iron and steel: alpha ferrite (α-Fe), beta ferrite (β-Fe), austenite (γ-Fe), high-temperature <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> (δ-Fe) and high-pressure hexaferrum (ε-Fe).|$|E

40|$|High-alloyed Cr-Ni-based {{two-phase}} {{stainless steel}} (SS) cast alloys {{are commonly used}} in nuclear power plants. The mechanical equipment in these facilities can contribute {{to a reduction in}} its resistance to stable crack growth as a result of extended operating times and high temperatures. The toughness of these materials strongly depends on their <b>delta</b> (▫/delta▫) <b>ferrite</b> content, which spinodally decomposes into two phases with different ratios of Cr and Ni at a relatively low (slightly above 300 °C) temperature. This temperature is similar to the operating temperature of the vital parts, for example, the coolant system. The formation of two phases with the same crystalstructure but different lattice parameters causes internal elastic stresses that result in a hardness increase and an impact-toughness decrease. The result is an increased risk of crack formation in the stress-concentration zones such as the critical regions of different welded joints (e. g. "L, T, K and X" shapes). The values of the critical stress intensity factor change according to its position along the crack contour.

To avoid from penetration defects and inclusion contamination in molten metal pool, multipass shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) of SS 304 L is performed in this research using E 308 L filler metal. The objective of this research is to investigate out the multiple welding passes effects on microstructural evolution, in situ <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> percentage and different mechanical properties. A metallurgical microscope is used to examine the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> phase in austenite. Instead of depending on general ferrite number (FN) obtained through rigorous physical attempts, a MATLAB code for image processing is developed to estimate the local percentage of <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite,</b> within the austenitic phase. To reveal <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> effects, its local percentage is discussed in relation to various properties. With the help of this technique, a good estimation is also made to detect the localized <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> morphologies. The fusion zone (FZ) solidified in ferritic-austenitic mode (FA mode) comprises two basic <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> morphologies; lacy and vermicular. Grain growth behavior and ferritic percentage of base metal (BM), heat affected zone (HAZ) and fusion zone (FZ) are discussed in single, double and triple pass weldments. Effects of <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> percentage and morphology on fatigue crack initiation as well propagation are also investigated in different zones of each pass weldment. Fatigue crack propagation rate (FCPR) in different orientation with respect to welding zones is checked and it is noticed that propagation rate is much lower in perpendicular direction as compared to parallel one. Due to specific microstructural pattern, HAZ has greater fatigue crack propagation rate (FCPR) in comparison to BM and FZ. Fatigue crack propagation found highest resistant in triple pass weldment due to high concentration of lacy ferrites. However, in some cases it is found that crack mechanics is actually responsible instead of microstructural effects. (C) 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order {{to explain the}} mechanism of edge cracking, the metallographical quantitative analysis of microstructural inhomogeneity of steel plates containing edge cracks of different intensities is performed. The austenitic matrix of the steel contained small amounts of <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> inhomogeneously distributed across the width and {{the thickness of the}} plate. A correlation was found between ferrite content and edge cracking: the higher the ferrite content the longer the edge cracks.

To understand the effects of reheating parameters on the morphology and content of <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite,</b> the specimens selected from different locations of as-cast 304 stainless steel slab, were reheated according to the temperature profiles, which simulated the industrial reheating process before hot rolling. In general, reheating reduced the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> content, increased the size of the individual ferrite island and changed its shape to a more spherical. An increase of reheating time to 92 minutes caused drastic reduction in <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> content and its further spherodization.

40|$|Strip casting {{is a new}} process, {{which can}} produce cast strips with {{thicknesses}} of only 2 [...] 5 mm and eliminate hot rolling. Cold rolled strips produced by strip casting have low mechanical anisotropy, which {{is related to the}} texture of the strip; however, this link has not yet been investigated. Texture development from strip casting through to cold rolling and subsequent annealing was therefore studied. Cast strips of two types were produced by solidification into the dual (<b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> + gamma austenite) phase and single (<b>delta</b> <b>ferrite)</b> phase domains. The { 001 }⟨uvw⟩ <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> texture is converted into the { 001 }⟨uvw⟩ gamma final texture in the first steel, while most of it transforms into the fcc { 011 }⟨uvw⟩ fiber in the second. The observed variant selection can be explained using the Bain strain model. The cast strips and a hot rolled strip were subsequently cold rolled and annealed. The gamma-to-alpha' deformation-induced transformation took place during cold rolling and low symmetry rolling textures were produced in the (<b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> + austenite) steel after 50 % reduction by cold rolling. By contrast, the 80 % cold rolled textures displayed orthorhombic symmetry.

KIVILAHTI ABSTRACT. The <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> in a Nb-stabilized austenitic cladding decomposes during stress relief heat treatments (10 to 600 h at 670 ° C, or 1238 °F,) forming sigma phase and secondary austenite. Tensile, impact, and crack opening dis-placement tests revealed the embrittling effect of the sigma phase. As little as 3 % of sigma phase reduced the impact toughness at room tempera-ture more than 50 %. The precipitation of sigma phase was not found to have any {{significant effect on the}} anodic polariza-tion behavior of the test material. The austenite matrix dissolved more easily than the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> and sigma phases during the anodic polarization. The effect was opposite in the electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation tests where the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> and sigma phase net-works were selectively dissolved. Slow strain-rate tests did not cause stress corrosion cracking in hot 0. 58 N H 3 BO 3 solution. In 1 N HCI solution the cracks grew as the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> and sigma phases were selectively dissolved. The crack growth rate increased with increas-ing sigma phase content.

Ferrite fraction measurements published in the literature for stainless steel cast samples {{were added to the}} present work data, enabling an extensive analysis about practical methods to calculate <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> fractions in stainless steel castings. Nineteen different versions of practical methods were formed using Schaeffler, DeLong, and Siewert diagrams and the nickel and chromium equivalent indexes suggested by several authors. These methods were evaluated by a detailed statistical analysis, showing that the Siewert diagram, including its equivalent indexes and iso-ferrite lines, gives the lowest relative errors between calculated and measured <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> fractions. Although originally created for stainless steel welds, this diagram gives relative errors lower than those for the current ASTM standard method (800 /A 800 M- 01), developed to predict ferrite fractions in stainless steel castings. Practical methods originated from a combination of different chromium/nickel equivalent indexes and the iso-ferrite lines from Schaeffler diagram give the lowest relative errors when compared with combinations using other iso-ferrite line diagrams. For the samples cast in the present work, an increase in cooling rate from 0. 78 to 2. 7 K/s caused a decrease in the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> fraction, but a statistical hypothesis test revealed that this effect is significant in only 50 % of the samples that have ferrite in their microstructures.

40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{consists}} of two separate and independent studies: One metallurgical study and one industrial buying behaviour study. Both studies concern continuous casting rolls. Metallurgical Study: The first objective {{of this study was}} to investigate two continuous casting rolls, consisting of different steel tubes with different martensitic stainless steel weld overlays. The second objective was to evaluate the methods employed in the study. The weld overlaps are clearly the weakest points of the weld overlay. They are sensitive to corrosion attacks, mainly due to sensitisation. The <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> present in the welded overlay of both rolls is a preferential site for the corrosion attacks and the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> content depends primarily on the chemical composition of the weld overlay. The welding temperature may also have some influence on the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> content, but this has not been observed in this study. Both rolls have similar surface hardness. Roll no. 2 has more generalized corrosion attacks than roll no. 1. This is due to a higher <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> content in roll no. 2 than in roll no. 1. The methods employed during the study proved to be adequate. In any future study, on condition that the visual inspection, diameter measurements, ultrasonic testing and surface hardness measurements show that all positions on the roll are similar, it will be sufficient to cut a bead and overlap sample from only one position. The rolls were investigated using macro etching, optical microscopy, Vickers hardness testing, ultrasonic testing ICP-OES analysis of nickel and chromium content and carbon content analysis by wet chemical method. <b>Delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> content was also calculated theoretically using a Schaeffler – DeLong diagram and a semi-empirical model. Industrial Buying Behaviour Study: The aim of this study is to investigate the industrial buying behaviour in slab casting steelworks in Western Europe when buying roll-lines. Case studies have been conducted at four steelworks belonging to different companies. Data was collected through personal interviews with people from production, maintenance and purchasing department and intermediate level management. A test consisting of a smaller amount of rolls is always performed before buying any larger quantities of rolls. Even though the test order has relatively low economic value, compared to a full-scale order, it is during this process that the relationships are established between the buying and the selling company. Findings show that the industrial buying behaviour of steelworks in Western Europe agrees well with the theory in this field. The buying process follows the steps in the buygrid model with only a few exceptions. The decision-making power lays in the intermediate level management, even though approval is required from upper level management. The most important factors affecting the buying behaviour are the relationship between the buyer and the seller, service-life and life cycle cost of the roll-line. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

The absence of <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> during hot rolling would eliminate the highly anisotropic structure currently found in 3 CR 12, whilst accelerating the transformation to alpha ferrite might eliminate the need for an annealing treatment.

40|$|A duplex {{stainless}} steel {{was investigated in}} both as-received sheet and after annealing at temperatures ranging from 850 to 1100 °C. The sheet presents a deformation texture in both phases, austenite and ferrite, induced by cold rolling. Microstructure in the as-received material consists of island-like austenitic grains in a ferrite matrix. These austenitic grains are elongated with an average size of 6, 20 and 40 m along the normal (ND), transversal (TD) and rolling direction (RD). Quantitative texture measurements demonstrated that texture components are distributed mainly along the -fiber (ND ‹ 100 ›) and -fiber (RD ‹ 110 ›) for the ferrite and the -fiber (ND ‹ 110 ›) for the austenite. After recrystallization, {{a decrease in the}} intensity of the mean fibers and an increase in the minor components was observed in both, ferrite and austenite. Therefore, a similar texture was reached in both phases after annealing at 1050 °C. Microstructural characterization after annealing at temperatures above 850 °C showed that the elongated austenitic grains transform in colonies of equiaxic grains of about 10 – 15 m in size. These colonies are surrounded by a ferritic matrix at annealing temperatures above 1000 °C or by a laminar microstructure at temperatures below 950 °C. This laminar microstructure includes sigma phase and austenite formed from <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite,</b> and untransformed <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{friction}} welding {{is a solid}} state joining process established as a niche technology for the joining of aeroengine bladed disks. However, the process {{is not limited to}} this application, and therefore the feasibility of joining a common engineering austenitic steel, AISI 316 L, has been explored. It was found that mechanically sound linear friction welds could be produced in 316 L, with tensile properties in most welds exceeding those of the parent material. The mechanical properties of the welds were also found to be insensitive to relatively large changes in welding parameters. Texture was investigated in one weld using high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Results showed a strong { 111 } type texture at the centre of the weld, which is a typical shear texture in face centre cubic materials. Variations in welding parameters were seen to {{have a significant impact on}} the microstructures of welds. This was particularly evident in the variation of the fraction of <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite,</b> in the thermo-mechanically affected zone of the welds, with different process parameters. Analysis of the variation in <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite,</b> with different welding parameters, has produced some interesting insights into heat generation and dissipation during the process. It is hoped that a greater understanding of the process could help to make the parameter optimisation process, when welding 316 L as well as other materials, more efficient...|$|E
40|$|A {{new series}} of {{austenitic}} stainless steels-Nb stabilized, without Mo additions, non-susceptible to <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> formation and devoid of intemetallic phases (sigma and chi), without deformation induced martensite is being developed, aiming at high temperature applications {{as well as for}} corrosive environments. The base steel composition is a 15 Cr- 15 Ni with normal additions of Nb of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2 wt%. Mechanical properties, oxidation and corrosion resistance already have been invetigated in previous papers. In this paper, the effects of Nb on the SFE, strain hardening and recrystallization resistance are evaluated with the help of Adaptive Neural Networks (ANN) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{localized}} corrosion {{behavior of}} laser surface melted 304 L {{austenitic stainless steel}} was studied by potentiodynamic polarization test. The extent of improvement in corrosion resistance was governed by the preferred orientation {{and the percentage of}} <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> present {{on the surface of the}} laser melted sample. It was established by orientation imaging microscopy that the highest pitting potential value was obtained when grains were oriented in the most close- packed [101] direction compared to the random distribution of the base metal and other laser surface melted samples oriented in [001] direction. The sample with lower percentage of ferrite had good pitting resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focused on}} the influence of welding inter-pass temperature in 304 H type austenitic stainless steel weld joints in the as-welded condition. The shielded metal arc welding process was used to weld the joints. The following was evaluated: the theoretical and measured ferrite numbers, solidification mode and <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> morphology, as well as the evolution and precipitation of secondary phases i. e. sigma phase in the weld, chromium carbides in the heat affected zone. After the evaluation, {{it was clear that the}} inter-pass temperature had an effect on solute distribution during cooling and subsequent calculated ferrite numbers of the welds. The calculated ferrite numbers, that were determined using the weld metal chemistry of each joint and the WRC- 1992 constitution diagram, increased from FN of 1 to FN of 3 with the increase in welding inter-pass temperature from 105 °C- 100 °C and to 195 °C- 200 °C respectively. The measured ferrite number showed no correlation with the increases in interpass temperature. The highest measured ferrite number of 3. 8 was obtained when welding at an inter-pass temperature of 135 °C – 140 °C which was closest to the FN of 5 required minimum, as specified by the SAPREF Refinery, to prevent solidification cracking. No solidification cracking was observed in any of the specimens evaluated in this study even though all the specimens had ferrite contents well below FN 5. This observation supports research that indicates that controlling of the primary solidification mode as <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> is more important a factor in preventing solidification cracking than trying to control the actual ferrite content of the weld metal. The primary solidification mode of the weld was a combination of the austenite-ferrite (AF) to predominantly ferrite-austenite (FA) with the FA solidification mode dominating with the increase in inter-pass temperature. The nature of the carbides formed due to low temperature sensitization in the heat affected zone of the base metal changed with the increase in inter-pass temperature. The precipitated chromium carbides only formed discontinuous carbide networks at the interpass temperature of 195 °C- 200 °C. The transformation of sigma from <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> was not observed in the columnar dendritic and mushy zones of the weld metal. This research revealed the optimum welding inter-pass temperature for welding 304 H austenitic stainless steel with 308 H electrode to be 135 - 140 °C...|$|E
40|$|A Fe- 22. 5 %Cr- 4. 53 %Ni- 3. 0 %Mo duplex {{stainless}} steel was solution treated at 1, 325 A degrees C for 1 h, quenched {{in water and}} isothermally treated at 900 A degrees C for 5, 000 s. The crystallography of austenite was studied using EBSD technique. Intragranular austenite particles formed from <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> are shown to nucleate on inclusions, and to be subdivided in twin-related sub-particles. Intragranular austenite appears to have planar-only orientation relationships with the ferrite matrix, close to Kurdjumov-Sachs and Nishyiama-Wassermann, but not related to a conjugate direction. Samples treated at 900 A degrees C underwent sparse formation of sigma phase and pronounced growth of elongated austenite particles, very similar to acicular ferrite...|$|E
40|$|The {{weld metal}} {{produced}} {{from a series}} of high productivity welds of 316 LN austenitic stainless steel plate was examined to evaluate the effects of the use of a higher heat input process (> 2. 5 kJ/mm). This high heat input process was aimed at maximising single sided weld metal penetration in a single pass using simple square edge preparations and minimising time consuming handling operations. The evaluation was undertaken by correlating the local microstructure with the local toughness and microhardness of the cap, middle and root of the weld. It was established that the intermetallic phases / carbides present did not appear to have a significantly adverse effect on either corrosion or toughness. The phases observed and confirmed by the use of SAED were predominantly chi (χ) with some sigma(σ). No identifications were made of M 23 C 6 which was observed in other studies of 316 LN welds. A series of impact tests with variations in the notch positions showed that the thickness of the <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> had an effect on the weld metal toughness. As a result of this work it was established that similar volume fractions of <b>delta</b> <b>ferrite</b> did not necessarily produce similar levels of weld metal toughness, but ferrite thickness did appear to have a contributory effect. Welding of 316 LN stainless steel with a single sided single pass submerged arc welding process was satisfactorily undertaken up to 20 mm plate thickness without preheat or post weld heat treatment. The ability to achieve this resulted in significant economic savings within the process for ship panel production combined with satisfactory weld metal properties...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{macroscopic}} and microscopic examinations on {{the failure}} specimen {{were conducted on}} T 91 /HR 3 C dissimilar steel welded joints for the high temperature reheater in a 3033 t/h USC boiler. The cracking is along the circumferential direction of tube, initiated in the CGHAZ (course grain HAZ) and terminated at the FGHAZ (fine grain HAZ) of the outer wall. The high hardness and unstability microstructure in the HAZ {{are responsible for the}} cracking failure. Post welding heat treatment (PWHT) is suggested for improving the ductility and reducing the residual stress for the welded joints.
