5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E
5|$|The use of helium {{reduces the}} {{distorting}} effects of temperature {{variations in the}} space between lenses in some telescopes, due to its extremely low <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction.</b> This method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that the {{silicate}} particles have a real <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.|$|E

This number is complex having both real and imaginary parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by the substance.|$|E
5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{treatment of}} power efficiency (P(eff) is undertaken {{for the case}} of a positively guiding optical fiber with a thin-film source distributed in the core-cladding interface. The approach adopts the exact solution of the cylindrical optical fiber with an infinite cladding to account for differences between the <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> <b>of</b> the core and the cladding. The excitation of low-loss leaky modes by the cladding is ignored, and only the injection by the evanescent field is considered. The formulas permit the analysis of the power-injection efficiency of fibers with arbitrary differences in <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction.</b> P(eff) does not always increase with V number, but rather varies slightly with wavelength and fiber-core radius and varies significantly with the difference in the <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction.</b> The theoretical results of the work are of interest for designing an atomic-O chemical sensor based on evanescent-wave coupling...|$|R

5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> of 1.026 {{which makes}} its surface {{so hard to}} see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide {{crystals}} {{have been}} used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction.</b> Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment {{that made the}} fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E

5000|$|Eveite is anisotropic, {{which means}} that its {{physical}} and optical properties differ with respect to direction. It has high relief, which is the apparent topography exhibited by minerals in thin section as a consequence <b>of</b> refractive <b>index.</b> It is biaxial, so it has two optic axes and three <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> n depending on the crystallographic direction. The refractive index is {{the ratio of the}} velocity of light in a vacuum to that in the mineral. The difference between the highest and lowest <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> is called the birefringence, so the birefringence of eveite is β = [...]032.|$|R

25|$|Waveplates are {{constructed}} {{out of a}} birefringent material (such as quartz or mica), for which the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> is different for different orientations of light passing through it. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, {{whether it is a}} half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction.</b> By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization.|$|E

5000|$|Snell's Law {{can be used}} {{to predict}} the {{deflection}} of light rays as they pass through [...] "linear media" [...] as long as the <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> and the geometry of the media are known. For example, the propagation of light through a prism results in the light ray being deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism. Additionally, since different frequencies of light have slightly different <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> in most materials, refraction {{can be used to}} produce dispersion spectra that appear as rainbows. The discovery of this phenomenon when passing light through a prism is famously attributed to Isaac Newton.|$|R
25|$|The {{high-pressure}} minerals, seifertite, stishovite, and coesite, though, {{have higher}} densities and <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> than quartz.

25|$|In a {{conducting}} medium, permittivity and <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> are complex-valued. Consequently, so are {{the angle}} of refraction and the wave-vector. This implies that, while the surfaces of constant real phase are planes whose normals make an angle equal to the angle of refraction with the interface normal, the surfaces of constant amplitude, in contrast, are planes parallel to the interface itself. Since these two planes do not in general coincide with each other, the wave {{is said to be}} inhomogeneous.
