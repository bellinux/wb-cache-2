5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>pole,</b> located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>pole</b> is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
25|$|Geomagnetic {{storms that}} ignite auroras may occur more often {{during the months}} around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but {{geomagnetic}} storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>pole</b> rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.|$|E
50|$|The Earth's {{geomagnetic}} field can {{be approximated by}} a tilted dipole (like a bar magnet) placed {{at the center of}} the Earth. The South <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> is the point where the axis of this best-fitting tilted dipole intersects the Earth's surface in the southern hemisphere. As of 2005 it was calculated to be located at , near the Vostok Station. Because the field is not an exact dipole, the South <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> does not coincide with the South Magnetic Pole. Furthermore, the South <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> is wandering for the same reason its northern magnetic counterpart wanders.|$|E
50|$|Over several {{thousand}} years, the average {{location of the}} <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>poles</b> coincides with the geographical poles. Paleomagnetists have long relied on the Geocentric axial dipole (GAD) hypothesis, which states that, aside from during geomagnetic reversals, the time-averaged position of the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>poles</b> has always coincided with the geographic poles. There is considerable paleomagnetic evidence supporting this hypothesis.|$|R
5000|$|As a first-order approximation, the Earth's {{magnetic}} field can be modelled {{as a simple}} dipole (like a bar magnet), tilted about 10° {{with respect to the}} Earth's rotation axis (which defines the Geographic North and Geographic South Poles) and centred at the Earth's centre. The North and South <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Poles</b> are the [...] points where the axis of this theoretical dipole intersects the Earth's surface. If the Earth's {{magnetic field}} were a perfect dipole then the field lines would be vertical at the <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Poles,</b> and they would coincide with the Magnetic Poles. However, the approximation is imperfect, and so the Magnetic and <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Poles</b> lie some distance apart.|$|R

The North and South <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Poles</b> are the antipodal points where the axis of this theoretical dipole intersects the Earth's surface, thus unlike the magnetic poles they always have an equal degree of latitude and supplementary degrees of longitude respectively (2017: Lat. 80.5°N, 80.5°S; Long. 72.8°W, 107.2°E). If the Earth's {{magnetic field}} were a perfect dipole then the field lines would be vertical at the <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Poles,</b> and they would coincide with the North and South magnetic poles.

50|$|The {{locations}} of geomagnetic poles are {{predicted by the}} International Geomagnetic Reference Field, a statistical fit to measurements of the Earth's field by satellites and in geomagnetic observatories. If the Earth's field were exactly dipolar, the north pole of a magnetic compass needle would point directly at the North <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> In practice it does not because the geomagnetic field that originates in the core has a more complex non-dipolar part, and magnetic anomalies in the Earth's crust {{also contribute to the}} local field.|$|E
5000|$|When Irving {{started his}} {{graduate}} studies, {{the history of}} the Earth's magnetic field was known for the few centuries since the first magnetic observatories had been established. With fellow students Ken Creer and Jan Hospers, he looked to extend this record back in time. Irving used a magnetometer, recently designed by Patrick Blackett, to analyze the magnetic directions imparted to rocks by their iron minerals. He found large discrepancies between the directions of the present magnetic field direction and those recorded in Precambrian rock in the highlands of Scotland. He surmised the only explanation could be that Scotland had shifted relative to the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>pole.</b> Irving also determined that India had moved northward by 6000 km and rotated by more than [...] These results confirmed the predictions Alfred Wegener had put forth in his theory of continental drift in 1912.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the Swarm GPS {{receivers}} {{are affected}} by ionospheric scintillation, which slightly degrades their performance when flying close to the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>poles</b> and the <b>geomagnetic</b> equator. This affects in particular {{the quality of the}} kinematic orbits, which show larger errors at these locations. To improve the robustness of the Swarm GPS receivers for ionospheric scintillation, the receiver settings have been modified by widening the bandwidths of the tracking loops. With the updated tracking loops, the amount of collected GPS observations increases by about 1.3  % and occasional tracking losses due to severe equatorial ionospheric scintillation are greatly reduced. The wider bandwidths of the carrier loops also significantly reduce the large carrier phase residuals close to the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>poles,</b> and no degradation is visible for GPS observations at midlatitudes. Both the reduced-dynamic and kinematic orbits show lower SLR residuals, which indicates that the updated tracking loops also improve the POD performance for both orbit types.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to resolution of hypotheses involving the tectonic history of the central Caribbean, a palaeomagnetic survey {{has been carried out}} on a series of Cretaceous dikes from the Central Inlier of Jamaica. The magnetic properties of the dikes, which are basalt, andesite, trachyandesite, and hornblende-andesite in composition, are variable but are generally dominated by low oxidation state titanoniagnetites. This has caused some difficulty in defining a stable direction of magnetiza-tion. Nevertheless, two distinct palaeomagnetic groups are recognized: eleven dikes possess virtual <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>poles</b> (VGP) which when averaged are indistinguishable from the previously-defined North American Cretaceous pole position, and four other dikes recorded closely-grouped equatorial VGP. Both groups contain polarity dif-ferences. The favoured interpretation is that Jamaica has not rotated significantly about a vertical axis since the Cretaceous, and for a limited period the regional geomagnetic field behaviour resulted in low latitude virtual <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>poles,</b> similar to previously described geomagnetic activity detected in Tertiary lavas of Hawaii, Alaska, Oregon, and Iceland...|$|R

50|$|The Earth's {{field is}} roughly like a tilted dipole, but it {{changes over time}} (a {{phenomenon}} called geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>pole</b> stays near the geographic pole, but at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth's field reverses. These geomagnetic reversals, analyzed within a Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale, contain 184 polarity intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete reversal of the Laschamp event occurring 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. Geologists observed geomagnetic reversal recorded in volcanic rocks, through magnetostratigraphy correlation (see natural remanent magnetization) and their signature {{can be seen as}} parallel linear magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on seafloor spreading, a part of plate tectonics. They are the basis of magnetostratigraphy, which correlates magnetic reversals with other stratigraphies to construct geologic time scales.
