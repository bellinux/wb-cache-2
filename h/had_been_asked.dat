5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{cover was}} created by graphic artist Margo Nahas. It was not {{specifically}} commissioned; Nahas <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to create a cover that featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. Her husband brought her portfolio to the band anyway, and from that material they chose the painting of a putto stealing cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas' best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, while {{attending}} Northwestern High School, {{he began working}} for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV), creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. After graduating from high school, Henson enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, as a studio arts major, thinking he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department {{introduced him to the}} craft and textiles courses in the College of Home economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character: Kermit the Frog. Henson would remain at WRC for seven years, from 1954 to 1961.|$|E

Siddharth Anand's adaptation of 2 States would film {{at the same time as}} Kohli's proposed film. Anand and Kohli met and agreed that Chopra would act in 2 States. Later, Kohli approached Chopra with a new script, and she agreed to join the cast for Teri Meri Kahaani. Prachi Desai and Neha Sharma were cast to play Kapoor's love interests in the 1960s and 2012, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E

5|$|On 12 July Ward {{reported}} on the weekend's events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> by Ivanov {{for information about the}} future arming of West Germany with atomic weapons. This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, Sir Roger Hollis.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford {{had told him}} that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that that made his position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: he said that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier {{had told him that}} if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E
5|$|The Reverend Francis Willmore Dixon was {{the head}} pastor of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, and his youth pastor, Peter Culver, had become a Christian {{as a result of}} meeting Jenner on George Street on 2 September 1945. In 1952, at an All Nations Bible College event, Dixon and Culver heard Noel Stanton's Christian testimony, which {{included}} the episode in which Stanton had met Jenner. Dixon then realised that Culver and Stanton must have become Christians {{as a result of the}} same man. The following year, Dixon heard two different British sailors who did not know each other tell their testimonies at Lansdowne Baptist Church, and both had told very similar stories to Culver and Stanton; both had been walking down George Street and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> Jenner's question.|$|E

5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi Minister of Agriculture and SS officer. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over}} the {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} steady stream of reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack could not be diverted and no fighters <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron {{on the ground in the}} area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their own hands and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E
5|$|After his release, he {{travelled}} to Schleswig-Holstein to join Baroness Gisela von Donner, {{an earlier}} acquaintance, on her estate {{and lived with}} her three children. During this time, Galland found work as a forestry worker. There he convalesced and came {{to terms with his}} career and alleged knowledge of Nazi war crimes. Galland began to hunt for the family and traded the kills in the local markets to supplement meagre meat rations. Soon Galland rediscovered his love of flying. Kurt Tank, the designer of the Fw 190, requested that he go to his home in Minden to discuss a proposal. Tank <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to work for the British and Soviets, and had narrowly avoided being forcibly kidnapped by the latter. Tank, through a contact in Denmark, informed Galland about the possibility of the Argentine Government employing him as a test pilot for Tank’s new generation of fighters. Galland accepted and flew to Argentina. He settled with Gisela in El Palomar, Buenos Aires. Galland enjoyed the slow life. His time there, aside from work commitments, was taken up with Gisela and the active Buenos Aires night life. Galland found South America a world away from post-war shortages of Germany. Soon, he took up gliding again.|$|E

5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} Army Group Don until 10 days after it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing that the Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1911 federal election, {{several local}} Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked Rutherford {{to run against}} him in Strathcona. Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly—Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross, who he viewed as a rival for {{dominance}} of the Liberal party in Alberta, and his Edmonton Bulletin had taken {{the side of the}} dissidents during the railway scandal. A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, though Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting. Before this meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew. Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that this was due to the Conservatives' nomination of William Antrobus Griesbach, dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude their opposing him. Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund, and had balked. Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid splitting the vote on reciprocity, which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed. Whatever the reason, for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Botha, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone {{to form a}} government, {{began to}} make {{policies}} and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to be unfair to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention {{in a way that}} Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.|$|E
