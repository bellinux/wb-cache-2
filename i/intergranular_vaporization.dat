Conditions for periodically updating {{the assessment of}} geothermal energy resources include: increased data from expanded exploration and drilling; development of improved and new technologies for exploration, evaluation, extraction, and use; rapid evolution of geothermal knowledge; and the increased role of geothermal energy in response to changing economic, social, political, and environmental conditions, particularly an increasing awareness of the limits to petroleum and natural gas resources. Accordingly, the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) plans {{by the end of}} 1978 to update its 1975 assessment of the United States’ geothermal resource, with increased emphasis on several items. The USGS’s joint evaluations of geothermal resource-assessment techniques in the last year with the National Electric Agency of Italy (ENEL) under U. S. Energy Research and Development Agency sponsorship identified a number of problems, one of which was how to formulate geothermal recovery factors for systems producing by <b>intergranular</b> <b>vaporization</b> and by intergranular flow. The first formulation is fairly rigorous; the author solicits the reservoir engineering community’s help in improving the estimate of the second. 3 figs., 11 refs...|$|E
