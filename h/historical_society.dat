5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} {{strong ties}} to its history and traditions. During Briarcliff Manor's 1952 semicentennial, nine people served on the Historical Committee and published a village history book. In March 1974, after the mayor appointed twelve people for a 75th anniversary committee, the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough <b>Historical</b> <b>Society</b> (BMSHS). The <b>historical</b> <b>society</b> published an updated village history (A Village Between Two Rivers: Briarcliff Manor) in 1977, marking the 75th anniversary of the village. The <b>historical</b> <b>society</b> was initially located at the since-demolished Briarcliff Middle School building; it later moved {{to the second floor}} of a realty building on Pleasantville Road, and moved back to the school building after it was leased by Pace University. On March 21, 2010, the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O'Connor Weber Historical Center, established as part of the expanded Briarcliff Manor Public Library. Members of the <b>historical</b> <b>society</b> joined the nine-member Centennial Committee in 2002 to organize events for Briarcliff Manor's centennial.|$|E
