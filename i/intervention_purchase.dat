40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} issues {{involved}} in moving towards greater exchange rate flexibility and capital account liberalization in China. A more flexible exchange rate regime would allow China to operate a more independent monetary policy, providing a useful buffer against domestic and external shocks. At the same time, weaknesses in China’s financial system suggest that capital account liberalization poses significant risks and should be a lower priority in the short term. This paper concludes that greater exchange rate flexibility is in China’s own interest and that, along with a more stable and robust financial system, it {{should be regarded as}} a prerequisite for undertaking a substantial liberalization of the capital account.

Using a time varying Markov switching model we separate periods of relatively stable market conditions from volatile periods and look at the dynamic of the causality effect under different market conditions. The analysis is conducted for three developing markets, namely Croatia, Iceland and Jamaica and one developed market, Australia, for comparative purposes. We show that direct intervention affects the probability of switching between states in the developed market but has little or no effect in the developing markets reviewed. We argue that this is due to specific intervention practices rather than market characteristics. Additionally, we find that <b>intervention</b> <b>purchases</b> and sales tend to have different effects. Monetary policy is also found to impact the probability of transitioning from one market state to another, sometimes detracting from the strength of the influence of direct intervention on the transition probabilities. ...|$|R

This dynamic intervention activity of traders will significantly alter the Hungarian trade sector by bringing it closer to the physical processes of the cereal chain. As to the size of intervention, the great volume of the purchase of maize has resulted in an exceptionally severe problem considering the large surplus of Hungarian cereals. Recently, the Commission hampered maize intervention in Hungary by excluding this crop from cereals eligible for intervention. This measure is criticised in the paper, as we deem it unnecessary in recent market conditions, and in our view it doesn't make up the compulsory need for a complex reconsideration of recent EU cereal policy on the long term.

Under a quadratic cost of interest rate adjustments and interven- tions the policy maker should {{use a combination of}} interest rate adjustment and interventions. According to the model <b>interventions</b> (<b>purchases</b> of foreign currency) will be negatively correlated with interest rate deviations from the steady state level but positively correlated with interest rate deviations per- taining to non-stabilizing motives or a binding zero lower bound.

This paper estimates an FX intervention function for Barbados using a dynamic complementary log-log model. Three general findings emerged: (i) dynamics {{play an important role}} in the Central Bank’s intervention function, meaning that the probability that an intervention takes place today is conditional upon an intervention taking place at least one day prior. This most likely reflects the fact that deficits/surpluses on the FX market tend to be persistent, resulting in intervention over a consecutive number of days; (ii) there appears to be some differences in the response of Central Bank interventions to the other key variables. Particularly, seasonal fluctuations in tourism and interest rate spreads are likely to impact the probability of a sale intervention, but don’t seem to affect the likelihood of a <b>purchase</b> <b>intervention.</b> Moreover, an influx of real estate flows is likely to increase the probability that a <b>purchase</b> <b>intervention</b> takes place, but might have limited impact on the marginal propensity of a sale intervention.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the key characteristics {{of foreign exchange}} intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the period 1983 - 1997. The effectiveness of intervention has come into question {{in view of the}} rapidly growing volume of trade in the markets. In the literature, tests of actual effects of foreign exchange intervention are inconclusive and mixed, with many reporting significant positive correlation of intervention on the conditional volatility of exchange rate changes and destabilising effects on the conditional mean. The intervention on the $US/$A exchange rate market by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the post-floating period (since 1983 - 97) can be broken into five distinct phases. This paper investigates the changing effectiveness of the RBA’s daily intervention on the exchange rate by decomposing the exchange rate response to the intervention into various separate components and finds that the overall effects of intervention on the days of intervention seemed to be destabilizing. However, we argue that lower (or higher) values of the $A and higher conditional volatility on the days of <b>intervention</b> <b>purchases</b> (or sales) of the $A reflect the simultaneity issue; with sustained and large interventions, the foreign exchange market is stabilised to some extent in terms of direction and volatility.

Using monthly data from July 1995 to July 2013 and GARCH methodology, the thesis empirically estimates two models. First model estimates the effect intervention on the exchange rate level and volatility by measuring <b>intervention</b> as net <b>purchases</b> of US dollar by the RBI. In second model included both purchases and sales of US dollar as a proxy the intervention to analyze the effect of asymmetric intervention on exchange rate level and volatility.

40|$|The Czech Republic {{is part of}} {{integrated}} domestic market of the European Union and it is abided by rules of the Common agricultural policy for the common organization {{of the market for}} single sectors of commodities in case of agrarian products. All Czech commodities have free access on the whole territory of domestic market of the European Union without the tariff and non-tariff barriers. It was abolished the customs procedure, the proving of the origin and the founding of bonded warehouse and the paying of licence fee and charges for certification. The Czech farmers (vine-growers) can operate in stabilized business environment on the basis of definite rules of economic competition. The Czech Republic within a regulation of an agrarian trade must manage common regulations of a horizontal character and vertical regulations for the sectors of commodities after the integration into the EU. The regulation is executed through the common organization of the market. The common organization of the market in wine is based on three principles – regulation of the supply, regulation of the wine quality and regulation of the market. These rules are concerned with domestic market, when the commodities move within European Union and within foreign trade, when commodities are transported a frontier. The regulation of external agrarian trade, which is concerned with conditions of import and conditions of export, is executed through the so-called trade mechanisms.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} factors which can explain the substantial appreciation of the EUR/USD exchange rate in the period from 2002 to 2003. Our analysis has shown that both fundamental and nonfundamental factors seem to have played a role. Regarding fundamental factors, an accommodating U. S. monetary policy in light of a weak labor market as well as the rising U. S. current account deficit contributed to weakening the U. S. dollar and thus strengthening the euro. The Bank of Japan's large <b>intervention</b> <b>purchases</b> of U. S. dollars, which have been widely considered important in the economic policy debate, do not appear to have had a significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate; however, they seem to have weakened the Japanese yen both vis-a‘-vis the U. S. dollar and the euro. In addition to these factors, the accounting scandals in the U. S. stock markets as well as fears of war and terrorism had a dampening effect on market sentiment, thus adding to the strain on the U. S. dollar. Measurement problems render it difficult to assess the role of euro area monetary policy and of European economic data. With a view to nonfundamental factors, we discuss the role of the trend-following behavior of agents in the foreign exchange market on the basis of a technical foreign exchange trading system used in practice. The buy and sell recommendations of such systems may also help explain the appreciation of the euro in the period in question. All in all, these fundamental and nonfundamental factors may explain the direction to which the EUR/USD exchange rate moved, but not the extent of this movement or the relative significance of these factors in determining the EUR/USD exchange rate in the period in question.

This mandate required central office administrators who managed federal budgets to make evidence-based decisions when <b>purchasing</b> <b>interventions</b> and programs with federal funds. In this study, central office administrators across the state of Texas were surveyed to obtain information about their evidence-based decision-making practices and the factors that influenced them when making decisions about interventions for their districts. The purpose of this quantitative non-experimental {{study was to identify}} the evidence-based decision-making practices of central office administrators (n = 268) and the factors that influence them. Based on the findings in the literature, a survey was developed to collect data to examine correlations between central office administrators? evidence use in decision-making and (a) administrator knowledge of evidence-based practices, confidence in understanding statistical methodology and analyses, and beliefs about research; (b) individual administrator characteristics measured by education, experience, and employment; (c) school district characteristics such as size, type, location, and presence of policies; and (d) the administrator level at which evidence-based decisions were made. Data were collected using survey methodology. Factor analysis, regression analysis, and ANOVAs were employed to analyze the data. The present study provides evidence that administrators? knowledge of evidence-based practices and their self confidence in their own ability to understand the statistical methodologies and analyses that are typically found in research studies, impact administrators? evidence-based decision-making practices; however, results from this sample did not support the importance of administrators? beliefs about research in general. Results indicated that individual administrator level of education, administrative experience, and current employment did not predict their evidence-based decision-making practices. However, the data did indicate that the type of district (rural, suburban, urban), size of the district, and the presence of policies concerning evidence-based practices did impact administrators? evidence-based decision-making practices. Finally, to provide some insight on the impact of organizational structure on evidence-based decision-making, this study investigated the level within the central office where evidence-based decisions were made. Findings indicated that in urban districts, the majority of decisions were made by the program director or the assistant superintendent, whereas suburban districts identified program directors/budget managers as the primary decision-maker. Small rural districts appeared to make decisions at the higher superintendent level; however, this could be {{due to the fact that}} in some small rural districts the superintendent is also the program director/budget manager, yet only identified themselves as superintendent in the study...|$|R
40|$|The {{agriculture}} is regulated generally by majority of developed countries. This statement {{is particularly true}} when taking European Union into account. This regulation, which comes often together with high grants, is explained by seasonal character of agriculture, supporting of rural country, protection of jobs but also by existence of foreign grants and financial support. The original idea behind Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was to increase the income of agriculture segment. That is why EU started to subsidize the agricultural products. This led to increase of production because of the fact, that the farmers made use of the subsidies and produced higher quantities. The farmers enlarged the crops areas, used intensive methods of production, extended usage of heavy machinery and invested more in processing. This resulted in increase of secondary processing business sector. This brought the basic economic problem for the farmers: higher production backed by higher subsidies resulted in overlap of supply over demand on the market, which subsequently forced decrease in price of goods. This way, the income of farmers decreased {{back to the original}} level. The Government reacted to this process by setting minimal redemption prices. Higher price would subsequently decrease number of sold agriculture commodities. This way, there occurs overproduction, which is logical consequence of regulating the system by minimal redemption prices. There exist several possibilities how to react to such a situation. Export subventions (financial support for exports and granting of export licences) mean only transferring the problem of overproduction to another country. Another "possibility" is to cut-down imported quantities by putting restriction on import, such as quantity restrictions or customs duties. The support of export makes the situation more difficult for local farmers and import restrictions could lead to retaliatory action. The last used method is a possibility of buying out of the overflowing quantity of agricultural products and its either destruction or selling these under price. In EU discussions about complex reform of CAP and the way of its financing are constantly in progress. Quality of products and support of rural country are the priorities of this complex reform. According to Author, the regulation of agricultural industry is necessary in European context, but in another way that is performed under CAP. The regulation is not necessary just because of the fact, that {{agriculture is}} a specific sphere of business, but more likely because of the need to control cheap, low-quality and dangerous products, as well as maintaining reasonable balance of migration of people from rural country towards towns. The approach of EU to market intervention is shown by the Author specifically on the market of agricultural commodities in EU and CR. According {{to the fact that the}} legislation relating to this topic is very wide, the Author used specific example of the butter market and examined the interventions on this market in detail. Market prices of butter and <b>intervention</b> <b>purchases</b> in EU countries were cross-examined. For this comparison the price levels from years 2005, 2006 and 2007 were used for the EU countries using intervention tool on the butter market. As a result of this analysis the Author declares, that he did not notice any significant differences in level of intervention prices among the EU countries. This applies to new EU joining countries as well. In the Czech Republic the State Agricultural Intervention Fund (SZIF) intervenes on the agricultural market. This Fund buys agricultural overpluses and tries to sell these commodities at highest price possible. Loss from intervention operations is estimated to be several billion Czech crowns per year. In 2005 SZIF accepted 26 offers from three economic operators and bought altogether 795, 1 tons of butter. This number refers to the quantity after deduction of returned butter. The value of butter kept by the SZIF was 69, 335, 000 CZK including VAT. In 2006, as in 2005, buy-outs of butter were initialised by Commission as late as at the beginning of April. Again, this was caused by the fact, that the market price was by 7 % higher, in comparison to new intervention price. Between 3 rd April and 15 th June the SZIF accepted 31 offers from four economic operators and bought altogether 1, 164. 2 tons of butter. Total value of butter was 157, 475, 000 CZK including VAT (69, 335, 000 CZK from year 2005 and 88, 140, 000 CZK relating to 2006). In 2007 and 2008 almost no butter was purchased because of the high global market price. An important conclusion can be made in relation to result of intervention tools and its impact on consumers, producing subjects and milk processing companies. Situation on the Common EU market is dependent on successful handling of agricultural overpluses, which means dependency on global prices of milk commodities and actual foreign exchange rates (USD/EUR/CZK). And what is a most important; main beneficiary from <b>intervention</b> <b>purchases</b> is the processing industry, to which this support is not primarily addressed. <b>Intervention</b> <b>purchases</b> have nearly no impact on income of commodity first-producers as well as on the consumer prices. Liberalisation of the world trade is another area analysed in this Thesis. Liberalisation does not have to mean necessarily reduction of agricultural production, especially not in territories favourable for agriculture. It is probable, that together with increasing financial solvency of poor countries, demand for agricultural product, backed by ability to pay, will grow in these regions. These countries will not be able to satisfy this demand themselves also because of the fact, that high quantities of local agricultural production is exported. As a result, liberalisation of the world agricultural trade could help both developed and developing countries. Nowadays, within the WTO agreements, agricultural products from more than 40 least developed countries are allowed to enter European market duty free and no real threat to the Common market was noticed. Furthermore, there exists a system of non-duty licences towards third countries that results in non-European agricultural product entering European Common Market. The fact is that export of the EU agricultural production is deteriorating due to the decreasing subsidies, which is in contrast to slightly increasing import of agricultural products from non-EU countries. Sadly, this is caused also by overdeveloped bureaucratic network in EU, which is increasing the price and making EU products less competitive. According to the Author, production and consumption of cheese will grow according to changing food habits, but in future the Author expects a decrease in demand for butter and low-fat milk and these products will be relatively more exported thanks to the generally increasing world demand for these products. The production of milk will not change significantly; the number of milking cows is expected to decrease slightly and the utilisation should slightly increase. In medium-term conditions, the Author expects the generally decreased demand for milk and butter should be followed by an increased demand for milk products with higher added value...|$|R

This paper reviews the policies and events which have driven this process and identifies how the regulatory/market-based approaches {{have resulted in a}} status quo situation, to the detriment of achieving sustainable water use. We suggest that both historical approaches offer less reform value, and that appropriate market intervention is warranted. However, entitlement water purchasing alone may limit provision of wet water to key environmental sites during critical periods and perpetuate a continuation of the status quo arrangements. A suggested expansion of the water purchasing programme is therefore provided...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present {{evidence}} that neither large differences in inflation nor long time periods {{are necessary for}} a finding favorable to purchasing power parity. Evidence from cointegrating regressions and tests of the real exchange rate indicate that purchasing power parity held as a long-run constraint between the United States and Canada for the period 1950 : 10 to 1961 : 5. The authors also find that government <b>intervention</b> can distort <b>purchasing</b> power parity over a finite period.

30|$|Second, Long-Distance <b>Intervention</b> (LDI) Player <b>purchasing</b> game props can be {{affected}} by events occurred long ago. For example, prop k is compounded by prop i and j with 50 points of “spar”, and only can be possessed by character of “priest”, i.e., there is an equipment upgrade tree for prop k. Any disturbances on even leaf nodes of the upgrade tree will affect the composition of prop k. Therefore, players have to make efforts to guarantee the possessions of prop i and j all the time, after they obtain both props. Otherwise, they need to buy prop k directly to avoid repetitive game tasks. Obviously, the problem induced by long-distance intervention makes props related to each other, and existing methods may be inappropriate for this recommendation task.|$|R
40|$|Background: WHO {{estimates}} that only 3 % of fever patients use recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), partly reflecting their high {{prices in the}} retail sector from where many patients seek treatment. To overcome this challenge, a global ACT subsidy has been proposed. We tested this proposal through a pilot program in rural Tanzania. Methods/Principal Findings: Three districts were assigned to serve either as a control or to receive the subsidy plus a package of supporting interventions. From October 2007, ACTs were sold at a 90 % subsidy through the normal private supply chain to intervention district drug shops. Data were collected at baseline and during intervention using interviews with drug shop customers, retail audits, mystery shoppers, and audits of public and NGO facilities. The proportion of consumers in the <b>intervention</b> districts <b>purchasing</b> ACTs rose from 1 % at baseline to 44. 2 % one year later (p, 0. 001), and was significantly higher among consumers purchasing for children under 5 than for adults (p = 0. 005). No change in ACT usage was observed in the control district. Consumers paid a mean price of $ 0. 58 for ACTs, which {{did not differ significantly}} from the price paid for sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, the most common alternative.

40|$|The central {{concept of}} the Russian agro-industrial {{production}} stabilization programme {{is a combination of}} market relations with government protectionist policy. The results achieved in the course of agrarian reforms in Russian regions indicate that there have been provided important legal and organizational conditions for successful functioning of multi-layer agriculture and formation of land market. However, as the paper shows, the agrarian reform still fails to bring about any growth in production. The present situation is such that if the current trends in AIC remain the downswing in production may make another 15 % in the nearest years. This requires immediate measures to be taken in order to increase food supply and protect the domestic commodity producers. For the purpose of planning a strategy of further reforms in AIC there have been identified the basic factors of stabilization of regional food markets. The paper contains the results of correlation-regression analysis and the typology of Russian regions based on the evaluation of the factors that govern the food demand and supply and the complex indicator of the level and structure of nourishment. It is shown that if the Russian food market is localized within the bounds of individual regions then the principal factors restraining food consumption are the low level of quality ecologically pure products. The paper also contains suggestions associated with improvement of the taxation system in part it is applied to agricultural commodity producers. principal factors restraining food consumption are the low level of development of the agrarian sector in the region and the insufficient provision of the local processing enterprises with raw agricultural produce. It is proven that the regional agrarian policy must pay due respect for the specific natural and climatic features {{as well as for the}} resource potential of the region. Along with this it is clear that food self-provision of regions must not in any way neutralize the production specialization and hamper the development of inter-regional ties. The research shows that the existing underdeveloped market environment is the cause for the low effectiveness of market means of regulation like interest rates and tax privileges. The application of direct economic instruments of regulation such as compensations for the agricultural producers' expenses, <b>intervention</b> <b>purchases,</b> subsidies and budget allocations for realization of investment programmes seems more reasonable in this situation. It is important that the agricultural commodity producers be supported selectively, the most effective ones having the priority. The authors outline some fundamental principles of a flexible price mechanism. The latter allows for the prices adjusted on federal and regional levels, pledge and target prices and price differentials for high quality ecologically pure products. The paper also contains suggestions associated with improvement of the taxation system in part it is applied to agricultural commodity producers. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{interventions in}} the Brazilian spot {{foreign exchange market}} from 1999 to 2008 and their effects on the R$/US$ exchange rate, using an event study approach. It aims to verify if the foreign exchange interventions have any {{significant impact on the}} exchange rate behavior. The period was divided according to a MS-VAR model and analyzed with different criterions. The results indicate that prolonged foreign exchange intervention have a greater effect on the exchange rate behavior, in comparison to short time intervention episodes. The results also point to the existence of quickly dissipating effects on the rate behavior. The creation of a new criterion, based on the analysis of exchange-rate acceleration, shows that the exchange rate is mainly prone to accelerate on leaning with the wind <b>purchase</b> <b>intervention</b> episodes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of indoor, three-stone fire pits in resource–poor {{countries}} {{is a substantial}} burden on {{human health and the}} environment. We conducted a pilot <b>intervention</b> promoting the <b>purchase</b> and use of an improved cookstove in rural Kenya. The goals of this qualitative inquiry were to understand the motivation to purchase and use; perceived benefits and challenges of cookstove use; and the most influential promotion activities for scaling up future cookstove promotion. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 10 cookstove promoters and 30 cookstove purchasers in the Luo community. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were transcribed and a thematic analysis conducted. Women reported the need for less firewood, fuel cost savings, reduced smoke, improved cooking efficiency, reduced eye irritation, lung congestion and coughing as major benefits of the cookstove. Cost appeared to be a barrier to wider adoption. The most persuasiv...|$|R

Both the event study methodology, extended with official interest rate moves, {{and a variety of}} GARCH models reveal that central bank <b>interventions,</b> especially koruna <b>purchases,</b> seem to have been relatively ineffective from 1997 to mid- 1998 compared {{to the size of the}} interventions. From mid- 1998 to 2002, however, koruna sales turn out to be effective in smoothing the path of the exchange rate up to 60 days. Nevertheless, the event study approach indicates that the success of FX interventions may be intimately related to the coordination of intervention and interest rate policies.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} the built {{environment}} on diet (and ensuing health outcomes) is less understood than the effect of diet on obesity. Natural experiments are increasingly advocated in place of cross-sectional studies unable to suggest causality. The central research question of this paper, therefore, asks whether a neighborhood-level food retail intervention will affect dietary habits or food security. The intervention {{did not have a}} significant impact on fruit and vegetable consumption, and the <b>intervention</b> population actually <b>purchased</b> prepared meals more frequently. More problematic, only 8 % of respondents overall regularly consumed enough fruits and vegetables, and 34 % were food insecure. Further complicating this public health issue, the new grocery store closed after 17 months of operation. Results indicate that geographic access to food is only one element of malnutrition, and that multi-pronged dietary interventions may be more effective. The economic failure of the store also suggests the importance of non-retail interventions to combat malnutrition...|$|R
