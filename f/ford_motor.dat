5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run.

5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry.

Around that time, the <b>Ford</b> <b>Motor</b> Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
