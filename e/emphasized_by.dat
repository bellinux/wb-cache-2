Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch.

This characterization is <b>emphasized</b> <b>by</b> her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E

5|$|Gyula Kristó {{and many}} other historians refute Porphyrogenitus's report of the {{omission}} of Álmos in favor of his son, saying that the turul legend connected to Álmos's birth proves his role as forefather of his dynasty. These historians say that the emperor's account {{is based on a}} report by one of Árpád's descendants named Termacsu, who <b>emphasized</b> <b>by</b> this report of Árpád's election that only those descending from Árpád were suitable to lead the Hungarians; other children of Álmos were excluded. András Róna-Tas says that Constantine Porphyrogenitus preserved the memory of a coup d'état organized against Levedi kende by Álmos gyula, who had his own son Árpád elected as sacred ruler in his opponent's place. A late 9th-century Central Asian scholar, Abu Abdallah al-Jayhaniwhose works were partially preserved in Ibn Rusta's and other Muslim authors' booksmentions the existence of these two high offices among the Hungarians. He describes the kende as the Hungarians' sacred ruler and the gyula as their military commander. Historians still debate which of the two offices was held by Álmos.|$|E

5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the ceiling with large-scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist intent is <b>emphasized</b> <b>by</b> the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E
5|$|II. Adagio in A-flat major, A–B–A–B–A form. Nostalgic in its {{traditional}} classical character (one {{of the few}} instrumental adagios Schubert wrote), the opening theme of this movement is an elegant, touching melody that eventually undergoes remarkable tonal and cadential treatment, undermining the peaceful setting. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} the voice-leading of the first phrase, 1–7–1–2–3–4–3, is based on the initial A-flat digression {{in the beginning of the}} Allegro. The unorthodox, chromatic harmonic structure of this movement is generated from a short progression that appears towards the end of the A section, leading to a plagal cadence in the subdominant key (D-flat), chromatically colored with its own minor subdominant chord (G-flat minor). The importance of this progression and of D-flat in general is <b>emphasized</b> <b>by</b> its quotation in a climax of the finale's exposition. This diversion of the main theme's expected cadence leads to the haunted atmosphere of the B section, which is full of chromatic modulations and startling sforzandos. In the second appearance of the A and B sections, almost the entire music is shifted a semitone up, further cementing the importance of the ascending minor 2nd in the sonata as a whole. The focal plagal progression returns transformed at the end of the movement, with even subtler chromatic coloration and more distant modulations, touching on C major, before the piece finally ends in the tonic, the theme now weakened and given an illusory quality due to the evasion of cadences, free modulation, and tendency toward digression into troubled minor passages.|$|E
