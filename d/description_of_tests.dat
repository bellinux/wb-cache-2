50|$|As {{long as the}} ATE {{manufacturer}} provides {{with the}} test program generator that can use UTSL as an input the cumbersome task of translating a test program from one platform to another can be significantly simplified. In other words, the task of rewriting of the test programs for a specific platform can {{be replaced by the}} automatically generating the code from the UTSL based test specification. Prerequisite for this is that the UTSL <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> is sufficiently detailed with definition of the test technique as well as the description of all the necessary inputs and outputs.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{complexity}} of ASICs lead to requirements of more complex test programs with longer development times. An automated test program generation could simplify and speed up this process. Teradyne Inc. together with Robert Bosch GmbH agreed to developed a concept and a tool chain for an automated test-program generation. To achieve this a tester independent programming language was required. Hence, UTSL, {{a programming language}} that enables detailed <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> that can be translated into the ATE specific programming language was developed. The ATE manufacturers need to provide a Test Program Generator that uses the UTSL test description as inputs and generates the ATE-specific test code with optimal resource mapping and better practice program code.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the main features}} of a Monte Carlo approach to calculate safety factors {{to be used in}} the analysis of Printed Circuit Boards subjected to random vibrations. This approach is justified on the basis of experimental results that are also briefly presented in the paper together with some tests carried out to quantify appropriate thresholds for the failure parameters. Various approximations based on the "smearing" of the electronic components properties on the PCB are considered, and the accuracies of the various simplifications are then quantified. This allows the determination of safety factors that can be applied to compensate for the mathematical model inaccuracy. The manufacturing variability and uncertainties in the parameters influencing the structural response are also investigated experimentally. The paper is concluded with a brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> carried out to quantify the components capability to withstand the underlying board curvature. © 2008 by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to predict daily number of firefighter {{incidents in the}} Central Bohemia Region and in the Region of Hradec Králové to improve firefighter shift planning. The analysis {{is based on a}} dataset of firefighter incidents from the period between the years 2008 and 2012. Econometric models, capturing yearly and weekly patterns and weather impact were estimated and used for long-term prediction. The first part of the thesis provides a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> applied to residuals and other econometric tests used in this study. Then linear regression is applied to model weather impact and effects of days of week and months of year. In the next part regression with AR errors, (S) ARMA models and regression with (S) ARMA errors are estimated. All these models are compared according to properties of residuals and out-of-sample mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The most accurate models predict daily number of incidents two months ahead with MAPE slightly above 20 % which is considerably better than the benchmark Holt-Winters method. Regression models with (S) ARMA errors produce relatively accurate long-term forecasts and its error terms are uncorrelated. Therefore, they can be considered suitable for long-term prediction of firefighter incidents...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly {{disabled}} and elderly people with mobility problems {{want to live}} autonomously in their home environment. They are motivated to use robotic aids to perform tasks by themselves, avoiding permanent nurse or family assistant supervision. They must find means to rehabilitate their abilities to perform daily life activities (DLAs), such as eating, shaving, or drinking. These means may be provided by robotic aids that incorporate possibilities and methods to accomplish common tasks, aiding the user in recovery of partial or complete autonomy. Results are highly conditioned by the system's usability and potential. The developed portable assistive robot ASIBOT helps users perform most of these tasks in common living environments. Minimum adaptations are needed to provide the robot with mobility throughout the environment. The robot can autonomously climb from one surface to another, fixing itself to {{the best place to}} perform each task.
