40|$|DE 102009022725 A 1 UPAB: 20101213 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} partial overflowing of {{a carrier}} structure by a low viscous, linked material, particularly by polyurethane. The linking material is fully cured and a {{photo voltaic cell}} is applied on the overflowed carrier structure. Contact lines are connected with the assigned <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> <b>points</b> by producing an <b>electrical</b> conductive <b>connection.</b> The upper side of the photo voltaic cell is overflowed and the linked, translucent material is partially hardened. USE - Method for producing a solar module. ADVANTAGE - The linking material is fully cured and a photo voltaic cell is applied on the overflowed carrier structure and contact lines are connected with the assigned <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> <b>points</b> by producing an <b>electrical</b> conductive <b>connection,</b> and hence ensure production of efficient and durable solar modules...|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Enigma consisted of a keyboard connected to a battery and a current entry plate or wheel (German: Eintrittswalze), at the right hand end of the scrambler (usually via a plugboard in the military versions). This contained a set of 26 contacts that made <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> with the set of 26 spring-loaded pins on the right hand rotor. The internal wiring of the core of each rotor provided an electrical pathway from the pins on one side to different <b>connection</b> <b>points</b> on the other. The left hand side of each rotor made <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> with the rotor to its left. The leftmost rotor then made contact with the reflector (German: Umkehrwalze). The reflector provided a set of thirteen paired connections to return the current back through the scrambler rotors, and eventually to the lampboard where a lamp under a letter was illuminated.|$|R
50|$|Most metals (with a few exceptions, such as gold) oxidize freely {{when exposed}} to air. Aluminium oxide is not an {{electrical}} conductor, but rather an electrical insulator. Consequently, the flow of electrons through the oxide layer can be greatly impeded. However, since the oxide layer {{is only a few}} nanometers thick, the added resistance is not noticeable under most conditions. When aluminum wire is terminated properly, the mechanical connection breaks the thin, brittle layer of oxide to form an excellent <b>electrical</b> <b>connection.</b> Unless this connection is loosened, there is no way for oxygen to penetrate the <b>connection</b> <b>point</b> to form further oxide.|$|R
40|$|DE 102006059411 A 1 UPAB: 20080715 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{providing an}} optical transparent plate (10) with lateral dimensions {{larger than a}} sensor chip (17), and establishing an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> between an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> elements of the optical transparent plate and an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> elements of the sensor chip.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an optical sensor for mounting on a carrier substrate, which has an optical sensor chip with an optical sensitive surface. USE - Method for producing an optical sensor for mounting on a carrier substrate. ADVANTAGE - The method involves establishing an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> between an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> elements of the optical transparent plate and an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> elements of the sensor chip, and hence enables to produce an optical sensor in economical manner with flat design...|$|R
