40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A suite of models were integrated to predict the potential of a large liquid <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> fire escalating and involving neighbouring tanks, {{as a result of}} thermal loading. A steady state pool fire radiant heat model was combined with a further model, in order to predict the distribution of thermal loading over the surface of an adjacent tank, and another model was incorporated to predict the thermal response of the contents of the adjacent tank. In order to predict if, or when, an adjacent tank will ignite, the radiant heat from the fire received by the adjacent tank must be quantified. There are a range of mathematical models available in the literature to calculate the radiant heat flux to a specified target and each of these models is based on assumptions about the fire. The performance of three of these models, which vary in complication, was analysed (the single point source model, the solid flame model and the fire dynamics simulator computational fluid dynamics model) and, {{in order to determine the}} performance of each model, the predictions made by each of the models were compared with actual experimental measurements of radiant heat flux. Experiments were undertaken involving different liquid fuels and under a range of weather conditions and, upon comparing the predictions of the models with the experimental measurements, the solid flame model was found to be the one most appropriate for safety assessment work. Thus, the solid flame model was incorporated into the thermal loading model, in order to predict the distribution of radiant heat flux falling onto an adjacent tank wall and roof. A model was developed to predict the thermal response of the contents of an adjacent tank, in order to predict variations in the liquid and vapour temperature, any increase in the vapour space pressure and the evolution of the vapours within the given time and the distribution of thermal loading over the surface of the tank as predicted by previous models; of particular importance was the identification of the possibility of forming a flammable vapour/air mixture outside the adjacent tank. To assess the performance of the response model, experiments were undertaken at both laboratory and field scale. The laboratory experiments were conducted in the Chemical Engineering Laboratory at Loughborough University and required the design and construction of an experimental facility representing a small-scale storage tank exposed to an adjacent fire. The field scale experiments were undertaken at Centro Jovellanos, Asturias, Spain. An experimental vessel was designed and fabricated specifically to conduct the laboratory tests and to measure the response of a tank containing hydrocarbon liquids to an external heat load. The vessel was instrumented with a network of thermocouples and pressure transmitter and gauge, in order to monitor the internal pressure and distribution in temperature throughout the liquid and its variation with time. The model predicting the thermal response of an adjacent tank was shown to produce predictions that correlated with the experimental results, particularly in terms of the vapour space pressure and liquid surface temperature. The vapour space pressure is important in predicting the time when the vacuum/pressure valve opens, while the liquid surface temperature is important as it governs the rate of evaporation. Combining the three models (the Pool Fire model, the Thermal Loading model and the Response model) forms the basis of the storage tanks spacing international codes and presents a number of innovative features, in terms of assessing the response to an adjacent tank fire: such features include predicting the distribution of thermal load on tanks adjacent to the tank on fire and thermal load on the ground. These models can predict the time required for the opening of the pressure vacuum relief valve on adjacent tanks and the release of the flammable vapour/air mixture into the atmosphere. A wide range of design and fire protection alternatives, such as the water cooling system and the minimum separation distance between storage tanks, can be assessed using these models. The subsequent results will help to identify any recommended improvements in the design of facilities and management systems (inspection and maintenance), in addition to the fire fighting response to such fires...|$|E
40|$|Based on the API 650 Standard, {{there are}} four types of raft {{foundations}} for liquefied <b>hydrocarbons</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> Since soil is the only material used in constructing foundation types B. 4. 1 and B. 4. 3, we can advance the process through further research to identify their behavior and technical/engineering characteristics. Because settlement is a fundamental problem in foundation design, studying its affecting parameters and estimation approaches are quite important. A {{study was conducted in}} South Pars region (Iran) focusing on type B. 4. 3 foundation, and its settlements were predicted after performing hydro-Tests. The general soil profile of the foundation bed was also recorded through some boreholes and crosshole test and some laboratory tests. For settlement estimations on granular soils, we used Schmertmann equation which {{is a function of the}} strain influence factor; the values proposed by some researchers for this factor yield conservative values for the settlement of the above <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> In this research, Schmertmann equation was rewritten with the proposed strain influence factor (a function of shear wave velocity) and the amount of settlements of the <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> were estimated. Results indicate that, compared with relations presented by other researchers, the proposed relation estimates settlements with highly acceptable precision...|$|R

40|$|Two {{quantitative}} retrieval {{techniques were}} evaluated to estimate methane (CH 4) enhancement in concentrated plumes using high spatial and moderate spectral resolution {{data from the}} Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). An Iterative Maximum a Posteriori Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) algorithm performed well for an ocean scene containing natural CH 4 emissions from the Coal Oil Point (COP) seep field near Santa Barbara, California. IMAP-DOAS retrieval precision errors are expected to equal between 0. 31 to 0. 61 ppm CH 4 over the lowest atmospheric layer (height up to 1. 04 km), corresponding to about a 30 to 60 ppm error for a 10 m thick plume. However, IMAP-DOAS results for a terrestrial scene were adveresly influenced by the underlying landcover. A hybrid approach using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was particularly effective for terrestrial surfaces because it could better account for spectral variability in surface reflectance. Using this approach, a CH 4 plume was observed immediately downwind of two <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> at the Inglewood Oil Field in Los Angeles, California, with a maximum near surface enhancement of 8. 45 ppm above background. At COP, the distinct plume had a maximum enhancement of 2. 85 ppm CH 4 above background and was consistent with known seep locations and local wind direction. A sensitivity analysis also indicates CH 4 sensitivity should be more than doubled {{for the next generation}} AVIRIS sensor (AVIRISng) due to improved spectral resolution and sampling. AVIRIS-like sensors offer the potential to better constrain emissions on local and regional scales, including sources of increasing concern like industrial point source emissions and fugitive CH 4 from the oil and gas industry...|$|R
40|$|The Geophex GEM- 2 {{electromagnetic}} (EM) instrument {{provides a}} rapid multifrequency technique for shallow geophysical exploration. Survey applications include; ground contamination, hydrogeology, groundwater contamination mapping and archaeological investigations. This highly portable hand-held instrument, when linked with active GPS tracking provides typical 1. 5 ground point spacing and allows a surveyor to collect around 20, 000 data points per hour over five frequencies. GEM- 2 uses an active EM signal to detect variations in subsurface conductivity. EM currents {{result in a}} secondary magnetic field that is measured together with the original transmitted signal, using a receiver coil on the EM instrument. The depth of ground penetration attained is dependent {{on a number of}} factors, and the most significant is the ground conductivity and the chosen EM wave frequencies. Typically five wave frequencies are used in the surveys; 825 Hz, 7075 Hz, 16075 Hz, 31025 Hz and 40075 Hz. This paper presented the results from the investigation at Barry Docks site undergoing redevelopment from a 50 year old oil terminal into future residential use. Typically, polluting contaminants will increase the electrical conductivity of the ground materials and ground water. However measured ground conductivity values actually depend upon the types of hydrocarbon present. Some pure hydrocarbons are electrically resistive but their conductivity values may also increase through time due to biodegradation over many years. This research programme carries out detailed GEM- 2 surveys in conjunction with chemical sampling to investigate this conductivity and ground chemistry relationship on the first layer of the GEM- 2 data. The study shows that the high conductivity zones correspond to the location of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> although there is a tank response showing no such signal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrocarbon</b> bulk <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> {{fires are}} not very common, but their {{protection}} is essential due to severe consequences of such fires. Water spray cooling system {{is one of the}} most effective ways to reduce damages to a tank from a fire. Many codes and standards set requirements and recommendations to maximize the efficiency of water spray cooling systems, but these are widely different and still various interpretations and methods are employed to design such systems. This article provides a brief introduction to some possible design methods of cooling systems for protection of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> against external non-contacting fires and introduces a new method namely “Linear Density Method” and compares the results from this method to the “Average Method” which is currently in common practice. The average Method determines the flow rate for each spray nozzle by dividing the total water demand by the number of spray nozzles while the Linear Density Method determines the nozzle flow rate based on the actual flow over the surface to be protected. The configuration of the system includes a one million barrel crude oil floating roof tank to be protected and which is placed one half tank diameter from a similar adjacent tank with a full surface fire. Thermal radiation and hydraulics are modeled using DNV PHAST Version 6. 53 and Sunrise PIPENET Version 1. 5. 0. 2722 software respectively. Spray nozzles used in design are manufactured by Angus Fire and PNR Nozzles companies. Schedule 40 carbon steel pipe is used for piping. The results show that the cooling system using the Linear Density Method consumes 3. 55 % more water than the design using the average method assuming a uniform application rate of 4. 1 liters per minute. Despite higher water consumption the design based on Linear Density Method alleviates the problems associated with the Average Method and provides better protection...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of how optimal weight savings of the cylindrical shell plates in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> can be reached using higher strength duplex material. The design criteria will be based on the requirements given by the American Petroleum Institute standards API 650 for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and API 12 B for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The expected result is that use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel can reduce the weight of the material needed to build a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> A comparison between welded and bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will also be included in the work to find which joining method that is preferable. Additionally, an evaluation of the software TANKTM by Intergraph will be performed. Matlab® will be used in order to perform the evaluation to compare the results. The main difference between the standards API 650 and API 12 B is that there are already given standard sizes of bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> API 12 B. Therefore, only <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 1   625 m 3 could be compared. When comparing <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> sizes up to 1   625 m 3 the result is that bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> require a smaller mean thickness of the cylindrical shell than welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and therefore less material and total weight of the shell. If the trend continues also for larger <b>tank</b> sizes, bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will be preferable to reduce the total weight of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> By use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> the minimum required thickness can be reduced because of the higher strength of duplex stainless steel. This leads to a smaller mean shell thickness and therefore a reduced weight compared to <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. For most dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> duplex stainless steel is cheaper than austenitic stainless steel, but for some smaller dimensions, grade 1. 4307 (austenitic) is cheaper than LDX 2101 ® (duplex). Instability calculations have been performed for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> while no instability calculations have been performed for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> With the wind speed 190 km/h (proposed by API 650), the welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> need to have wind girders to stiffen the cylindrical shell and in some cases also be anchored to the ground. Anchor is not required for large dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The evaluation of TANKTM showed that most parameters agreed to the computed value of the same parameters in Matlab®. Why a few parameters not agrees is not fully known, therefore better explanations of the parameters used in the equations in API 650 would be preferable. To see the difference between Matlab® and TANKTM it would also be of interest to see how the calculations are performed in TANKTM, as only the results and inputs are printed at the moment...|$|R
