5|$|Schulze Baking Company Plant is a <b>factory</b> <b>building</b> {{located on}} the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is located at 40 East Garfield Boulevard (also {{described}} as 55th Street and Wabash Avenue) in the Washington Park community area in Cook County. Built in 1914, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1982. Originally built for the Schulze Baking Company, it was {{the home of the}} Hostess Brands' Butternut Bread until 2004.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} used for daylight ground attack missions during the Battle of Moscow, but this {{proved to be}} costly since the aircraft was unarmored. Armor and additional guns were retrofitted to the existing aircraft {{to make it more}} effective, but the evacuation of the sole <b>factory</b> <b>building</b> the Pe-3 in October 1941 limited the number of aircraft available and many units of the Soviet Air Forces flying the Pe-3 were either disbanded or converted to other aircraft. Although production was stopped and restarted several times, the aircraft remained in service throughout World War II. Most of the later production runs were given to reconnaissance units.|$|E
5|$|Today's {{economic}} {{position is}} very different from the 1950s, when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30% of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75% of manufacturing jobs were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the carriage works (known as Asea Brown Boveri or ABB at the time of closure), which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people but closed in the mid-1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestlé York (formerly Nestlé Rowntrees) and home to the KitKat and eponymous Yorkie bar chocolate brands. Terry's chocolate factory, makers of the Chocolate Orange, was located in the city; but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland. The historic <b>factory</b> <b>building</b> is situated next to the Knavesmire racecourse.|$|E

25|$|When {{natural erosion}} or human mining makes the ground {{too weak to}} support the {{structures}} built on it, the ground can collapse and produce a sinkhole. For example, the 2010 Guatemala City sinkhole which killed fifteen people was caused when heavy rain from Tropical Storm Agatha, diverted by leaking pipes into a pumice bedrock, led to the sudden collapse of the ground beneath a <b>factory</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wartime and postwar {{prosperity}} brought development, {{and designs}} commissioned from {{nationally and internationally}} known architects. For instance, Walter Gropius, {{a leader of the}} German Bauhaus movement in the United States, designed a <b>factory</b> <b>building</b> in the city in 1944. Greensboro-based Ed Loewenstein designed projects throughout the region. Eduardo Catalano and George Matsumoto were hired for projects whose designs have challenged North Carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms.|$|E

The UB Regional Institute, Center on Rehabilitation Synergy, and a number of pre-K-16 initiatives related to UB's civic engagement mission, such as the UB-Buffalo Public Schools Partnership office, are set to relocate to the first site. The latter location has been purchased to house additional biomedical- and life science-related businesses connected to the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus.|$|E
25|$|Today, several {{projects}} {{aiming to}} revitalize the town are underway. The Willimantic Whitewater Partnership plans to reclaim the town's riverfront by developing a whitewater park and research facility. Some of the town's distressed <b>factory</b> <b>buildings</b> have been turned into residential space for artists by Artspace. Efforts to attract high-tech businesses to the area have turned other former <b>factory</b> <b>buildings</b> into space for small technology startups.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the buildings on the original factory site were demolished {{during the summer of}} 2008. Although these <b>factory</b> <b>buildings</b> were in the conservation area of the village, none of them were listed for conservation, although the developer agreed to retain the original 1926 factory and the Power House building, which originally generated electricity for the village. These <b>factory</b> <b>buildings,</b> which originally formed part of the intrinsic character of the village and an integral part of its raison d'etre - as a village in which to live and work, in Crittall's original concept - have thus now been lost. Most of the remaining <b>factory</b> <b>buildings</b> have been unused for some while.|$|R
