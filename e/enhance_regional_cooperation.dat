The main impact of this financial distress has fallen on local infrastructure and the magnitude of the problem is now so large that only massive injections of funds from higher levels of government can resolve the problem. However, some scope also exists for local councils to improve the efficiency of their operations. While structural reform in the guise of amalgamation has largely failed to generate efficiency gains, all state-based and national inquiries into local government saw significant potential in shared service models. This paper seeks to augment the existing embryonic literature on alternative models of local government suited to Australian circumstances by proposing a new two-tier model of local governance that can <b>enhance</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> between local councils.

Owing to the {{remarkable}} biodiversity, the three countries came together to <b>enhance</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in conservation and development in 2012. To start a strategic conservation intervention, the status of our knowledge base on biodiversity of the landscape is the most important stepping stone. In this paper, we traced the history of biodiversity research in the Kangchenjunga landscape, and present the research trends over time and subject interests. Meanwhile, we also identified key research and knowledge gaps and future priorities. For this, we analyzed 500 peer-reviewed journal articles (until 2014) relating to biodiversity, which were retrieved from the web platform ‘Google Scholar’ and other peer-reviewed journals. The review showed that the landscape received attention from the scientific community as early as the 1840 s, and grew progressively after the 1980 s. Research on fauna (especially mammals) and flora (especially angiosperms) is most notable, but with major gaps in systematic research of their ecology, whereas invertebrates other than butterflies appear to be neglected. There is a need for systematic research with long-term monitoring that would allow us to understand changes occurring within the landscape...|$|E

This qualitative mapping looks at science initiatives that aimed to <b>enhance</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> both in the BSR itself and between those countries and the EU. There has been widespread commitment and willingness from the EU and the BSR to involve in science cooperation projects, and the projects under FP 6, FP 7 and H 2020 did not face acceptance issues from national or regional leaders. However, implementation of the envisaged objectives and Action Plans has been quite often lacking or incomplete due to capacity issues or weak political commitment. Much {{more needs to be}} done in this area if the EU and the BS countries want to reach the full potential of the H 2020 projects. On the other hand, a broader political framework that shows a clear vision of the EU towards the BSR is lacking, as the Black Sea Synergy (BSS) has been inactive and the Eastern Partnership has been gaining more momentum and thus overshadowed the BSS. Moreover, political tensions in the BSR will push the EU to opt for a more careful approach towards the region, where either all stakeholders will have to be better involved, or some stakeholders should be left out to ensure a better functioning of future projects...|$|E

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing {{is a product of}} overfishing and affects all marine fisheries. Southern Ocean fisheries have been particularly targeted by IUU fishing. The efforts of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Commission and the Australian government to adopt complementary measures to deter IUU fishing in the Southern Ocean form the basis of this study, although the examination is conducted following a comprehensive review of the legal and other factors contributing to the development of IUU fishing as well as the applicable international law. The author concludes that in the absence of flag State control, alternative measures and strategies have proved to be effective in influencing the behaviour of IUU fishing vessels. By improving coastal State surveillance, <b>enhancing</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> imposing port and market State controls, establishing IUU vessel databases and vigorously prosecuting offenders, Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and coastal States can jointly increase the risk of conducting IUU fishing activities. At the same time financial returns can be diminished so that engaging in IUU fishing becomes economically unattractive. It is concluded that the application of a combination of these measures is required in order to achieve a degree of success in deterring IUU operators...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, Southeast Asian economies have prospered {{through an}} outward-oriented strategy, through intra-regional {{integration}} under the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) initiative and through {{participating in the}} East Asian production networks. In the 1970 - 804 s, South Asia stagnated due to its inward-oriented growth strategy and lack of infrastructure connectivity-resulting in low trade integration and regional connectivity within the region and with Southeast and East Asia. However, since 1991, South Asia, particularly India has adopted a Look East policy and opened its market raising huge potential for economic integration between South and Southeast Asia leading to peace, prosperity and stability of these two regions.

40|$|The {{concern for}} <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and {{integration}} in Africa predates independence. The period 1960 - 1980, however, witnessed {{the emergence of}} the major regional integration schemes that pushed forward the Continent’s economic integration agenda. Post-independence regional economic integration and cooperation efforts resulted in a variety of initiatives with overlapping membership and mandates, making Africa the region with the highest density of economic integration and cooperation arrangements. Yet, these arrangements failed to impact positively on the Continent’s economic performance. Inadequate political will and commitment to the process; high incidence of conflicts and political instability; poor design and sequencing of regional integration arrangements; multiplicity of the schemes; inadequacy of funding; and exclusion of key stakeholders from the regional integration process are factors accounting for the ineffectiveness. Despite Africa’s unsatisfactory track record in regional integration over the decades, the case for cooperation and integration has become much stronger in recent years, {{due to the fact that}} the continent is facing a number of major challenges, notably globalization and the changing global economic and political environments, to which enhanced cooperation and integration constitute an appropriate response.

Despite of the individual approach towards states in the Western Balkan region and the EU’s advocacy, the relations between European Union and Western Balkans will probably remain characterized by a more regional approach, in terms of commonly used models of accession and applying the same criteria and assessing achievements. The EU major initiatives show that this restructuring will not end with full membership, but will remain an open-ended process.

40|$|To promote {{regional}} or mutual improvement, numerous interjurisdictional efforts to share tax bases have been attempted. Most {{of these efforts}} fail to be consummated. Motivations to share revenues include: narrowing fiscal disparities, <b>enhancing</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and economic development, rationalizing land-use, and minimizing revenue losses caused by competition to attract and keep businesses. Various researchers have developed theories to aid understanding of why interjurisdictional cooperation efforts succeed or fail. Walter Rosenbaum and Gladys Kammerer studied two contemporaneous Florida local-government consolidation attempts. Boyd Messinger subsequently tested their Theory of Successful Consolidation on nine consolidation attempts. Paul Peterson 2 ̆ 7 s dual theories on Modern Federalism posit that all governmental levels attempt to further economic development and that politicians act in ways that either further their futures or cement job security. Actions related to the latter theory often interfere with the former. Samuel Nunn and Mark Rosentraub sought to learn how interjurisdictional cooperation evolves. Through multiple case studies they developed a model framing interjurisdictional cooperation in four dimensions. ^ This dissertation investigates {{the ability of the}} above theories to help predict success or failure of regional tax-base revenue sharing attempts. A research plan was formed that used five sequenced steps to gather data, analyze it, and conclude if hypotheses concerning the application of these theories were valid. The primary analytical tools were: multiple case studies, cross-case analysis, and pattern matching. Data was gathered from historical records, questionnaires, and interviews. ^ The results of this research indicate that Rosenbaum-Kammerer theory can be a predictor of success or failure in implementing tax-base revenue sharing if it is amended as suggested by Messinger and further modified by a recommendation in this dissertation.

SAARC, on the other hand, has yet to take off and contribute towards the creation of a predictable and orderly regional environment. The paper identifies and explains the significant factors that have helped or hindered ASEAN and SAARC in addressing and dealing with regional conflicts...|$|R

It reviews first {{the theory and}} evidence of knowledge and growth spillovers generally and second {{the evidence in the}} African context. Given the limited and scattered evidence of actual past spillovers, it reviews recent ex ante simulations using partial and general equilibrium models to stress the potential for spillovers from greater cooperation in agricultural research, and from trade liberalization, policy harmonization and investments in infrastructure. The results show that permitting greater crossborder transfers and adopting improved technologies could have large spillover multiplier effects on overall economic welfare in the region. And simply reducing African countries’ trade barriers and improving cross-border transport could increase agricultural incomes by as much as 10 %. These two examples confirm that <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in agricultural research and harmonization and liberalization of regional trade systems are two important areas that have yet to be optimally harnessed to generate larger spillovers and <b>enhance</b> <b>regional</b> economic take-off.
