40|$|This {{grounded}} theory study describes practitioner decision-making processes regarding best interest determinations for granting children {{the power of}} assent to art interventions and the procedures used to initiate participation. Assent refers to the agreement of a minor to participate in activities, while recognizing the developmental limitations of children to render a <b>fully</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision.</b> Twelve practitioners who use art in their clinical work with children participated in direct interviews. The narrative data collected was conceptualized, categorized, and coded using a Paradigm Model. Results link the present study to Awareness Context Theory, suggesting that best interest determinations are guided by concerns not to disrupt the existing level of child's awareness to intervention and to the practitioner's role...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{look at the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s latest <b>fully</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> on {{independence}} in Canadian Pacific v. Matsqui, where native tribunals {{were found to be}} biased because of certain institutional characteristics. The authors argue that the court employs, on the one hand, a very simplified analysis of independence, but at the same time, sets standards for testing independence and bias in tribunals that are impossible to adequately quantify in practice. Neither the reasoning of Lamer C. J, nor Sopinka J. is adequate to address the full range of tribunal experience; in fact, the Supreme Court examines administrative tribunals as if they were simply smaller courts, without recognizing their inhere/If differences. Subsequent cases on this point have failed {{to take into account the}} differences in these opinions. The authors conclude by noting the complexity of issues regarding bias, such as institutional independence, and question the direction of Canadian jurisprudence in this area...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{models of}} {{surrogacy}} exist internationally, each contributing different protections to surrogacy arrangements. Commercial surrogacy arrangements can be successfully managed without necessarily resulting in exploitation of, or {{harm to the}} involved parties. It is possible for Australians to engage in Cross Border Surrogacy (CBS) {{in a manner consistent}} with Reproductive Technologies Accreditation Council guidelines and current Australian Assisted Reproductive Technology practices. All surrogacy arrangements must first and foremost be designed to protect the wellbeing and interests of the child to be born through surrogacy. Surrogacy services are inextricably linked to egg, sperm and embryo donation services. It is impossible to properly examine CBS without a concurrent examination of donor practices. Counselling professionals working in surrogacy must understand the legal, medical, logistical and emotional aspects of undertaking a surrogacy arrangement both within Australia and overseas. Fertility counsellors must have capacity to prepare IPs with current and accurate information about surrogacy in Australia and overseas, provide appropriate and unbiased counselling and support ethical and safe decision making. Regular psychosocial counselling or “checkins” provided during the surrogacy arrangement can facilitate healthy and successful relationships between IPs and surrogates, and ensure that all parties are coping with the surrogacy. IPs should be provided with sufficient opportunity to undertake a domestic surrogacy arrangement, within the Australian regulatory framework. IPs and surrogates contemplating involvement in domestic surrogacy must have access to clear and comprehensive information to enable a <b>fully</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> about the process of the arrangement. Current Australian legislative frameworks provide insufficient and inconsistent protection for the parties involved in domestic or cross border surrogacy arrangements. Legislative change is imperative for the wellbeing of IPs, surrogates and the children who will be born from surrogacy. Regulatory reform is necessary to ensure sufficient surrogates are available domestically to meet a rapidly growing demand for surrogacy arrangements. Legislative frameworks must be consistent across Australia. Medicare funding for domestic surrogacy would increase affordability. CBS is a potentially unsafe form of fertility treatment: medically, ethically, psychologically and legally. For IPs who determine that they wish to engage in a cross border arrangement, it is critical that access to impartial support and advice services is available, to examine the risks of travelling overseas for surrogacy. IPs must be given sufficient information about the various CBS options, so if they do choose to engage in a cross border arrangement, they select a country which has clear regulatory frameworks which are protective of themselves and their surrogates, and is provided within treatment practices consistent with what would be offered in Australia.  ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 107 - 111) The material {{presented in}} this thesis examines the method by which the Department of Defense manages national security. This methodology is accomplished {{through the use of}} planning, programming, budgeting, and systems analysis. Each of these phases is examined in detail. Systems analysis applications to each of these phases is also examined in detail. Before 1960, the Department of Defense was characterized by a separation between budgeting and military planning. Budgeting control and fiscal guidance were exercised by the Secretary of Defense, and planning was left to the individual armed services. Although planning extended over several years, budgeting was based on a one year projection. Furthermore, while budgeting and accounting were based on fiscal considerations, planning was not. The major problem with the old approach was the difficulty in translating military requirements into financial terms for the budget submission. When the planning, programming, budgeting system was installed in the Department of Defense, it provided a bridge between planning and budgeting. Programming was conceived to be the key element in providing this bridge. One of the purposes of bringing the planning, programming, budgeting approach to the Department of Defense was to ensure strong civilian control over military affairs. This it accomplished. A secondary purpose was to bring rationality to defense decision-making by the systematic comparison of program alternatives in terms of costs and benefits. Program elements were identified as the basic building blocks of the planning, programming, budgeting system. These program elements were categorized into major ???force programs???, which form the core of the Five Year Defense Program, and which cut across organizational lines of the individual services. Through this program, the secretary of Defense evaluates alternative defense objectives. Analysis assists by increasing the rational quality of decisions. Its greatest contribution lies in illuminating a problem; unveiling its nature, providing insights, and if necessary, pointing out the need for more information. This very explicitness makes analysis an effective device that enables all participants to understand more <b>fully</b> the <b>reasons</b> for <b>decisions...</b>|$|R

40|$|As {{primary care}} {{practitioners}} are the health professionals closest to patients' everyday lives, {{they are most}} likely to experience the impact of policies that support the patient choice agenda. The government's approach to increasing patient choice has been subject to criticism by those sceptical of its politics and by those concerned with its influence on health providers and some patient groups. A perspective missing from the debate is one informed by research on the psychology of choice. Some psychologists have argued that a seemingly inbuilt preference for choice can adversely affect the decision-making process and that presenting healthcare decisions as choices may result in less <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> making. It is important that GPs encourage patients to make <b>reasoned</b> healthcare <b>decisions</b> that are informed by an evaluation of the options rather than by a simple preference for choice.

40|$|Rationality {{is central}} to modern biomedicine: not only are doctors {{expected}} to diagnose and prescribe rationally according to evidence-based guidelines, but patients are increasingly expected to behave in rational ways in their encounters with medical practitioners. Patients are offered guidance on how to ask rational questions of their doctors, {{and how to make}} <b>reasoned</b> <b>decisions</b> about what treatment options to pursue. Here, we examine the operation of such rationalities and their ‘others’ in two kinds of clinical encounter: those around methadone maintenance treatment, and those around hormone replacement therapy. In these contrasting but related cases, we argue, clients/patients struggle to perform the kinds of rationality figured in contemporary biomedical discourses. The historical freight of non-rationality attached to the medical conditions being treated, namely ‘addiction’ and the menopause, means that clients/patients are enacted as intrinsically non-rational, which renders suspect their capacity to make the kinds of <b>reasoned</b> <b>decisions</b> that contemporary patients are expected to make. Engaging with the work of cultural studies theorist, Eve Sedgwick, we suggest that such enactments can be understood as a form of habit, produced within the complex social space of the clinical encounter. It is only through taking seriously the habits of rationality and non-rationality in which particular kinds of patients are enacted that we can begin to understand the inevitable limitations of the rationalist model of clinical encounter presented as ‘ideal’ in contemporary health discourses...|$|R
