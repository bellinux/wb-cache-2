40|$|A {{large number}} of indoor {{positioning}} systems have recently been developed to cater for various location-based services. Indoor maps are a prerequisite of such indoor positioning systems; however, indoor maps are currently non-existent for most indoor environments. Construction of an indoor map by external experts excludes quick deployment and prevents widespread utilization of indoor localization systems. Here, we propose an algorithm for the automatic construction of an <b>indoor</b> <b>floor</b> plan, together with a magnetic fingerprint map of unmapped buildings using crowdsourced smartphone data. For floor plan construction, our system combines the use of dead reckoning technology, an observation model with geomagnetic signals, and trajectory fusion based on an affinity propagation algorithm. To obtain the indoor paths, the magnetic trajectory data obtained through crowdsourcing were first clustered using dynamic time warping similarity criteria. The trajectories were inferred from odometry tracing, and those belonging to the same cluster in the magnetic trajectory domain were then fused. Fusing these data effectively eliminates the inherent tracking errors originating from noisy sensors; as a result, we obtained highly accurate indoor paths. One advantage of our system is that no additional hardware such as a laser rangefinder or wheel encoder is required. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm successfully constructs <b>indoor</b> <b>floor</b> plans with 0. 48 m accuracy, which could benefit location-based services which lack indoor maps...|$|E

Dietary data came from the French Total Diet Study, while concentrations in residential tap water, soil and <b>indoor</b> <b>floor</b> dust came from the ‘Plomb-Habitat’ nationwide representative survey on children's lead exposure at home. Indoor air concentrations were assumed to be equal to outdoor air concentrations, which were retrieved from regulatory measurements networks. Human exposure factors were retrieved from literature.

This study aims to describe lead contamination in the homes of children aged 6 months to 6 years in France (without overseas). Between October 2008 and August 2009, 484 housing units were investigated. Lead in tap water and total and leachable lead levels from floor dust, outdoor soils and paint chips were measured. X-ray fluorescence measurements were carried out on non-metallic and metallic substrates. Nationwide results are provided. The <b>indoor</b> <b>floor</b> dust lead (PbD) geometric mean (GM) was 8. 8 μg/m² (0. 8 μg/ft²) and 6. 8 μg/m² (0. 6 μg/ft²) for total and leachable lead respectively; 0. 21 % of homes had an indoor PbD loading above 430. 5 μg/m² (40 μg/ft²). The outdoor play area concentration GM was 33. 5 mg/kg and 21. 7 mg/kg in total and leachable lead respectively; 1. 4 % of concentrations were higher than or equal to 400 mg/kg. Outdoor floor PbD GM was 44. 4 μg/m² (4. 1 μg/ft²) that was approximately 3. 2 times higher than the GM of indoor PbD. Lead-based paint (LBP) was present in 25 % of dwellings, LBP on only non-metallic substrates was present in 19 % of homes and on metallic substrates in 10 % of dwellings.
