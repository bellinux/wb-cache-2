In technical terms, the Seiberg-Witten maps define canonical transformations in the antibracket that make the solutions of the master equation for the commutative and noncommutative versions coincide in their antifield-dependent terms.

30|$|The {{reason why}} Complete mode {{was able to}} produce better results can be {{explained}} by BLUiR formula (also used by AmaLgam) for determining the similarity of a bug report and a source <b>file</b> (<b>Section</b> 2.3), which involves the summation of the similarities of all pairs of bug-file parts. In Default mode, the total number of similarities to be summed is 8 —two parts from the bug report multiplied by four parts from the source code files. In Complete mode, the number of “similarities” increases to 24 (12 file parts × 2 bug parts). Similarity results are normalized before the rank of files is generated, such that file scores are always between 0 and 1. Therefore, the higher value that would result from the summation of more terms in Complete mode is unlikely to be the reason this mode produced better results. In addition, the Mixed mode restricts the number of terms to be added up to 8, similarly to the Default mode. Since the Mixed mode has also produced results higher than those of the Default mode, we conclude that the consideration of more source constructs by itself contributed to increasing the bug localization effectiveness.|$|E
30|$|Structured {{information}} retrieval (IR) {{has been able}} to increase the effectiveness of static bug localization techniques (Saha et al. 2013; Wang and Lo 2014). The key feature of structured IR-based techniques refers to how they break up source files, based on constructs available in the adopted programming language. Bug localization techniques based on traditional IR calculate the similarity between a source file and a bug report considering the whole <b>file</b> (<b>Section</b> 2.2). Conversely, structured IR-based techniques break source files into multiple parts, one for each construct recognized by the technique (Section 2.3). Each of these parts contains only terms that are instances of the corresponding construct in the original source file. Then, instead of calculating similarity using the whole file, the final similarity between a bug report and a source file is the sum of the similarities between each part of the source file and the bug report (Equation 1). BLUiR (Saha et al. 2013) recognizes four Java constructs: class names, method names, variable names, and comments (Section 2.3. 1). Thus, it breaks source files into four parts. The same approach is followed by BLUiR+ (Saha et al. 2013) (Section 2.3. 1) and AmaLgam (Wang and Lo 2014) (Section 2.3. 2).|$|E

40|$|Background Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{may be a}} {{risk factor}} for mortality but previous meta-analyses lacked standardization of laboratory methods for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D) concentrations and used aggregate data instead of individual participant data (IPD). We therefore performed an IPD meta-analysis on the association between standardized serum 25 (OH) D and mortality. Methods In a European consortium of eight prospective studies, including seven general population cohorts, we used the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP) protocols to standardize 25 (OH) D data. Meta-analyses using a one step procedure on IPD were performed to study associations of 25 (OH) D with all-cause mortality as the primary outcome, and with cardiovascular and cancer mortality as secondary outcomes. This meta-analysis is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 02438488. Findings We analysed 26916 study participants (median age 61. 6 years, 58 % females) with a median 25 (OH) D concentration of 53. 8 nmol/L. During a median follow-up time of 10. 5 years, 6802 persons died. Compared to participants with 25 (OH) D concentrations of 75 to 99. 99 nmol/L, the adjusted hazard ratios (with 95 % confidence interval) for mortality in the 25 (OH) D groups with 40 to 49. 99, 30 to 39. 99, and < 30 nmol/L were 1. 15 (1. 00 – 1. 29), 1. 33 (1. 16 – 1. 51), and 1. 67 (1. 44 – 1. 89), respectively. We observed similar results for cardiovascular mortality, but there was no significant linear association between 25 (OH) D and cancer mortality. There was also no significantly increased mortality risk at high 25 (OH) D levels up to 125 nmol/L. Interpretation In the first IPD meta-analysis using standardized measurements of 25 (OH) D we observed an association between low 25 (OH) D and increased risk of all-cause mortality. It is of public health interest to evaluate whether treatment of vitamin D deficiency prevents premature deaths.

Introduction. This document and its appendices contain information for users of the 2001 National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) public use data file. Conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics, NHDS collects medical and demographic information from a sample of discharge records selected from a national sample of non-Federal, short-stay hospitals. The data serve as a basis for calculating statistics on hospital inpatient utilization in the United States. For a brief description of the survey design and data collection procedures, see below. For a more detailed description of the survey design, data collection procedures, and the estimation process, see Reference 1. Publications based on the data for each survey year can be obtained from the NCHS website at: [URL]. History. To provide more complete and precise information on the utilization of the Nation's hospitals and on the nature and treatment of illness among the hospitalized population, in 1962 the NCHS began exploring possibilities for surveying morbidity in hospitals. A national advisory groupwas established. The NCHS conducted planning discussions with other officials of the Public Health Service. Hospitalization material from the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan, the American Hospital Association, and the Professional Activities Study was examined and evaluated. In 1963, a study by the School of Public Health of the University of Pittsburgh under contract to the NCHS demonstrated the feasibility of an NHDS type of program. An additional pilot study using enumerators from the Bureau of the Census was conducted in late 1964 and confirmed the University of Pittsburgh's findings. Finally, with advice and support from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, individual experts, other professional groups, and officials of the U. S. Public Health Service, the NCHS initiated the National Hospital Discharge Survey in 1964. NHDS/nhds 2001. pdfSection I. Description of the National Hospital Discharge Survey [...] II.

40|$|Over {{twenty years}} ago, Congress took the {{extraordinary}} step of authorizing taxpayers {{to sue the}} Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for damages if the IRS engaged in “unauthorized collection action” when trying to collect a federal tax debt. For many years the IRS has generally been immune from any private action by three laws. Thus, fashioning a private cause of action against the IRS for damages was an extraordinary act. Congress expressly authorized taxpayers to bring a private cause of action against the United States for economic damages caused by “unauthorized collection. ” Codified as section 7433 of the Internal Revenue Code, this statute provides taxpayers with the exclusive remedy for abuses by IRS employees {{in connection with the}} collection of taxes. The legislative history, although sparse, reflects Congress’ concern that unless taxpayers were given the right to bring a private cause of action against the IRS for abusive tortious tax collection action, such activities would go unchecked. Because the IRS was and continues to be shielded from other private causes of action by the Tax Anti-Injunction Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act, without a specific private right of action to sue the government taxpayers would never have the ability to stop excessive and illegal collection action by the IRS. Despite the importance of section 7433 to check government unauthorized tortious collection activity, federal courts have turned section 7433 into a shield against excessive or unsupported IRS action, rather than maintain it as the small, but important, sword that Congress intended to give taxpayer. This article contributes to the sparse literature on section 7433 by demonstrating that federal courts have effectively vitiated section 7433 by misreading its statute of limitations to: (1) require a taxpayer to be put on notice that all collection action taken by the IRS is unauthorized and to therefore <b>file</b> <b>section</b> 7433 actions from the first time collection action is taken; and (2) prevent continuous unauthorized collection action to extend the statute of limitations start date until the last of such series. These readings contravene the purpose of section 7433 in two ways. First, as the legislative history of section 7433 demonstrates Congress intended section 7433 ’s statute of limitations to be interpreted no less liberally then the statute of limitations for actions brought under the Federal Torn Claims Act. Second, even absent the legislative history, the purpose and goal of section 7433 are best advanced by reading section 7433 not to start when the taxpayer notified of the first collection action taken by the IRS. In so ruling, the courts have made a simple category mistake. The courts have treated section 7433 like a typical tax claims procedure- i. e., a procedure for a taxpayer to file a claim with the IRS to get back a taxpayer’s monies that that he claims the IRS wrongfully collected. The statutes of limitations for such typical tax claims procedures actions are properly strictly construed against the taxpayer because they reflect the policy that taxpayers may not sit on their rights to get their money back. The mistake is that section 7433 is not a typical tax claims procedure statute, but a statute to protect citizens against tortious acts by government employees {{in the course of their}} work. In this respect, a claim under section 7433 belongs in the category of tort claims against federal employees under the Federal Tort Claim Act (“FTCA”). This is further supported by Congress’ action to make section 7433 the exclusive private action for tortious acts by IRS employees in connection with the collection of tax. Once the courts treat section 7433 claims like tort claims, not typical tax claim actions, courts will see why they should read section 7433 ’s statute of limitations just as they read the statute of limitations under FTCA...|$|E
