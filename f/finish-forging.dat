40|$|Abstract. The {{cold forging}} process of large module spur gear with four modules and 59 mm breadth is {{performed}} {{by means of}} numerical simulation method. Two processes to forming such spur gears were compared by the simulation method, one is with the closed-die performing and extrusion in the <b>finish-forging,</b> the other is with divided-flow method in the <b>finish-forging.</b> Especially, the divided-flow method is analyzed in detail. The necessary reference and basis to realize practical cold precision forging process of spur gear with large modulus is provided eventually...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Steering knuckle is the {{key part}} of vehicle {{steering}} system, and its mechanical properties and surface qualities are very strict. The current production technologies of branch-like steering knuckle are obsolete, which become the restriction of increasing productivity and improving the quality. Aiming at Jetta steering knuckle, the technology of two forging steps in one heat is presented. This technology is mainly composed of a closed die extrusion with the extrusion belt and open <b>finish-forging.</b> Experimental researches and numerical analysis show that the new technology is feasible and the mechanical property of the forging piece can be improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The cold closed-die forging of {{spur gears}} brings the {{problems}} of great forming forces, low life of the dies and insufficent corner filling. The two-step forming technology is presented. First, the billet is pre-forged by closed-die forging for getting most of tooth profile. Second, the gear is <b>finish-forging</b> by local loading. The finite element method is used to simulate the cold forging process. The strain distributions, the stress distributions, velocity distributions and load-stroke curve are investigated. The simulation {{results show that the}} technology can guarantee the full filling effect, and decrease the forming force remarkably. The results of simulation and analysis were verified by the physics experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{hot-working}} {{characteristics of}} IN- 718 are {{studied in the}} temperature range 900 °C to 1200 °C and strain rate range 0. 001 to 100 s− 1 using hot compression tests. Processing maps for hot working are developed {{on the basis of}} the strain-rate sensitivity variations with temperature and strain rate and interpreted using a dynamic materials model. The map exhibits two domains of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) : one occurring at 950 °C and 0. 001 s− 1 with an efficiency of power dissipation of 37 pct and the other at 1200 °C and 0. 1 s− 1 with an efficiency of 40 pct. Dynamic recrystallization in the former domain is nucleated by the δ(Ni 3 Nb) precipitates and results in fine-grained microstructure. In the high-temperature DRX domain, carbides dissolve in the matrix and make interstitial carbon atoms available for increasing the rate of dislocation generation for DRX nucleation. It is recommended that IN- 718 may be hot-forged initially at 1200 °C and 0. 1 s− 1 and <b>finish-forged</b> at 950 °C and 0. 001 s− 1 so that fine-grained structure may be achieved. The available forging practice validates these results from processing maps. At temperatures lower than 1000 °C and strain rates higher than 1 s− 1 the material exhibits adiabatic shear bands. Also, at temperatures higher than 1150 °C and strain rates more than 1 s− 1, IN- 718 exhibits intercrystalline cracking. Both these regimes may be avoided in hotworking IN- 718...|$|R
