This event has come to generate a sense of excitement - a “buzz” - that speaks {{not only to the}} normal enthusiasm that marks new beginnings, but also, I am increasingly beginning to sense, to an enthusiasm about the exciting developments which lie ahead, and the role that each of us will be playing <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>forge</b> a new identity for our beloved Unisa. And in that spirit of excellence and the forging of a new identity, you will have noticed our magnificent new mace, highly symbolic in its ebony and ivory composition, and designed as a symbol of office and authority for use in Unisa’s official ceremonies such as our assembly this morning, graduation ceremonies, and at the installation of the Chancellor and inauguration of the Vice Chancellor. The unveiling and blessing of the mace brings to fruition a branding exercise that began in 2005 for the newly merged, dedicated, comprehensive distance education institution. It gives character and identity to the new Brand Unisa which builds on years of service to higher education by all our merging institutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) {{has emerged}} as a leading {{molecular}} typing method owing to its high ability to discriminate among bacterial isolates, the relative ease with which data acquisition and analysis can be standardized, and the high portability of the resulting sequence data. While MLST has been successfully applied {{to the study of the}} population structure for a number of different bacterial species, it has also provided compelling evidence for high rates of recombination in some species. We have analyzed a set of Campylobacter jejuni strains using MLST and Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) on a full-genome microarray in order to determine whether recombination and high levels of genomic mosaicism adversely affect the inference of strain relationships based on the analysis of a restricted number of genetic loci. Results Our results indicate that, in general, there is significant concordance between strain relationships established by MLST and those based on shared gene content as established by CGH. While MLST has significant predictive power with respect to overall genome similarity of isolates, we also found evidence for significant differences in genomic content among strains that would otherwise appear to be highly related based on their MLST profiles. Conclusion The extensive genomic mosaicism between closely related strains has important implications in the context of establishing strain to strain relationships because it suggests that the exact gene content of strains, and by extension their phenotype, is less likely to be "predicted" based on a small number of typing loci. This in turn suggests that a greater emphasis should be placed on analyzing genes of clinical interest <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>forge</b> ahead with the next generation of molecular typing methods. </p...|$|R
40|$|Researchers have {{documented}} a "summer reading setback" where a demonstrated achievement gap between proficient and struggling readers expands {{during the summer}} months (Allington & McGill-Franzen, 2003). Educators need to devise a plan to foster diverse independent reading (Byrnes, 2000) by providing students access to texts of interest (Ivey & Broaddus, 2001; Hughes-Hassell & Rodge, 2007) and researchers suggest when given opportunities to read e-books, students read more (Fasimpaur, 2004). This study was designed to reveal students' perceptions of a Nook summer reading program granting the students access {{to a wide variety of}} eBooks, paying particular attention to the non-proficient fifth-grade students' reported summer reading behaviors and the influences for students' summer reading. Using a qualitative exploratory approach, I studied 20 students who participated in a summer independent reading program using Nook digital readers. I was able to analyze and interpret the student voices regarding their summer reading experiences using an online book log, student questionnaires, focus group interviews, and through two individual student case studies. I analyzed and interpreted the data through an interpretive mosaic focused on four overarching themes and the intersection of those themes which included: the reader, access to text, social relationships and Nook digital readers. I found important implications that were generated from the students' reported reading behaviors and perceptions: 1) Social reading relationships were cultivated through the experience, 2) Access to a variety of texts shaped the kinds of reading students engaged in, and 3) Nook digital readers helped to foster students' reported positive summer reading behaviors. This study serves as a foundation to consider how and in what ways technology shapes students' literacy experiences <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>forge</b> ahead in this technological saturated society...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we use both {{observations}} and modelling {{to explore the}} gas content of galaxies. We use the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model to simultaneously match the Hɪ and stellar mass properties of model galaxies to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We add the observed <b>Hɪ</b> mass function <b>as</b> an extra model constraint and successfully match the Hɪ and stellar mass functions. However, the fit to the star formation properties has been weakened compared to without the Hɪ constraint. We suggest that this problem may be partially resolved by forming stars out of only H 2 gas instead of the total cold gas. The environment in which a galaxy resides can affect its evolution. We use the counts in a fixed size cylinder method to estimate 3 environment measures for the GAMA survey. We use density and edge corrections {{to allow us to}} calculate estimates for every galaxy out to z = 0. 4 in our flux limited sample. We then use these estimates to examine the effect of environment on the luminosity and stellar mass functions. Using Hɪ observations of the groups and galaxies in the ALFALFA and GAMA surveys we calculate Hɪ masses using the stacking technique. The use of the stacking technique has allowed us to exploit survey data that would not otherwise be possible. We stack galaxies in halo mass bins and calculate the Hɪ to halo mass fraction as a function of halo mass. We see a steady decline in the <b>Hɪ</b> fraction <b>as</b> <b>we</b> move to higher mass halos. These are the highest density environments where there is less cold gas. Combining this fraction with the halo mass function we are able to calculate a lower limit value for ΩHɪ of 1. 8 ± 0. 39 x 10 - 4 h-¹...|$|R
