40|$|Messenger RNA was {{isolated}} from monkey testes and size-fractionated on sucrose gradients. In vitro translation of these mRNA fractions resulted in nascent, labeled alpha-glucosidase {{that could be}} precipitated with anti human alpha-glucosidase antiserum. A cDNA library was constructed from the most enriched fraction. The library was screened with cDNA made from mRNA obtained from immunoselected polysomes. Five cross-hybridizing clones were isolated and identified by their selection of alpha-glucosidase mRNA, as shown by <b>hybrid</b> <b>released</b> <b>translation</b> and further by their ability to hybridize with DNA from human chromosome 17, on which the gene coding for acid alpha-glucosidase is locate...|$|E
40|$|A cDNA clone (pFD 1) {{derived from}} Silene pratensis {{ferredoxin}} mRNA was {{selected from a}} cDNA-library using the <b>hybrid</b> <b>released</b> <b>translation</b> technique. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed the cDNA insert to contain the complete coding region of the ferredoxin precursor protein. The ferredoxin precursor has a mol. wt. of 15 300, the transit-peptide has a mol. wt. of 5600. The length of the ferredoxin mRNA {{was found to be}} 700 nucleotides whereas the cDNA insert was about 1200 basepairs. S 1 nuclease protection experiments showed the ferredoxin-specific DNA to be 660 basepairs in length and to start 39 nucleotides upstream of the ferredoxin coding sequence. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA revealed the presence of only one fragment with homology to the ferredoxin cDNA probe, so it is probably a single-copy gene. Comparison of the ferredoxin transit-sequence with transit sequences of another stromal protein, the small subunit of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase showed no apparent homology, except for a stretch of three amino acids near the processing site...|$|E
40|$|Complementary DNA was {{synthesized}} on polyadenylated RNA from a dikaryotic mycelium of the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune bearing fruiting body initials. The complementary DNA was cloned {{into the}} PstI site of pBR 327 by the deoxyguanidylate-deoxycytidylate tailing approach. After transformation into Escherichia coli cells, a differential screening {{was performed by}} colony hybridization with complementary [32 P]DNA made on the RNAs of the monokaryon and dikaryon strains. Two clones were selected for further analysis by Northern blotting and <b>hybrid</b> <b>release</b> <b>translation.</b> Clone 1 D 10 hybridized with an mRNA of 775 nucleotides, coding for a polypeptide with an Mr of 15, 000. Although this RNA was present in both monokaryotic and dikaryotic mycelia, its concentration appeared to change considerably over time and with different cultivation conditions. This mRNA {{is probably the most}} abundantly expressed sequence in S. commune. Clone 1 G 2 and its homologs hybridized with an mRNA of 650 nucleotides, coding for a polypeptide with an Mr of 13, 000. This gene was exclusively expressed in the dikaryon strain. In liquid-grown cultures, the concentration of this mRNA was low but increased ca. 20 -fold during the establishment of fruiting body primordia. A chromosomal fragment of 9 kilobase pairs which contained the 1 G 2 gene was cloned into pBR 327 and used as a probe in Northern blot hybridization. It was found that surrounding sequences were not expressed at the same time or to the same extent as the 1 G 2 gene...|$|R
40|$|The CDC 28 gene was subcloned from a plasmid {{containing}} a 6. 5 -kilobase-pair segment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA YRp 7 (CDC 28 - 3) by partial digestion with Sau 3 A and insertion {{of the resulting}} fragments into the BamHI sites of YRp 7 and pRC 1. Recombinant plasmids were obtained containing inserts of 4. 4 and 3. 1 kilobase pairs which were capable of complementing a cdc 28 (ts) mutation. R-loop analysis indicated that each yeast insert contained two RNA coding regions of about 0. 8 and 1. 0 kilobase pairs, respectively. In vitro mutagenesis experiments suggested that the smaller coding region corresponded to the CDC 28 gene. When cellular polyadenylic acid-containing RNA, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis after denaturation with glyoxal and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, was reacted with labeled DNA from the smaller coding region, and RNA species of about 1 kilobase in length was detected. Presumably, the discrepancy in size between the R-loop and electrophoretic determinations {{is due to a}} segment of polyadenylic acid which is excluded from the R-loops. By using hybridization of the histone H 2 B mRNAs to an appropriate probe as a previously determined standards, it was possible to estimate the number of CDC 28 mRNA copies per haploid cell as between 6 and 12 molecules. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>release</b> <b>translation</b> performed on the CDC 29 mRNA directed the synthesis of a polypeptide of 27, 000 daltons, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. This polypeptide was not synthesized when mRNA prepared from a cdc 28 nonsense mutant was translated in a parallel fashion. However, if the RNA from a cell containing the CDC 28 gene on a plasmid maintained at a high copy number was translated, the amount of in vitro product was amplified fivefold...|$|R
40|$|Extensins are hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins {{associated}} with most dicotyledonous plant cell walls. To isolate cDNA clones encoding extensin, we started by isolating poly(A) + RNA from carrot root tissue, and then translating the RNA in vitro, {{in the presence}} of tritiated leucine or proline. A 33 -kDa peptide was identified in the translation products as a putative extensin precursor because: (i) it is rich in proline and poor in leucine, and (ii) the message appears to be more abundant when carrot tissue is wounded. From a cDNA library constructed with poly(A) + RNA from wounded carrots, one cDNA clone (pDC 5) was identified that specifically hybridized to poly(A) + RNA encoding this 33 -kDa peptide. We isolated three cDNA clones (pDC 11, pDC 12, and pDC 16) from another cDNA library using pDC 5 as a probe. DNA sequence data, RNA hybridization analysis, and <b>hybrid</b> <b>released</b> in vitro <b>translation</b> indicate that the cDNA clone pDC 11 encodes extensin and that cDNA clones pDC 12 and pDC 16 encode the 33 -kDa peptide, which as yet has an unknown identity and function. The assumption that the 33 -kDa peptide was an extensin precursor was invalid. RNA hybridization and DNA sequence analysis indicate that pDC 5 is a hybrid clone corresponding to two RNA species. RNA hybridization analysis showed that RNA encoded by both clone types is accumulated upon wounding...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the response of grain yield to plant density and nitrogen rate in spring maize <b>hybrids</b> <b>released</b> from 1970 to 2010 and grown extensively in Northeast China. Twenty-one hybrids were grown for 2 years in Northeast China at densities of 30, 000, 52, 500, 75, 000, and 97, 500 plantsha− 1 and N application levels of 0, 150, 300, and 450 kgNha− 1. Irrespective of density or nitrogen application rate, grain yields both per plant and per unit area were significantly higher for newer than older hybrids. As plant density increased from 30, 000 to 97, 500 plantha− 1, yield per plant of 1970 s, 1980 s, 1990 s, and 2000 s hybrids decreased by 50 %, 45 %, 46 %, and 52 %, respectively. The response of grain yield per unit area to plant density was curvilinear. The estimated optimum plant densities were about 58, 000, 49, 000, 65, 000, and 65, 000 plantsha− 1 for <b>hybrids</b> <b>released</b> in the 1970 s, 1980 s, 1990 s, and 2000 s, respectively. The theoretical optimum densities for the <b>hybrids</b> <b>released</b> from the 1970 s to the 2000 s increased by 1750 plantsha− 1 decade− 1. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased grain yields per plant and per unit area for all hybrids. The theoretical optimum N application rates for high yield for <b>hybrids</b> <b>released</b> in the 1970 s and 1980 s were about 280 and 360 kgha− 1, and the hybrids from the 1990 s and 2000 s showed highest yield at 330 kgha− 1 N. No significant difference in the grain yields of 2000 s hybrids between the N levels of 150 to 450 kgha− 1 was found. Significant yield gains per plant and per unit area were found, with average increases of 17. 9 g plant− 1 decade− 1 and 936 kgha− 1 decade− 1 over the period 1970 – 2010, respectively. Yield gains were attributed mainly to increased yield per plant, contributed by increases in kernel number per ear and 1000 -kernel weight. The rates of lodging and barren plants of newer hybrids were significantly lower than those of older ones, especially at high plant density...|$|R
