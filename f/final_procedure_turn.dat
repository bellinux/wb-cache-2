40|$|The present paper {{intends to}} couple the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) with the Boundary Element Method (BEM) in the {{analysis}} of the scattering of plane sound waves from an inﬁnite cylinder in a ﬂuid. The cylinder is modeled as ﬂuid-like, i. e. it is not capable to support shear waves. A governing integral equation is derived from the Helmholtz diﬀerential equation for both the ﬂuid and the scatterer. Such an equation is discretised and solved by using the fast multipole approach in order to speed up the CPU time. The <b>ﬁnal</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>turns</b> out to be much faster if compared to the conventional approach. An iterative solver is adopted in order to improve the overall computational effciency...|$|R
40|$|In the {{following}} paper, a new method for fast and accurate volume intensity and color integration is elaborated, which employs wavelet decompositions and texture mapping. At this point, it comprises and unifies {{the advantages of}} recently introduced Fourier domain volume rendering techniques and wavelet based volume rendering. Specifically, the method computes analytic solutions of the ray intensity integral through a single wavelet by slicing its Fourier transform and by backprojecting it into the spatial domain. The resulting slices {{can be considered as}} RGB textures where R, G, and B account for the decomposed volume color function. Due to the similarity of the basis functions, the computation of the texture map has to be figured out only once for each 3 D mother wavelet. Hence, the <b>final</b> volume rendering <b>procedure</b> <b>turns</b> out to be a superposition of self [...] similar, transparent and colored textures, which is supported by modern hardware accumulation buffers.

5000|$|<b>Procedure</b> <b>turn</b> (PT): ICAO {{defines a}} PT as a {{maneuver}} {{in which a}} turn is made away from a designated track followed by a turn {{in the opposite direction}} to permit the aircraft to intercept and proceed along the reciprocal of the designated track. A standardized way of reversing course to get lined up for final approach. The approach chart must indicate that a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is authorized for the approach, via a [...] "procedure turn barb" [...] symbol or a similar notation. Note that when a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> exists for an approach, the maximum speed of the aircraft in the <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is limited by regulations (typically, it should not exceed 200 knots IAS). The <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is typically entered by tracking a navaid course outbound (usually following a reciprocal of the inbound course), and then turning 45° off of the course; after that, the pilot flies this leg for a certain time, then conducts a 180° turn to get on a 45° intercepting course, and then re-intercepts the inbound course.|$|R

5000|$|An {{instrument}} approach wherein final approach is begun without first having executed a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> not necessarily completed with a straight-in landing or made to straight-in landing minimums. A direct {{instrument approach}} requires no <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> {{or any other}} course reversal procedures for alignment (usually indicated by [...] "NoPT" [...] on approach plates), as the arrival direction and the final approach course are not too different from each other. The direct approach can be finished with a straight-in landing or circle-to-land procedure.|$|R

50|$|Some {{approach}} procedures do {{not permit}} straight-in approaches unless the pilots are being radar vectored. In these situations, pilots are required to complete a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> (PT) or other course reversal, generally within 10 NM of the PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate or final approach segment. When conducting any type of approach, if the aircraft is not lined up for a straight-in approach, then a course reversal might be necessary. The idea of a course reversal is to allow sufficiently large changes in the course flown (in order to line the aircraft up with the final approach course), without taking too much space horizontally and while remaining {{within the confines of}} protected airspace. This is accomplished in one of three ways: a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> a holding pattern, or a teardrop course reversal.|$|R

Bonding and debonding procedures can cause irreversible changes on the enamel surface [1, 2], which are more important when they occur on the most resistant outer layer. These potential alterations involve up to 55  μm enamel loss [3], increased surface roughness [1, 2], and, therefore, more susceptibility to demineralization and discoloration [4].|$|R

50|$|Following {{the second}} <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> a continual descent begins from {{a height of}} {{approximately}} 3,200 ft, as they had a definite glide path indication. This could not, however, {{have come from the}} ILS glide path transmitter, as the flight path led over the glide path station with its many weak and steep secondary glide path beams. The flight director system could offer an explanation for the regular rates of descent. At approximately 3,200 ft over N a spurious glide path was crossed during the second <b>procedure</b> <b>turn.</b> Now if {{on the basis of this}} indication, which might have also coincided with a localizer indication, the flight director was set to the approach mode in order to follow both pointers on this, the subsequent approach might be explained, but only if the two pilots neglected to keep the normal, continuous, mutual check on the basic navigational instruments and the marker control. The artificial horizon pitch bar which is not integrated with the ILS glide path signals required an average rate of descent of approximately 500 ft/min to maintain a 2.5° glide path without wind correction. In this instrumentation, the ILS glide path indication takes the form of a small triangle in the artificial horizon.|$|R
