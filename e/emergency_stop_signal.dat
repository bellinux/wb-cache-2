40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I 2 V) experiments implementing cooperative maneuvering for three different vehicles driving automatically. The cars used were cybercars from the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique (INRIA), (France), which are fully automated road vehicles, and two mass-produced cars-one a Smart Fortwo car from TNO (Netherlands) equipped with additional actuators and sensors {{and the other a}} convertible Citroe¨n C 3 from IAI (Spain) that uses sensorial information to manage the actuators. The cars communicate by a wireless mesh network over Wi-Fi using the optimized link state routing (OLSR) ad-hoc protocol. The entire communication task is embedded in a small MIPS Linux Box (4 G System Cube) that is transparent for the cars. A standard framework was defined with the parameters needed to perform adaptive cruise control (ACC) and intersection maneuvers among the cars, as well as <b>emergency</b> <b>stops</b> via a <b>signal</b> sent by the infrastructure. The experiments were carried out in La Rochelle (France) during the final demonstration of the European Union (EU) Cybercars- 2 Project...|$|R
50|$|On large {{industrial}} machines, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is typically {{located on the}} panel, and possibly in several {{other areas of the}} machine. Often, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is made wireless using a remote control. This provides a rapid means to disconnect the energy source of the device to protect workers. For fail-safe operation, the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is a normally closed switch which ensures that a broken wire will neither accidentally activate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> nor prevent it from being activated.|$|R
40|$|In working environments {{with large}} manipulators, {{accidental}} collisions can cause severe personal injuries and can seriously damage manipulators, necessitating {{the development of}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm to prevent such occurrences. In this paper, we propose an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system for the efficient and safe operation of a manipulator by applying an intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm. Our proposed intelligent algorithm considers the direction of motion of the manipulator. In addition, using a new regression method, the algorithm includes a decision step that determines whether a detected object is a collision-causing obstacle or a part of the manipulator. We apply our <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system to a two-link manipulator and assess the performance of our intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm as compared with other models...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 <b>Emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{controls}} are essential parts of industrial machinery {{because they are}} designed to stop the operation in case of emergencies without risks to operators, equipment, products, or facilities. Current guidelines for <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> controls have been formulated based on experience but not on empirical studies. The main objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} the type and orientation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons on the reaction time, mode of activation, and preferences of subjects in order to formulate guidelines for their selection. An experiment consisting of a simple, cooperative assembly operation with a Microbot was designed for this study. The main conclusions of this research are that reaction time to activate <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbutton is not affected by the orientation of the control but it is influenced by the type of control. The mode of activation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons is influenced by both the type and the orientation of the control. Subjects preferred <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards or with half guards over controls with full guards, and subjects also preferred an inclined orientation of the control over horizontal or vertical orientations. The following guidelines are recommended for the selection of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons. Select <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards. If a guard is absolutely required, select a guard with slots or a half guard to ensure adequate visibility of and access to the button. If possible, give <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons an inclined orientation (about 45 °) on the control panel. Avoid using vertical orientations for these controls...|$|R

After the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is activated, {{the size of the}} workpiece must be re-established before the line can be reactivated into production mode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A motion planner of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{must make}} an {{operating}} humanoid robot to a stationary state under the emergency signal. It {{plays an important}} role in prevention of falling over because humanoid robots fall over easily. Immedi-ately after the emergency signal, it must generate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion in real-time. We modeled a humanoid robot as a simple dynamic system consists of ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) and COG (Center of Gravity) as its states. The <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion is generated by a state feedback. We determined optimal feedback gains in terms of the initial conditions and the pole assignment. The proposed method realized a reliable <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> with low computational cost. Furthermore, it can easily predict the possibility of the successful <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> at any time. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by an experiment using humanoid robot HRP- 2. I...|$|R

50|$|Speed/event {{recording}} devices {{indicated that the}} Conrail locomotives were moving at approximately 60 mph when their brakes were applied for an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop,</b> after they had passed the trackside signals. This was, Gates later claimed, {{when he realized that}} he did not have a wayside signal to proceed north at the interlocking. He was, however, moving too fast to stop before passing the signal indicating he should stop clear of the main track on which #94 was approaching. Had Gates reacted either to an approach signal instructing him to reduce speed, or to the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> itself in a timely fashion, or had the brakeman called out the state of the signals as he was supposed to do, it was likely the Conrail engines could have stopped short of the switch.|$|R

50|$|On railways, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{is a full}} {{application}} of the brakes {{in order to bring}} a train to a stop as quickly as possible. This occurs either by a manual <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> activation, such as a button being pushed on the train to start the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop,</b> or on some trains automatically, when the train has passed a red signal or the driver has failed to respond to warnings to check that he/she is still alert, which is known as a dead man's switch. A similar mechanism is the watchdog timer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In an eye {{movement}} countermanding paradigm it is demonstrated {{for the first}} time that a tactile stimulus can be an effective <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> when human participants are to inhibit saccades to a visual target. Estimated <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> processing times were 90 – 140 ms, comparable to results with auditory <b>stop</b> <b>signals,</b> but shorter than those commonly found for manual responses. Two of the three participants significantly slowed their reactions in expectation of the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> as revealed by a control experiment without <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> All participants pro-duced slower responses in the shortest <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay condition than predicted by the race model (Logan and Cowan 1984) along with hypometric saccades on stop failure trials, suggesting that the race model may need to be elaborated to include some component of interaction of <b>stop</b> and go <b>signal</b> processing...|$|R

30|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>signal</b> {{reaction}} time (SSRT) {{was used as}} a measure of individual response inhibition. SSRT is an estimate of the time it takes for a stop process to finish once it is initiated by a <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> The finishing time of the stop process was estimated by taking the ith percentile of the go trial distribution, where i corresponded to the percentage of successfully stopped trials in the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> condition (Ridderinkhof, Band, & Logan, 1999). The average <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay was subtracted from the estimated finishing time of the stop process {{in order to determine the}} <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> {{reaction time}}. A smaller SSRT indicated faster inhibition when responding to the primary task. The task took approximately 10 min to complete.|$|R

30|$|The <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> task (Blackwell, Chatham, Wiseheart, & Munakata, 2014) {{was used}} to measure {{response}} inhibition. First, in a reaction time block consisting of 16 trials, participants were required to press the letter “f” on the keyboard when they saw a blue circle on the screen or the letter “j” when they saw a red circle, as quickly and accurately as possible. No cues were provided and the mean reaction time was used as a baseline to compare performance on the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> trials. Next, participants performed a practice <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> block consisting of 16 trials, where they were presented with go and no-go trials. On the no-go trials, participants were required to inhibit their response (i.e. not press “f” or “j” in response to the circle on the screen) when they heard a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> (i.e. the verbal prompt “stop”). This block allowed participants to become better acquainted with the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> portion of the task and allowed for calibration of the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay.|$|R
