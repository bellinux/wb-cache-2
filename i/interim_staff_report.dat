40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} <b>Interim</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>Report</b> Under Intensified Surveillance for Jamaica. Following the adverse {{economic}} impact of Hurricane Ivan, the outlook for FY 2005 / 06 is for a rebound in growth {{in the context of}} broad macroeconomic stability. Real GDP growth slowed, and damage to agriculture contributed to double-digit inflation in FY 2004 / 05. Achieving the envisaged further reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 100 percent {{over the next four years}} will be challenging and demand high fiscal discipline. The IMF staff welcomes the continuing progress toward strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial system.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} <b>Interim</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>Report</b> Under Intensified Surveillance for Jamaica. The {{authorities}} have reaffirmed their objective of {{balancing the budget}} in FY 2005 / 06, while recognizing that this now poses a greater challenge. The IMF staff now estimates that measures {{in the range of}} 2. 5 – 3. 0 percent of GDP would be required to meet this goal, compared with the IMF staff’s estimate of 1. 7 percent of GDP {{at the time of the}} 2004 Article IV consultation. The room to maneuver in monetary and exchange rate policy remains constrained by the debt overhang.
