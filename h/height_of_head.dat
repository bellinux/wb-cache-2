Moreover, trophic niche breadth, trophic diversity and predator-prey ratio was determined; this latter measure was made between the length, width and maximum volume of prey and morphology (LHC and head measures) from predators. Also information on sexual dimorphism was supplied. For trophic analysis digestive tracts were used. Each prey item found was reconstructed for its identification and its volume, numerosity, and frequency of occurrence were estimated. It was used the Relative Importance Index (RII) to estimate the contribution of each food category to the diet. To examine sexual dimorphism, 14 morphological variables were measured.

40|$|Dutch {{national}} {{accident data}} show a considerable {{increase of the}} number of rear end collisions during the last 10 years. The numbers of cars involved and casualties from these accidents have also increased. Neck injuries, typical for rear end collisions, are expected to become a major health problem, though it is still very difficult to obtain reliable data. Head restraints, meant to prevent neck injuries during rear end collisions, are not compulsory in The Netherlands. Traffic observations show, however, that they are available in nearly all modern cars. Their proper adjustment appears to be a great problem. A great number of occupants (both drivers and front seat passengers) are not adjusting the restraint as it is should be, that is to say the top of the restraint is positioned lower than the top of the occupants' ears. The problem may be partly due to incorrect positioning of the restraint by the occupant. However, the problem may be caused by insufficient maximum height of the restraint. Calculations, using population measurements, have been carried out. It was found that for Dutch male occupants the minimum <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> restraints (as regulated in ECE 25) should be increased considerably to satisfy all but the highest 5 -percentile of the population.

40|$|This report {{gives an}} account of a study into the {{technical}} aspects of head rests. Measurements of new cars were performed at car dealers. Surveys were carried out in public parking places. The field study was supplemented by a technical study. At present, head rests in cars are not compulsory in the Netherlands. If they are fitted, the new vehicle regulation (NVR) states that they should comply with an obsolete European Community guideline. Partly at the insistence of the Netherlands, an adaptation to the guideline concerning the minimal <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> rests is being prepared in a European context. It was not possible to raise the head rests sufficiently in many cars. If all front-seat passengers were to adjust their head rest to the highest position, this would still not be sufficient in 46 % of the cases. Adjustable head rests were found in 91 % of new cars. Of the head rests, which were adjustable in a vertical direction, 34 % were also adjustable in a horizontal direction. It was shown that amongst 38 % of front-seat passengers, the adjustable head rest was in the lowest position. An excessive horizontal distance between the head rest and the head was found among 28 % of front-seat passengers...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{stress is}} a common health problem {{throughout}} industry. Any heat stress evaluation requires some exposure assessment of climatic conditions, especially air temperature, humidity, and speed, along with the average temperature of the solid surroundings. In this paper workplace environmental climatic parameters were measured and then evaluated by Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, Corrected Effective Temperature, Heat Stress Index, and Allowable Exposure Time indices among 40 workers in a glass manufacturing unit in Tehran. Also, the effect of available heat control devices on heat stress indices was investigated. The {{results of this study}} showed that the obtained heat stress index in individual section and press units is exceeded from 100 (in individual section unit: 302. 6, in press unit: 283. 6). Also, it is found that the mean average of allowable exposure time in individual section and press units were 13. 15 and 12. 26 minutes exposure for one hour, respectively.

40|$|Introduction/Aim. There are {{numerous}} {{factors that influence}} the formation of condylar processus: the growth and development of cranial base, growth {{and development of the}} jaws and alveolar extensions, teething, the way of intercuspidation, the overlap of incisors, functions of masticatory muscles, etc. Considering the fact that the above-mentioned factors significantly differ in persons with different morphological set of the face, we set a hypothesis that dimensions of condylar processus and the mandibular ramus considerably differ in persons with mandibular prognathism compared to eugnatic persons. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the differences in dimensions of condylar processus between the above-mentioned groups. Methods. Six parameters representing the dimensions of the condylar processus were measured on profile teleradiographs of 30 eugnatic persons and 30 paersons with mandibular prognathism: the height of condylar processus, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> of the mandible, width of the head, width of the neck, height of the ramus without the condylar processus and the overall height of the ramus. Results. A considerable difference in the values of the parameters was found, as well as the distribution toward the values of reference. It was found that the height of the condylar processus was significantly greater in persons with mandibular prognathism, whereas the width of the head of the mandible, the width of the neck and the height of the ramus without the condylar processus was considerably decreased within the same group. The height of the head of the mandible and the overall height of the ramus was not significantly changed. Conclusion. In persons with mandibular prognathism, morphological features of the condylar processus are changed. The condylar processus lengthens on account of shortening of the lower part of the ramus, and the mentioned lengthening is the most prominent in its condylar neck area which is also the centre of its most intense growth...|$|E
40|$|Dutch (police based) {{accident}} data show a tremendous {{increase over the}} years of the number of rear-end collisions with cars, while the total number of injury accidents has remained more or less at the same level. The increase of traffic, especially regarding cars and vans, without expanding the road network, is thought to be the main contributing factor. Though these {{accident data}} imply the existence of an increasing WAD-problem in The Netherlands, they are not sufficient prove, since they contain no injury details, but only some general indication of injury severity. Besides, they are very much incomplete with respect to non-fatal accidents, especially for accidents in the lower injury severity ranges, where the majority of whiplash cases is to be expected. By using existing medical registration systems, such as the national registration system of in-patients, and the registration of casualties treated at emergency departments (A&E) of hospitals, as well as data from periodical national surveys on accidents, WAD related to traffic casualties can be quantified. It is estimated that annually at least 14, 000 car occupants suffer from whiplash injury after a car crash. While (police based) accident data lack information about injury, the medical registration systems do not provide sufficient and reliable accident data. The type of collision (for instance: rear-end accident) is not specified, though the mode of transportation of a casualty fortunately is. One could therefore say that the two main registration types (police based accident data, and injury registrations) do still not prove the existence of a causal link between rear-end accidents of cars and whiplash injury of occupants. It is also not clear from the injury data whether the WAD-problem is increasing or not. Preventing the occurrence of whiplash injury could well {{be the best way to}} deal with WAD, since both diagnosis and cure of the this type of neck-injury is still a matter of much debate. Head restraint systems are the most obvious means of preventing neck-injury in rear-end accidents, apart of course from preventing rear-end accidents to occur at all, through infrastructural or other means. The proper use of existing head restraints therefore became a matter of concern, especially after periodical surveys indicated that the (vertical) adjustment of the restraint was not good. It was also found that Dutch people are even more at risk than other (European) people since the average height of the Dutch is greater. SWOV calculated that the requirements for vertical <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> restraints in the existing (European) regulations should be upgraded by 10 centimetres (from 75 cm to 85 cm) in order to better protect still only 95 % of the Dutch males. This goal is not yet reached, despite considerable efforts of Dutch officials at the international vehicle legislative field. Only limited data on the costs of whiplash injury is available, mainly based on third party vehicle insurance cost data. The annual cost of injury payments only is estimated at about 350 million guilders, which represents about one third of the total injury payments by insurance companies with respect to injury from accidents in The Netherlands. There are many different disciplines involved in research concerning WAD: medical, technical, biomechanical, to mention just a few. Up to now, these research activities in The Netherlands have been mainly uncoordinated isolated efforts to help improve the situation or at least to describe the problem. In view of the great amount of money involved, and in view of the estimated current magnitude of the personal and societal problem of WAD, a more coordinated national effort to counteract WAD seems very appropriate, especially since a further increase of the problem may be expected as road traffic increases.

Methods: The study group consisted of convenient samples of 100 healthy volunteers (aged 18 - 25 years), with {{an equal number of}} female and male subjects who had no history of mixed racial parentage. 22 linear measurements were taken twice from 22 landmarks over six craniofacial regions. Results: The Malays shared many similar sizes of measurements with the Singaporean Chinese. Their left eye fissure length and mouth width (ch-ch) were almost identical for both genders. However, Malay females had an upper lip height (sn-sto) (left) and ear width (pra-pa) similar to Singaporean Chinese females. Six other measurements, viz. the head width (eu-eu), head circumference (on-op), face height (n-gn), lower face height (sn-gn), (left) eye fissure height (ps-pi), cutaneous upper lip height (sn-ls) and cutaneous upper lip height (ls-sto), were 0. 4 - 4. 3 mm less in the Malays. Measurements for another four parameters, viz. the length <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> (g-op), biocular width (ex-ex), lower vermillion height (sto-li) and (left) ear length (sa-sba), were 0. 5 - 3. 6 mm higher in the Malays.
