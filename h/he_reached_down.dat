25|$|In 1177, John led an {{invasion}} of Ulaid (an area roughly encompassing what is today County Antrim and County Down). <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>Down</b> (modern day Downpatrick), drove off Ruaidrí Mac Duinn Sléibe, King of Ulaid (died 1201), consolidated his conquest, and ruled {{with a certain amount}} of independence for about a quarter of a century. Although the precise date of the marriage between John and Affrica is unknown, the union itself may well have attributed to his stunning successes in Ireland. Certainly, decades later in the reign of Guðrøðr's son and successor, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1229), John received significant military support from the Crovan dynasty, and it is not improbable that Guðrøðr himself supplied similar assistance. In the 1190s, John also received military assistance from Guðrøðr's kinsman Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, Earl of Carrick (died 1250). Like Guðrøðr, Donnchad was a grandson of Fergus, and it possible that John's marriage to Affrica accounts for Donnchad's cooperation with him.|$|E

50|$|As <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to {{pull the}} hairpin from Sasaki's neck, Kagenobu tells Eliza {{that when he was}} a child his mother told him that there isn’t any honor in {{throwing}} one’s life away but he finds it less honorable in turning and running away from trouble that the person has created. Eliza agrees with Kagenobu but declares the two have each other now and nothing else, except for their revenge. Together they stand back to back, as The Hand strikes.|$|R
5000|$|Scott's debut single, [...] "Makin' This Boy Go Crazy", was {{released}} in June 2013. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song {{three and a half}} stars out of five, writing that [...] "the native Louisianan can really rumble when <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to hit the low notes, but his performance won’t leave female fans tingling like the greats." [...] It charted for 10 weeks on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, peaking at number 54 in April 2014. The song's music video premiered on CMT in December 2013.|$|R

5000|$|Liz's {{love for}} Leamas overcomes her moral disgust, and she accompanies Leamas {{to a break}} in the wire {{fronting}} the Berlin Wall, from which they can climb the wall and escape to West Berlin. Leamas climbs to the top but, as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to help Liz, she is shot by a Mundt operative as a [...] "final touch" [...] to make the plot perfect and to avoid any possible suspicion of Leamas' escape. She falls and as Smiley calls out to Leamas {{from the other side of}} the wall, he hesitates. Then he climbs back down the Eastern side of the wall, to be shot and killed too.|$|R
5000|$|Known as [...] "la mecedora" [...] in Mexico. The {{opponent}} is {{face down on}} the mat, with the attacker bending both of their legs up and tucking their ankles against his armpits. <b>He</b> then <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> and grabs both of the opponent's arms before sitting down, [...] "rocking" [...] back and forth and stretching the back.|$|R

60|$|Warily <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down.</b> He did {{not know}} Lucy's {{strength}} was spent. He feared she might yet escape. With hard, quick grasp he caught her, lifted her, threw her over the King's back. He forced her down.|$|E

50|$|In Ireland, {{the story}} of Niamh and Oisin has a similar theme. Oisin {{falls in love with}} the {{beautiful}} Niamh and leaves with her on her snow white horse, bound for Tir Na nOg - the land of the ever-young. Missing his family and friends, he asks to pay them a visit. Niamh lends him her horse, warning him never to dismount, and he travels back to Ireland. But 300 years have passed; his family and fellow warriors are all dead. When Oisin encounters some men trying to move a boulder, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to help them, the girth of the horse's saddle snaps, and he falls to the ground. Before the watching eyes of the men, he becomes a very, very old man.|$|R
40|$|When {{a person}} has lost an arm or leg in an accident, or {{as the result of}} surgery, he {{typically}} continues to feel the lost extremity as if it were still present. On first awaking from the anaesthesia such a patient may not believe that the leg has actually been removed until he can convince himself by looking under the covers. Even once he knows beyond doubt that it is gone, the foot of the amputated leg may itch and, as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to scratch it, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> for an empty space. He may feel the bed sheets on the arm or leg, he may feel a mild, perhaps pleasant tingling, a phenomenon which Henderson and Smyth regard as basic (Henderson and Smyth, 1948), or, more rarely, he may have pain. He may feel that he can wiggle his fingers or toes, flex o...|$|R
50|$|The {{final scene}} of the video shows Jeremy striding into class, tossing an apple to the teacher, and {{standing}} before his classmates. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> and draws back his arm as he takes a gun {{out of his pocket}} (The gun only appears onscreen in the unedited version of the video). The edited version cuts to an extreme close-up of Jeremy's face as he puts the barrel of the gun in his mouth, closes his eyes, and pulls the trigger. After a flash of light the screen turns black. The next shot is a pan across the classroom, showing Jeremy's blood-spattered classmates, all completely still, recoiling in horror. The video ends on a shot of a dangling blackboard, on which all the harsh terms and phrases seen earlier had been scrawled.|$|R
60|$|The man stooped {{over the}} case; handed barrels, stock, and {{fore-end}} to Strickland, who fitted all together, yawning dolefully. Then <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to the gun-case, took a solid-drawn cartridge, {{and slipped it}} into the breech of the '360 Express.|$|E

25|$|On 2 April 1804 Curlew, sloop of war, {{reportedly}} sailed {{from the}} North Seas station with a squadron, and store ships, to Boulogne. Two days later, Curlew recaptured Stert, of Cardiff, William Pettigrew, master. Pettigrew reported, when <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> The <b>Downs,</b> that the privateer that had captured him off Dungeness had {{that same day}} taken nine vessels that she had sent to Dunkirk.|$|R
5000|$|Saam {{was known}} for the {{occasional}} slip-up on the air. For example, he once opened a game by saying, [...] "Hello, Byrum Saam, this is everybody speaking." [...] (This goof has also been credited to other announcers, including Lindsey Nelson and Phil Rizzuto.) Prior to Game 5 of the 1959 World Series, when Mel Allen introduced the NBC Radio audience to [...] "amiable, affable, able Byrum Saam", a distracted Saam unthinkingly replied, [...] "Right you are, Mel Allen." [...] Once, Saam created a beheading when Alex Johnson, the Phillies' left fielder, chased a fly ball: [...] "Alex Johnson is going back. He's going back, back. His head hits the wall. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down,</b> picks it up, and throws into second base." [...] (Jerry Coleman made a similar statement about Dave Winfield in a San Diego Padres broadcast.) ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{he put it}} {{into the}} breast-pocket of his coat, the wooden chest caught his eye. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> it <b>down</b> and tried the lid. The lid opened in his hand, and {{disclosed}} the compartments and the bottles placed in them. One of the bottles rose higher by an inch or two than any of the others. He drew that one out first to look at it, and discovered--the [...] "blue-glass bottle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I just {{happened}} to notice," [...] replied Mr. Drill. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> as though {{to take up the}} carpet-bag which he had placed by the side of his chair, and then, apparently thinking better of it, leaned back in his seat and eyed Mr. Gunnill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there is}} no use in doing that, Miss Ford," [...] {{answered}} the manager. [...] "The fire is out, and it is perfectly safe on board now. You had better come up here. I will help you," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> with his hand.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time that he had ever {{asserted}} himself in her presence, and even then he did it half apologetically, yet with an unconscious dignity in his manner that became him well. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> as he spoke and took up his pick and his bundle, and turned to go.|$|E
50|$|In {{the neutral}} section before the {{official}} {{start of the}} race, Fabio Felline crashed. <b>He</b> was <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to adjust something {{at the front of}} his bike; his wheel then jammed and the bike stopped abruptly. Felline was thrown over the handlebars and hit the ground face first. He broke his nose and suffered a fracture {{at the base of his}} skull. The injuries put him out of both the Amstel Gold Race and the rest of the Ardennes week.|$|R
5000|$|That night, Spike meets Dracula as he {{emerges from}} a manhole. He demands his eleven pounds, which is {{compensation}} {{for a copy of}} Dracula that Vlad had burned a hundred years ago. Dracula sneers that not only did Spike pay a ridiculous sum for the book at the time, but now that he is demanding compensation he is failing to consider the value of the book today, or even the effect of inflation on the original price. Spike says he doesn't care about any of that, he just wants what's his. He had only bought the book because Drusilla wanted it. Dracula smiles and says that [...] "love makes fools of us all." [...] He produces twenty American dollars - the equivalent of eleven British pounds - and throws it to the street. He then transforms into a bat and flies away as Spike mocks him. As Spike gloats about being the winner, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to pick up the money, and his hand passes right through it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> sat <b>down,</b> <b>reached</b> {{haphazard}} for a book, {{opened it}} in middle {{and began to}} read; but after going conscientiously over two lines he lost his hold on the print completely and {{did not try to}} regain it. He thought-- ...|$|R
60|$|The old {{man made}} no answer at the moment, but {{going to a}} rack upon the wall, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> a Wesley-Richards falling-block rifle that hung there. Then {{he sat down in}} a wooden {{armchair}} that faced the French window opening on to the verandah, and beckoned to her to come to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I-- I can't!" [...] gasped Miss Harrow. And now {{the youth}} {{saw that she}} was almost paralyzed from fright. She clung desperately to the window sill, evidently unable to move. Clinging to the ladder with his left hand, Tom placed his right foot on the window sill, and then <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> and caught the teacher under the arm.|$|E
60|$|At Usanga's order one of {{the blacks}} lifted her {{from the ground and}} carried her to the machine, and after Usanga had clambered aboard, they lifted her up and <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> and drew her into the {{fuselage}} where he removed the thongs from her wrists and strapped her into her seat and then took his own directly ahead of her.|$|E
5000|$|The wrestler {{begins the}} hold by {{standing}} over a face-down opponent. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> {{to pull the}} opposing wrestler up slightly, sits on his back, and places both of his opponents' arms across his thighs, usually locking at least one by placing the arm {{in the crook of}} his knee. Once the wrestler has the opponent's arms where he wants them, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> forward, cups his hands in a manner so that his fingers are interlocking, then grabs the opponent's chin in his cupped hands and leans back, pulling on the opponent's chin and applying pressure to his back. A camel clutch can also refer simply to a rear chinlock while seated on the back of an opponent, without placing the arms on the thighs. The move was invented by Gory Guerrero in Mexico, where it was called la de a caballo (Horse-mounting choke), but got its more common name from Ed Farhat, who wrestled as [...] "The Sheik" [...] and used it as his finisher. Rusev performs a variation he calls The Accolade, where he stomps on his opponent's back before applying the hold. A standing variation of the camel clutch is also used, with this variation popularized by Scott Steiner in the late 1990s as he used it as his finisher dubbed the Steiner Recliner.|$|R
6000|$|Dryer and dryer; {{the very}} leaves smelt of saw-dust; till at last I drank some water, and went at it again. But soon I {{had to give}} it up for lost work; and thought that the old backgammon board, we had at home, {{lettered}} on the back, [...] "The History of Rome" [...] was quite as full of matter, and a great deal more entertaining. I wondered whether Mr. Jones had ever read the volume himself; and could not help remembering, that he had to get on a chair when <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> it <b>down</b> from its dusty shelf; that certainly looked suspicious.|$|R
60|$|In feverish haste {{he set his}} torch up in a {{crack of}} the rocks and {{commenced}} to scoop the sand from the pocket with his hands. Out came another nugget and then another, and then half a dozen, all {{about the size of}} hickory nuts. Then the pocket grew so deep and narrow <b>he</b> could not <b>reach</b> <b>down</b> into it. <b>He</b> took up the crowbar, and with it ascertained that the opening with the sand and nuggets was of unknown depth.|$|R
