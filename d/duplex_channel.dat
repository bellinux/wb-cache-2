50|$|A radiotelegraph <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> {{comprises}} a transmitter and {{a receiver}} combination (transceiver) together {{with one or}} two antennas at a station {{on one end of the}} channel coupled with a similar complement for the station on the other end; in contrast to a simplex channel, it is possible for both stations on a <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> to send information to each other. Duplexing protocols refer to the manner in which a <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> is shared by the respective operators; <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> operators may employ either full-duplex or half-duplex protocols.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> can be {{operated}} {{only one way}} at a time it is styled a half-duplex channel and half-duplex protocols must be used. If a <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> can be shared and operated in both directions simultaneously it is styled a full-duplex channel and full-duplex protocols may be used.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> was {{composed}} of 2 frequencies. 416 of these were in the 824-849 MHz range for transmissions from mobile stations to the base stations, paired with 416 frequencies in the 869-894 MHz range for transmissions from base stations to the mobile stations. Each cell site used a different subset of these channels than its neighbors to avoid interference. This significantly {{reduced the number of}} channels available at each site in real-world systems. Each AMPS channel had a one way bandwidth of 30 kHz, for a total of 60 kHz for each <b>duplex</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

50|$|The mid-symbol {{listening}} and interruption capability {{provided by the}} short but ubiquitous Morse code silent periods during QSK or full break-in operation on half-duplex radiotelegraph channels creates the illusion of apparent continuous two-way contact allowing radiotelegraph operators {{to feel as if}} they are sharing a full <b>duplex</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some systems use {{a mix of}} the two where radios use duplex as a default but can {{communicate}} simplex on the base station channel if out-of-range. In the US, the capability to talk simplex on a <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> with a repeater is sometimes called talk-around, direct, or car-to-car.|$|E
50|$|<b>Duplex</b> <b>channel</b> systems {{transmit}} {{and receive}} on different discrete channels. This defines systems where equipment cannot communicate without some infrastructure {{such as a}} repeater, base station or Talk-Through Base. Most common in the US is a repeater configuration where a base station is configured to simultaneously re-transmit the audio received from mobile units. This makes the mobiles, or hand-helds, able to communicate amongst one another anywhere within reception range of the base station or repeater. Typically the base or repeater station has a high antenna and high power, which allows much greater range, compared with a ground vehicle or hand-held transceiver.|$|E

5000|$|Marine VHF mostly uses [...] "simplex" [...] transmission, where {{communication}} {{can only}} take place in one direction at a time. A transmit button on the set or microphone determines whether it is operating as a transmitter or a receiver. Some channels, however, are [...] "duplex" [...] transmission channels where communication can take place in both directions simultaneously when the equipment on both ends allow it (full duplex), otherwise [...] "semi-duplex" [...] is used. Each <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> has two frequency assignments. Duplex channels {{can be used to}} place calls on the public telephone system for a fee via a marine operator. When full duplex is used, the call is similar to one using a mobile phone or landline. When semi-duplex is used, voice is only carried one way at a time and the party on the boat must press the transmit button only when speaking. This facility is still available in some areas, though its use has largely died out with the advent of mobile and satellite phones. Marine VHF radios can also receive weather radio broadcasts, where they are available.|$|E

50|$|A radiotelegraph simplex channel, {{operates}} {{by sending}} information {{in one direction}} only (e.g. a broadcast channel). A simplex channel may comprise only a transmitting station with only a transmitter and a transmit antenna on the sending end coupled with a receiving station comprising only a receive antenna and a receiver on the receiving end. Such simplex channels may be contrasted with <b>duplex</b> <b>channels</b> which have fully equipped stations on both ends and are capable of sending information in both directions.|$|R
50|$|To protect {{receiver}} circuitry, radiotelegraph channels {{on nearby}} frequencies and antennas must operate in so-called half-duplex mode wherein the stations {{at either end}} alternate between transmitting and receiving (because e.g. simultaneous transmit and receive is simply not possible). To support two way conversations on half <b>duplex</b> <b>channels,</b> analog radio frequency hardware antenna switches must be provided at each station location to connect and disconnect the transmitters and receivers from their antennas whenever the channel transmission control is turned over from one station to the other.|$|R

Furthermore, lattices space-time coded multiple-input multiple-output half <b>duplex</b> <b>channel</b> is applied. The main goal is to increase the throughput of the system by selecting multiple number of relays. The selection criteria depends on the maximum decoding delay at relays where the system implements a decoding time-out algorithm at each relay.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} Gaussian half duplex relay channel, where the relay node can not {{transmit}} and receive {{at the same}} time. The main contribution lies in showing that both Partial-Decode-Forward and Compress-Forward achieve the Cut- Set upper bound to within a constant gap regardless of the channel parameters. This provides a closed form characterization of the Generalized Degrees-of-Freedom (gDoF) of the channel, which for certain channel parameters is strictly smaller than the gDoF of the full <b>duplex</b> <b>channel.</b> Half duplex channels can convey information through the random switch between the receive and retransmit phases; this work shows numerically that random switch achieves larger rates compared to deterministic switch, which is usually considered in the literature...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} protocol for the delay-limited fading ARQ single relay half <b>duplex</b> <b>channel.</b> The source is using an ARQ retransmission protocol to send {{data to the}} relay and the destination.

The proposed protocol exploits two kinds of diversity: (i) space diversity available through the cooperative (relay) terminal, which retransmits the source’s signals, (ii) ARQ diversity obtained by leveraging the retransmission delay to enhance the reliability. The performance characterization {{is in terms of}} the achievable diversity, multiplexing gain and delay tradeoff for a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Then, by letting the source’s power level vary over the retransmission rounds, we show the benefits of power control on the diversity...|$|E

Our protocols have an initial phase where the parties interact with a cryptocurrency network, that then enables them to interact only among themselves {{over the course of}} playing many poker games in which money changes hands. The high efficiency of our protocols is achieved by harnessing the power of stateful contracts. Compared to the limited expressive power of Bitcoin scripts, stateful contracts enable richer forms of interaction between standard secure computation and a cryptocurrency. We formalize the stateful contract model and the security notions that our protocols accomplish, and provide proofs using the simulation paradigm. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation in Ethereum/Solidity for the stateful contracts that our protocols are based on.

We show that the use of systematic network coding using XORs can provide the same or close to the same performance in terms of completion time as a random linear network coding scheme that uses a large field size, with the added advantage of requiring fewer and simpler operations during the decoding process. We show that the average computation required to decode using systematic network coding in an erasure channel grows as O(M 3 P e 3), where M is the number of original packets being coded together, and P e is the packet erasure probability. This means that systematic network coding requires P e − 3 times fewer operations on average than random linear network coding with the same field size. I...|$|R
