30|$|The topics {{covered in}} the study have {{previously}} been {{covered in the}} lectures of the introductory programming course. The pre/post-tests had six questions each and were administered on paper. The tests contained same types of questions from Table 1 (worth one mark each), and additionally a code-writing question (worth five marks). The maximum mark for both tests is ten marks. The participants were not accustomed to doing any programming exercises on paper, because all lab quizzes and assessment in the course are completed using computers. Therefore, the code syntax on their pre/post-test were not strictly penalized. There were no multiple-choice questions in the pre/post-tests. The code-writing question provided the problem description, test cases with expected output, function <b>definition</b> <b>statement,</b> and the docstring. The code-writing questions had an ideal solution of five LOCs (without any comments), which {{was the reason for}} a maximum of five marks on this question. The participants did not receive scores for the problems completed in the tutor.|$|E

The proposed method extracts plain words that are the most similar to the headword from the dictionary <b>definition.</b> The <b>definition</b> <b>statements</b> describe the headword using plain words; therefore, paraphrasing by replacing the headword with the most similar word in the dictionary definition is expected to be an accurate means of lexical simplification. However, {{it is difficult to determine}} which word is the most appropriate for the paraphrase. The method proposed in this paper measures the similarity of each word in the <b>definition</b> <b>statements</b> against the headword and selects the one with the closest semantic match for the paraphrase. This method compares favorably with the method that acquires the target word from the end of the <b>definition</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R

40|$|The history {{behind the}} title and the formula is {{explained}} below after the following <b>definition,</b> <b>statement</b> of theorem and proof. Recall that a DGLA is an algebra A over a field k with grading A = ⊕n∈ZAn along with a bilinear map [.,. ]: A × A−→A (bracket) and a linear map ∂: A−→A (differential) for which ∂ 2 = 0 while • (1) (symmetry of bracket) [b, a] = −(− 1) |a||b | [a, b]; • (2) (Jacobi identity) [[a, b], c] = [a, [b, c]] − (− 1) |a||b | [b, [a, c]]; • (3) (Leibnitz rule) ∂[a, b] = [∂a, b] + (− 1) |a | [a, ∂b]. Note that the three properties above are valid only for homogeneous elements a, b and c of A (that {{is an element of}} ⋃ n An), and |a | ∈ Z denotes the grading. The bracket and differential are required to respect the grading, in that for homogeneous elements, |[a, b] | = |a | + |b | while |∂a | = |a | − 1. The adjoint action of A on itself is given by ade(a) = [e, a] and acts on the grading by ade: An−→An+|e|. In this notation (2) and (3) can be rewritten as • (2 ′) (Jacobi identity) ad[a,b] = [ada, adb] • (3 ′) (Leibnitz rule) [∂, ada] = ad∂a in which the brackets on the right-hand side refer to the (signed) commutator of operators defined by [x, y] = xy − (− 1) |x||y | yx where the product is composition of operators and the grading |x | of a (homogeneous) operator is the shift in grading which x induces. Thus the gradings of ade and ∂ are |e| and − 1, respectively. An element x of A− 1 is said to be flat iff ∂x + 1 [x, x] = 0. Any v ∈ A 0 2 defines a flow on u ∈ A− 1 by du dt = ∂v − adv(u) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} comparison {{was made}} of two treatment conditions: a <b>definition</b> <b>statement</b> and a strategy statement, and a no treatment condition. The effect of these variables on the conceptual skills of economically deprived preschoolers was investigated using six geometric configurations. Twelve preschoolers were selected {{to participate in the}} study which was conducted in their Head Start classroom. The study utilized an Adapted Alternating Treatment Design with four experimental phases. Phase I was the no treatment condition, Phases II and III were the experimental conditions, and Phase IV was best treatment only condition. Graphic representations of subject performance data was used to portray intersubject and intrasubject variability. Results indicated that the performance of 10 out of 12 (83 %) of the subjects improved with analytic assistance and 8 out of 12 (66 %) improved using a strategy statement. A limited number (16 %) improved using a definition or after receiving no treatment. The findings also demonstrated that the treatment condition producing the best performance in the presence of the other conditions, continued to produce the best performance in the absence of the other conditions. It was concluded that the use of analytic assistance with strategy statements proved most beneficial with economically deprived children. Additionally, the strategy condition caused increased response latency and reduced off task behavior (i. e. looking around the room or playing with test materials). The few children who performed best during the definition condition or no treatment condition made more errors and objected to using a strategy statement. In sum, this investigation demonstrated that while a small proportion of children responded to other conditions, the majority of the children's performance improved following analytic assistance using strategy statements. More specifically, most of the children performed best with strategy statement assistance; for some, however, such assistance appeared to interfere with the learning task. Perhaps the most important practical implication of the present study was that in teaching concepts, strategies and definitions should not be viewed so much as different types of analytic assistance, but as different amounts of prompting. Thus, teachers should fade from strategy to definition assistance and, finally, to no assistance. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
