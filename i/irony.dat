5|$|Some {{commentators}} see {{the conservative}} readings of Forrest Gump as indicants {{of the death}} of <b>irony</b> in American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film's humor and <b>irony</b> relies on the assumption of the audience's historical (self-) consciousness.|$|E

5|$|Emma Thompson (born 15 April 1959) is a British {{actress and}} screenwriter. She {{is known for}} her portrayals of reticent women, often in period dramas and {{literary}} adaptations, and playing haughty or matronly characters {{with a sense of}} <b>irony.</b> She is considered one of Britain's most accomplished actresses.|$|E

5|$|Freki {{is also a}} name {{applied to}} the monstrous wolf Fenrir in the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá. Folklorist John Lindow sees <b>irony</b> {{in the fact that}} Odin feeds one Freki at his dinner table and another—Fenrir—with his flesh during the events of Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using <b>irony</b> so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, so as to be indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of <b>irony</b> in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare wrote {{seventeen}} comedies {{that incorporate}} many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as jokes, puns, parody, wit, observational humor, or the unexpected effect of <b>irony.</b> One-liner jokes and satire {{are also used}} to comedic effect in literature. In farce, the comedy is a primary purpose.|$|E

50|$|The {{themes and}} style of the stories are very much carried on from Catherine Lim's first {{collection}} of short stories, Little <b>Ironies.</b> They focus on the snobbery, selfishness, prejudice and ignorance of the characters.

5|$|According to The Economist, Apollo {{succeeded in}} {{accomplishing}} President Kennedy's goal {{of taking on}} the Soviet Union in the Space Race, and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased {{the superiority of the}} capitalistic, free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the <b>irony</b> that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Cox {{has also}} said {{that there is a}} massive <b>irony,</b> both in the film and in real life, that a {{religion}} so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality. In fact, Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay. Nevertheless, a major theme of Latter Days is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.|$|E

The prosecutors found Kids Can Say No! on YouTube and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional <b>irony,</b> but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not admitted as evidence.|$|E

5|$|Music {{journalist}} Peter Doggett {{notes the}} <b>irony</b> {{of the surf}} music reference. In 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to contributing to the soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing scenes with David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, {{who claimed to have}} met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|Rachel — A {{young woman}} who {{operates}} a business that breeds lab mice and lives with psychological conditions on the Autism spectrum.

5|$|The novel {{frequently}} changes narrative perspectives, using {{a significant}} amount of interior monologue, direct speech and dramatic <b>irony.</b> Though employing an omniscient narrator who occasionally describes the events from a broad perspective, the novel tends to shadow a handful of characters closely, principally Stephen Wraysford, Isaebelle Azair, Micheal Weir, Jack Firebrace and Elizabeth Benson.|$|E

5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work {{with a touch of}} social <b>irony.</b> His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|Austen's novels {{appeared}} in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of Pride and Prejudice, quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen {{was not well}} known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works {{as part of the}} English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and <b>irony.</b> European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{lamented the}} effects of his drug use and noted the <b>irony</b> that the drugs did not do much to improve the {{consistency}} of his performances. On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness. After proving that he had recovered, Gibbs was offered a short term contract at the club, which was eventually extended. Newly relegated Watford finished 13th of 24 teams in 1996–97. They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted the <b>irony</b> that having been released as an injury concern, he ended up playing more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Canada {{has been}} {{influenced}} by British, French, and indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity. During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. Canadian humour {{is an integral part}} of the Canadian identity and is reflected in its folklore, literature, music, art and media. The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are <b>irony,</b> parody, and satire. Many Canadian comedians have archived international success in the American TV and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of <b>irony,</b> modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

40|$|This article explores {{a number}} of <b>ironies</b> of {{globalisation}} that have transpired from observations of working with communities in Fiji and Kiribati. These <b>ironies</b> illustrate the nexus that exists between culture and globalisation in the Pacific region. The overarching message {{of this article is}} that major shifts are transpiring across the Pacific region under the currents and pressures of globalisation. These currents are often viewed as essential for countries within the region to modernise, but they also present serious challenges and can undermine culture and agency, particularly for women, as explored in the examples provided throughout this article. These examples – considered throughout as <b>ironies</b> – are drawn from participant observation and working with {{a number of}} communities in Fiji and Kiribati in 2011 - 2012. Together these <b>ironies</b> highlight the clashes that unravel when transnational forces impact on local communities throughout the region...|$|R
