5|$|Montville {{suggested}} that Ruth is probably even more popular today {{than he was}} when his career home run record was broken by Aaron.

Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight each evening during the season.

5|$|On March 3, 1873, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a bill re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, to the <b>delight</b> <b>of</b> much of the state population and the concern of the Minstrels. The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With {{the help of the}} newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about to erode his Republican base out from under him.|$|E

5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, to the <b>delight</b> <b>of</b> her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be}} better to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in medias res, while Piz (Chris Lowell) and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{are at a}} party, a bloodied Veronica stumbles to Piz’s {{door and}} collapses. The episode flashes back to two days earlier. As the Lilith House celebrates {{the end of the}} Greek system, Logan (Jason Dohring) {{abruptly}} breaks up with Veronica. Weevil helps Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) fix his TV. A man comes into the Dean’s office and implicitly threatens to remove his funding if the Greek system stays closed. The Dean tells Keith (Enrico Colantoni) to track his wife, and Veronica sobs in the shower due to her breakup with Logan. The Dean unexpectedly reinstates the Greek system, to the <b>delight</b> <b>of</b> Dick (Ryan Hansen). The Dean and Veronica spot a classified ad that states that a mysterious person will find his next victim at a party.

5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the <b>delight</b> <b>of</b> white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; {{he did not understand}} that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
5|$|In early 1623, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham {{decided to}} seize the {{initiative}} and travel to Spain incognito, to win the infanta directly, but the mission proved an ineffectual mistake. The infanta detested Charles, and the Spanish confronted them with terms that included the repeal of anti-Catholic legislation by Parliament. Though a treaty was signed, the prince and duke returned to England in October without the infanta and immediately renounced the treaty, much to the <b>delight</b> <b>of</b> the British people. Disillusioned by the visit to Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James's Spanish policy upon its head {{and called for a}} French match and a war against the Habsburg empire. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham, who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Lionel Cranfield, by now made Earl of Middlesex, when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost. The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare or fund a war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to finance a war against Spain, a stance that was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.|$|E

5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the country, to the <b>delight</b> <b>of</b> the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as {{an officer in the}} Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E
5|$|While Shekhar {{is off to}} Darjeeling on a {{business}} trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita {{about the loss of}} his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he got married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the <b>delight</b> <b>of</b> his mother.|$|E
