5|$|Although Jevons {{originally}} {{focused on}} the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, water usage and interpersonal contact. It <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most widely known paradox in environmental economics.|$|E
5|$|Communally {{roosting}} birds, the dusky woodswallow has {{a variety}} of chattering calls which are used in certain situations. The most distinctive of these calls <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> one which is used when a predator or intruder approaches, which consists of a harsh mobbing call to warn others.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are known}} to carry pollen and {{regularly}} visit flowers, so are regarded as potential pollinators {{for a number of}} flowering plants. One flower in particular, Rhizanthella gardneri, is regularly pollinated by foraging workers, and it <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> only Orchidaceae flower in the world to be pollinated by termites.|$|E

5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's French and Spanish colonial {{history has}} {{given it a}} culture {{distinguished}} by French, Spanish, Creole, African and Catholic heritage, in addition to later British and American influences. It is distinguished from all other cities {{in the state of}} Alabama. The annual Carnival celebration <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> best example of its differences. Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period.|$|E
5|$|Not listed <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> {{most notable}} 'acquisition', the 2001 merger with Time Warner to become AOL Time Warner. Due {{to the larger}} market {{capitalization}} of AOL, it gained ascendancy in the merger, with its executives largely displacing Time Warner's despite AOL's far smaller assets and revenues. AOL was spun off as its own independent company from Time Warner in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most interesting. It {{is written in}} B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{examples}} of Palladianism in Ireland is the Castletown House, near Dublin. Designed by the Italian architect Alessandro Galilei (1691–1737), it <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> only Palladian house in Ireland to have been built with Palladio's mathematical ratios, {{and one of the}} three Irish mansions which claim to have inspired the design of the White House in Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Webley is a top-break {{revolver}} {{and breaking}} the revolver operates the extractor, which removes cartridges from the cylinder. The Webley Mk I service revolver was adopted in 1887 and the Mk IV, rose to prominence during the Boer War of 1899–1902. The Mk VI, introduced in 1915 during the First World War, <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> best-known model.|$|E

5|$|The {{documents}} record official military {{matters as}} well as personal messages to and {{from members of the}} garrison of Vindolanda, their families, and their slaves. Highlights of the tablets include an invitation to a birthday party held in about 100 AD, which <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> oldest surviving document written in Latin by a woman.|$|E
5|$|The tombs were {{constructed}} and decorated by the {{workers of the}} village of Deir el-Medina, located in a small wadi between this valley and the Valley of the Queens, facing Thebes. The workers journeyed to the tombs through various routes over the Theban hills. The daily lives of these workers are quite well known and are recorded in tombs and official documents. Amongst the events documented <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> first recorded worker's strike, detailed in the Turin strike papyrus.|$|E
5|$|Acorn Antiques <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> best-remembered regular {{item from}} the series. It was a spoof soap opera set in an {{antiques}} shop, which, despite its provincial high-street status, manages to supply an unending stream {{of works by}} Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always played by the same two actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based it on the long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E

5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full {{power of his}} genius. This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The Overture <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|Hebel was {{interested}} in botany, natural history and other subjects. His literary work began with Allemannische Gedichte, which <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar stories in the Badischer Landkalender, and later with Rheinländischer Hausfreund (Rhenish family friend), but a dispute between Catholics forced him to resign {{as editor of the}} calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish priest was never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse and other writers have praised his works.|$|E

5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This {{was the first}} royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E
5|$|Many {{novels of}} the Lost Generation feature {{scenes in the}} Ritz, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is The Night and Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Noël Coward's play Semi-Monde <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most notable work {{covering}} the hotel in detail, following the escapades of an extravagant, promiscuous fictional Paris elite between 1924 and 1926. In the Bret Easton Ellis novel Glamorama, a group of supermodels turned terrorists plant a home-made bomb in the Ritz, resulting in its destruction. In The Da Vinci Code, the protagonist, Robert Langdon, stays at the hotel while in Paris, as do Andrea Sachs and Miranda Priestly in Lauren Weisberger's The Devil Wears Prada. The final chapter of Ian Fleming's James Bond novel From Russia, with Love is set at the hotel. The villain, Rosa Klebb, stays in room 602 and engages in a battle with Bond which results in her death. In Julian Fellowes' novel Snobs (2004), those attending Earl Broughton's pre-marriage bachelor party are accommodated at the Ritz.|$|E
5|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90cm (35in) {{in length and}} weighing up to 28kg (62lb), whereas females were 70cm (28in) and weighed 17kg (37lb). This is only 60% {{of the weight of}} a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.|$|E
