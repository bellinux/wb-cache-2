Heat and light from sun, along with solar based resources such as wind and wave power, hydroelectricity and biomass, account for most the available flow of renewable energy. Solar power is becoming increasingly popular, as environment friendly renewable energy source that produces no pollution, requires minimal maintenance and energy from the sun is free. There many technologies for solar energy application through the residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and transportation sectors. The solar energy wide variety of technologies is flexibility. One types of Solar Energy system is Solar Photovoltaic Power. Photovoltaic Standalone system, Photovoltaic Hybrid system, Photovoltaic Grid Tie system is types of Solar Photovoltaic Power. Photovoltaic system use cell to convert sunlight into electricity. The PV cells consist {{of one or two}} layer of a semi conducting material, usually silicon. When light shines on the cell it creates an electric field across the layers causing electricity flow.

40|$|Laser {{devices are}} an {{integral}} part of the technological background of our modern society. Laser light transmits data over the fiber-optical cabling of internet, reads DVD disks and bar codes, cuts metals and plastics, etc. Many applications, such as refractive eye surgery, breakdown spectroscopy, and various time-resolved methods, rely on optical power that is delivered in short pulses. The bite of laser light on matter is also greatly enhanced by pulsing. Q-switching is a method of producing pulsed laser light by periodically suppressing the optical feedback of a laser resonator. In passive Q-switching the cycle is run without any external control by the process of saturable absorption. Miniature passively Q-switched lasers are small solid-state devices that produce nanosecond long, <b>kilowatt</b> <b>peak</b> power pulses of coherent light at near-infrared wavelengths. They are simple to fabricate and have found applications, e. g., in range finding, micro machining and spectroscopy. In this thesis the operation of miniature passively Q-switched lasers is studied both theoretically and experimentally. Also, nonlinear frequency conversion of the laser output is applied in microstructured optical fiber. The conversion allows for the laser output to be extended into wavelengths at which no laser sources exist. In miniature lasers the cavity decay time and the thermalization time of the laser multiplets are at close to equal. In order to take this into account, the normalized geometric rate-equation model of passively Q-switched lasers is refined to include the thermalization process. As an experimental case, a high peak power 1123 nm Nd:YAG laser is demonstrated, and the nonsaturable loss level of the Cr:YAG saturable absorber crystal is measured at the laser's wavelength. The output spectrum of a passively Q-switched and frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser is converted to narrowband visible light ranging from blue to red wavelengths by means of nondegenerate four-wave mixing, and to a broad spectrum of blue light by means of cascaded cross-phase modulation. The output spectra are adjusted by the group-delay profile of the microstructured optical fiber. A broadband source continuously covering the wavelength range of 420 - 1300 nm is realized by pumping a microstructured optical fiber with a miniature gain-switched Ti:Sapphire laser...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the North Carolina's PV Bonus Team was to develop and demonstrate a commercially viable, building-integrated, photovoltaic system that, {{in addition to providing}} electricity, would capture and effectively utilize the thermal energy produced by the photovoltaic array. This project objective was successfully achieved by designing, testing, constructing, and monitoring two roof integrated photovoltaic systems [...] one on a Applebee's Restaurant in Salisbury, North Carolina and the second on a Central Carolina Bank in Bessemer City, North Carolina. The goal of Innovative Design is to now use these successful demonstrations to facilitate entry of building integrated, pv/thermal systems into the marketplace. The strategy was to develop the two systems that could be utilized in future applications. Both systems were designed and then constructed at the North Carolina Solar Center at North Carolina State University. After extensive testing at the North Carolina Solar Center, the systems were moved to the actual construction sites and implemented. The Applebee's Restaurant system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of a low sloping, south-facing sunspace roof that typically incorporated clay tile. After monitoring the installed system for one year it was determined that the 1. 2 <b>kilowatt</b> (<b>peak)</b> system produces an average peak reduction of 1 kilowatt (rated peak is 1. 7 kiloWatts), saves 1, 529 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and offsets 11, 776 kilowatt-hours of thermal energy savings used to pre-heat water. A DC fan connected directly to eight of the thirty-two amorphous modules moves air through air passages mounted on the backside of the modules and into a closed loop duct system to a heat exchanger. This heat exchanger is, in turn, connected to a pre-heat hot water tank that is used to heat the water for the restaurant. The Central Carolina Bank system was designed to substitute for the roof assembly of the drive-in window area of the bank. The design featured a triangulated truss that incorporated ten crystalline photovoltaic modules {{on one side of the}} truss and a reflective panel on the opposite side. The system used a utility interactive, programmable inverter and a 18. 9 kilowatt-hour battery bank. The system is designed so that a DC fan, connected to one of the modules, forces ambient air across the back side of the modules. In the summer this heat is vented to the outside but in the winter this heated, fresh air is introduced into the building as ventilation air. Like the Applebee's system, the design allowed the entire roof assembly to be constructed off-site, tested, and then shipped to the site in pie-assembled, large components. During the first full year of operation, the 2. 2 kilowatt (rated peak is 2. 7 kilowatts) system contributed to an average peak reduction of. 9 kilowatts. The system, as designed, saves 2, 576 kilowatt-hours of electricity and offsets 3, 473 kilowatt hours (of a potential thermal benefit of 10, 172 collected kWhs) of thermal energy savings that is used as fresh air make-up in the colder months.

With the recent {{development of cloud computing}} technologies, everyone from Fortune 500 companies to defense organizations believes that there are tangible benefits to moving operations to the cloud. This idea is particularly resonant with Naval Surface operations, consistent with the downsizing of personnel on surface ships, and with the Chief of Naval Operations vision for information systems to be agile, relevant, and cost effective. By building a scalable private cloud model that utilizes a centralized server for computer processing, thin client workstations were compared to current thick client architectures onboard surface vessels. With multicore server processors developed to handle several tasks simultaneously, the ability to consolidate and virtualize multiple servers and workstations aboard naval vessels is now possible from a blade server chassis.

50|$|The table below {{shows the}} total cost in US cents per kWh of {{electricity}} generated by a photovoltaic system. The row headings on the left show the total cost, per <b>peak</b> <b>kilowatt</b> (kWp), of a photovoltaic installation.

The column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kWh expected from each installed kWp. This varies by geographic region because the average insolation depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight. It also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon. Panels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude, and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing solar declination. Solar tracking can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight, thereby raising the total energy output.|$|R
