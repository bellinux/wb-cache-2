There are many <b>generic</b> <b>chain</b> stores in the town centre and in the Roundswell Business Park, on the western fringe of the town. Tesco has several stores in the area, which includes a Tesco Extra hypermarket, a large Tesco superstore. There is also a Sainsbury's superstore, a Lidl supermarket. And, the multi-million pound redevelopment of the former Leaderflush Shapland works at Anchorwood Bank, and the surrounding area, is creating a conservation area near the River Taw, hundreds of new homes, a commercial retail area with new shops, restaurants and leisure facilities. A new Asda superstore and petrol filling station is part of the redevelopment. The whole scheme will be completed by the end of 2017, and the new Asda store opened in November 2016. However, by far the largest employer in the region is local and central Government. The two main government employers in the area are the Royal Marines Base Chivenor, 3 mi west of the town, and North Devon District Hospital, 1 mi to the north.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze and {{systematic}} theoretical findings which are based on Porter´s <b>Generic</b> <b>Chain</b> of Values in regards to the area of supporting activities. Supporting activities were long time at the margin of interest, both social and economic. Today, they represent important competitive advantage of an enterprise, both on the side of providers of such services and also on the side of receiving customers. Management activities known as planning, organization, human resources management or controlling form in the partnership of participants of such chain of values, a strategic coalition both chains of activities. Once Michael E. Porter established a direct link between this coalition and the added value, entrepreneurial economic thinking and also the management have received an impetus for replacing the denomination of Steering of Supporting Activities by "Facility Management" as it has been usual in the USA and in other developed countries. This term is being used in this country since 1991.

40|$|We {{introduce}} two {{new concepts}} {{designed for the}} study of empirical processes. First, we introduce a new Orlicz norm which we call the Bernstein-Orlicz norm. This new norm interpolates sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential tail behavior.

Secondly, we introduce <b>chaining</b> and <b>generic</b> <b>chaining</b> along a tree. These simplify the well-known concepts of <b>chaining</b> and <b>generic</b> <b>chaining.</b> The supremum of the empirical process is then studied as a special case.

40|$|Flexibility {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the design of space missions. Algorithms able to derive the dynamical equations for a <b>generic</b> <b>chain</b> of flexible and rigid bodies have been developed in the past decades so that accurate dynamic simulations of large multi-body chains are possible. On the other hand control devices are getting more and more sophisticated so that the guidance of satellite platforms equipped with last generation fly-wheels is a quite complex task. In order to develop control laws, restrictive hypotheses are commonly introduced to make the equation of motion as simple as possible: rigid body dynamic, small angular velocities, small deforma-tions, symmetric appendages bending, reduced degrees of freedom and many other hypotheses lead to as many different mathematical models. Simple modeling leads to fast simulations and allows an easier design of attitude steering laws or vibration sup-pression controls. In this work a mathematical model describing the full non-linear dynamic of a flexible satellite platform equipped with a system of rigid fly-wheels is developed in an explicit form. The equations are than compared to those obtained by applying standard multi-body analysis. The advantages of having an explicit form of the equations in term of the sole state of the central platform (the state of the wheels is considered as a control) are particularly attractive for control design. The set of ordinary differential equations written returns widely used model when restrictive hypotheses are introduced and has to be used in connection to a preliminary Finite Element Method analysis in order to evaluate the structural invariants...|$|E

40|$|These {{lecture notes}} consist of three chapters. In {{the first chapter}} we present oracle inequalities for the {{prediction}} error of the Lasso and square-root Lasso and briefly describe the scaled Lasso. In the second chapter we establish asymptotic linearity of a de-sparsified Lasso.

A similar line of reasoning can be invoked to derive bounds in sup-norm for the Lasso and asymptotic linearity of de-sparsified estimators of a precision matrix. In the third chapter we consider chaining and the more general <b>generic</b> <b>chaining</b> method developed by Talagrand. This allows one to bound suprema of random processes.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{classical}} chaining bounds on the suprema of random processes {{in terms of}} entropy numbers can be systematically improved when the underlying set is convex: the entropy numbers need not be computed for the entire set, but only for certain "thin" subsets. This phenomenon arises from the observation that real interpolation {{can be used as}} a natural chaining mechanism. Unlike the general form of Talagrand's <b>generic</b> <b>chaining</b> method, which is sharp but often difficult to use, the resulting bounds involve only entropy numbers but are nonetheless sharp in many situations in which classical entropy bounds are suboptimal. Such bounds are readily amenable to explicit computations in specific examples, and we discover some old and new geometric principles for the control of chaining functionals as special cases.
