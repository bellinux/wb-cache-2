5|$|In July 1989, it was {{announced}} that SBG was to be privatised. In an effort to make <b>Kelvin</b> Scottish more attractive on the approach to privatisation, <b>Kelvin</b> was merged with Central Scottish to form <b>Kelvin</b> Central Buses Ltd. Upon the merger, <b>Kelvin</b> Scottish ceased trading as a stand-alone subsidiary.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 a new fares scheme, the Glasgow Gold Card, was introduced, {{offering}} weekly {{travel on}} all SBG routes in the city. A <b>Kelvin</b> AEC Routemaster bus was painted in a gold livery to advertise the ticket, and {{remained in the}} livery until withdrawal by <b>Kelvin</b> Central in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In July 1989 <b>Kelvin</b> was {{merged with}} Central Scottish to form <b>Kelvin</b> Central Buses. This company {{was sold to}} its {{employees}} on privatisation, before being taken over by Strathclyde Buses. It {{is now part of}} First Glasgow.|$|E

The supposed explanation is nothing but an entry in the gardener's catalogue of hypothesis that constitutes the theory.

5|$|The {{hydrogen}} fusion {{process is}} temperature-sensitive, so a moderate {{increase in the}} core temperature {{will result in a}} significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result, the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from 4 million <b>kelvin</b> for a small M-class star to 40 million <b>kelvin</b> for a massive O-class star.|$|E
25|$|The color {{temperature}} of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from an ideal black body is defined as its surface temperature in <b>kelvins,</b> or alternatively in mireds (micro-reciprocal <b>kelvins).</b> This permits {{the definition of a}} standard by which light sources are compared.|$|R

5|$|<b>Kelvin</b> Central {{was renamed}} to First Glasgow (No.2) Ltd. in May 1998, {{with a red}} livery adopted. Its {{operations}} {{are now part of}} First Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this change {{is that the new}} definition makes the definition of the <b>kelvin</b> depend on the definitions of the second, the metre, and the kilogram.|$|E
50|$|Some {{have argued}} that the Rayleigh-Plesset {{equation}} described above is unreliable for predicting bubble temperatures and that actual temperatures in sonoluminescing systems can be far higher than 20,000 <b>kelvins.</b> Some research claims to have measured temperatures as high as 100,000 <b>kelvins,</b> and speculates temperatures could reach into the millions of <b>kelvins.</b> Temperatures this high could cause thermonuclear fusion. This possibility is sometimes referred to as bubble fusion and is likened to the implosion design used in the fusion component of thermonuclear weapons.|$|R

5|$|Operating {{from its}} head office in Bishopbriggs and depots in Old Kilpatrick, Milngavie, Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth, Stepps and Cumbernauld, <b>Kelvin</b> Scottish had an {{operating}} area bounded by Loch Lomond to the west, Cumbernauld to the east, the Campsie Fells {{to the north}} and the River Clyde to the south. <b>Kelvin</b> was the largest operator in Dunbartonshire and north east Glasgow, and was responsible for urban, rural and interurban services. Its operating area had previously been served by Central SMT and Walter Alexander & Sons (Midland).|$|E
5|$|Psychologist Kris <b>Kelvin</b> (Donatas Banionis) {{is being}} sent on an {{interstellar}} journey {{to evaluate whether}} a decades old space station should continue to study the remote oceanic planet Solaris. He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father (Nikolai Grinko) and retired pilot Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky). They watch filmed testimony of Berton describing a four-meter-tall child on Solaris, only to have this sighting dismissed as a hallucination {{by a panel of}} scientists. After burning his personal mementos, <b>Kelvin</b> departs Earth to meet the Solaris scientists who have made reports that are equally confusing.|$|E
5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to <b>Kelvin,</b> as the <b>Kelvin</b> equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension {{is greater than}} standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That {{is to say that}} when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.|$|E

5|$|The company {{expanded}} its operations in Glasgow prior to bus deregulation in 1986. New services {{were introduced in}} competition with Strathclyde Buses, many using AEC Routemaster double-deckers operated by conductors. <b>Kelvin</b> suffered from vehicle maintenance problems, and on two occasions was forced to hire vehicles from other companies to ensure operation of all its routes. After <b>Kelvin</b> lost money in 1987, the depot at Milngavie was closed and many routes withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of places of worship in Summer Hill. St Patrick's Catholic Church was built in 1874, and is the oldest known {{building}} in the suburb. There is also a small primary school associated with the church and located next to it. The building was originally a private home known as <b>Kelvin</b> Grove, and owned by Mrs Jane Drynan. Much of the exterior of the church is original but none of the internal walls were retained when the building was converted into a church. Following Drynan's death, <b>Kelvin</b> Grove was owned or leased by a succession of different people, including the Haberfield real-estate developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s <b>Kelvin</b> Grove may have been used as a nursing home. The first mass was celebrated in <b>Kelvin</b> Grove on St Patrick's day 1946, giving the church its name.|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} into the expansion, when the {{temperature}} was about a billion (one thousand million) <b>kelvin</b> and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. <b>Kelvin</b> had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company <b>Kelvin</b> Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E
