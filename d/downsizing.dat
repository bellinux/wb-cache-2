5|$|As the {{occupation}} duties were accomplished, {{the occupation}} force continued to downsize as more troops returned home and their units were inactivated. By 1950, the Sixth Army had left Japan, and the occupation force {{was reduced to}} the Eighth United States Army commanding two corps and four under-strength divisions; the I Corps, commanding the 24th Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Division, and the IX Corps, commanding the 1st Cavalry Division and the 7th Infantry Division. IX Corps had been moved to Sendai as the occupation forces shifted {{as a result of}} the <b>downsizing.</b> As part of further <b>downsizing,</b> IX Corps was inactivated on 28 March 1950, and its command responsibilities were consolidated with other units.|$|E

5|$|The {{scale of}} UBS's losses led to renewed {{calls for the}} global {{separation}} of commercial banking from investment banking, while media commentators suggested UBS should consider <b>downsizing</b> its investment bank and potentially rebranding it under the resurrected S.G.

25|$|Upon {{introduction}} of the <b>downsized</b> GM A-body (later G-body) mid-size cars in 1978, the X-body and <b>downsized</b> A-platform had similar exterior dimensions. The roomier and more modern <b>downsized</b> A-bodies outsold their X-body counterparts.|$|R

5|$|Reformed {{after the}} battle, the brigade {{took part in}} {{operations}} in Denmark {{at the end of}} the war and then in 1946 joined the 6th Airborne Division on internal security duties in Palestine.

30|$|In contrast, the {{advancement}} of the petrol-fuelled engine has received considerably less attention during the past 20 years. For example, {{there were a few}} automakers only early offering cars with <b>downsized</b> turbocharged petrol-fuelled engines like Mitsubishi and Volkswagen. Just recently, other automobile manufacturers have marketed <b>downsized</b> petrol engines.|$|R
25|$|Sales were up {{modestly}} to 26,138 for 1977 {{and then}} fell to 20,535 for 1978, although this was strictly a stopgap model until the all-new E-body cars would be ready for 1979. To date, 1977 and 1978 Rivieras are considered a rare find since it was only produced for two model years on the <b>downsized</b> GM B platform before the 1979 redesign on the FWD E-platform (there are two reasons why the B-platform was used—the existing 1976 B-platform was phased out for the <b>downsized</b> variant where RWD E-platform vehicles were produced on the B-chassis. Buick could have continued production although the frame stamping facilities and undercarriage/chassis components were being retooled in late 1976 for <b>downsized</b> B-platform production where the FWD E-platform did not <b>downsize</b> since they were produced on a separate assembly line.|$|R
5|$|The three vinyl LPs and booklet were housed {{inside a}} deep orange-coloured box. The 1991 CD release placed the cover photo {{on a white}} background, however, replicating {{the front of the}} {{original}} album booklet. As commentators noted in 1991, the necessary <b>downsizing</b> to CD dimensions meant that much of the effectiveness of the booklet photography was lost, not least because the contents had also been trimmed down to just 36 pages.|$|E
5|$|We are {{introduced}} to Michael Scott (Steve Carell), the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, a paper-production company that is currently under threat of facing <b>downsizing.</b> The news is delivered {{to him by the}} Vice President of Northeast Sales, Jan Levinson-Gould (Melora Hardin), who, along with the other employees, can barely tolerate Michael’s foolish antics.|$|E
5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless <b>downsizing.</b> Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War in 1989, the US {{government}} conducted careful {{restructuring of}} national priorities and of the defense establishment. Fort Lewis, ideally located to act as a base for mobilization and power projection into the Pacific region, was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall. Thus, while most of the Army was <b>downsizing,</b> Fort Lewis began to grow, however, several tenant units such as the 9th Infantry Division were downsized.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Radford {{proposed}} protecting several military {{programs from}} funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but {{the proposal was}} leaked to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other Joint Chiefs of Staff again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force <b>downsizing</b> directly to Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, who agreed to pass them along to Eisenhower.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{rejected a}} report prepared {{by an independent}} committee that called for a massive <b>downsizing</b> of the fishing industry. The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry. At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million price tag was too expensive. Opposition parties and union leaders were {{highly critical of the}} government for dismissing the report, with NDP leader Lorraine Michael calling for Minister Jackman to resign.|$|E
5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about <b>downsizing</b> measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it rejects the card. When he inserts a manual override key, he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, {{paranoia}} {{takes over}} {{the members of the}} office as <b>downsizing</b> rumors swirl. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) forms a Survivor-esque alliance with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) against the other employees—later adding Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) also. Meanwhile, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arranges a morale-boosting birthday party for Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery)—although her birthday is more than a month away. Michael agonizes over writing the perfect greeting in her birthday card, and in the end, his joke falls flat, ruining the party.|$|E

5|$|It {{was after}} the Cold War that III Corps was acclimated {{to the role of}} primary counteroffensive force for the US Army. With the <b>downsizing</b> of other major Army formations, III Corps gained command of heavier units, {{including}} the 1st Cavalry Division while the XVIII Airborne Corps took charge of rapid-deployment for emergency contingencies, including the 101st Airborne Division and 82nd Airborne Division. III Corps took charge of the heavy units designed for large, conventional offensive actions.|$|E
5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff <b>downsizing</b> took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E
