In later interviews, the actors had varying views on the reasons behind the show's cancellation. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to All Souls was primarily positive, with commentators praising its use of <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> paranormal elements. Critics compared the show to other <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> science-fiction television series, specifically The X-Files {{and the work of}} American writer Stephen King.|$|E

5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> the rock lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Comprising {{the nascent}} motion picture genres of <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> science fiction, the {{nightmare}} picture provoked individual psychological terror in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological terror in its science fiction manifestations. The two main types of pre-Code horror pictures were the single monster movie, and films where masses of hideous beasts rose up and attacked their putative betters. Frankenstein and Freaks exemplified both genres.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Beyond the Mountains of Madness too was {{announced}} in November 2002 and has been scheduled for the Xbox and PC release {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2004. It would be a sequel to Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness, inspired by the Call of Cthulhu RPG campaign of the same title. The game was to be a survival <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> first-person shooter set in the 1930s and taking place in varied locations including Germany and Antarctica, and its protagonist would be a Miskatonic University archaeologist Robert Naples attempting to stop the Nazi occultist search for the ruins of the Elder Things' city.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich's {{reputation}} suffered {{further damage}} when his imagery {{was adopted by}} a number of Hollywood directors, such as Walt Disney, built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.|$|E
5|$|Kneale's {{remaining}} television {{work was}} written for ITV. His first script for ITV was the one-off play Murrain, made by the network's Midlands franchise holders Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1975. The play, a horror piece based around witchcraft, led the following year to a series called Beasts, a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> the macabre. It featured some well-known actors such as Martin Shaw, Pauline Quirke and Bernard Horsfall, but did not gain a full network run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different timeslots and some in different sequences.|$|E

5|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. Within {{the month of}} its release in North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies were sold, with {{the greatest number of}} sales in North America. English-language critics praised the atmosphere, graphics, story and monster designs of Silent Hill 2, but criticized the controls as being difficult to use although much improved over its predecessor. Since its release, the game has appeared on several critics' top lists for its story and use of metaphors, psychological <b>horror</b> <b>and</b> taboo topics as well as its soundtrack/sound design. Because of the success of Silent Hill 2, a sequel titled Silent Hill 3 was released in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The first story-driven game expansion, Nightmare in North Point, was {{released}} in October 2012.

After incinerating his little finger, Cat returns to the underworld and Shen's girlfriend is freed.|$|E
