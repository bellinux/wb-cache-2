For example, Article 42(7) of the 1982 Treaty of Lisbon specifies that [...] "If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power".

Skeptics have decried the rise of CSDP as a new security pillar, arguing that it is an attempt to balance against NATO and the US. I argue that this criticism is false. A comparison of two CSDP military operations, European Union Force Chad/CAR (EUFOR Tchad/RCA) and European Union Force Althea (EUFOR Althea), shows that operational success is heavily dependent on the EU’s ability to use NATO assets through the Berlin <b>Plus</b> <b>agreement.</b> While EU security integration has progressed, it continues to suffer from a significant capabilities gap; without access to NATO capabilities, CSDP military operations face many challenges.

In spite of insufficient capacities and capabilities, Europe must deal with new security threats and challenges (e. g. terrorism, organised crime, {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destruction, cyberthreats). Therefore, a possible solution provides close collaboration between the EU and NATO in the field of collective defence and security. The main reason represent 21 European countries, which are members of both organizations. Hence, this bachelor's thesis focuses on identification of barriers and prospective perspectives to improve this relation. Its structure composes of three main parts. The first part analyses strategic documents and aims of both organizations, preconditions for collaboration set down in the Berlin <b>Plus</b> <b>agreements</b> and reactions to the economic crises.

There are many limitations to closer EU-NATO relations, among the most significant is ranked the still unsolved Turkey- Cyprus dispute, forming the real obstacle to strategic partnership between Union and Alliance, and also the issue regarding the potential establishment of the European permanent operational headquarter. The current deadlock is foremost caused by Turkey strictly interpreting the Berlin <b>Plus</b> <b>agreement.</b> The situation became much worse with the accession of southern Cyprus into the EU resulting in nearly absolute impossibility of any official contacts due to the restrictions to collaborate under the agreement only for the members of NATO or PfP.

The Treaty of Brussels is considered the precursor to NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in Washington, D.C. in 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states, as well as the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Greece and Turkey joined the alliance in 1952, and West Germany did the same in 1955. Spain entered in 1982. In 1999, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland became NATO members. Finally, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia joined in 2004. In 2009, Croatia and Albania joined. In 2008, Ukraine and Georgia were told that they will also eventually become members. The Republic of Macedonia's application process is finished, but it is blocked by Greece. Thus, 22 out of 28 NATO states are among the 28 EU members, another two are members of the EEA, and one more is an EU candidate and {{also a member of the}} European Union Customs Union.|$|R
