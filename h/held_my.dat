[...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze <b>held</b> <b>my</b> eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E

Laura Burrows, also of IGN, said that the fourth-season premiere [...] "introduced a new side of George". Armstrong said of O'Malley and Stevens' reconciliation: [...] "George and Izzie are finally on the old Grey's Anatomy road to ruin. And I admit {{this is a good}} lesson in Grey's viewing as well as life: Sit tight if you hate something, as nothing is permanent." [...] Armstrong also commented that the [...] "sparkling" [...] {{friendship}} development between Lexie and O'Malley [...] "won her over". The following year, Monfette observed of O'Malley's lack of screen time: [...] "His growing interest in trauma surgery at the side of Owen leads to an interesting development in the finale, but the character is virtually side-lined this season." [...] Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times said of the character's death: [...] "The time-lapse episode was an interesting choice, and though we sped through six weeks of mourning in two hours, it didn't feel rushed to me. I'm not sure the show could have <b>held</b> <b>my</b> attention for another season of crippling sadness." ...|$|E

When asked how he had done in those games, Moon replied, [...] "I've done all right. I've <b>held</b> <b>my</b> own." [...] Moon joined 63 other players in the 2010 National Heads-Up Poker Championship at the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. He paid the $20,000 buy-in from his {{personal}} funds. Moon was paired against online qualifier William Huntress {{in the first round}} of the tournament on March 5. ESPN writer Gary Wise said Huntress stood [...] "as good a chance of toppling an invited player as any qualifier ever has", and questioned why Moon participated in the tournament given Moon's past claims of disinterest in media exposure and sponsorship. However, PokerNews.com writer Mickey Doft predicted Moon would do well in the tournament due to his unpredictable play. Moon defeated Huntress when his [...] held out against Huntress' [...] The flop was , giving Huntress the better draw, but Moon won with king-high when another club failed to come on the turn or river, advancing Moon to the second round. He lost in that round to Annie Duke, whose three kings bested Moon's two pair of queens and tens. Duke went on to win the tournament.|$|E

[...] "Little Dude" [...] {{was the first}} entry in the series to have been storyboarded by prop and {{character}} designer DeForge. He wrote on his official Tumblr that, [...] "Cole and Adam Muto basically <b>held</b> <b>my</b> hand through the whole process, and were both incredibly patient with me." [...] Starting with [...] "Love Games", Ristaino was promoted from lead character designer to storyboard artist. Guest artist Falk, creator of the animated series Untalkative Bunny, storyboarded the episodes [...] "Shh!" [...] and [...] "Root Beer Guy". The former was dedicated to Armen Mirzaian who was a storyboard artist for earlier episodes in the series. Mirzaian {{died in a car}} accident on February 21, 2013 at the age of 35. Regular storyboardist Castuera had to take off two storyboard rotations due to an art show, and so her partner, Moynihan, worked with German cartoonist Wellmann on [...] "The Suitor" [...] and [...] "Wizards Only, Fools"; the two co-operated on their storyboards via Skype and Google+ Hangout.

500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I <b>held</b> <b>my</b> breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E

Bourguiba, who had always criticized {{repudiation}} in Islam, stated in 1973, that the reason of the divorce was [...] "futile".

2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and when I finally got to match point I went for a winner and I hit it.
