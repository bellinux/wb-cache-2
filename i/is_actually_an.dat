Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else.

5|$|Whether an epikleros who {{was married}} {{at the time of}} her father's death was {{required}} to divorce her current spouse and marry the anchisteia is unclear. Most modern historians have come to the conclusion that this was only required if the epikleros had not yet had a son that could inherit the grandfather's estate. The clearest evidence is from the Roman playwright Terence, in his play Adelphoe, which includes a plot element involving a claim that a girl <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> epikleros. Although the play was written in the 2nd century BCE, Terence adapted most of his plays from earlier Athenian comedies, which makes it slightly more reliable as a source. And common sense argues that if a son had already been born to an epikleros, there was no need to parcel out the epikleros to a relative in order to provide a male heir to the grandfather's estate. Although the anchisteia had the right to marry the epikleros, he was not required to do so, and could refuse the match or find another spouse for the heiress. It was also possible for the husband of an epikleros, who was not her anchisteia, to buy off the anchisteia in order to remain married to his wife. Such cases were alleged by the speaker of Isaeus' speech Isaeus 10 as well as a character in Menander's play Aspis.|$|E
