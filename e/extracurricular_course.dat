In 1898–1899, together with Deodat Țăranu, he was also curator of the Medical and Naturalist Society, criticized by researcher N. A. Bogdan for their inconsistent, [...] "haphazard" [...] work at the numismatics collection. Nevertheless, in 1901 Bujor became the Society's secretary general, serving until 1905 or 1906. His research took him outside the country: with Voinov and Racoviță, he worked as a marine biologist at Banyuls-sur-Mer and at the Stazione Zoologica of Naples, returning with a rich collection of biological samples, which he donated to his faculty. In 1903, with Alexandru Popovici and Leon Cosmovici, he held a pioneering <b>extracurricular</b> <b>course</b> on parasitology. He then followed up with other such courses, in embryology and histology. From 1904, his articles promoting physical culture among the peasantry were hosted by Cultura Română, the popular pedagogy magazine, with Bujor serving as president of the Iași Society for Gymnastics, Sport and Music. His efforts in that field led to the establishment of multi-sport venues in Copou Park, and the first ever chalet on Ceahlău Massif.|$|E
40|$|Physics is {{not very}} popular with both {{children}} and adults alike. Studies show {{that one of the}} causes for the current situation might be a discordance between topics taught in the school curriculum and experiences from everyday life. Children are also too often put in passive roles during classes which, in many teachers’ opinions, is mostly due to lack of appropriate experimental equipment. A common remedy for both issues can be found in using toys in physics education. Many toys oﬀer opportunities to explore interesting physics principles that children are mostly unaware of during play. In this way, toys can bridge the gap between everyday life experiences and the process of learning physics laws during formal classes. Using physics toys in classroom activities can help children assume an active role which, in return, boosts their motivation and improves their attitude towards physics education. The Diploma thesis will describe some opportunities for the usage of toys in physics education with its advantages and disadvantages. Also, some conclusions from various studies dealing with this topic will be outdrawn. The criteria for the selection of toys suitable for use in class will be formed. Toys will be described in brief, sorted according to topics included in the curriculum for physics education at lower secondary level. Further, selected toyswillbeshownwithashortdescriptionoftheirunderlyingphysicsprinciples and their possible usage in performing experiments. Magnetic toys will be presented in more detail together with extended usage scenarios in class. Some results acquired during hands-on experiments with toys on an <b>extracurricular</b> <b>course</b> in natural sciences which we led, will be presented.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the development, implementation {{and evaluation of}} a model of game education, here understood as the process of educating about digital games. The pivotal characteristic of this model is in placing the claimed influences of gaming (e. g. cognitive gains, increase of aggression) at {{the centre of the}} content to be learnt. It is based on five principles, namely, that game education can be Informative, Critical, Empowering, Emancipatory, and Dialogic, hence the ICEED Game Education Model. The ICEED model was inspired by both the academic literature and the first study of this thesis, in which 15 University students were interviewed regarding the influences of their gaming practices. Later the model was operationalised in a course named Reflective Gaming Course (RGC), which addresses a series of positive and negative influences of gaming according to the ICEED model. Using a Design Based Research methodological framework, the course was implemented, evaluated and improved as an <b>extracurricular</b> <b>course</b> for adolescents in a secondary school and then in a college, {{in the second and third}} study of this thesis. The contributions of the thesis can be divided into four sections. The first is the ICEED Game Education Model, which offers a novel and useful conceptual understanding of what game education can be, hence expanding the possibilities of how game education is conceived. The second section is the Reflective Gaming Course, which is a concrete course plan that can be reproduced or adapted by researchers or practitioners. This course was improved through two implementations, and it was found to be a useful and promising practice. By providing accounts of the course, the process involved, the outcomes achieved, the successes and failures, it is hoped to provide detailed information to inform future projects. The third section is a discussion of the findings with regard to the difficulty of transforming the academic literature on the influences of gaming into useful content for players. This highlights a limitation on the part of research in this area, which often overlooks the potential of its claims to inform players and encourage them to improve their gaming practices. The fourth section concerns knowledge about players’ perspectives about the influences of their gaming practices, complementing other similar studies. In the perspective of participants, some of the topics were perceived as more important (e. g. tangential learning, cognitive gains, excessive gaming) others less so (e. g. connections with school, aggression, stereotypes). Their perspectives also illustrate the recurring absence of opportunities in which players can problematize their perspectives on the influences of gaming...|$|E

40|$|A presente pesquisa objetivou refletir sobre o uso e os benefícios de atividades lúdicas e de improvisação teatral em fase inicial de aprendizado da língua estrangeira (LE) em contexto institucional. Almejou também demonstrar que a associação Teatro, Jogo e Aprendizagem de línguas realizada de modo sistemático, constante e em função de objetivos precisos estimula e auxilia na apropriação e no desenvolvimento da língua alvo. Para essa reflexão, propomos no primeiro capítulo um {{panorama}} histórico da relação teatro, jogo, educação. No segundo, as questões didáticas que deram abertura a uma prática lúdico - teatral no ensino de LE no século XX e aquelas que norteiam o ensino atual de línguas. No terceiro capítulo, apresentamos algumas características do Lúdico e de práticas teatrais adaptáveis ao contexto de ensino de LE (jogo teatral, de papéis e simulação global). O quarto capítulo é dedicado ao relato da experiência lúdico-teatral realizada em janeiro e fevereiro de 2007 com duas turmas de nível 01 do Curso Extracurricular de Francês oferecido pelo departamento de Letras Modernas da Faculdade de Filosofia Letras e Ciências Humanas da Universidade de São Paulo. Os resultados demonstraram que o uso de atividades lúdicas e de improvisação teatral no ensino do Francês contribuiu significativamente no aprendizado da LE e na criação de um ambiente de descontração e de interação favoráveis à expressão na língua-alvo, onde a desinibição e o medo do erro deram pouco a pouco lugar ao prazer de se comunicar-se na LE. Assim, foram contemplados aspectos referentes à aprendizagem, à relação sujeito-LE, à relação e interação aluno-aluno/ professor, tendo sido de extrema significação para a aquisição da língua-alvo e para as relações interpessoais. This research aims at reflecting {{about the}} use {{and the benefits of}} playful activities and of theatrical improvisation for a communicative and interactive teaching of a foreign language, and to demonstrate that the association Theater, Play and Apprenticeship of methodical way brings contributions to the apprentices and the benefits go beyond the apprenticeship of a foreign language. In the first chapter a historic overview of the relation theater, play, education is proposed. In the second chapter, we present the educational questions that arose with the use of games and theatrical activities in the teaching of a foreign language in the century XX and the questions about the current teaching of languages. In the third chapter, some characteristics of the Playful one and of theatrical adaptable practices to the context of teaching (theatrical play, role-play-games and global simulation) what contributed to the construction of our improvised practice, besides the benefits of this transposition found in the literature. The chapter four is dedicated to the theatrical-playful report of the experience carried out in the level 01 of the <b>extracurricular</b> <b>course</b> of intensive French (FLE) of the FFLCH-USP between January and February of 2007. In this application, we notice that the playful use of a methodology - improvised in the teaching of FLE allowed a better apprenticeship, an environment of favorable casualness to the expression in the target-language and of integration between the participants, which contemplates aspects referring to the apprenticeship, to the relation Subject-LE, to the relation and interaction of student-student. We could also conclude that the plays and the improvisations create a favorable environment to the experimentation in the LE and that shyness and the fear of making a mistake are replaced slowly by the pleasure of learning the targetlanguage, of communicating with other people...|$|E

The process towards achieving these outcomes and the instructional methods and strategies might vary among universities. The authors acknowledge that there are different ways to reach the targeted learning outcomes and that there is a diversity of curricular approaches, structures and methodologies among Australian dental schools, which are enriching and desirable educationally.

It comprised a hundred dentists from the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, University of São Paulo (HRAC/USP), Brazil, from different dental specialties. A questionnaire was applied to evaluate their knowledge of medical emergencies/urgencies from June through September 2011. The questionnaire was anonymous, confidential and constructed with closed questions and either yes-no or multiple-choice responses. Results showed that most professionals (87 %) were trained in basic life support (BLS), but only 43 % considered themselves capable of providing first aid and performing the necessary maneuvers. Most participants (94 %) claimed that they knew the difference between medical urgencies and emergencies, and 69 % had BLS training in their undergraduate courses, as opposed to 37 %, during their specialization. Some participants (23 %) mentioned that they had received knowledge of the subject during <b>extracurricular</b> <b>courses</b> and/or graduate courses (12 %).

40|$|In {{the sphere}} of forms and manuscripts, {{the passage of time}} causes the {{dynamics}} of the concept of ‘rare' applied to collections that once time didn’t consider such in the reaches of academic libraries in Latin American, essentially generated in 20 th century. Surviving numerous adverse factors, among them the lack of interest and necessity of the environment in which they were originally created and valued, diverse types of materials usually are only conserved -in best of the cases- in warehouses, disuse areas or discarded of the general collections, in other cases in some office of the academic personnel, or in some personal collection. Starting with traditional concept of ‘rare’, the concept is a new configuration in this type of collections, discussing the diverse incident factors which take to affirm that these collections have become rare: Extinction supposed, Shortage, Absence of conservation, Disuse and Purge. Some detected typologies are detailed, such as the produced by the request of the academic activity (case of theses, minor thesis and field research projects), original forms for curricular and <b>extracurricular</b> <b>courses</b> (programs, manuals, tests), as well as the produced by the institutional activity (case of internal printed of all type).
