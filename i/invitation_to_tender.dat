25|$|The {{project is}} {{estimated}} to cost £16.42 billon (£9.86 bn at 2013 prices). A notice was published on 28 February 2014 in the Official Journal of the European Union asking for expressions of interest in building the trains. On 9 October 2014 TFL published a shortlist of those (Alstom, Siemens, Hitachi, CAF and Bombardier) who had {{expressed an interest in}} supplying 250 trains for between £1.0 billion and £2.5 billion, and on the same day opened an exhibition with a design by PriestmanGoode. The fully automated trains may be able to run without drivers, but the ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying it would affect safety. The <b>Invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tender</b> for the trains was issued in January 2016; the specifications for the Piccadilly line infrastructure are expected in 2016, and the first train is due to run on the Piccadilly line in 2022.|$|E

Currently, the project of the first phase is considered to follow a PPP scheme which might be extended for constructing the whole new line.

In March, LKAB again applied for permit to operate their own trains in Norway and stated that they would only join a joint venture if they were the majority owner. On 8 June, LKAB established a Swedish and a Norwegian subsidiary dedicated to rail transport.

25|$|Improved {{services}} {{along the}} line are called for {{as part of the}} Greater Bristol Metro scheme, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. There is an aspiration for half-hourly services, however due to the large sections of single-track and the congested main line from Temple Meads, such frequency is not currently feasible. However, it is expected that with the four-tracking of Filton Bank, including the Severn Beach line between Temple Meads and Narroways Hill Junction, that there will be sufficient capacity to allow half-hourly services. The <b>Invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tender</b> for the new Greater Western franchise asks bidders to include costs for two trains per hour each direction on the Severn Beach line, one between Severn Beach and , the other between Severn Beach and , both calling at all stations.

25|$|By 2009, {{suggestions}} of a rivalry between Modi and N. Srinivasan surfaced. During 2009–10, Lalit Modi oversaw the bidding process for induction {{of two new}} teams in the Indian Premier League. In December 2009, he inserted two new clauses in the <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>tender</b> (ITT): the bidder should have a net worth of at least USD 1 billion and must provide a bank guarantee of USD 100 million. Modi stated that these clauses protected BCCI's interests. However, other BCCI board members claimed that he was rigging bids to suit Adani Group and Videocon Group, as the new clauses would rule {{out most of the}} other prospective bidders. After the ITT was floated on 22 February 2010, some of the prospective bidders, including Sahara Group and Jagran Group, complained to the BCCI President Shashank Manohar that they were being deliberately kept out of the tendering process. After receiving only two bids, IPL changed the ITT, removing the net worth clause and reducing the guarantee amount to USD 10 million.|$|E
