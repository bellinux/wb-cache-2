40|$|Background: Although disease {{management}} programs are widely implemented, {{little is known}} about their effectiveness. Objective: To determine whether {{disease management}} by physician groups is associated with diabetes care processes, control of intermediate outcomes, or the amount of medication used when intermediate outcomes are above target levels. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Patients were randomly sampled from 63 physician groups nested in 7 health plans sponsored by Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (87 %) and from 4 health plans with individual physician contracts (13 %). Patients: 8661 adults with diabetes who completed a survey (2000 - 2001) and had medical record data. Measurements: Physician group and health plan directors described their organizations' use of physician reminders, performance feedback, and structured care management on a survey; their responses were used to determine measures of intensity of disease management. The current study measured 8 processes of care, including most recent hemoglobin A 1 c level, systolic blood pressure, serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and several measures of medication use. Results: Increased use of any of 3 disease management strategies was significantly associated with higher adjusted rates of retinal screening, nephropathy screening, foot examinations, and measurement of hemoglobin A 1 c levels. Serum lipid level testing and influenza vaccine administration were associated with greater use of structured care management and performance feedback. Greater use of performance feedback correlated with an increased rate of foot examinations (difference, 5 percentage points [95 % CI, 1 to 8 percentage points]), and greater use of physician reminders was associated with an increased rate of nephropathy screening (difference, 15 percentage points [CI, 6 to 23 percentage points]). No strategies were associated with <b>intermediate</b> outcome <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> <b>level</b> of medication management. Limitations: Physician groups were not randomly sampled from population-based listings, and disease management strategies were not randomly allocated across groups. Conclusions: Disease management strategies were associated with better processes of diabetes care but not with improved <b>intermediate</b> outcomes <b>or</b> <b>level</b> of medication management. A greater focus on direct measurement, feedback, and reporting of <b>intermediate</b> outcome <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> of <b>level</b> of medication management may enhance the effectiveness of these programs...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic {{genes are}} {{distributed}} along chromosomes as clusters of highly expressed genes termed RIDGEs (Regions of IncreaseD Gene Expression) and lowly expressed genes termed anti-RIDGEs, interspersed among genes expressed at <b>intermediate</b> <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> not expressed. Previous studies {{based on this}} observation suggested a dual mechanism of gene regulation, where, in addition to transcription factors, the chromosomal domain influences the expression level of their embedded genes. The objectives here were to provide evidence {{for the existence of}} chromosomal regional regulation of transcription in the bovine genome, to analyse the genomic features of genes located within RIDGEs versus anti-RIDGEs and tissue-specific genes versus housekeeping and to examine the genomic distribution of genes subject to positive selection in bovines. Gene expression analysis of four brain tissues and the anterior pituitary of 28 cows identified 70 RIDGEs and 41 anti-RIDGEs (harbouring 3735 and 1793 bovine genes respectively) across the bovine genome which are significantly higher than expected by chance. Housekeeping genes (defined here as genes expressed in all five tissues) were over-represented within RIDGEs but tissue-specific genes (genes expressed in only one of the five tissues) were not. Housekeeping genes and genes within RIDGEs had, in general, higher expression levels and GC content but shorter gene lengths and intron lengths than tissue-specific genes and genes within anti-RIDGES. Our findings suggest the existence of chromosomal regional regulation of transcription in the bovine genome. The genomic features observed for genes within RIDGEs an...|$|R

40|$|CD 59 is a {{complement}} regulatory protein {{and may also}} act as a signal-transducing molecule. CD 59 transgenic mice have been generated using a CD 59 minigene (CD 59 minigene- 1). Although this minigene contained a 4. 6 -kilobase pair 5 '-flanking region from the human CD 59 gene as a promoter, the expression levels of the CD 59 mRNA were substantially lower than those observed in humans, suggesting that CD 59 gene expression might also require other transcriptional regulatory elements such as an enhancer. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the CD 59 gene, we used three cell lines that express CD 59 at different levels. We have identified DNase I-hypersensitive sites in intron 1 in HeLa cells, which express CD 59 at high levels, but not in Jurkat (<b>intermediate</b> <b>level)</b> <b>or</b> Raji cells (low level). Furthermore, cell line-specific enhancer activity was detected in a fragment containing these DNase I-hypersensitive sites.

Directional factors (e. g., visual scanning bias and reading habits) have been proposed to influence visuospatial performance, such as in line bisection and figure drawing. In past studies, bidirectional readers have been less consistent in demonstrating a bias compared to unidirectional readers. Using a straight-ahead pointing task to assess egocentric reference, we compared 14 unidirectional left-to-right readers (Uni-LR) to three bidirectional reading groups that differed in the reading direction of their native language and/or the level of their second language literacy: 16 low-English literate, native right-to-left, bidirectional readers (Lo-Bi-RL), 13 high-English literate, native right-to-left, bidirectional readers (Hi-Bi-RL), and 15 native left-to-right, bidirectional readers (Bi-LR). Participants were asked to point straight-ahead while blindfolded using either a left-to-right or a right-to-left scanning direction to approach the subjective sagittal midline. Uni-LRs showed left-side spatial bias when scanning left-to-right and right-side bias during right-to-left scanning, Bi-LRs and Lo-Bi-RLs (i. e., <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> <b>or</b> less in their second language) demonstrated the opposite pattern, and Hi-Bi-RLs showed left-side spatial bias regardless of scanning direction.

Foremost among these {{is its ability to}} remove the bulk (80 to 90 percent) of the liquid associated with any of the purex-type high level, <b>intermediate</b> <b>level,</b> <b>or</b> mixed waste slurries. The major disadvantage of the evaporator is its current inability to discharge a product that is low enough in liquid content to avoid sticking to the evaporator discharge nozzle. Also, while the indirect indications of the torque required to turn the rotor and the power drawn by the drive motor are indicative of the liquid content of the discharged product, no reliable correlation has been found to cover all of the possible flow rates and feed stock compositions that the evaporator may be required to handle. In addition, no reliable means has been found to indicate {{the presence or absence of}} product flow through the discharge nozzle. The lack of a positive means of moving the product concentrate out of the evaporator and into a high temperature receiver is an undesirable feature of the evaporator.
