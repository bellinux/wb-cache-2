A ring with the property that every ideal is prime is called a <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> ring. The general structure of <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> rings is studied and several examples and constructions of such rings are given. A necessary and sufficient condition for a ring to be <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> is that every ideal is idempotent and the set of ideals is linearly ordered. The only commutative <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> rings are fields. Examples exist, however, showing that noncommutative <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> rings are not necessarily simple rings. Among those examples, we found a nonprimitive <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> ring, a nonsimple <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> ring which is integral over its center, and a nonsimple <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> Noetherian ring. We determine, on the other hand, conditions under which a <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> ring is simple. A <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> ring satisfying a polynomial identity is a central simple algebra, and a <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> right Goldie ring which is integral over its center or is fully right bounded is a simple Artinian ring. Using the injective test lemma of P. F. Smith, a similar proposition on rings all of whose ideals are idempotent and on rings endowed with an involution are also proved. As a generalization of <b>fully</b> <b>prime</b> rings, we consider rings all of whose nonzero proper ideals are prime. Such a ring has a minimal nonzero ideal when it is not a prime ring. For example, a commutative ring with the property that every nonzero proper ideal is prime is either a field, a ring which is isomorphic to a direct sum of two fields, or a ring with exactly one proper nonzero ideal whose square is zero...|$|R

Also, primed cells produced interferon in response to low concentrations of polyriboinosinic acid · polyribocytidylic acid that did not induce interferon in normal cells. Therefore, priming appears to be a function of interferon separable from its antiviral activity.

Introduction The classical framework for the denotational semantics of programming languages is the category of Scott domains with continuous functions. A Scott domain is a complete partial order whose elements are thought of as some information about computation.

40|$|To study {{different}} activation {{states in}} polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in mice, {{we compared the}} function of murine PMN obtained from the bone marrow (BMPMN) with those of PMN obtained by intraperitoneal induction with thioglycolate (TGPMN) or uric acid (UAPMN). When stimulated with chemotactic peptides, e. g., formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF), WKYMVM, or WKYMVm, the TGPMN and UAPMN showed greatly enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with BMPMN, which suggests that exudation to the peritoneum per se induces a primed state in the cells. The WKYMVm peptide was the most potent stimulant of ROS generation, and it desensitized for subsequent stimulation with fMLF or WKYMVM. This desensitization was broken {{by the addition of}} cytochalasin B. The TGPMN and UAPMN appeared to be <b>fully</b> <b>primed,</b> since no increase in response was induced by pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). In contrast, the BMPMN response was increased 2. 5 - to 3 -fold. The differences in oxidative responses were supported by degranulation studies. Preincubation with TNF-α promoted CR 3 expression on BMPMN, and this level of expression was also enhanced by WKYMVm. In contrast, CR 3 expression on untreated TGPMN and UAPMN was already similar to that on TNF-α-primed BMPMN and could be only slightly enhanced by TNF-α treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that BMPMN are in a resting state and have the capacity to become primed, while peritoneal exudate PMN are already <b>fully</b> <b>primed</b> upon isolation. These results have major implications for murine neutrophil research and show the importance of defining which PMN subsets to use when investigating murine models...|$|R
