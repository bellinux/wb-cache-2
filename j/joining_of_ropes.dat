5000|$|The racking bend is a knot for <b>joining</b> two <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} diameter. [...] "Racking" [...] {{refers to}} the figure eight weaving that binds the bight <b>of</b> the larger <b>rope</b> together.|$|R
5000|$|The triple fisherman's knot is a bend knot, used to <b>join</b> two ends <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> together. It is an {{extension}} of the double fisherman's knot and is recommended for tying slippery, stiff ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and aramid cored ropes.|$|R
50|$|The Flemish bend, {{also known}} as a figure eight bend, a double figure eight bend, and a rewoven figure eight is a knot for <b>joining</b> two <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> roughly similar size.|$|R
5000|$|The double fisherman's knot or grapevine knot is a bend, or a knot used to <b>join</b> two lengths <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> This knot and {{the triple}} fisherman's knot are the {{variations}} used {{most often in}} climbing, arboriculture, and search and rescue. The knot is formed by tying a double overhand knot, in its strangle knot form, with each end around the opposite line's standing part.|$|R
50|$|The {{heaving line}} bend is a knot for {{securely}} <b>joining</b> two <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> different diameter or rigidity. It {{is often used}} to affix playing strings to the thick silk eyes of an anchorage knot in some stringed instruments. In nautical use, the heaving line bend is used to connect a lighter messenger line to a hawser when mooring ships. It is knot number 1463 in The Ashley Book of Knots, and appeared in the 1916 Swedish knot manual Om Knutar.|$|R
5000|$|The knot {{provides}} a compact, streamlined and decorative way <b>of</b> <b>joining</b> two <b>ropes.</b> However its primary attribute {{is that it}} is resistant against working loose when subject to intermittent loads. [...] The security of the knot arises from the fact that at step 3 in the tying sequence the knot is a Double Harness Bend (ABoK #1420). The additional step of passing the ends through the outer loops to complete the knot results in each line entering and exiting the knot being clamped at two points within the knot.|$|R

The questionnaire of 52 visitors <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> park is conducted (youths in age 16 - 19 years). It is set that overcoming <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> obstacles helps {{to get the}} necessary physical loading. Also to get feelings, characteristic for the extreme types of sport. It is found out that overcoming <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> obstacles helps people to be delivered from fear before difficulties and agitation before important events...|$|R

5000|$|Although ropes may be {{sensible}} on harder scrambles, sustained use <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and belay {{counts as}} climbing; typically, the use <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> in scrambling {{is limited to}} basic safety uses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{butterfly}} bend is a knot used to <b>join</b> {{the ends}} <b>of</b> two <b>ropes</b> together. It is the analogous bend {{form of the}} butterfly loop, {{in that it is}} the butterfly loop with the loop cut. [...] The observation that the butterfly loop is secure enough to isolate a worn or damaged section <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> within the loop indicated that the bend form of the knot would be similarly secure.|$|R

5000|$|With {{her body}} was a length <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> that was unusual in being made of four strands, rather than the more usual three or five strands. An expert told police that the {{composition}} <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> [...] "suggests it was made for use with agricultural machinery". Police traced the place of manufacture <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> to Dundee in Scotland but the firms that made that type <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> have since ceased trading.|$|R

50|$|Relative knot strength, {{also called}} knot efficiency, is the {{breaking}} strength <b>of</b> a knotted <b>rope</b> {{in proportion to}} the breaking strength <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> without the knot. Determining a precise value for a particular knot is difficult because many factors can affect a knot efficiency test: the type of fiber, the style <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> the size <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> whether it is wet or dry, how the knot is dressed before loading, how rapidly it is loaded, whether the knot is repeatedly loaded, and so on. The efficiency of common knots ranges between 40—80% <b>of</b> the <b>rope's</b> original strength.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of diamond wire saw upon ex plo i tation {{of natural stone}} depends on the right choice of the const ructional and technological fac¬tors of the machine, diamond wire and conditions, and way of explora¬tion in the particular kind of the rock. One of these parameters is the steel <b>rope</b> <b>of</b> diamond wire. A long-standing work on testing and certifying <b>of</b> hoisting <b>ropes,</b> experience and knowledge acquired upon these testings, aroused us to a detailed analysis and testing <b>of</b> the <b>ropes</b> which are used in diamond wire shaping. The paper {{presents the results of}} testings <b>of</b> steel <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> diamond wire and the testings <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> joints i. e. tensile strength which can resist the joints between separate rope sections. The suggested idea regarding construction desings <b>of</b> steel <b>rope</b> <b>of</b> diamond wire, which is used in natural carbonate stone exploitation, is based on this experimen¬tal testing <b>of</b> steel <b>ropes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Belay {{devices and}} rope brakes are an {{integral}} part of climbing equipment, required for personal protection such as injury prevention or life saving purposes. In spite of mushrooming design improvement the malfunctioning of brakes is reported repeatedly, caused by handling mistakes or un-optimised design. This review article provides a detailed discussion of the evolution and the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and introduces a new design classification. Design varieties are examined and addressed in detail. Subsequently, the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are reviewed and the differences between dynamic and static belaying are compared as to static and kinetic friction as well as belt and linear friction. In this critical review of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes, we discuss misconceptions as well as improvements. The issues covered in this review article aim to highlight the problems and challenges which the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and belay devices is facing in the quest for developing an optimised brake which never fails and which is ready to use without training. The shortcomings of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R
