5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end <b>handsets</b> were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end <b>handsets</b> completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 <b>handsets</b> in a matter of weeks.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{had over}} 50 handset partners, when Windows Mobile {{was still being}} shipped on new devices. 80% of the 50 million Windows Mobile devices that were made from launch to February 2009 were built by one {{contract}} manufacturing group, HTC, which makes <b>handsets</b> for several major companies under their brands, and under its own brand.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011, during Nokia World 2011, it was {{announced}} that Angry Birds would come preloaded in Nokia's Asha series of Series 40 touch <b>handsets,</b> aimed at emerging markets such as India, China and South Africa. In December 2011, Rovio released Angry Birds HD, Angry Birds Seasons HD and Angry Birds Rio HD on the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet from Research In Motion. In January 2012, Angry Birds was released for devices using Bada OS.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of new regulation about unbundling service plan and <b>handset</b> price in 2008, the Japanese <b>handset</b> market has shrunk. At its peak, in 2007, the total <b>handset</b> shipping amount was roughly 52M units. However, the number for 2009 was roughly 32M units. This caused a serious recession for the <b>handset</b> industry and a consolidation of <b>handset</b> vendors because most of the <b>handset</b> vendors relied solely on the Japanese market.|$|R

5|$|The island made {{communication}} history {{again on}} 8 October 2002, by {{becoming one of}} the first areas of South Wales to link to the Internet through a wireless connection deployed by Cardiff Council as part of the Flat Holm Project. The connection is used for Internet, access to Cardiff Council's data network and VOIP telephony. There are two <b>handsets</b> in the main farmhouse {{that are part of the}} councils own PBX thus having Cardiff dialling codes. 105 years after Marconi, Spencer Pearson an IT Consultant with Cardiff Council made the first telephone call from the island to his office at County Hall, Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost {{a decade and a half}} after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone <b>handsets</b> using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name.|$|E

50|$|Usually, a {{standard}} telephone <b>handset</b> was placed into a cradle {{that had been}} engineered to fit closely (by the use of rubber seals) around the microphone and earpiece of the <b>handset.</b> A modem would modulate a loudspeaker in the cup attached to the <b>handset's</b> microphone, and sound from the loudspeaker in the telephone <b>handset's</b> earpiece would {{be picked up by}} a microphone in the cup attached to the earpiece. In this way signals could be passed in both directions.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, {{developments}} in anti-sidetone circuitry and non-positional transmitters, which worked in any orientation, permitted Western Electric {{to develop a}} <b>handset</b> model free of these problems. The resulting E1 <b>handset</b> was ready for production in 1927. This <b>handset</b> was paired with a base that was essentially a candlestick with a shortened neck of approximately one inch in height, topped with a new cradle for the <b>handset.</b> The cradle incorporated the hookswitch as a vertical plunger actuating the electrical switch contacts. This initial design was tested in the central offices and released in limited supply as Western Electric's first <b>handset</b> subscriber telephone, the model A1.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{radiation}} efficiency of a mobile <b>handset</b> {{as a function}} of its relative position to the user's head, has been investigated. The study was based on theoretical results taken through electromagnetic modelling using MoM and on experimental results obtained by a measuring procedure using a mock-up <b>handset</b> and a phantom head in an anechoic chamber. The distance between antenna and the head as the <b>handset</b> is moving away from the head in the horizontal direction is found to be the main factor affecting the {{radiation efficiency}} in comparison with the movement of the <b>handset</b> vertically or horizontally on the "ear to nose " direction.
