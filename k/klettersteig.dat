2500|$|A third ascent runs {{across the}} Austrian Cirque or Österreichische Schneekar. Starting point for this are the lake of Eibsee (...) or {{the village of}} Ehrwald (...) [...] The two trails merge above the cirque of Gamskar. Thereafter the routhe {{continues}} to the Wiener-Neustädter Hut (...) and through the Österreichische Schneekar, {{at the end of}} which a <b>klettersteig</b> begins. During this section the route climbs through the Stopselzieher, a natural drainage cave. The route then joins the secured sections of the Reintal route. This ascent takes at least eight hours and climbs [...] in height.|$|E
2500|$|The first hut on the Zugspitze was the Wiener-Neustädter Hut (Wiener-Neustädter-Hütte, [...] ) {{built in}} 1884. It {{acts as a}} base for the <b>klettersteig</b> through the Österreichische Schneekar that was opened as far back as 1879. The hut is located on the western rim of the cirque and stand below the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car. It is {{operated}} by the Austrian Tourist Club and offers overnighting for up to 34 mountaineers in the period from July to October. The winter room is designed to take 14 people and has no cooking or heating facilities.|$|E
2500|$|The more popular, but harder {{route is}} through the Höllental. It starts at Hammersbach near Garmisch, goes through the Höllentalklamm, a similar gorge up to the [...] "Höllentalangerhütte", where one can take a meal or stay for the night. It then crosses the Höllentalferner, the {{remnants}} of a small glacier. After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps. <b>Klettersteig</b> equipment is recommended for that part. Over the Irmerscharte (a gap) it reaches the summit. This path will take 7 to 8 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{well-known}} <b>Klettersteigs</b> (climbing paths) {{lead to the}} summit: ...|$|R
5000|$|There are the {{following}} <b>klettersteigs</b> (sometimes abbreviated to Steig) in the Wetterstein: ...|$|R

2500|$|During the crossing, {{which is}} not a pure <b>klettersteig,</b> several {{unprotected}} sections have to be negotiated that roughly correspond to climbing grade III. The most difficult climbing section is a smooth gully (III-). In the area of the Vollkarspitze peak is a climbing section of difficulty (D). The difficulty of the roughly eight kilometre long climbing route is around [...] I and II as well as B. Normally it can be crossed in one day during the summer. Between the Middle and Outer Höllentalspitze is the Höllengrat Hut (...) , a bothy where climbers can take refuge for the night. It is mainly used during winter crossing, when the tour is split into two stages. The approach route to the tour is also possible from the Knorr Hut via the Brunntalgrat ridge and joins the route {{in the area of the}} Inner Höllentalspitze.|$|E
2500|$|The ascent {{starts in}} Hammersbach (...) through the Höllental along the Hammersbach stream. The path {{runs through the}} Höllental Gorge (Höllentalklamm) and was built from 1902 to 1905. Twelve tunnels were driven in the rock of the 1,026metre long gorge with a total length of 288metres. Another 569metres of path was dynamited into the rock {{in the shape of}} a half profile, whilst 120metres was led over {{footbridges}} and [...] 49metres over scree. The construction costs came to a total of 57,000 gold marks. Each year around 60,000 people pass through the gorge. The gorge can also be circumnavigated over the Stangensteig path. After the gorge the route heads for the [...] Höllentalanger Hut (...) , after which it crosses the Höllentalanger stream. Above that the Brett is crossed on steel pins fixed to a rock face. Crossing the Grünen Buckel the trail runs up to the Höllentalferner glacier. The glacier is mostly snow-free in summer so that crampons are required to cross it. Even more difficult is the randkluft because the ice retreats further and further from the rock as it melts. After the glacier there is a <b>klettersteig</b> to the summit of the Zugspitze. This route climbs through a height of , for which between seven and eight hours are needed. There is also the option of getting to the Höllental route on the Riffelsteig path from Eibsee. This path crosses the Riffelscharte wind gap and meets the route before the Brett.|$|E
50|$|The {{normal route}} for the First Schafalpenkopf is the Mindelheim <b>Klettersteig.</b> This medium-difficulty <b>klettersteig</b> (C) crosses the {{mountain}} from northeast to southwest, from the Second Schafalpenkopf. Climbers are assisted by cables, iron rungs and a ladder.|$|E
5000|$|The wind gap of the Riffelscharte to the {{southwest}} forms a crossing between northern and southern sides of the Waxensteinkamm crest and can be reached on marked hiking trails from the Eibsee (partly over protected <b>klettersteigs)</b> or from Ehrwald, {{as well as from}} the valley of Höllental. The most important base for these mountains, the Höllentalanger Hut (...) lies in the last-named valley.|$|R
50|$|The AV guides contain all {{the routes}} - hiking trails, {{mountain}} hut approaches and summit climbs {{as well as}} ice and high mountain routes and <b>klettersteigs</b> in each mountain range. The descriptions are factual and dry, with few illustrations - rather unlike mountain books by e.g. Walter Pause - and despite introductory sections require general Alpine knowledge and experience. Examples are the AVF Allgäuer Alpen and the AVF Verwallgruppe.The AV guides are often {{used as the basis}} for other publications and complement the Alpine Club maps or other map series.|$|R
5000|$|The plateau of the Hohe Wand may be {{accessed}} over a toll road built in 1931/32 that branches {{off the road}} between Stollhof and Maiersdorf. From 1965 until it was dismantled in 1994 {{there was also a}} double chairlift from Grünbach to the Plackles summit.Easy, but little used, hiking trails runs from the Dürnbach valley, from Grünbach and from the [...] "rear side", from Miesenbach, up the mountain. Most of the climbs on the southern and southeastern sides are more challenging, requiring sure-footedness and, in places a head for heights. In this area are most of the over 700 climbing routes of all levels of difficulty; there are also numerous <b>Klettersteigs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Schafalpenköpfe {{are a small}} {{mountain}} formation, {{consisting of}} three peaks, the First (2,272 m), Second (2,302 m) and Third Schafalpenkopf (2,320 m). A 2.4-kilometre-long <b>klettersteig</b> of medium difficulty (grade C), the Mindelheimer <b>Klettersteig,</b> runs over them.|$|E
50|$|The Northern Limestone Alps, which {{run from}} near Vienna to the Swiss border, {{remain at the}} heart of Austrian <b>klettersteig,</b> with routes {{concentrated}} in key mountain groups: the Rax (where some of the oldest via ferratas are), the Hohe Wand, the Totes Gebirge, the Dachstein, the Wilder Kaiser, the Karwendel. The Dachstein mountains in Styria, in particular, are home to several notable via ferratas, including the Ramsauer <b>Klettersteig,</b> the Jubiläumsklettersteig, and on the northern side of the Dachstein, the Seewand <b>Klettersteig,</b> {{which is one of the}} hardest long routes in Austria. However, perhaps the highlight is the long and difficult Dachstein Super Ferrata, recently created by linking three routes, and possibly the most challenging via ferrata overall in Austria. Other notable routes in the Northern Limestone Alps are the Innsbrucker <b>Klettersteig</b> in the Karwendel and the Tajakante <b>Klettersteig</b> in the Mieminger Chain just to the east (both routes are in Tirol, near Innsbruck).|$|E
50|$|For both tours <b>klettersteig</b> {{experience}} is needed.|$|E
50|$|In the summer, {{the guests}} usually come for {{mountain}} hiking. There are also two very popular climbing routes (Mindelheimer <b>Klettersteig</b> and Zweienland <b>Klettersteig)</b> on ​​the border to the neighboring commune area of ​​Oberstdorf, which are mostly accessed via the Kleinwalsertal {{because of the}} shorter route and easier accessibility.|$|E

50|$|The fixed rope route Pidinger <b>Klettersteig</b> {{was created}} in 2003 {{and is one of}} the most {{challenging}} fixed rope routes in Germany.|$|E
50|$|The Central Eastern Alps {{have seen}} more recent development, {{with large numbers}} of routes in the Otztal and the Stubai Alps, and {{on either side of the}} Hohe Tauern. Highly {{regarded}} routes are the Schlicker <b>Klettersteig</b> and Ilmspitz <b>Klettersteig</b> in the Stubai, the Tiroler Weg in the Otztal, and the Bella Vista <b>Klettersteig</b> on the south side of the Hohe Tauern in Carinthia. Other via ferratas in this area climb a number of 3000m summits. The Southern Limestone Alps in Carinthia and East Tirol are more traditional ground for via ferratas. Several routes lie near the Italian border (in the Carnic Alps) which formed the front line in World War I and some via ferratas pass fortifications from the conflict, including the Weg der 26er which ascends the Hohe Warte, the highest peak of the range.|$|E
5000|$|From Hunerkogel (2.690 m, Dachstein South Face Cable Car from Ramsau via the Hallstätter Glacier, {{only for}} the experienced, with <b>Klettersteig</b> equipment, duration: 1½ hours ...|$|E
50|$|The First Schafalpenkopf (Erste Schafalpenkopf) or Southwestern Schafalpenkopf (Südwestlicher Schafalpenkopf) is a 2,272-metre-high {{mountain}} in the Allgäu Alps. It {{is part of the}} Schafalpenköpfe and the Mindelheim <b>Klettersteig.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Second Schafalpenkopf (Zweite Schafalpenkopf), also Middle Schafalpenkopf (Mittlerer Schafalpenkopf) is a 2,302-metre-high {{mountain}} in the Allgäu Alps. It {{is part of the}} Schafalpenköpfe and the Mindelheim <b>Klettersteig.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Third Schafalpenkopf (Dritte Schafalpenkopf), Highest Schafalpenkopf (Höchster Schafalpenkopf) or Northeastern Schafalpenkopf (Nordöstlicher Schafalpenkopf) is a 2,320-metre-high {{mountain}} in the Allgäu Alps. It {{is part of the}} Mindelheimer <b>Klettersteig.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} climb the Zugspitze through the Höllental valley the Höllentalferner has to be negotiated. Depending on the season the randkluft of the glacier is a key point {{on the way to}} the <b>Klettersteig.</b>|$|E
50|$|The routes {{from the}} time before the {{construction}} of the <b>klettersteig</b> are hardly used today. The old normal route had a climbing grade of UIAA II and ran through the Wildental valley to the top.|$|E
50|$|On the Calmont {{runs the}} Calmont <b>Klettersteig,</b> which {{was laid out}} by the German Alpine Club and opened on 4 May 2002 and on which can {{discover}} more about the hills and their flora and fauna.|$|E
50|$|A trail leads {{above the}} Kehlsteinhaus towards the Mannlgrat ridge {{reaching}} from the Kehlstein {{to the summit}} of the Hoher Göll. The route, which is served by a <b>Klettersteig,</b> is regarded as the easiest to the top.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2000s the western summit broke off, and with it a long section of the safety equipment on the Jubiläumsgrat. The new route {{is the heart of the}} <b>Klettersteig</b> section of the Jubiläumsgrat.|$|E
50|$|The {{ascent of}} the 500 m steep slope {{on the north}} face of the {{mountain}} is climbed by a via ferrata (<b>Klettersteig)</b> built by the Austrian Alpine Club in 1966/67, the use of which requires some mountaineering skills.|$|E
5000|$|Another ascent {{runs from}} the col of Grießkarscharte (...) , which is reached either from the Höllentalanger Hut in the Höllental valley via the cirque of Mathaisenkar (involving a <b>klettersteig)</b> or from the lake of Stuibensee via the Grießkar cirque.|$|E
50|$|The ridge {{rises from}} a col {{separating}} {{it from a}} subpeak of the Hoher Göll, the Kehlstein, upon which the famous Kehlsteinhaus is located. Served by a <b>Klettersteig,</b> the Mannlgrat {{is regarded as the}} easist route to the Hoher Göll's summit.|$|E
