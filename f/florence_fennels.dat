40|$|Abstract. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a {{flowering}} plant {{species in the}} celery family Apiaceae or Umbelliferae. It is a hardy, perennial herb with yellow flowers and feathery leaves, indigenous from {{the shores of the}} Mediterranean, widely naturalized {{in many parts of the}} world, especially on dry soils near the sea-coast and on riverbanks. <b>Florence</b> <b>fennel</b> Foeniculum vulgare Azoricum is a cultivar group with inflated leaf bases which form a bulb-like structure. This experiment aimed the germination fennel seed, as a result of qualitative and quantitative processes, which determine the transition of seed from latent life to active life, resulting in development of a new plant. Seed germination depends on both internal and external conditions. Germination is epigeal and fennel seed normally germinates in 10 - 14 days depending mainly on the weather following sowing. The experiences made that the preparation SM (produced by Research and Development Center for Biostimulators "BIOS " Cluj-Napoca) in concentration of 0. 05 %, in case of treating seeds for 3 h, has a positive influence on seeds germination, compared to untreated water control...|$|R
