5|$|The German leader Arminius <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> example at an {{individual}} level: {{after several years}} of serving in Rome's forces as prefect of an auxiliary unit, he used the military training and experience he had gained to lead a confederacy of German tribes against Rome, culminating in the destruction of three Roman legions in the Teutoberg Forest in 9AD, and the abandonment of Augustus' strategy of annexing Germany as far as the Elbe river. (This strategy was never revived by later emperors).|$|E
5|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> {{philosophical}} debate {{of free will}} versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, {{and the nature of}} self-perception. The film also continues to follow Spielberg's tradition of depicting broken families,*Vest. pg. 136 which he has said is motivated by his parents' divorce when he was a child.|$|E
5|$|It is archaeologically {{difficult}} to distinguish Diocletian's fortifications from those of his successors and predecessors. The Devil's Dyke, for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most {{that can be said}} about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under Probus along the Lake Constance-Basel and the Rhine–Iller–Danube line), on the Danube- where a new line of forts {{on the far side of}} the river, the Ripa Sarmatica, was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses – in Egypt, and on the frontier with Persia. Beyond that, much discussion is speculative, and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources. Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement, and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims. The Strata Diocletiana, built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of Bostra, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts – defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons – followed by further fortifications in the rear. In an attempt to resolve the difficulty and slowness of transmitting orders to the frontier, the new capitals of the tetrarchic era were all much closer to the empire's frontiers than Rome had been: Trier sat on the Rhine, Sirmium and Serdica were close to the Danube, Thessaloniki was on the route leading eastward, and Nicomedia and Antioch were important points in dealings with Persia.|$|E

25|$|The Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are logosyllabic {{combining}} {{the use of}} logograms with a syllabary, and they are often called hieroglyphic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica, but archaeological dating methods, and {{a certain degree of}} self-interest, create difficulties in establishing priority and thus the forebear from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and therefore the most widely known, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> Maya script. Others include the Olmec, Zapotec, and Epi-Olmec/Isthmian writing systems. An extensive Mesoamerican literature has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postinvasion transcriptions into Latin script.|$|E

Basic Beaujolais and Beaujolais nouveau are meant to be drunk within a year of their harvest. Beaujolais-Villages are generally consumed within 2–3 years and Cru Beaujolais has the potential to age longer, some not even fully developing till at least 3 years after harvest. Premium examples from Chénas, Juliénas, Morgon and Moulin-à-Vent can spend up to 10 years continuing to develop in the bottle and in very good vintages can take on Burgundian qualities of structure and complexity.|$|E

25|$|Mesoamerica {{is one of}} the {{relatively}} few places in the world where writing has developed independently throughout history. The Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are logosyllabic combining the use of logograms with a syllabary, and they are often called hieroglyphic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica but archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was earliest and hence the forebear from which the others developed. Candidates for being the first writing system of the Americas are Zapotec writing, the Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script or the scripts of the Izapan culture. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and hence the most widely known, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> Maya script. Post-Classic cultures such as the Aztec and Mixtec cultures do not seem to have developed true writing systems, but instead used semasiographic writing although they did use phonetic principles in their writing by the use of the rebus principle. Aztec name glyphs for example do combine logographic elements with phonetic readings. From the colonial period on there exists an extensive Mesoamerican literature written in the Latin script.|$|E
25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at a crumpled piece of paper in the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E
25|$|As for the {{required}} vocal {{range of the}} title role, it is an extraordinary case: The highest note is the high B5, not irregular for a soprano or mezzo-soprano to sing, while the lowest note is a low G3, in the contralto range and officially below the standard range for a mezzo-soprano. Considering this range, {{which is similar to}} many mezzo roles (such as Carmen and Amneris), one might assume that a high soprano is not essential to the piece, but it is; most of the relatively low sopranos who attempted this role found themselves straining their voices throughout the opera, and having reached the closing scene (the {{most important part of the}} opera for the title role) were very fatigued. This role <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> example of the difference between tessitura and absolute vocal range: While mezzos can perform a high note (like Carmen), or even temporarily sustain a high tessitura, it is impossible for a singer to spend such a long time (with the needed strength and breath-control) in the second octave above the middle C unless she is a high soprano. Moreover, the low G occurs twice in the opera, and in both cases it is in pianissimo—more of a theatrical effect than music—and can be growled instead of sung. The other low notes required are no lower than low A, and they are also quiet.|$|E

There are many other examples, such as the chocobo racing theme from FFVII, the Boss theme being borrowed from Final Fantasy VI, Irma's house is a rendition of the Final Fantasy IV sorrow music, and the end credits feature the airship theme from Final Fantasy VIII. Music from Final Fantasy III has also been borrowed, such as the crystal room theme and Gysahl theme.|$|E
500|$|According to Nomura, [...] "death {{should be}} {{something}} sudden and unexpected, and Aerith's death seemed more natural and realistic." [...] He said: [...] "When I reflect on Final Fantasy VII, {{the fact that}} fans were so offended by her sudden death probably means that we were successful with her character. If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn't an effective character." [...] From the original release of the game, rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back, but this was scrapped in development. Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true; [...] "the world was expecting us {{to bring her back}} to life, as this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> convention." [...] A lengthy petition asking for Aerith's revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase, but he dismissed it, pointing out that [...] "there are many meanings in Aerith's death and [...] could never happen." ...|$|E

500|$|In many aspects, Cabernet Sauvignon can {{reflect the}} desires and {{personality}} of the winemaker while still presenting familiar flavors that express the typical character of the variety. The most pronounced effects are {{from the use of}} oak during production. Typically the first winemaking decision is whether or not to produce a varietal or blended wine. The [...] "Bordeaux blend" [...] of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet franc, with potentially some Malbec, Petit Verdot or Carménère, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> example of blended Cabernet Sauvignon, emulated in the United States with wines produced under the [...] "Meritage" [...] designation. But Cabernet Sauvignon can be blended with a variety of grapes such as Shiraz, Tempranillo and Sangiovese. The decision to blend is then followed by the decision of when to do the blending—before, during or after fermentation. Due to the different fermentation styles of the grapes, many producers will ferment and age each grape variety separately and blend the wine shortly before bottling.|$|E

Academic Louis Menand contends that [...] "The Cat in the Hat transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children's books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks."
