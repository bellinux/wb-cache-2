5|$|Traditional attire in Faisalabad is Punjabi {{clothing}} {{such as the}} dhoti, kurta and pagri. Faisalabadi men wear white shalwar kameez as <b>do</b> <b>women</b> {{but also}} with a dupatta (scarf). The more conservative women wear burqas {{that may or may}} not cover the face. Combinations of Pakistani and Western attire are worn by women, such as an embroidered kurta worn with jeans or trousers, and half sleeve or sleeveless shirts with Capri pants. Men have adopted some of the modern Western styles for both casual and formal business dress such as dress pants, trousers, T-shirts and jeans.|$|E

25|$|In human females, the urethra opens {{straight}} into the vulva. Hence, urination can take place while sitting or squatting for defecation. It is also possible for females to urinate while standing, and while clothed. It is common for women in various regions of Africa to use this method when they urinate, as <b>do</b> <b>women</b> in Laos. Herodotus described a similar custom in ancient Egypt.

In 1914, she first posed the question “What <b>do</b> <b>women</b> want at a fight?” in an article titled “My Sisters and I at a New York Prizefight” published in New York World magazine. According to Irene Gammel, “Barnes’ essay effectively begins to unravel an entire cultural history of repression for women”.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} a multichannel investigation of how gender-based familiarity moderates {{verbal and nonverbal}} behaviors between m n and women. Undergraduates in 24 mixed-sex dyads discussed masculine, feminine, and non-gender-linked topics. The primary dependent variables were verbal and nonverbal behaviors related to social power. The verbal behaviors examined were speech initia-tions and total amount of speech; the nonverbal behaviors studied were visual behavior (while speak-ing and while listening), gesturing, chin thrusts, and smiling. As expected, systematic differences in the behaviors f men and women emerged on the gender-linked tasks. On the masculine task men displayed more verbal and nonverbal power-related behavior than <b>did</b> <b>women.</b> On the feminine task women exhibited more power than men {{on most of the}} verbal nd nonverbal measures. Also as predicted, on the non-gender-linked task men displayed greater power both verbally and nonverbally than <b>did</b> <b>women.</b> There were twoexceptions tothis overall pattern. Across all conditions, women smiled more often han did men, and men had a higher frequency of chin thrusts than <b>did</b> <b>women.</b> In this study we investigated the communication f power between women and men.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of popular culture, especially prime-time television, on women learner-viewers? identity development. More specifically, this study explores one specific television show, the 1962 - 64 Cathy Gale episodes of The Avengers as a portal to adult learning. It further explores the ways in which television, as a form of public pedagogy, can help facilitate the formation of a critical or feminist identity among adult learner viewers. The research questions guiding this study were: 1) How and what <b>did</b> <b>women</b> learn from watching The Avengers? 2) How <b>did</b> <b>women</b> incorporate that learning into their lives and into their identities? and 3) How <b>did</b> <b>women</b> interpret and accommodate the feminist example of Cathy Gale? Data for this study was collected over a two-and-a-half year period. Data consisted of interviews with contemporaneous viewers of the Cathy Gale Avengers episodes, interviews with scriptwriters and the actor who played Cathy Gale, Honor Blackman, numerous documents from statistics obtained at the British Film Institute, fanzines, and newspaper articles of the period. Analysis revealed that in particular historical times and situations television viewing can become a form of public pedagogy, facilitating transformational learning in adult viewers that produces lasting, life-changing effects. The investigation revealed that not only <b>did</b> biologically-born <b>women</b> incorporate Cathy Gale?s feminist example into their identities and actions, but biologically born males whose core gender identity was female did also.
