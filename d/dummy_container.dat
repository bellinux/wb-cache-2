40|$|Main goal of {{steganography}} is {{to communicate}} securely {{in a completely}} undetectable manner. It is an art of hiding secret data in an innocently looking <b>dummy</b> <b>container.</b> In the Steganographic process, communication is masked to make the hidden message not discernible to the observer. Hidden message may be textual or image. In this paper, a novel image steganography method based on randomized bit embedding is presented. Firstly the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of the cover image is obtained. Then the stego image is constructed by hiding the given secrete message image in Least Significant Bit of the cover image in random locations based on threshold. DCT coefficients determine the randomized pixel locations for hiding to resist blind steganalysis methods such as self calibration process by cropping some pixels to estimate the cover image features. Blind steganalysis schemes can be guessed easily hence the proposed technique is more practically applicable. Quality of the stego image is analyzed by tradeoff between no of bits used for embedding. Efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated by exhaustive experimental results and comparisons...|$|E
50|$|Duqu {{looks for}} {{information}} that could be useful in attacking industrial control systems. Its purpose {{is not to be}} destructive, the known components are trying to gather information. However, based on the modular structure of Duqu, special payload could be used to attack any type of computer system by any means and thus cyber-physical attacks based on Duqu might be possible. However, use on personal computer systems has been found to delete all recent information entered on the system, and in some cases total deletion of the computer's hard drive. Internal communications of Duqu are analysed by Symantec, but the actual and exact method how it replicates inside an attacked network is not yet fully known. According to McAfee, one of Duqu's actions is to steal digital certificates (and corresponding private keys, as used in public-key cryptography) from attacked computers to help future viruses appear as secure software. Duqu uses a 54Ã—54 pixel JPEG file and encrypted <b>dummy</b> files as <b>containers</b> to smuggle data to its command and control center. Security experts are still analyzing the code to determine what information the communications contain. Initial research indicates that the original malware sample automatically removes itself after 36 days (the malware stores this setting in configuration files), which would limit its detection.|$|R
