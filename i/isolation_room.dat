5|$|The Barnacle {{was built}} in 1950 as a First Aid centre, which quickly became a volunteer-run cottage {{hospital}} for visitors and the local community. It houses a 6-bed ward, <b>isolation</b> <b>room,</b> dental surgery, X-ray room and operating theatre. In the late 1980s the building became volunteer accommodation, until it was decommissioned in 2016 {{with the opening of}} the International Volunteer Lodge.

25|$|Tests are {{sometimes}} {{confined to the}} workshop, but often require the teams to be outside. Much of the outdoor testing during early seasons {{took place in the}} parking lot of M5, and occasionally M6 and M7. A cargo container in the M7 parking lot commonly serves as an <b>isolation</b> <b>room</b> for dangerous myths, with the experiment being triggered from outside. However, budget increases have permitted more frequent travel to other locations in San Francisco and around the Bay Area. Common filming locations around the Bay Area include decommissioned (closed) military facilities (such as Naval Air Station Alameda, Naval Air Station Moffett Field, Concord Naval Weapons Station, Naval Station Treasure Island, Marin Headlands, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Hamilton Air Force Base, and abandoned base housing at Marina, California's former Fort Ord), and the Alameda County Sheriff's facility in Dublin, California, especially the firing range, Emergency Vehicles Operation Course (EVOC), and bomb range. Occasionally, mainly for special episodes, production is out of state, or even out of the country.|$|E
500|$|Merrick {{arrived at}} Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely {{back in his}} own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not {{eligible}} to enter a workhouse in London {{for more than one}} night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was [...] away. He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he huddled in a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card. The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves took him in a hansom cab to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for bronchitis, washed, fed and put to bed in a small <b>isolation</b> <b>room</b> in the hospital's attic.|$|E

2500|$|Power-tube {{distortion}} {{is required}} for amp sounds in some genres. In a standard master-volume guitar amp, as the amp's final or master volume is increased beyond the full power of the amplifier, power tube distortion is produced. The [...] "power soak" [...] approach places the attenuation between the power tubes and the guitar speaker. In the re-amped or [...] "dummy load" [...] approach, the tube power amp drives a mostly resistive dummy load while an additional low power amp drives the guitar speaker. In the isolation box approach, the guitar amplifier is used with a guitar speaker in a separate cabinet.

Gwendolyn Lee ("Gwen") Byrd (born April 15, 1961), Jacquelyn Faye ("Jackie") Byrd (born August 2, 1962) and Tina Denise Byrd (born March 27, 1965). According to Tammy's autobiography Stand by Your Man, Tina was born three months prematurely, and spent her first three months in an incubator. Tina weighed an estimated two pounds at birth. She was not quite five pounds when she arrived home at three months old, and Tina was home for only three weeks when a relative whom Tammy lived with at the time said [...] "Every time I try to pick her up, she screams in pain and I think it's her back."

40|$|A {{laminar airflow}} room {{was used to}} provide a low-pathogen {{environment}} for a child with lymphopenic immune deficiency transplanted with paternal bone marrow. Comparison of flora from the patient, personnel, and the environment indicated that no colonization with exogenous organisms occurred in the patient during the 45 -day period of study. The number of organisms recovered from the laminar airflow room was exceedingly small. Conventional hospital <b>isolation</b> <b>rooms</b> contained more bacteria and fungi than the laminar airflow room, even when strict aseptic procedures were followed in the former. Patients with lymphopenic immune deficiency and agranulocytosis admitted to conventional <b>isolation</b> <b>rooms</b> were colonized with exogenous organisms within 1 week. Each developed infection with these strains, and one patient died. Laminar airflow isolation seems at present the best means to prevent exogenous infection during hospitalization of patients with lymphopenic and other severe immune-deficiency diseases and may be essential when bone marrow transplantation is performed to treat their immunological defect...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In Emergency and Medical Admission Departments (EDs and MADs), prompt {{recognition}} and appropriate infection control management {{of patients with}} Highly Infectious Diseases (HIDs, e. g. Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers and SARS) are fundamental for avoiding nosocomial outbreaks. Methods The EuroNHID (European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases) project collected data from 41 EDs and MADs in 14 European countries, located in the same facility as a national/regional referral centre for HIDs, using specifically developed checklists, during on-site visits from February to November 2009. Results <b>Isolation</b> <b>rooms</b> were available in 34 facilities (82, 9 %) : these rooms had anteroom in 19, dedicated entrance in 15, negative pressure in 17, and HEPA filtration of exhausting air in 12. Only 6 centres (14, 6 %) had <b>isolation</b> <b>rooms</b> with all characteristics. Personnel trained for the recognition of HIDs was available in 24 facilities; management protocols for HIDs were available in 35.

40|$|In 11 {{patients}} receiving transplants of allogeneic bone marrow, the graft {{was successful in}} six. Nine patients developed infections, and six died—five of septicaemia and one of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Fifty individual infections occurred. Predisposing factors included severe underlying diseases, long-term exposure to resistant hospital organisms, heavy immunosuppressive therapy, and graft-versus-host disease. Gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans were the most common causative organisms. In every instance of septicaemia identical organisms were isolated from blood cultures and simultaneously obtained stool cultures. Infection with exogenous organisms often occurred in patients occupying conventional <b>isolation</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>Isolation</b> of one patient for 45 days in a laminar air flow room prevented infection with exogenous organisms...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the study {{done by the}} National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), by order of the Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ), of the capacity of isolation wards required in hospitals in the Netherlands. To determine the required isolation capacity, a model was developed. From various secondary sources data were collected on persons who in 1998 were placed in isolation or who because of their diagnosis should have placed in isolation. Because of uncertainties in the available data two extreme scenarios were calculated. They show that the required capacity ranges between 100 and 150 <b>isolation</b> <b>rooms</b> for a prompt accommodation of all patients who must be nursed in isolation. With an estimated available capacity of 700 <b>isolation</b> <b>rooms</b> in Dutch hospitals, {{it can be concluded}} that there is definitely no under-capacity. The outcomes of the model do not support the availability problems as experienced in practice by hospitals and repatriation organizations. than capacity. It could well be that when needed the single <b>rooms</b> equipped for <b>isolation</b> are occupied by patients who do not necessarily need to be nursed in isolation (e. g. seriously ill patients or private patients). If so, flexibility and effort are required to clear the room instantaneously and to prepare it for isolation. Shortage of staff and reluctance to admit patients from abroad may be other reasons for the experienced insufficiency of available isolation capacity. It is recommended for each hospital to register in a uniform way all actual cases of isolation thus to get insight into the use of <b>isolation</b> <b>rooms</b> per hospital and for the hole nation. From now on repatriation organizations should register all requests for transfer to a Dutch hospital (not just the requests met), thus to get a more complete picture of the need for isolation capacity...|$|R
