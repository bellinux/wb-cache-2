The Court of Appeal recognized a rule of customary international law that had been received into the common law, that is, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and ascribed to Parliament the intent to uphold that rule for the purposes of construing a statutory provision.|$|E
5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} {{a more active role}} in the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom is {{party to}} a number of {{international}} treaties and agreements which guarantee fundamental human rights and freedoms. However, as the UK is a dualist state, treaties and agreements ratified by the government have no effect until and unless incorporated into <b>domestic</b> <b>law.</b> The provisions of unincorporated treaties can have nevertheless an impact on <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> in a certain number of situations including the interpretation of legislation, the consideration of public policy and the assessment of the legality of the exercise of administrative discretion. In particular, there is a presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate in a manner contrary to international agreements which have been ratified by the United Kingdom but not incorporated into <b>domestic</b> <b>law.</b> This presumption is capable of rebuttal by reference to Hansard in accordance with the principle established in Pepper v Hart.|$|E

The article first reviews the statutory basis for the antitrust laws in both the U. S. and the E.

The author illustrates the difficulties that arise when <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> intersect in a global economy, she then demonstrates {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} proposed solutions to these problems. Finally, the author proposes a new model which integrates several aspects of the proposed solutions while also considering the critical role of innovation and new technology in the search for a solution...|$|R

25|$|The Court of Appeal was of {{the opinion}} that {{customary}} international law cannot be incorporated into {{the meaning of the word}} law in Article 9(1) of the Constitution. Customary international law rules do not have any status in <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> until they are first accepted and adopted as part of <b>domestic</b> <b>law.</b> This can occur when a rule is incorporated into a statute (in which case it is no longer a customary international law rule but is regarded as <b>domestic</b> <b>law),</b> or when it is judicially declared to be part of the common law of Singapore. However, customary international law can only be incorporated into the common law when it is not inconsistent with existing domestic laws. Given the existence of the mandatory death penalty in several Singapore statutes, the Court {{was of the}} opinion that it could not treat the alleged customary international law rule prohibiting inhuman punishment as part of Singapore common law. Also, even if a rule has been incorporated in this manner, it may be overridden by subsequent inconsistent statutory provisions. Moreover, the Court did not accept the contention that customary international law should be conferred constitutional status by being read into the meaning of law in Article 9(1) as this is clearly not in accordance with the normal hierarchy of Singapore law.|$|E
