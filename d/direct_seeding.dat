A field experiment was initiated in 2011 / 12 and continued up to 2012 / 13 to compare the organic carbon buildup in the soil due to conservation and conventional agriculture. The soil organic carbon data represents the cumulative after five crop cycle. The treatments consisted conventionally tilled <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> rice followed by zero tilled wheat, conventionally tilled transplanted rice followed by conventionally tilled wheat, zero tilled <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> rice followed by zero tilled <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> wheat without residue retention, zero tilled <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> rice followed by <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> wheat with residue retention, permanent raised bed of rice followed by wheat without residue retention and permanent raised bed of rice followed by wheat with residue retention in randomized complete block design with three replications.

Present study evaluated {{the effect of}} seed priming and irrigation on crop establishment, tillering, agronomic traits, paddy yield, grain quality and water productivity of <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> rice in alternate wetting and drying (DSR-AWD) in comparison with <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> rice at field capacity (DSR-FC). Seed priming treatments were osmo-priming with KCl (2. 2 %), CaCl 2 (2. 2 %) and moringa leaf extracts (MLE, 3. 3 %) including hydro-priming as control. Among the treatments, seed osmo-primed with MLE emerged earlier and had higher final emergence, followed by osmo-priming with CaCl 2. Tillering emergence rate and number of tillers per plant were the highest for seed priming with CaCl 2 in DSR-AWD. Total productive and non-productive tillers, panicle length, biological and grain yields, harvest index were highest for seed priming with MLE or CaCl 2 in DSR-AWD. Similarly, grain quality, estimated in terms of normal grains, abortive and chalky grains, was also the highest in DSR-AWD with MLE osmo-priming. Benefit cost ratio and water productivity was also the highest in DSR-AWD for seed priming with MLE.

40|$|The {{information}} on combined effect of seeding time and competition period on weeds, phenology and yield of directly sown rice is very limited.

Rice cultivar “Super basmati ” was seeded during 1 st and 3 rd week of June and 1 st week of July and weeds were allowed to compete for 15, 30, 45, 60 days after seeding (DAS). Weed free treatment along with a weedy check was also maintained for comparison. Interaction effect of seeding time and competition period was significant. Weed crop competition until 15 DAS gave statistically similar kernel yield to weed free in different seeding times with better yield in plots sown in first week of June during both years. However an increase in competition period from 15 DAS to 30 DAS could not exhibit significant differences. Further increase in competition periods increased the weed density and biomass with significant reduction in yield.

40|$|Early {{seedling}} vigor (ESV) is {{the essential}} trait for <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> rice to dominate and smother the weed growth. In this regard, 629 rice genotypes were studied for their morphological and physiological responses in the field under <b>direct</b> <b>seeded</b> aerobic situation on 14 th, 28 th and 56 th days after sowing (DAS). It was determined that the early observations taken on 14 th and 28 th DAS were reliable estimators to study ESV as compared to 56 th DAS. Further, 96 were selected from 629 genotypes by principal component (PCA) and discriminate function analyses. The selected genotypes were subjected to decipher the pattern of genetic diversity {{in terms of both}} phenotypic and genotypic by using ESV QTL linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. To assess the genetic structure, model and distance based approaches were used. Genotyping of 96 rice lines using 39 polymorphic SSRs produced a total of 128 alleles with the phenotypic information content (PIC) value of 0. 24. The model based population structure approach grouped the accession into two distinct populations, whereas unrooted tree grouped the genotypes into three clusters. Both model based and structure based approach had clearly distinguished the early vigor genotypes from non-early vigor genotypes. Association analysis revealed that 16 and 10 SSRs showed significant association with ESV traits by general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM) approaches respectively. Marker alleles on chromosome 2 were associated with shoot dry weight on 28 DAS, vigor index on 14 and 28 DAS.

The objective of this research was to study the interaction of soil organic amendment and nematicide on N 2 O emission and nitrogen uptake from rainfed lowland rice soils.

The second factor was nematicide application consisted of without nematicide, neemcake and carbofuran. Variables measured were N 2 O flux, rice grain yield and nitrogen uptake.
