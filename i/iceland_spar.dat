50|$|The narrator, Roland Patcham, {{by his own}} {{introduction}} a “redundant… spoilt, angry, {{bored and}} aimless reporter”, is losing his younger wife Sophie (“a spoilt, well-off, beautiful and busy journalist”) to her lover, the Director of National Arts. Sophie uncovers {{the existence of a}} one-thousand-piece dinner service made for Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1914, a Wedgwood set which depicts an enormous range of typically English urban, village and pastoral scenes, and which has been forgotten if not irretrievably lost throughout the course of two world wars. Patcham becomes obsessed with retrieving the surviving pieces, all the more so that his rival, Courtney Ranston, has already become engaged in their collection on behalf of the nation.Rummaging through South-East England, Belgium, Holland, France, Denmark, Sweden and finally <b>Iceland,</b> <b>sparring</b> with a carnival of eccentric characters, Patcham manages to outflank and defeat the National Arts, and in so doing win back his wife.The Dinner Service is quickly established as a metaphor for a destroyed past, both in the sense of an “olde Englande”, and in the joy of youthful love, and its partial restoration - both rediscovery and repair - describes the mitigated reconquest of love.|$|R
25|$|Danish {{archaeologist}} Thorkild Ramskou {{posited that}} the sunstone {{could have been}} one of the minerals (cordierite or <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar)</b> that polarize light and by which the azimuth of the sun can be determined in a partly overcast sky or when the sun is just below the horizon. The principle is used by many animals and polar flights applied the idea before more advanced techniques became available. Ramskou further conjectured that the sunstone could have aided navigation in the open sea in the Viking period. This idea has become very popular, and research as to how a sunstone could be used in nautical navigation continues.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, 1852, there {{appeared}} {{the paper on}} the composition and resolution of streams of polarised light from different sources, and in 1853 {{an investigation of the}} metallic reflection exhibited by certain non-metallic substances. The research was to highlight the phenomenon of light polarisation. About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the intensity of light reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates; and in 1862 he prepared for the British Association a valuable report on double refraction, a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes. Perhaps the best known crystal is <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar,</b> transparent calcite crystals.|$|E

2500|$|Rømer {{was born}} on 25 September 1644 in Århus to a {{merchant}} and skipper, Christen Pedersen (died 1663), and Anna Olufsdatter Storm ( [...] – 1690), daughter of a well-to-do alderman. Since 1642, Christen Pedersen had taken to using the name Rømer, which means that he was from the Danish island of Rømø, to distinguish himself {{from a couple of}} other people named Christen Pedersen. There are few records of Ole Rømer before 1662, when he graduated from the old Aarhus Katedralskole (the Cathedral school of Aarhus), moved to Copenhagen and matriculated at the University of Copenhagen. His mentor at the University was Rasmus Bartholin, who published his discovery of the double refraction of a light ray by <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar</b> (calcite) in 1668, while Rømer was living in his home. Rømer was given every opportunity to learn mathematics and astronomy using Tycho Brahe's astronomical observations, as Bartholin had been given the task of preparing them for publication.|$|E
2500|$|Research in 2011 by Ropars et al., {{confirms}} {{that one can}} identify {{the direction of the}} sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. [...] The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye. Alternatively a dot can be placed on top of crystal so {{that when you look at}} it from below, two dots appear, because the light is “depolarised” and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of the top face now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at The British Geological Survey in 2014 failed. Kaplan communicated extensively with Ropars and neither could understand why the samples of <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar</b> that were being used during the trials did not reveal the sun's direction.|$|E

6000|$|... § 4. There are, however, {{many cases}} in which, though our power of {{producing}} {{the phenomenon is}} complete, the Method of Difference either {{can not be made}} available at all, or not without a previous employment of the Method of Agreement. This occurs when the agency by which we can produce the phenomenon is not that of one single antecedent, but a combination of antecedents, which we have no power of separating from each other, and exhibiting apart. For instance, suppose the subject of inquiry to be the cause of the double refraction of light. We can produce this phenomenon at pleasure, by employing any one of the many substances which are known to refract light in that peculiar manner. But if, taking one of those substances, as <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar,</b> for example, we wish to determine on which of the properties of <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar</b> this remarkable phenomenon depends, we can make no use, for that purpose, of the Method of Difference; for we can not find another substance precisely resembling <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar</b> except in some one property. The only mode, therefore, of prosecuting this inquiry is that afforded by the Method of Agreement; by which, in fact, through a comparison of all the known substances which have the property of doubly refracting light, it was ascertained that they agree in the circumstance of being crystalline substances; and though the converse does not hold, though all crystalline substances have not the property of double refraction, it was concluded, with reason, that there is a real connection between these two properties; that either crystalline structure, or the cause which gives rise to that structure, is one of the conditions of double refraction.|$|E

60|$|There is a duality in {{life that}} I cannot express except by such images as this, a duality so {{that we are at}} once absurd and full of sublimity, and most absurd when we are most anxious to render the real splendours that pervade us. This duplicity in life seems to me at times ineradicable, at times like the {{confusing}} of something essentially simple, like the duplication when one looks through a doubly refracting medium. You think in this latter mood that you have only to turn the crystal of <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar</b> about in order to have the whole thing plain. But you never get it plain. I have been doing my halting utmost to get down sincerely and simply my vision of life and duty. I have permitted myself no defensive restraints; I have shamelessly written my starkest, and it is plain to me that a smile that is not mine plays over my most urgent passages. There is a rebellious rippling of the grotesque under our utmost tragedy and gravity. One's martialled phrases grimace as one turns, and wink at the reader. None the less they signify. Do you note how in this that I have written, such a word as Believer will begin to wear a capital letter and give itself solemn ridiculous airs? It does not matter. It carries its message for all that necessary superficial absurdity.|$|E
6000|$|The best {{instrument}} I have as yet contrived {{and used}} for optical superimposition is a [...] "double-image prism" [...] of <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar</b> (see Fig., p. 228), formerly procured for me by the late Mr. Tisley, optician, Brompton Road. They have a clear aperture of a square, half an inch in the side, and when held {{at right angles to}} the line of sight will separate the ordinary and extraordinary images to the amount of two inches, when the object viewed is held at seventeen inches from the eye. This is quite sufficient for working with carte-de-visite portraits. One image is quite achromatic, the other shows a little colour. The divergence may be varied and adjusted by inclining the prism to the line of sight. By its means the ordinary image of one component is thrown upon the extraordinary image of the other, and the composite may be viewed by the naked eye, or through a lens of long focus, or through an opera-glass (a telescope is not so good) fitted with a sufficiently long draw-tube to see an object at that short distance with distinctness. Portraits of somewhat different sizes may be combined by placing the larger one farther from the eye, and a long face may be fitted to a short one by inclining and foreshortening the former. The slight fault of focus thereby occasioned produces little or no sensible ill effect on the appearance of the composite.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the {{sunstone}} (sólarsteinn, a different mineral from the gem-quality sunstone) mentioned in medieval Icelandic texts was <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar,</b> and that Vikings used its light-polarizing property to tell {{the direction of the}} sun on cloudy days for navigational purposes. The polarization of sunlight in the Arctic can be detected, and the direction of the sun identified to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye, probably Haidinger's brush. The recovery of an <b>Iceland</b> <b>spar</b> sunstone from the Elizabethan ship Alderney, which sank in 1592, suggests that this navigational technology may have persisted after the invention of the magnetic compass.|$|E
