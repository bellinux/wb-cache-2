5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can {{remain in the}} soil for many years {{it is necessary to}} remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious.</b> Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E

Nearly all venomous species in Australia are elapids, as vipers are absent from the continent.|$|E

25|$|Traditional manmade {{threats to}} macaques have been slash-and-burn agriculture, use of forest woods for {{construction}} and fuel, and hunting. These threats have declined due {{to social and}} economic changes in Japan since World War II, but other threats have emerged. The replacement of natural forest with lumber plantations <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> threat. As human prosperity has grown, macaques have lost their fear of humans and have increased their presence in both rural and urban areas, with one macaque recorded living in central Tokyo for several months.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{municipality}} {{is covered in}} forest of one type or another, and these forests are its main natural resource. These forests have been having problems in recent years between insect and parasitic plant infestations and logging. The infestations have been more severe than usual because of drought conditions weakening trees. While there are strict environmental laws for the area {{as part of the}} biosphere reserve, enforcement is spotty. The forests of this and neighboring municipalities have attracting illegal logging from those outside the area. Pinal de Amoles is one of the Sierra Gorda municipalities where this problem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious.</b>|$|E
25|$|Excommunication. An {{individual}} who is excommunicated {{is no longer a}} member of the LDS Church. All of the restrictions of the disfellowshipped member also apply to excommunicated individuals. In addition, an excommunicated person is not permitted to pay tithing or fast offerings or wear the temple garment. Excommunication <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> sanction a disciplinary council can impose and is generally reserved for only the most severe offences. Excommunication is mandatory for murder and is almost always required for incest. Excommunication may also be appropriate for members who have been disfellowshipped and have not repented. Excommunication almost always lasts at least one year; only a reconvened disciplinary council may approve an excommunicated member for readmittance to the church through baptism.|$|E

Newer drugs such as BIMU-8 and CX-546 may be much more effective.|$|E
