5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, Rashid Johnson <b>exhibited</b> <b>The</b> Evolution of the Negro Political Costume in December 2004. He presented replicas of three outfits worn by African-American politicians. He included a late 1960s dashiki worn by Jesse Jackson, a 1980s running suit worn by Al Sharpton in the '80s and a business suit worn by then United States Senator-elect Barack Obama. The presentation, which invited inspection, was as likely to evoke humorous response to the Jackson dashika as well as critical commentary about the presentation of political attire.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović {{strove to}} make The Takovo Uprising as {{historically}} accurate as possible. He studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time}} of the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović led the people to revolt. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris over the course of several months in 1894. It was first <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> following year at his brother Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace.

5|$|Led Zeppelin II is the eponymous second studio album by the English {{rock band}} Led Zeppelin, {{released}} on 22 October 1969 in the United States and on 31 October 1969 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album {{took place at}} several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album's production was credited to the band's lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, and it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of the engineer Eddie Kramer. Incorporating several elements of blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin II <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar riff-based sound.

5|$|Palmyra's economy {{before and}} at the {{beginning}} of the Roman period was based on agriculture, pastoralism, trade, and serving as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a mixed economy based on agriculture, pastoralism, taxation, and, most importantly, the caravan trade. Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was <b>exhibited.</b> <b>The</b> law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city.|$|E
5|$|Some {{germanium}} compounds {{have been}} administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted {{in some cases}} of renal dysfunction, hepatic steatosis, and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (propagermanium), has not <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> same spectrum of toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|After World War II {{work on the}} {{synthesis}} of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> liquid crystalline state and developed {{a better understanding of}} how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world’s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{considered}} {{the painting to}} be his best work, insisting that it form the centrepiece of his 1849 Royal Society of Arts solo exhibition. The Royal Manchester Institution was concerned that the painting would be damaged if moved, refusing {{to allow it to}} be used in the exhibition until Etty, and a number of influential friends, visited Manchester to beg them to release it. Etty died later that year, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. As it was rarely <b>exhibited,</b> <b>The</b> Sirens and Ulysses had little influence on later artists, although it is credited as an influence on Frederic Leighton's 1858 The Fisherman and the Syren.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> {{painting}} at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Krøyer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Krøyer probably met during his time in Paris. Larsson had started painting in watercolours while {{a member of the}} Grez-sur-Loing artists' colony in France. On returning to Sweden, he had begun {{a series of}} pictures of family life with his wife and children in Sundborn in the mid-1890s, publishing it as Ett hem (A home) in 1899. Krøyer's paintings display no signs of disturbance or frustration but leave an impression of a happy family environment, no doubt in accordance with Krøyer's own desires. He <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> three from Skagen in 1889 at Den Frie – the exhibition of the artists' association that had been formed in 1891 with Krøyer's support – under the collective title Fra mit Skagenshjem (From my Skagen Home).|$|E
5|$|The Glades {{culture is}} divided into three periods based on {{evidence}} found in middens. In 1947, archaeologist John Goggin described the three periods after examining shell mounds. He excavated one on Matecumbe Key, another at Gordon Pass near modern-day Naples, and a third south of Lake Okeechobee near modern-day Belle Glade. The Glades I culture, lasting from 500 BCE to 800 CE, was apparently focused around Gordon Pass and is considered the least sophisticated {{due to the lack of}} artifacts. What has been found—primarily pottery—is gritty and plain. With the advent of a well-established culture in 800 CE, the Glades II period is characterized by more ornate pottery, wide use of tools throughout the South Florida region, and the appearance of religious artifacts at burial sites. By 1200, the Glades III culture <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> height of their development. Pottery became ornate enough to be subdivided into types of decoration. More importantly, evidence of an expanding culture is revealed through the development of ceremonial ornaments made from shell, and the construction of large earthworks associated with burial rituals. From the Glades III culture developed two distinct tribes that lived in and near the Everglades: the Calusa and the Tequesta.|$|E
