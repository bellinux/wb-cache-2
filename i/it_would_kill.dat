25|$|Other related Old Norse Tales {{are those}} such as King Hrolfr Kraki, where the main protagonist King Hrolfr of Denmark is tricked into marrying his own daughter. Yet the most {{striking}} similarity to Tolkien's work are the tales of swords such as Tyrfing, that appears in the Hervarar Saga. Svafrlami was the King of Gardariki, and a grandson of the god Odin. He caught the dwarves, Dvalin and Durin, and forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would never miss a stroke, would never rust and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes. The dwarves made the sword, and it shone and gleamed like fire. However, in revenge they cursed it so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> a man every time it was used {{and that it would}} be the cause of three great evils. They also cursed it so that it would in the end, kill Svafrlami himself. Then there is Dáinsleif, a sword from the legend of the eternal battle Hjaðningavíg, made by the dwarf Dain. Like Tyrfing, Dainsleif gave wounds that never healed and once drawn it could not be sheathed again without killing a man.|$|E

The Giants instead find the dragon Fin Fang Foom, who is {{revealed}} to be the Midgard Serpent in disguise. Time slows as the pair - mortal enemies due to prophecy that stated they would kill each other during Ragnarök — battle to the death. Thor kills the Serpent, although his body is completely pulverized. Loki restores the Destroyer, and after killing the Ice Giants finds Thor's now liquid form. The Destroyer attempts to disintegrate the thunder god but can not do so due to Hela's curse. Thor assumes mental control of the Destroyer, and forces Hela on pain of death to restore his true form. The thunder god then breaks Loki's arm as punishment for his actions. Thor meets and battles Leir, the Celtic god of lightning. After another encounter with the Celestials on an alien world; Thor finds Odin — a captive of Seth — and uses the Odinpower to fend off a returning Surtur; and defeats Annihilus while Asgard is in the Negative Zone. Thor battles X-Men foe the Juggernaut and meets the New Warriors.|$|E

At least two significant landslides from the southern flank of Pylon Peak 8,700and 4,400years ago dumped volcanic debris into the adjacent valley of Meager Creek.

2500|$|Sackveille-West's novel Challenge also bears {{witness to}} her affair with Trefusis: Sackville-West and Trefusis had started {{writing this book}} as a {{collaborative}} endeavour, and the male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. Challenge is a roman à clef with the character of Julian being only a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Trefusis. Notably, Sackville-West in Challenge defends Trefusis against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Trefussis a [...] "swine" [...] and a [...] "pig", and in the book Julian goes {{out of his way}} to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig. In the book, Julian says that [...] "Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine". Reflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an [...] "insinuating femininity" [...] that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence. [...] Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: [...] "Don't please dedicate it to Violet, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> me if you did". When Challenge was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: [...] "This book is yours, honored witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free". Throughout their relationship, Trefusis was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue. As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown. The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Trefusis. Her mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son Nigel Nicolson (1973, p.194) praises his mother: [...] "She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything… How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?" ...|$|E
