Detailed data on the decisions of 1, 694 bio-scientists allow to detect {{similarities and differences between}} academia-based and industry-based scientists. Arguments from social capital theory are applied to explain why individuals share information even at (temporary) personal cost. In both realms, the results suggest that the likelihood of sharing decreases with the competitive value of the requested information. Factors related to social capital, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>expected</b> reciprocity {{and the extent to which}} a scientist’s community conforms to the norm of open science, either directly affect information-sharing or moderate competitive interest considerations on information-sharing. The effect depends on the system to which a scientist belongs. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The dorsomedial {{prefrontal cortex}} (DMPFC) {{has been shown}} to be {{involved}} in attending differ-ent states, all including a strong emotional component. It remains unclear, though, whether neural activity in the DMPFC is predominantly determined by either a particular domain, as emotional stimuli, or by a specific process, as attention. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the alternative hypotheses of domain- versus process-specificity in DMPFC. Subjects had to perceive pictures from three different domains, sexual, emotional, and neutral stimuli, in both a nonattended, i. e., unexpected, and attended, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>expected</b> mode. Our results show DMPFC activation during attended, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>expected</b> stimulus perception when compared with nonattended, i. e., unexpected stimuli perception. DMPFC activation and corresponding behavioral changes (reaction time, subjective ratings) were observed in all three domains, sexual, emotional, and neutral stimuli. As opposed to those process-specific effects that were found pre-dominantly in posterior DMPFC, a process by domain interaction was found to be characteristic for more anterior parts of the DMPFC. Taken together, our findings favour the hypothesis that neural activity in the posterior DMPFC is determined by a specific process, i. e., attending stimuli, and thus characterized by process-specificity rather than by a particular domain, i. e., sexual, emotional, or neutral stimuli, reflecting domain-specificity. This suggests that the anterior and posterior DMPFC is involved in the process of attending mental states while remaining more (posterior DMPFC) or less (anterior DMPFC) independent of the type or domain of the respective stimulus.

40|$|The {{question}} of what type of purchase (i. e., experiential vs. material) typically advances more happiness has been answered (Van Boven and Gilovich, 2003). This dissertation employed three different manipulation methods across six studies to investigate what underlies this effect. A consistent pattern of results demonstrated that verbal sharing (i. e., telling others) helps explain the superiority of experiential purchases in advancing happiness. Moreover, I found that people's greater inclination to share about their experiential (vs. material) purchases is driven by their expectation of being more highly regarded by their listeners. Taken together, these findings shed light on a behavioral (i. e., sharing) and psychological process (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>expected</b> regard) that help us understand why experiences make people happier than do material objects...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} smooth preferences structure under ambiguity that allows to represent an ambiguity averse behavior also in a context of continuous-time uncertainty. This is not achieved by prior smooth, ambiguity sensitive preferences models. The devised preferences structure is then used in two applications. First, I analyze the optimal portfolio choice, and its pricing consequences, for an ambiguity averse investor. It is shown that trading behaviors and pricing implications that are at odds with the traditional finance theory can be explained by ambiguity aversion. Second, I study the survival chances of ambiguity averse agents in a competitive economy. Under some conditions, smooth ambiguity averse agents can also survive when competing with the most rational agents, i. <b>e.</b> <b>expected</b> utility maximizers...|$|E
40|$|Trust towards {{unrelated}} {{individuals is}} often conditioned by information about previous social interactions {{that can be}} derived from either personal or vicarious experience (e. g., reputation). Intergroup stereotypes can be operationalized as expectations about other groups' traits/attitudes/behaviors that heavily influence our behavioral predictions when interacting with them. In this study we investigated the role of perceived social dimensions of the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) -Warmth (W) and Competence (C) -in affecting trusting behavior towards different European national group members during the Trust Game. Given the well-known role of ideological attitudes in regulating stereotypes, we also measured individual differences in right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). In Experiment 1, we designed an online survey to study one-shot intergroup trust decisions by employing putative members of the European Union states which were also rated along SCM dimensions. We found that low-RWA participants' trusting behavior was driven by perceived warmth (i. e., the dimension signaling the benevolence of social intentions) when interacting with low-C groups. In Experiment 2, we investigated the dynamics of trust in a multiple-round version of the European Trust Game. We found that in low-RWA participants trusting behavior decreased over time when interacting with high-W groups (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>expected</b> to reciprocate trust), but did not change when interacting with low-W groups (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>expected</b> not to reciprocate trust). Moreover, we found that high-RWA participants' trusting behavior decreased when facing low-W groups but not high-W ones. This suggests that low-RWA individuals employ reputational priors but are also permeable to external evidence when learning about others' trustworthiness. In contrast, high-RWA individuals kept relying on stereotypes despite contextual information. These results confirm the pivotal role played by reputational priors triggered by perceived warmth in shaping social interactions...|$|E
