5|$|The Mormon <b>handcart</b> pioneers were {{participants}} in the migration of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as the LDS Church) to Salt Lake City, Utah, who used handcarts to transport their belongings. The Mormon <b>handcart</b> movement began in 1856 and continued until 1860.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} lessons had been {{learned from the}} 1856 {{disaster}} that allowed the Church to continue the <b>handcart</b> system while avoiding another disaster. Never again would a <b>handcart</b> company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.|$|E

30|$|The {{process of}} {{transporting}} a cuboid object with four <b>handcarts</b> is explained here, but this proposed method {{is not necessarily}} limited to four <b>handcarts.</b> The proposed transport method can also resolve problems when using n <b>handcarts</b> to transport general shaped objects.|$|R
30|$|As {{a future}} work, {{contact with the}} ground when an object is placed on four or more <b>handcarts</b> {{will be a major}} problem to be tackled. This problem is {{important}} considering the transportable weight of <b>handcarts,</b> but it could be resolved by introducing suspension or some other form of compliance to each handcart; however, this would make it difficult to keep the <b>handcarts</b> compact.|$|R
30|$|As stated earlier, the {{transport}} method using <b>handcarts</b> and mobile robots faces {{the following two}} problems. One problem is the sliding of the already inserted <b>handcarts</b> during the second tilting work. This {{is a result of}} the low friction force between the <b>handcarts</b> and the floor surface. If the friction force is too high, it will be difficult to push the object. In brief, during the tilting operation and during the pushing operation, there is a big difference in the required coefficient of friction between the <b>handcarts</b> and the floor surface. The second problem is the danger of tilting or sliding caused by the reaction force generated while the robot is tilting the object. Thus, while operating the object, the robots are fixed in position, and when moving, they are released. To address the two problems, functions that fix and release the object according to the tasks that both robots are performing is required. Regarding the former, <b>handcarts</b> are equipped with a controllable lock mechanism that can lock or unlock the <b>handcarts.</b> The latter problem is resolved by using an outrigger.|$|R

5|$|The {{trail was}} used for more than 20 years, until the {{completion}} of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Among the emigrants were the Mormon <b>handcart</b> pioneers of 1856–60. Two of the <b>handcart</b> companies, led by James G. Willie and Edward Martin, met disaster on the trail when they departed late and were caught by heavy snowstorms in Wyoming.|$|E

5|$|By 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; {{almost all}} of the <b>handcart</b> emigrants that year and in {{subsequent}} years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of <b>handcart</b> emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way to Utah to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.|$|E

5|$|About 815 emigrants {{from the}} first two ships were {{organized}} into the first three <b>handcart</b> companies, headed by captains Edmund Ellsworth, Daniel D. McArthur, and Edward Bunker. The captains were missionaries returning to their homes in Utah and {{were familiar with the}} route. Most of the sub-captains were also returning missionaries.|$|E

30|$|The {{problems}} during the loading process (1) are, as stated earlier, the tilting of the robot or the sliding of the <b>handcarts.</b> During transport (2), the friction with the floor {{has to be}} reduced while the transported object is on the <b>handcarts</b> so that the mobile robots can transport the object by pushing. Control of the robots when they are pushing has, as stated above, already been proposed, and can be adopted. The steps of the unloading process (3) {{are assumed to be}} the steps used to load the object performed in reverse.|$|R

5|$|Near Wood River, Nebraska, {{a herd of}} bison {{caused the}} Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each <b>handcart</b> was {{required}} to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} <b>handcart</b> {{companies}} made the journey in 1860, again following the route through St. Joseph. Although the journey {{proved to be}} difficult for the emigrants, these companies had relatively uneventful trips and experienced little loss of life.|$|E
5000|$|A 1954 {{report in}} The Manchester Guardian {{mentions}} that some men could {{make as much}} as £25 a day collecting rags. Most used <b>handcarts</b> rather than a bag, and some used a pony and cart, giving out rubbing stones {{in exchange for the}} items they collected. [...] In 1958 a Manchester Guardian reporter accompanied one rag-and-bone man, John Bibby, as he made his rounds through Chorlton and Stretford, near Manchester. For his <b>handcart's</b> load, which comprised rags, furs, shoes, scrap car parts, a settee and other furniture, he made about £2.|$|R

5|$|Although {{fewer than}} 10 {{percent of the}} 1846–68 Latter-day Saint emigrants made the journey west using handcarts, the <b>handcart</b> pioneers have become an {{important}} symbol in LDS culture, representing the faithfulness and sacrifice of the pioneer generation. They continue to be recognized and honored in events such as Pioneer Day, Church pageants, and similar commemorations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the <b>handcart</b> company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} <b>handcart</b> party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
5|$|The <b>handcart</b> {{companies}} {{continued with}} more success until 1860, and traditional ox-and-wagon companies also continued {{for those who}} could afford the higher cost. After 1860, the church began sending wagon companies east each spring, to return to Utah in the summer with the emigrating Latter-day Saints. Finally, with {{the completion of the}} Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, future emigrants were able to travel by rail, and the era of the Mormon pioneer trail came to an end.|$|E
