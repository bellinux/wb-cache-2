500|$|Clinton gave {{testimony}} to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, [...] "With all due respect, the <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys {{out for a walk}} one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, senator." [...] Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative Jeff Duncan accusing her of [...] "national security malpractice" [...] and Senator Rand Paul saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator John McCain said that while [...] "It's wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.|$|E
2500|$|Khazaria {{developed}} a Dual kingship governance structure,clan, identified with Obadiyah, compelled the Qağanal clan to convert, an event which putatively caused the Qabar revolt. Golden comments: [...] "There {{is nothing but}} conjecture to connect it with the reforms of Obadiyah, the further evolution of Khazar Judaism or the Qabars... The <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> do not know when, precisely, the Khazar system of dual kingship emerged. It could not have come ex nihilo. It was not present {{in the early stages}} of Khazar history. Given the Old Türk traditions of the Khazar state... and the overall institutional conservation of steppe society, one must exercise great caution here. Clear evidence for it is relatively late (the latter part of the ninth century perhaps and more probably the tenth century)- although it was probably present by the first third of the ninth century. Iranian influences via the Ors guard of the Qağans may have also been a factor" [...] typical among Turkic nomads, consisting of a shad/bäk and a qağan. The emergence of this system may be deeply entwined with the conversion to Judaism. According to Arabic sources, the lesser king was called îšâ and the greater king Khazar xâqân; the former managed and commanded the military, while the greater king's role was primarily sacral, less concerned with daily affairs. The greater king was recruited from the Khazar house of notables (ahl bait ma'rûfīn) and, in an initiation ritual, was nearly strangled until he declared the number of years he wished to reign, on the expiration of which he would be killed by the nobles. The deputy ruler would enter the presence of the reclusive greater king only with great ceremony, approaching him barefoot to prostrate himself in the dust and then light a piece of wood as a purifying fire, while waiting humbly and calmly to be summoned. Particularly elaborate rituals accompanied a royal burial. At one period, travellers had to dismount, bow before the ruler's tomb, and then walk away on foot. Subsequently, the charismatic sovereign's burial place was hidden from view, with a palatial structure ('Paradise') constructed and then hidden under rerouted river water to avoid disturbance by evil spirits and later generations. Such a royal burial ground (qoruq) is typical of inner Asian peoples. Both the îšâ and the xâqân converted to Judaism sometime in the 8th century, while the rest, according to the Persian traveller Ahmad ibn Rustah, probably followed the old Tūrkic religion.|$|E
