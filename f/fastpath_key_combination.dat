50|$|Finding a {{definition}} for warm boot, however, {{is more of}} a challenge. All aforementioned sources indicate that a warm boot is initiated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination; all except Tulloch (2002) mention that a warm reboot does not perform POST. Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) specifies that for a warm reboot to occur, BIOS must be the recipient of the <b>key</b> <b>combination.</b> Microsoft Support article 102228 takes a more technical approach and defines a warm boot a result of invoking INT 19h, a BIOS interrupt call; the Ctrl + Alt + Delete <b>key</b> <b>combination</b> {{is only one of the}} ways. According to Grimes (2001), malware may prevent or subvert a warm boot by intercepting Ctrl + Alt + Delete <b>key</b> <b>combination</b> and prevent it from reaching BIOS. Windows NT family of operating systems also does the same and reserves the <b>key</b> <b>combination</b> for its own use. Soper (2004) asserts that Windows restart command initiates a warm boot, thus contradicting Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) that believes the same action performs a cold boot.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the control}} key was located above, not below, the shift key—in {{the same place}} where most modern PC {{keyboards}} put the Caps Lock key. Many standard Unix <b>key</b> <b>combinations</b> were designed with the QWERTY layout and the ADM-3A's original Ctrl key placement in mind. Many of those <b>key</b> <b>combinations</b> are still in use today, even on non-Unix operating systems. Seasoned computer users familiar with the original layout often claim that the different position of the Ctrl key on modern PC keyboard layouts makes the use of Ctrl <b>key</b> <b>combinations</b> more cumbersome. Solutions exist for many operating systems to switch around the Caps Lock and Ctrl keys in software, thus making the PC keyboard layout more closely resemble the ADM-3A's keyboard layout.|$|R
