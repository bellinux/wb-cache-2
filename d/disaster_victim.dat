40|$|AbstractRelief {{housings}} {{are used}} to quickly provide <b>disaster</b> <b>victims</b> with a temporary living place whenever {{there is a natural}} disaster. However, few previous studies on the influences of the deterioration in living environments on the health of the <b>disaster</b> <b>victims</b> in relief housings might be identified. Therefore, a study on the influence of the deteriorations in living environments on the health of <b>disaster</b> <b>victims</b> following a severe natural disaster has been carried out and the study results are reported in this paper. Field tests on the thermal environment inside relief housings and questionnaire survey on the health of <b>disaster</b> <b>victims</b> in relief housings in Wenchuan earthquake disaster settlement area were performed. The study found that the thermal environment in relief housings was very poor in summer days, and that the deteriorations in the living environment had significantly negative impacts on the disaster victims’ mental state, sleep duration, appetite, and body weight. It also found that frequency of sickness, especially cold and heatstroke increased after moving into the relief housings. In addition, the number of doctor visitings by <b>disaster</b> <b>victims</b> in tents and in prefabricated houses increased by 55. 4 % and 44. 4 %, respectively. The study results revealed that it is of great urgency to improve the living environments in relief housings following a natural disaster for the better health of <b>disaster</b> <b>victims...</b>|$|R

25|$|Christchurch Police were {{supplemented}} by {{staff and resources}} from around the country, along with a 323-strong contingent of Australian Police, who were sworn in as New Zealand Police on their arrival, bringing {{the total number of}} officers in the city to 1200. Many of them received standing ovations from appreciative locals as they walked through Christchurch Airport upon arrival. Alongside regular duties, the police provided security cordons, organised evacuations, supported search and rescue teams, missing persons and family liaison, and organised media briefings and tours of the affected areas. They also provided forensic analysis and evidence gathering at fatalities and <b>Disaster</b> <b>Victim</b> Identification (DVI) teams, working closely with pathologists, forensic dentists and scientists, and the coroner at the emergency mortuary established at Burnham Military Camp. They were aided by DVI teams from Australia, UK, Thailand Taiwan and Israel.|$|E

2500|$|Titus {{authored}} {{the bill}} that provides for the rescue of pets in a natural disaster emergency. The bill was co-sponsored by Senators Randolph Townsend and Valerie Wiener. Titus told Las Vegas television station Channel 3 KVBC: [...] "We all remember heartbreaking scenes and stories from Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida... When lives are turned upside down by disaster, people seek comfort and normalcy. To exacerbate problems by forcing a <b>disaster</b> <b>victim</b> to leave behind a beloved pet – a member of their family – is both unconscionable and entirely unnecessary. Emergency responders can and should take into account pets and service animals in disaster rescue and recovery plans. Planning could save disaster victims from needless additional pain at a most difficult time." [...] The bill {{was signed into law}} in June 2007.|$|E
