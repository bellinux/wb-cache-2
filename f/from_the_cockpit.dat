5|$|The canopy hinges open to {{the right}} and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low in the cockpit, {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of the canopy to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the crash in Dryden criticised {{approaches}} to deicing. It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II deicing fluid rather than Type I, deicing trucks near the runway {{rather than at the}} gate, and that the crew should inspect their wings not only <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> but also the cabin. The report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry’s sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations.|$|E
5|$|Of the 158 {{people on}} board, 73 {{died as a}} result of the crash. The lead flight {{attendant}} was the only crew member to survive. Of the surviving passengers, 72 adults and children over three years old sustained serious injuries, while two sustained minor injuries. Of the 11 infants, two sustained minor injuries, eight were seriously injured, and one, Kenneth Fernando Martinez, the four-month-old son of Gloria L. Martinez, died. The surviving steward testified that there had been no communication <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> as to the unfolding situation and, thus, no warning in the end to assume brace positions. The NTSB report held that, had passengers been warned ahead of time to brace for impact, the severity of some injuries might have been avoided.|$|E

5000|$|The new chassis was {{completely}} different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 135 in its dimensions, proportions, and structural design. Even in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> area, <b>the</b> new chassis {{had a large}} parallel-sided central structure, whereas the Type 135's was tapered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit's</b> rear cross-member forward, and it was considerably narrower. A very distinct feature was the nearly round open hoop through both rear chassis-rails, through which the DeDion tube and splined half-shafts extended, out to the hub-carriers attached to the rear leaf springs. The rear section of the chassis aft of <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> was visually quite similar to the Type 57 Bugatti in this respect.|$|R
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Serrate {{used the}} Mk. IV {{equipment}} for reception and display, replacing only the receiver unit. This could be switched {{in or out}} of the circuit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> which turned off the transmitter as well. In a typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional cues from the displays to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was not supplied, but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the final approach.|$|E
5|$|The P variant {{had similar}} {{features}} to the Do 17M-1, with added blind flying and camera equipment for reconnaissance work. The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines {{with a maximum}} performance of 865PS (853hp, 636kW) each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (Funkgerät), the PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - Funkblindlandegerät). The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom (EiV -Eigenverständigungsanlage). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection for the cameras. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The B-4's {{fuselage}} {{was based}} on a chrome-molybdenum steel frame. It had a [...] American Cirrus III four-cylinder, upright inline engine in the nose with an aluminium firewall and tanks in the wing roots. <b>The</b> two tandem <b>cockpits,</b> fitted with dual controls, were over the wing. <b>The</b> view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> forward <b>cockpit,</b> placed around quarter-chord, was good and <b>the</b> instructor's view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit</b> was improved with windows in the underside wing roots.|$|R
2500|$|It was a parasol aircraft, {{with wings}} of {{constant}} chord and with slightly pointed, semi-elliptical tips. The thin-airfoil-section wings were built around two lattice girder spars {{and had a}} skin thickness of 300μm. [...] There was a large, trapezoidal cut-out in the trailing edge to improve <b>the</b> view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits.</b> [...] Its aileron hinges were set at a shallow angle to the trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|The first battle {{fought with}} neither side {{sighting}} <b>the</b> other except <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> {{of their respective}} aircraft, the engagement in the Coral Sea stopped the Japanese thrust toward Port Moresby. It was a strategic victory for the Allies, but a tactical one for the enemy, since the Japanese had inflicted heavier damage on the American carriers. Besides the loss of Lexington, Yorktown had been badly damaged.|$|R
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E
25|$|The rudder and {{elevators}} were of {{the same}} construction as the ailerons. Trim tabs were adjustable <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{the crash}} {{two of the}} {{inflatable}} chutes deployed into the cabin. The first chute, which blocked the forward right exit, nearly suffocated a flight attendant and was deflated by a pilot with a fire axe <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The second chute expanded {{toward the center of}} the aircraft near the fire. It trapped a second flight attendant until a co-pilot deflated it with a dinner knife.|$|E
25|$|Mooney began {{producing}} the aircraft in 1968 as the Mooney A2-A. Next the company redesigned the fuselage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> back, with square windows behind the sliding canopy. Even as it produced the A2-A Cadet, Mooney was busy re-designing the aircraft. On February 23, 1968, the first Mooney Cadet M-10 flew.

Actual pyrotechnics work was done at Indian Dunes, California, with actor Bruce Willis' ejection composited into the shot later.|$|E
25|$|The engines were unusually quiet {{because the}} {{exhausts}} were muffled by the General Electric turbo-superchargers on the twin Allison V12s. There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too {{hot in the}} tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as {{the distance of the}} engines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to solve these problems.|$|E
