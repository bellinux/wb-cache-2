40|$|As {{a result}} of fast {{developments}} in information and communication technology and the trend to reduce costs, the way of operating modem vessels will change. The introduction of <b>integrated</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>systems</b> contributes to solving {{the problem of the}} different 'islands of information' {{as can be seen in}} the present situation. The main objective of <b>integrated</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>systems</b> aboard of both naval and merchant vessels is to use common data from different origin. Data obtained by one function to operate the vessel should be made available for others. Integration prevents duplication of sensors and decreases the workload of the crew. Even more important, integration increases safety of operation due to, among others, the transition of manual to automatic processing and the introduction of decision support systems. The availability of common data is also important for the logistic process and typical shore applications as vessel traffic management and shore based pilotage. A vessel is sailing to transport cargo in order to fiilfil a part of the intermodal transport chain. Optimising this chain will require real-time information from the vessels at the shore. Also the transition of Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) to Vessel Traffic Management and Information Systems (VTMIS) requires additional information. It is clear that <b>integrated</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>systems</b> provide an added value for shore applications. To take advantage of this fact it is essential to apply new developments in communication technology (e. g. transponders) in order to exchange data between ship and shore. The paper describes the functional ideas of the Bridge 2000 project with regard to the added value for the shore. The Bridge 2000 project is a study, aiming to integrate information of several subsystems and to define human interfaces. Furthermore, international developments related to ship-shore communication and shore applications will be briefly presented m the paper. Topics include <b>integrated</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>systems,</b> developments in communication technology, transponders and shore applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Advantages in the {{adoption}} of integrated systems on a ship’s bridge are quantified {{with respect to a}} more traditional bridge layout. The study is performed by modelling the causation factor for a ship-to-ship collision scenario. The assessment is provided in terms of the probability distribution of the time required to the officer on the watch (OOW) to complete a foreseen procedure aimed at avoiding a collision with another ship. The time needed to identify and agree the evasive manoeuvre with the second ship is evaluated for the two layouts, considering also a probabilistic occurrence of disturbances distracting and delaying the OOW during the procedure. Bayesian networks are employed to model the scenario. A general increment of the reactivity of the OOW in the <b>integrated</b> <b>bridge</b> is seen, represented by a shorter time to complete the procedure and by a reduced probability of being interrupted. The overall effect is an increase in the time available to put into practice the manoeuvre itself and, eventually, to avoid the collision.
