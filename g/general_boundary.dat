It follows that the formation volume for defects controlling atomic mobility across <b>general</b> <b>boundaries</b> is significantly less than of those controlling diffusion along boundaries and dislocation climb. Investigations of diffusion mechanisms by means of high pressure methods have a long tradition (see for instance ref. 1). The advan-tage of measurements of the effect of high pressure on diffusion is that it allows to determine the changes of the volume of the inves-tigated body due to the creation and motion of defects controlling the diffusion kinetics. The basic equation in that respect is (1) : where: V X is the activation volume, R- gas constant, T- temperature...|$|R

50|$|As {{shown in}} 9, the {{well-known}} Duhamel's integral for heat flux {{on a plate}} with arbitrary variable temperature is a sum of series of consequent temperature derivatives. This series in fact is a <b>general</b> <b>boundary</b> condition which becomes a condition of the third kind in the first approximation. Each of those two expressions {{in the form of}} Duhamel's integral or in a series of derivatives reduces a conjugate problem to the solution of only the conduction equation for the body at given conjugate conditions. An example of an early conjugate problem solution using Duhamel's integral has been performed8. In 9 this approach has been applied both in integral and in series forms and is generalized for laminar and turbulent flows with pressure gradient, for flows at wide range of Prandtl and Reynolds numbers, for compressible flow, for power-law non-Newtonian fluids, for flows with unsteady temperature variations and some other more specific cases.|$|E
50|$|The Nile {{flows from}} Africa (Nubia), north into Egypt and {{eventually}} disperses into the Mediterranean Sea. As the Nile flows northward into Egypt through Africa, there are cataracts throughout the river. Cataracts are {{areas in the}} river where there are patches of rock, making the river dangerous and unnavigable by boat. These cataracts would serve as <b>general</b> <b>boundary</b> points for the Egyptian Empire, and often settlements and forts were constructed around these natural boundaries. Egypt’s natural boundary was around {{the area of the}} first cataract, just south of Aswan. The Nubian empire was Egypt’s historical enemy, with its territory spread throughout the areas of the second cataract, down into the area of Kush, and around the 4th and 5th cataracts around the area of Khartoum (Modern day Sudan). Around the time of the Second Intermediate Period Nubia had seized the land up past Egypt’s normal border around the 1st cataract, almost wiping out Egypt’s empire. Egyptian Pharaoh Ahmose, crushed the Nubian expansion and re-established Egyptian dominance by reunifying the empire which and turning back the Nubians to the south.|$|E

He is, according to , the founder of the theory of partial differential equations of non-positive characteristics: in the paper [...] he introduced the now called Fichera's function, in order to identify subsets of the boundary of the domain where the boundary value problem for such kind of equations is posed, where it is necessary or not to specify the boundary condition: another account of the theory can be found in the paper , which is written in English and was later translated in Russian and Hungarian.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, Calimesa {{is divided}} from the City of Yucaipa by the Wildwood Canyon Wash; politically, [...] "County Line Road" [...] divides the two towns. Much {{of what was}} {{originally}} known as [...] "Calimesa" [...] actually lies within the city boundaries of Yucaipa, including [...] "I-Street" [...] (Calimesa) Park and Calimesa Elementary School. Because State of California law prohibits the incorporation or annexation of cities over county lines, the city was unable to adjoin what was considered the town of Calimesa when it finally incorporated. When Yucaipa incorporated, it included the area outside of the Yucaipa Valley on the [...] "hilltop" [...] or [...] "mesa" [...] that was traditionally known as Calimesa within its city boundaries, {{so as not to}} leave a gap of unincorporated area between the two towns.
