5|$|Argentina {{possesses}} definite comparative {{advantages in}} agriculture, {{as the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth.

5|$|After he {{returned}} to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair relocated to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the University of Chicago as an anthropology student (in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that only conferred the higher master's degree) on the G.I. Bill. He augmented his <b>income</b> <b>by</b> working as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago at night. Jane accepted a scholarship from the university to study Russian literature as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, Mark (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the University without any degree (despite having completed his undergraduate education) when his master's thesis on the Ghost Dance religious movement was unanimously rejected by the department.|$|E
5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple his annual <b>income</b> <b>by</b> touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E

5|$|Hammond was {{involved}} with several businesses. In 1933, to ease his financial concerns, {{he took a job}} with the Cater Motor Company. He was used as a sales promotions manager, which mainly involved publicity and meeting customers, although he also test-drove cars. Taking a job with Marsham Tyres in 1937 enabled him to become an amateur cricketer. He joined the board of directors and was again used for publicity, but he was never a hard worker or determined salesman. Returning to Marsham's after he was discharged from the RAF in 1944, he supplemented his <b>income</b> <b>by</b> working as a journalist. He wrote for The Star during the 1948 Test series and penned three books with the assistance of a ghostwriter.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, with {{finances}} {{given to}} her by United Artists executive Richard Stewart, Tina returned onstage, giving a round of shows in Las Vegas in a cabaret setting, influenced by the cabaret shows she witnessed while {{a member of the}} Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She took her cabaret act to smaller venues in the United States. Turner earned further <b>income</b> <b>by</b> appearing on shows such as The Hollywood Squares, Donny and Marie, The Sonny & Cher Show and The Brady Bunch Hour.

30|$|The key {{variable}} {{in this study}} is the relationship between the identified ultimate controller and the board chair. We define a dummy variable, NFChair, taking a value of one if the chair is not a family member (and 0 otherwise). Following previous research (Bennedsen et al. 2007; Bertrand et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2015), we measure firm performance using return on assets and return on sales, where return is computed using net income or operating income. 5 These variables are ROA (net <b>income</b> divided <b>by</b> total assets), OROA (operating <b>income</b> divided <b>by</b> total assets), ROS (net <b>income</b> divided <b>by</b> total sales) and OROS (operating <b>income</b> divided <b>by</b> total sales).|$|R

5|$|In 1995 Beyoncé's father {{resigned}} {{from his job}} to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's <b>income</b> <b>by</b> half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly {{to work on their}} first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|In November 1995 the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust {{purchased}} the locomotive for £200,000 (through a third party) {{and the following}} February it {{was transferred to the}} Trust's premises at the Midland Railway in Butterley,Derbyshire. In 1998, funded by public donation and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the third party purchaser was paid off and the money was now available to restore the locomotive. The work was carried out at the railway workshops at Swanwick Junction and in July 2001 the restored locomotive was allowed a trial run on the national rail network, where it promptly broke down and had to be towed home. With the fault fixed, No. 46233 now started to generate <b>income</b> <b>by</b> hauling enthusiasts' trains, as well as the Royal Train on two occasions. Following another overhaul commencing in 2010, the locomotive resumed its steaming duties in 2012. As at October 2016, it is still owned by the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust and still pulling enthusiasts' specials.|$|E
