They include the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Mermaid, the Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep, the Toad, the <b>Darning</b> Needle, the Emperor's New Clothes, the Sea Horse, the Paper Boat, the Flying Trunk and the Wild Swans. There is also a distinctive statue of Andersen in Eventyrparken (The Fairy Tale Park) beside the cathedral. Sculpted by Louis Hasselriis in 1888, it shows the storyteller with a book in his hand, ready to entertain onlookers with his fairy tales.|$|E

Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. Female legislators took advantage of the momentum to draft a bill allowing women to volunteer for any position, if they could qualify.|$|E

25|$|In early 1923, and in poor health, Baird {{moved to}} 21 Linton Crescent, Hastings, {{on the south}} coast of England. He later rented a {{workshop}} in the Queen's Arcade in the town. Baird built {{what was to become}} the world's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors, some <b>darning</b> needles, a few bicycle light lenses, a used tea chest, and sealing wax and glue that he purchased. In February 1924, he demonstrated to the Radio Times that a semi-mechanical analogue television system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images. In July of the same year, he received a 1000-volt electric shock, but survived with only a burnt hand, and as a result his landlord, Mr Tree, asked him to vacate the premises. Baird gave the first public demonstration of moving silhouette images by television at Selfridges department store in London in a three-week series of demonstrations beginning on 25 March 1925.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, dragonflies {{have often}} been seen as sinister. Some English vernacular names, such as [...] "horse-stinger", [...] "devil's <b>darning</b> needle", and [...] "ear cutter", link them with evil or injury. Swedish {{folklore}} holds that the devil uses dragonflies to weigh people's souls. The Norwegian name for dragonflies is Øyenstikker ("eye-poker"), and in Portugal, they are sometimes called tira-olhos ("eyes-snatcher"). They are often associated with snakes, as in the Welsh name gwas-y-neidr, [...] "adder's servant". The Southern United States term [...] "snake doctor" [...] refers to a folk belief that dragonflies follow snakes around and stitch them back together if they are injured.|$|E
500|$|The Distrest Poet is an oil {{painting}} produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist William Hogarth. Reproduced as an etching and engraving, {{it was published}} in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740. The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. [...] It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing. [...] Near him sits his wife <b>darning</b> clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.|$|E

2500|$|Various tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to make hand-knitting easier. [...] Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and [...] "yarntainers". [...] Crochet hooks and a <b>darning</b> needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge. [...] The <b>darning</b> needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as Swiss <b>darning).</b> The crochet hook is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. [...] Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. [...] For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools {{have been developed}} to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. [...] A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by [...] "point protectors" [...] that cap the tapered ends. [...] Another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{point-like}} ornaments may {{be added}} to knitting for their look or to improve the wear of the fabric. [...] Examples include various types of bobbles, sequins and beads. [...] Long loops can also be drawn out and secured, forming a [...] "shaggy" [...] texture to the fabric; {{this is known as}} loop knitting. [...] Additional patterns can be made {{on the surface of the}} knitted fabric using embroidery; if the embroidery resembles knitting, it is often called Swiss <b>darning.</b> [...] Various closures for the garments, such as frogs and buttons can be added; usually buttonholes are knitted into the garment, rather than cut.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{women had}} served as pilots during the Israeli War of Independence {{and a few years}} thereafter, the Israel Defence Forces had until 1995 denied women the {{opportunity}} to become pilots. In 1995, civilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned the Israel High Court of Justice to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams, after being rejected on grounds of gender. Though president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, told Miller that she'd be better off staying home and <b>darning</b> socks, the court in 1996 eventually ruled that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. After the prohibition had been lifted, the first female graduate was F-16 navigator [...] "Shari" [...] in 1998, followed three years later by Roni Zuckerman, the first female jet fighter pilot in IAF history.|$|E
2500|$|Ordinarily, {{stitches}} are knitted in {{the same}} order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric. [...] However, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern. [...] Cables patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic; Aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling. [...] Arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric. [...] Knitters have developed methods for giving the illusion of a circular wale, such as appear in Celtic knots, but these are inexact approximations. [...] However, such circular wales are possible using Swiss <b>darning,</b> a form of embroidery, or by knitting a tube separately and attaching it to the knitted fabric.|$|E
2500|$|Fundamentally, {{women were}} thought to be taking work defined as [...] "men's work;" [...] however, the work women did was {{typically}} catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity. For example, in a Sperry Corporation recruitment pamphlet the company stated, [...] "Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press." [...] A Ford Motor Company at Willow Run bomber plant publication proclaimed, [...] "The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters." [...] One manager was even stated saying, [...] "Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied embroidery needles, knitting needles and <b>darning</b> needs all their lives?" [...] In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.|$|E
40|$|Background: Hernia repair in clean-{{contaminated}} or contaminated operations, as in {{incarcerated hernia}} operations, are still debated. Nylon <b>darn</b> repair technique, which foreign bodies {{are less than}} mesh, is cheap and effective for hernia repair despite the fact of its unpopularity. This research is aimed to analyze difference of infection occurence and bacterial count, and its correlation, between nylon <b>darn,</b> macroporous monofilament and multifilament mesh in clean-contaminated operations, in a rat model. Methods: A randomized, bias-free laboratory experimental study was conducted on thirty wister rats. Sample was divided into three groups and applied nylon <b>darn</b> or macroporous monofilament or multifilament mesh. Infection occurence was noted based on Hulton’s criteria, while bacterial count using Spread-Plate method. Results were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis, Mann Whitney, and Spearman tests as appropriate. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} in bacterial count (p= 0. 006), while no difference in infection occurence of all groups (p= 0. 13). There were significant differences between macroporous multifilament mesh vs nylon <b>darn</b> (p= 0. 005) and macroporous monofilament mesh (p= 0. 007). There was no difference in bacterial count between nylon <b>darn</b> vs macroporous monofilament mesh (p= 0. 940). There was strong correlation between infection occurence and bacterial count (p= 0. 000; Spearman’s rho 0. 662). Conclusion: Bacterial count in the application of macroporous multifilament mesh was significantly higher than nylon <b>darn</b> and macropore monofilament mesh, while {{there was no difference between}} nylon <b>darn</b> and macroporous monofilament mesh. There was no difference in infection occurence of all groups despite its strong correlation with bacterial count. Perhaps, it will be possible to note a significant difference of the infection occurence in clinical observation since surgical site infection occurs within 1 year after implant is in place.

2500|$|Because {{of poverty}} {{following}} the death of her father, Annie did not regularly attend school as a child, although she did attend later in childhood and in adulthood. On March 15, 1870, at age nine, Annie was admitted to the Darke County Infirmary, along with elder sister Sarah Ellen. According to her autobiography, she was put in the care of the infirmary's superintendent, Samuel Crawford Edington, and his wife Nancy, who taught her to sew and decorate. Beginning in the spring of 1870, she was [...] "bound out" [...] to a local family to help care for their infant son, on the false promise of fifty cents a week and an education. The couple had originally wanted someone who could pump water, cook, and who was bigger. She spent about two years in near-slavery to them where she endured mental and physical abuse. One time, the wife put Annie out in the freezing cold, without shoes, as a punishment because she had fallen asleep over some <b>darning.</b> Annie referred to them as [...] "the wolves".
