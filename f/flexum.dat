5000|$|The {{area around}} Mosonmagyaróvár has been {{inhabited}} since the 5th millennium BC, but {{settlement of the}} city proper can only be traced to around the 1st century, which was when the Roman Empire was extended to the Danube, creating the province of Pannonia. The Romans established a camp called Ad <b>Flexum</b> (Latin: [...] "towards the bend") {{at the site of}} Mosonmagyaróvár; {{it is likely that the}} Hungarians from the Árpád era would name the place Óvár due to the Roman ruins which would still be present during the 11th century. The purpose of Ad <b>Flexum</b> was to defend the Mosoni-Duna, but the security the legions provided also drew civilian settlement, especially since a major east-west trade route ran through the area. Circa 170 AD, Germanic barbarians who lived north of the Danube river attacked the settlement, nearly completely destroying it. The Romans reconquered the area around the 3rd century, and the town once again prospered, likely with a population of three or four thousand people. After the Emperor Valentinianus died in 375, Hunnic invasions drove the populace away.|$|E

30|$|Sometimes {{stiffness}} is {{not caused}} by the knee itself but rather by problems affecting other joints. Clinical outcome can be influenced by hip or spine disorders. Hip flexion contracture or dorsal–lumbar kiphosis can lead to knee <b>flexum.</b> Their evaluation and treatment is important and should be performed before knee surgery. Moreover, {{in the evaluation of}} a stiff knee, several neurological or muscular pathologies should be considered [26]. Finally, proper rehabilitation is mandatory to obtain satisfactory articular motion: intensive passive motion and pain control must be performed immediately after surgery. Conversely, a too aggressive rehabilitation may lead to an inflammatory reaction with persistent pain and joint contracture.|$|E

Free-ranging anatids were collected during the winters of 1990 through 1992 in Freestone, Chambers and Jefferson Counties, Texas. Intestines from 62 gadwalls (Anas Strepera), 13 mottled ducks (Anas fulvigula) and 13 ring- necked ducks (Aythya collaris) were examined for endohelminths. There {{was no significant difference in}} total endohelminth abundance between male and female, or juvenile and adult ducks, nor a significant correlation between body weight and parasite load. Parasite diversity decreased through the winter, predominatly due to the increase in abundance of the genus Microsomacanthus. The highest relative density of helminth species occurred in the duodenum and cecae of the hosts. Only one helminth species (Cloacataenia megalops) was found in the cloaca. Twenty-one helminth species, including four genera and six species of Cestoda, one genus and seven species of Digenea, one species of Acanthocephala, and two species of Nematoda, were found. There were also unidentified pseudophylideans. The resident mottled duck was host to more endoheiminth genera than either the gadwall or ring-necked duck, including C. megalops, Diorchis spp., Dicronataenia coronula, Fimbriaria fasciolaris, Microsomacanthus sp. 1 and sp. 2, Sobolevicanthus filumferens, and a pseudophylidean (cestode); Cotylurus flabelliformes, Echinoparyphium <b>flexum,</b> Echinostoma revolutum, Notocotylurus attenuatus, Psilochasmus oxyurus, Psilotrema sp., Zygocotyle lunata (digenean); P. obtusus (acanthocephalan); Trichostrongulus tenuis and Ascaridia gaffl (nematode). Gadwalls were host to C. megalops, Diorchis spp., Hamatolepis teresoides, Microsomacanthus sp. 1 and sp. 2, a pseudophylidean (cestode); Apetemon gracilis, C. flabelliformes, E <b>flexum,</b> E revolutum, N. attenuatus, P. oxyurus, Z lunata (digenean); P. obtusus; and T tenuis. Ring-necked ducks were host to C. megalops, Diploposthe laevis, Diorchis spp., F fasciolaris, Microsomacanthus sp. 1 and sp. 2, (cestode); C. flabelliformes, E <b>flexum,</b> E revolutum, P. oxyurus, Z lunata; and P. obtusus. In gadwalls, total endohelminth abundance increased from 75 in early winter (October-December) to 395 in late winter (January- April) (p = 0. 01 1). Most of this increase is attributed to the genus Microsomacanthus. Polymorphus obtusus abundance increased from 0. 5 in early winter to 5. 0 in late winter (p 0. 034); but most parasites did not exhibit a significant change in abundance through the winter. Zygocotyle lunata prevalence decreased through the winter...|$|E
40|$|Arthrogryposis is a {{congenital}} disorder {{characterized by}} multiple joint contractures {{found throughout the}} body at birth. We present {{the case of a}} 3. 5 year-old girl with multiple congenital defects: arthrogryposis involving bilateral hip, knee and ankle joints, together with sacral agenesis and with lumbar dysmorphism, anorectal agenesis, hydronephrosis of the left kidney as the result from reflux, right kidney hypoplasia, renal fusion and heart anomalies: tetralogy of Fallot. Immediately after birth, in several steps, colostomy, left ureterocystoneostomy and suprapubic cystostomy were performed. Later in infancy corrective surgery for the heart defect was required. At the age of 2 years, surgery for the equinovarus deformities and for left genu <b>flexum</b> was performed. Medical rehabilitation tries to maximize independent function. The main goals were increasing the muscle tonus of upper-limbs, increase the rate of motion of the joints, establishment of stability for ambulation, learning different schemes of movement according to her needs, obtaining of a functional independency.

40|$|Three genera {{and seven}} species {{belonging}} to the subfamily Zigzagiceratinae (family Perisphinctidae) are described from the Lower Bathonian of France and Saudi Arabia. Intraspecific dimorphism is recognized. A revision of the genus Franchia proposed by Sturani (1967), based on the syntypes and new specimens from south-east France, is presented. Franchia arkelli Sturani, Franchia subalpina sp. nov., Protozigzagiceras torrensi (Sturani), Protozigzagiceras tethycum sp. nov., Protozigzagiceras <b>flexum</b> sp. nov. and Protozigzagiceras densum sp. nov. are described from the Digne– Castellane region of south-east France. Megazigzagiceras subarabicum, gen. et sp. nov. is described from the Dharma region of Saudi Arabia. The successive Early Bathonian species of Franchia and Protozigzagiceras herein identified in West Tethyan areas, {{as members of the}} Mediterranean–Caucasian Subrealm, formed lasting separate peramorphoclines characterized by increasing hydrodynamic coiling of the shell. In contrast, rapid proterogenesis originated and diversified the earliest Bathonian zigzagiceratin lineages, giving paedomorphic members, commonly neotenic and more scarcely progenetic. Procerites–Siemiradzkia seems to be the oldest zigzagiceratin member in the French Subalpine, Iberian and Lusitanian basins, branched off by paedomorphosis from leptosphinctins at the Bajocian–Bathonian transition. The Mediterranean–Caucasian genera Franchia, Zigzagiceras, Zigzagites and Wagnericeras branched from successive species of Protozigzagiceras, in turn, a direct derivative of Procerites. The oldest lineages of the clade Zigzagiceratinae evolved by iterative, rapid, paedomorphic changes and additional, lasting, peramorphic modifications during the Early Bathonian...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFinal flexion {{mobility}} after a total knee arthroplasty is {{an important}} factor in patient comfort. Some patients gain in flexion mobility, others do not. Is it possible to identify the clinical factors related to the patient that predicted the final gain in flexion? Materials and methods: A multicenter retrospective study directed by the Societe francaise de la hanche etdu genou (SFHG) was conducted on 1601 cases of total knee arthroplasty that had presented no complications and a minimal follow-up of 2 years. The gain in flexion was assessed by the difference between the preoperative and the final range of flexion. The range of the gain in flexion was tested based on eight factors: age, gender, etiology, body mass index, frontal deformity, preoperative <b>flexum</b> deformity and four levels of preoperative mobility: = 130 degrees. Results: A mean gain in flexion of 8. 4 degrees +/- 14 degrees was found for the overall series. In 66 % of cases, we found an increase of flexion and in 19 % a loss of flexion. In cases with BMI higher than 35, varus deformity with an HKA angle = 130 degrees'' group. A decrease in flexion was noted in 51 % of the cases in the latter group. Other factors such as age, sex, and etiology had no influence on the gain in flexion. Discussion: After TKA, a gain in flexion was often noted. The amount of gain depended on the preoperative range of flexion: the lower this level was, the more flexion increased. The presence of a varus deformity, morbid obesity, or flessum was associated with greater gain in flexion, even if the final flexion was lower than the mean flexion in the overall population. The search for these factors made it possible to predict a gain in flexion and discuss this with the patient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUÃÃO. O termo fragilidade Ã aplicado aos indivÃduos idosos com alto risco para quedas, hospitalizaÃÃo, institucionalizaÃÃo e morte. Embora fragilidade esteja associada a quedas, os mecanismos exatos dessa associaÃÃo ainda nÃo estÃo suficientemente estabelecidos, o que pode limitar as intervenÃÃes nessa Ãrea. A alteraÃÃo da postura poderia ser um fator que nos idosos frÃgeis favoreceria a maior ocorrÃncia de quedas. Sendo assim, abordagens voltadas para a melhoria da postura poderiam ser importantes para a reduÃÃo de quedas em idosos. InvestigaÃÃes sobre a ocorrÃncia de alteraÃÃo da postura em idosos com fragilidade nÃo estÃo disponÃveis. OBJETIVO. Estimar as medidas angulares posturais entre idosos (idade de 60 anos ou mais) frÃgeis, prÃ-frÃgeis e nÃo-frÃgeis residentes em Ãrea urbana de Fortaleza, CearÃ. MÃTODOS. Foram avaliadas medidas angulares posturais, cujas alteraÃÃes implicam em prejuÃzo na dinÃmica {{corporal}} e risco de quedas, por meio do software de avaliaÃÃo postural â SAPO. No perÃodo de marÃo de 2009 a outubro de 2010, foram avaliados 158 idosos, na idade de 60 a 92 anos, oriundos de um inquÃrito realizado nos domicÃlios de uma Ãrea urbana da cidade de Fortaleza-CE, distribuÃdos em trÃs categorias: nÃo frÃgeis, prÃ-frÃgeis, e frÃgeis, seguindo os critÃrios de classificaÃÃo proposto no estudo de Fried et al., 2001. A relaÃÃo entre as medidas posturais e presenÃa de fragilidade ajustada para potenciais confundidores, foi estimada por meio de regressÃo logÃstica multivariada. RESULTADOS. Os indicadores posturais: posiÃÃo da cabeÃa anteriorizada (< 36 graus), joelho <b>flexum</b> (< 172 graus), tornozelo em dorsiflexÃo (< 77 graus), pernas tortas (&# 8805; 185 graus) apresentaram-se significativamente associados Ã fragilidade depois de ajustados para gÃnero, idade e IMC. CONCLUSÃO. AlteraÃÃes posturais estÃo associadas Ã fragilidade em idosos. A identificaÃÃo dos indicadores posturais associados Ã fragilidade pode orientar intervenÃÃes fisioterÃpicas que minimizem os desfechos indesejÃveis, como quedas e reduÃÃo das atividades fÃsicas. RATIONALE. The term frailty {{is applied}} to aged individuals with high risk for falls, hospitalization, institutionalization and death. Frailty is associated with falls, but this association {{has not yet been}} sufficiently established, which may limit the intervention in this area. We hypothesized that posture would be a factor that would be associated with the elderly fragile taking it to a higher occurrence of falls in frailty. Approaches focused on improving posture could be important for the reduction of falls in elderly people. Investigations on the occurrence of postural alterations in elderly patients with frailty are not available. OBJECTIVE. This study aimed estimate the postural angular measures among frail, pre-fragile and non-fragile older adults (60 years or more) living in the urban area of Fortaleza, CearÃ. METHODS. Angular postural measures wich alterations are associated with impaired body dynamics and high risk of falls were evaluated. The postural analysis was interpreted by the software of postural evaluation â (software of postural evaluation â SAPO). 158 elderly aging from 62 to 90 years old were evaluated from March 2009 to October 2010 and distributed in three categories: non fragile, pre-fragile, and frail accordingly to classification criteria proposed by Fried et al., 2001. The adjustment for potential confounders relationship between postural measures and presence of frailty was estimated through a multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS. Position of the head protruded (< 36 degrees), knee flexed (< 172 degrees), ankle dorsiflexion (< 77 degrees), legs pies (&# 8805; 185 degrees) were significantly associated with frailty after being adjusted for gender, age and BMI. CONCLUSION. Posture changes are associated with frailty and the identification of indicators associated with postural fragility can lead to interventions that minimize the undesirable outcomes such as falls and reduction of physical activities and operationalize valuable strategies towards preventive clinical practice...|$|E
