5|$|The {{nuclear fission}} {{properties}} of berkelium {{are different from}} those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> <b>reactor.</b> Its critical mass is relatively high at 192kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.|$|E

25|$|A {{specific}} {{risk of the}} sodium-cooled fast reactor is related to using metallic sodium as a coolant. In case of a breach, sodium explosively reacts with water. Fixing breaches may also prove dangerous, as the cheapest noble gas argon {{is also used to}} prevent sodium oxidation. Argon, like helium, can displace oxygen in the air and can pose hypoxia concerns, so workers may be exposed to this additional risk. This is a pertinent problem as demonstrated by the events at the loop type Prototype <b>Fast</b> <b>Breeder</b> <b>Reactor</b> Monju at Tsuruga, Japan.|$|E

500|$|The [...] Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{replaced}} the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947, and on January 1, 1948 it {{announced that the}} Argonne National Laboratory would be [...] "focused chiefly on problems of reactor development." [...] Zinn did not seek the additional responsibility, which he realised would divert the Laboratory away from research, and divert him from other responsibilities, such as designing a <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> <b>reactor.</b> He even obtained a written assurance from Carroll L. Wilson, the AEC's general manager, that it would not. He was therefore willing to collaborate with Alvin Weinberg to allow the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to remain involved in reactor design. Nonetheless, reactor research accounted for almost half the laboratory's budget in 1949, and 84 percent of its research was classified.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg {{was fired}} by the Nixon {{administration}} from ORNL in 1973 after 18 years as the laboratory's director, because he continued to advocate increased nuclear safety and molten salt reactors (MSRs), instead of the Administration's chosen Liquid Metal <b>Fast</b> <b>Breeder</b> <b>Reactor</b> (LMFBR) that the AEC's Director of Reactor Division, Milton Shaw, was appointed to develop. Weinberg's firing effectively halted development of the MSR, as it was virtually unknown by other nuclear laboratories and specialists. There was a brief revival of MSR research at ORNL {{as part of the}} Carter administration's nonproliferation interests, culminating in ORNL-TM-7207, [...] "Conceptual Design Characteristics of a Denatured Molten-Salt Reactor with Once-Through Fueling", by Engel, et al., which is still {{considered by many to be}} the [...] "reference design" [...] for commercial molten salt reactors.|$|E
500|$|The other {{branch of}} reactor {{development}} at the Argonne National Laboratory, and the one closer to Zinn's heart, was the <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> <b>reactor.</b> At {{the time it was}} believed that uranium was a scarce resource, so {{it would be wise to}} make the best use of it. The breeders were designed to create more fissile material than they consumed. By 1948, he had become convinced that it would be unwise to build large experimental reactors near Chicago, and the AEC acquired land around Arco, Idaho, which became an outpost of Argonne. The Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I, but known at Argonne as [...] "ZIP" [...] — Zinn's Infernal Pile) was the first reactor to be cooled by liquid metal, and the first to produce electricity. It proved the breeder concept. AEC Chairman Gordon Dean described it as a major milestone in nuclear history.|$|E
