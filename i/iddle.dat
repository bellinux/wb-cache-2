Joan rode between two lines of horses, burros, oxen, mules, packs and loads and canvas-domed wagons and gaudy vehicles resembling gipsy caravans. The street was as busy as a beehive and as noisy as a bedlam. The sidewalks were rough-hewn planks and they rattled under the tread of booted men. There were tents on the ground and tents on floors and tents on log walls. And farther on began the lines of cabins-stores and shops and saloons--and then a great, square, flat structure with a flaring sign in crude gold letters, [...] "Last Nugget," [...] from which came the creak of <b>iddles</b> and scrape of boots, and hoarse mirth. Joan saw strange, wild-looking creatures--women that made her shrink; and several others of her sex, hurrying along, carrying sacks or buckets, worn and bewildered-looking women, the sight of whom gave her a pang. She saw lounging Indians and groups of lazy, bearded men, just like Kells's band, and gamblers in long, black coats, and frontiersmen in fringed buckskin, and Mexicans with swarthy faces under wide, peaked sombreros; and then in great majority, dominating that stream of life, the lean and stalwart miners, of all ages, in their check shirts and high boots, all packing guns, jostling along, dark-browed, somber, and intent.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{delineate}} {{the changes in}} proton MR spectroscopy and imaging that occur with acute, irreversible ischemia of the basal ganglia of a baboon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The M 1 segments of the middle cerebral arteries of six adult male baboons were occluded by endovascular means with microcatheters and N-buty l cyanoacry late adhesive. Cerebral blood f low measurements were taken with positron emission tomography or radioactive microsphere tech-niques. Serial spatially localized proton MR spectroscopy of the basal ganglia and MR imaging of the brain were performed. The distribution of ischemic and infarcted ti ssue was demonstrated by histopathologic techniques or triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain ing. RESULTS: Radioactive micro-sphere or positron emission tomography measurements demonstrated no signi ficant cerebral blood flow within the basal ganglia after occlusion of the m <b>iddle</b> cerebral artery. Proton MR spectroscopy of the basal ganglia demonstrated increasing cerebral lactate and decreasing N-acetyl aspartate within 30 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Changes in the MR imaging signal intensity of the basal ganglia were observed as earl y as 3. 1 hours on T 2 -weighted, 3. 3 hours on T 1 -weighted, and 6. 1 hours on spin density-weighted images. The distribution of these changes correlated well with the histopathologic features of ischemia and infarction that were seen throughout the basal ganglia. CONCLUSION: Changes in MR imaging signal intensity corresponded to ischemia and infarction in our baboon model of acute irreversible ischemia of the basal ganglia.

An example is provided of a service-learning class where middle school students received comprehensive guidance curriculum instruc-tion and then taught a similar curriculum to elemen-tary school students. Results from a phenomenological evaluation describe yielded five major themes perti-nent to middle school student development and dem-onstrate comprehensive guidance program goal achievement: personal awareness, social skills, learning skills, career interests and character education. The themes were personal awareness, social skills, learning skills, career interests, and character education. M <b>iddle</b> school students struggle with significant issues unique to early adolescence involving physical, psychological, and social changes. They have been characterized by their need to (a) explore a variety of interests; (b) connect learning to practical life and work; (c) release energy through activity coupled with frequent fatigue due to rapid growth; (d) develop personal identity found through peers ’ affirmation; (e) separate self from parents; and (f) rely on friends to provide comfort, understanding, and approval (American School Counselor Association [ASCA], n. d.). With compre-hensive guidance programs striving to reach all stu-dents (ASCA, 2003), middle school counselors find themselves employing various methods to meet the unique developmental needs of these students (ASCA, 2004).

The new M <b>iddle</b> A tmosphere A lomar R adar Sy stem (MAARSY) replaces the existing ALWIN radar {{which has been}} operated continuously on Andøya for more than 10 years. The new system is a monostatic radar operated at 53. 5 MHz with an active phased array antenna consisting of 433 Yagi antennas. The 3 -element Yagi antennas are arranged in an equilateral triangle grid forming a circular aperture of approximately 6300 m 2. Each individual antenna is connected to its own transceiver with independent phase control and a scalable output up to 2 kW. This arrangement allows very high flexibility of beam forming and beam steering with a symmetric radar beam of a minimum half power beam width of 3. 6 °, a maximum directive gain of 33. 5 dB and a total transmitted peak power of approximately 800 kW. The IF signals of each 7 transceivers connected to each 7 antennas arranged in a hexagon are combined to 61 receiving channels. Selected channels or combinations of IF signals are sent to a 16 -channel data acquisition system with 25 m sampling resolution and 16 -bit digitization specified which will be upgraded to 64 channels in the final stage.

40|$|This thesis pursued three objectives: (1) to {{identify}} {{policies and practices}} which {{are related to the}} retention of professionals and managers with critical skills; (2) to document why and how these policies and practices have changed in relation to the business strategy; and (3) to assess whether the organisation's skill supply patterns constitute a strategy, that is, explicit, consistent and coordinated efforts supporting the business strategy. Guided by a contextual theoretical framework and methodology, the researcher undertook a pilot stuay of two Canadian high technology firms, and followed with three case studies of large UK-based high technology organisations with an R&D Division. The findings indicated the importance of hard benefits (compensation) as a necessary condition for recruitment and retention, and the complementary impact of twelve soft benefits (job characteristics and other factors tied to the work, organisational and social environments) with special relevance for retention. Lifetime employment as a policy and as the dominant skills supply pattern proved to be resistant to change. The HRM context (comprising the history of the organisation, managerial and professional cultures, the personnel function, and workforce planning) was found to inhibit skill initiatives, but certain features became less negative over time. In particular, the cumulative effect of recruitment of new skills over several years altered the internal labour market such that many employees supported new ways of doing business. Skills were found to be solidly embedded in the work and social organisation, and high levels of energy were required to modify the organisation-wide skillbase. Both single lever and multiple lever SKISSs were identified. b 1 <b>iddle</b> managers proved to be potential key actors in obtaining skill advantages for the entire R&D Division.

40|$|The early {{detection}} and intervention of hearing impairment as a standard care in infants has become a fundamental topic {{within the field of}} pedi atric audiology over the last decades. In Flanders, a general neonatal h earing screening program was implemented in 1998. Since then, the patien t population for diagnostic and rehabilitative follow-up has significant ly changed, as much younger infants are referred after negative screenin g. Consequently, objective techniques that do not require the active par ticipation of the patient have gained strong clinical importance. Object ive audiometry is currently widely accepted, but still needs improvement s on various essential aspects. Within this context, three specific nece ssities have been the main starting points for this research project. In the first study, we have focused on improving the assessment of the m <b>iddle</b> ear function at young age. This is an essential aspect of pediatri c hearing assessment, since middle ear dysfunction is very common in chi ldren, and can cause mild to moderate hearing impairment. Tympanometry i s an objective technique that can be applied to evaluate the function of the middle ear, but a conscious choice regarding probe-tone frequency i s critical. In this first research, tympanometry was performed in a grou p of young children and adults using two different probe tone frequencie s. The relation between age and probe-tone frequency was evaluated and a classification system for the interpretation of high-frequency tympanom etry was proposed. The results of this study have {{led to the development of}} a protocol that can be easily followed in clinical practice. Current ly, high-frequency tympanometry is fully implemented in the neonatal fol low-up program of the ENT Department of UZ Leuven. The second study aimed to critically assess and extend the current clini cal application of auditory steady-state response (ASSR) testing. ASSRs have been extensively studied over the last decades in the context of fr equency-specific hearing threshold prediction. In this study, the applic ability of ASSRs was evaluated in a large group of young infants at risk for or with hearing impairment. ASSRs were reliably recorded in this pa tient population during natural sleep and the ASSR thresholds provided g ood objective estimations of the behavioral hearing thresholds at differ ent frequencies. Furthermore, ASSR latencies were evaluated in normal-he aring infants and adults to gain a better understanding of the underlyin g mechanisms of ASSR generation and the possible developmental aspects i nvolved. The results pointed to longer response latencies in infants com pared to adults, and to maturational changes throughout early infancy. T his study has provided a first insight into the application of ASSRs in assessing the normal developmental course of neural maturation. The third main study concentrated on the relation between suprathreshold ASSRs and speech understanding skills. In a first step, ASSRs to low mo dulation frequencies were explored in terms of reliability and latency i n a group of young, normal-hearing adults. The results showed large vari ability between individuals. Furthermore, the response latencies gave ev idence of cortical sources underlying ASSR generation at low frequencies. In a second step, low-frequency ASSR measures were linked to the perce ptual outcomes of speech intelligibility for phonemes and sentences in n oise. The results showed objective ASSRs were significantly correlated w ith behavioral speech understanding scores when several low modulation f requencies, inherent to the temporal envelope of speech, were integrated in the ASSR measure. These results may provide promising prospects for the application of ASSRs in objective speech audiometry. status: publishe...|$|E
