I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for <b>even</b> <b>my</b> enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|E

25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that <b>even</b> <b>my</b> vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E

[...] With characteristic grace, the composer wrote to Kipling, [...] "Your splendid words went with a swing and enthusiasm which <b>even</b> <b>my</b> music cannot stifle". Kipling, on the other hand, described the music as [...] "a tune guaranteed to pull teeth out of barrel-organs".|$|E

500|$|Nirvana biographer Everett True {{wrote an}} uncharacteristically {{unfavorable}} review in Melody Maker, accusing the single {{of being a}} cash-in on Neverminds success. [...] "Whoop whoop bloody whoop", he wrote, [...] "Forgive me if I don't sound too thrilled. This release is stretching <b>even</b> <b>my</b> credulity beyond repair. Like, milking a still-breathing (sacred) cow, or what? Badly inferior live versions of 'Polly' and 'Sliver' on the flip don't help matters either." [...] In 2011 Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song number 415 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, Aditya Music {{released}} Eega on Blu-ray [...] with English subtitles and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround sound. The release {{also contained}} a two-hour DVD about {{the making of}} the film. J. Hurtado of Twitch Film reviewed the Blu-ray version, writing, [...] "The most egregious mangling of the film {{comes in the form of}} a severely fucked contrast scale, which leads to absurdly crushed black levels rendering nearly all shadow detail completely obliterated". Hurtado called the audio a [...] "thing of beauty, giving good separation and a booming low end that puts you in the middle of the Eega action in a way that <b>even</b> <b>my</b> theatrical experience couldn't do".|$|E
500|$|On November 29, 2002, Harisu filed a {{petition}} with the Incheon District Court {{to have her}} sex corrected on her family register, and that her birth name be changed from Lee Kyung-yeop to the more feminine Lee Kyung-eun. The subsequent court ruling went in her favour, and on December 13, 2002, she became only the second person in the Republic of Korea to legally change their sex. Speaking of the difficulties she had previously encountered, Harisu has said: [...] "My most embarrassing moments were when I have had to show my personal identification card in public... I couldn't get a passport, visa or <b>even</b> <b>my</b> own bank accounts because I was legally a man".|$|E

500|$|He showed Groening and Jean his Adult Swim {{shorts and}} Groening responded by giving him free hands {{to do the}} 35-second-long segment. [...] Groening told him to break all The Simpsons rules, but Kricfalusi {{explains}} that he [...] "tried not to break any rules in the characters’ personalities, just in {{the execution of the}} visuals. I didn’t follow any models—not <b>even</b> <b>my</b> own". The more rules he broke, the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result. Contrary to Banksy, who lives a life in secrecy, Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the dubbing of the final soundtrack. While Kricfalusi animated the 2D parts, he had John Kedzie to help him with the computer graphics and Sarah Harkey and Tommy Tanner to do the assistant animation.|$|E
500|$|Cardinale {{published}} an autobiography, with Anne Mori, Io Claudia, Tu Claudia in 1995. She {{has been a}} regular attendee of the Academy Awards. Her awards have included an honorary Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Film Festival, and an honorary Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival. The Los Angeles Times Magazine, in a February 2011 online feature, named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history. Cardinale said of her acting, [...] "I never felt scandal and confession were necessary to be an actress. I've never revealed my self or <b>even</b> <b>my</b> body in films. Mystery is very important." [...] In a 2014 interview, she revealed her secret of success: [...] "If you want to practise this craft, {{you have to have}} inner strength. Otherwise, you’ll lose your idea of who you are. Every film I make entails becoming a different woman. And in front of a camera, no less! But when I’m finished, I’m me again." ...|$|E
500|$|Sternberg, still {{prospecting}} for Cope that spring, was woken by a liveryman who relayed {{word from}} Annie that Cope had died three days earlier. Sternberg {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "I had lost friends before, and I had known {{what it was to}} bury my own dead, <b>even</b> <b>my</b> firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply than I did over the news." [...] Cope's Quaker funeral consisted of six men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope's friend Persifor Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood, and Harrison Allen. The six sat around Cope's coffin among the fossils and Cope's pets, a tortoise and a Gila monster, for what Osborn called [...] "a perfect Quaker silence... an interminable length of time." [...] Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had brought along a Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, [...] "These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} the {{interlude}} is spare and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting, [...] "cake cake cake cake cake cake." [...] Aside from the repetitive chant of [...] "cake", the interlude consists of multiple sexual metaphors. The lyric [...] "I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticing/ Nothing else like this, I'ma make you my bitch/ And it's not <b>even</b> <b>my</b> birthday/ But you wanna put your name on it" [...] is a metaphor referring to a vagina. Rihanna sings about the desire to have spontaneous sex. Rihanna promises her lover that she will make him do whatever she pleases, singing [...] "I'mma make you my bitch." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy of The Montreal Gazette described the lyric as a [...] "promise", with Rihanna intending to act upon her desires. The interlude ends mid-verse and mid-lyric with a fade at 1:18. Katherine St. Asaph of Popdust described the fade as [...] "ungraceful", as well as writing that it makes the track appear as {{though it is not}} finished. Upon the fade, Rihanna puts forward the line [...] "Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now." [...] Dunlevy and St. Asaph were critical of the final line, with the former labelling it as [...] "blatant", and the latter noting that [...] "cursing makes everything obvious." ...|$|E

500|$|While Gambier hesitated, {{one by one}} the French {{ships which}} had {{grounded}} began to refloat, although several grounded again. As they had removed their topmasts before the attack, they had survived the groundings with less damage than might otherwise have been the case, and were easier to [...] kedge off. [...] Foudroyant and Cassard, fearing an attack by the British fleet, retreated up the Charente at 12:45 and both then grounded at Fouras. At 13:00, Cochrane, his impatience and fury rising, deliberately allowed Imperieuse to drift stern-first alone down the channel towards the French fleet, flying the signal [...] "The enemy's ships are getting under sail", followed by [...] "the enemy is superior to the chasing ship", and then at 13:45 [...] "the ship is in distress, and requires to be assisted immediately". He later wrote [...] "It was better to risk the frigate, or <b>even</b> <b>my</b> commission, than suffer a disgraceful termination to the expectations of the Admiralty". At 14:00 the frigate was within range of Calcutta and began a steady fire into the beached storeship, supported by Aetna and several of the sloops, which he ordered into position by the unexpected process of firing cannon in their direction until they had moved to the position he intended. Cochrane had forced Gambier's hand: despite his desire to avoid combat, the admiral could not allow one of his frigates to fight the entire French fleet single-handed, and reluctantly he instructed the large frigate HMS Indefatigable, the smaller Emerald, Unicorn, Aigle and Pallas and the ships of the line Valiant and Revenge, the latter now commanded by Captain Alexander Robert Kerr, to join with the inshore squadron, enter the Aix Roads and support Cochrane.|$|E

[...] Trump clarified, [...] "Yes, <b>even</b> <b>my</b> own feelings as to where the world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day. Then you have a September 11th, and you don't feel so good about yourself and you don't feel so good about the world and you don't feel so good about New York City. Then you have a year later, and the city is as hot as a pistol. Even months after that it was a different feeling. So yeah, <b>even</b> <b>my</b> own feelings affect my value to myself." ...|$|E
