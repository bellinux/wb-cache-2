Adaptation of agriculture to climate change could cover a wide range of measures, from changes in the farming management practices (e.g. choice of crop varieties, use of pesticides, change in crop calendar, rainwater harvesting) to large investment schemes in developing and/or improving the agriculture infrastructure (e.g. <b>irrigation</b> <b>equipments).</b>|$|R

40|$|A field {{evaluation}} of the technical performance of centre pivot sprinkler irrigation system was carried out during the maize crop growing season and when operating with different working speeds: S 1 - 40 %, S 2 - 60 % and S 3 - 80 %. For this goal, four uniformity measurements are {{to be considered in}} the evaluation; coefficient of uniformity (CU), distribution uniformity (DU), potential efficiency of low quarter application (PELQ) and actual efficiency of low quarter application (AELQ). The first step of {{evaluation of}} the sprinkler irrigation system is to compare the measured uniformity values with the standard values, DU ≥ 75 %, CU ≥ 85 %, AELQ and PELQ ≥ 90 %. Effect of variation of speed produced CU values of 80. 3, 82. 7 and 86 % for S 1, S 2, and S 3 speed, respectively. Furthermore, DU standard value was obtained at S 3 speed of 82 %. Moreover, AELQ and PELQ were below the acceptable standard level of 90 % for all speeds.

Of great interest to sinologist historians, Wang also outlined the difference between the agricultural technology of Northern China and that of Southern China. The main characteristic of agricultural technology of the north was technical applications fit for predominantly dryland cultivation, while intensified irrigation cultivation was more suitable for southern China. Furthermore, Wang used his treatise as a means to spread knowledge in support of certain agricultural practices or technologies found exclusively in either South or North that could benefit the other, if only they were more widely known, such as the southern hand-harrow used for weeding in the south, yet virtually unknown in the north.|$|E

Modern advances {{in the development of}} WSN offer new trends like Precision Agriculture (PA). This paper presents Fuzzy Logic Based Intelligent Irrigation Control System by employing WSN for PA. In the proposed system the irrigation controller normalizes the desired moisture level in the agricultural soil by controlling the water flow of the irrigation pump based on the sensor readings, by switching the pump between ON and OFF states. For the efficient utilization of water in the agricultural irrigation, the proposed methodology offers a system equipped with soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, precise <b>irrigation</b> <b>equipments,</b> computer-controlled devices, and an intelligent controller using fuzzy logic approach for irrigation of agricultural fields, which simulates or emulates the human being’s intelligence. This leads to effective utilization of various resources like water and electricity and hence becomes a cost effective system for the expected yield. The fuzzy controller designed in this paper efficiently monitors moisture level in soil, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, and other essential parameters and also controls the irrigation intelligently. The results show that the application is correct and reasonable and enables user to precisely acquire the crop water requirement information. The system can be effectively applied to PA applications such as water-saving agriculture areas, for example, the croplands, the nursery gardens and the greenhouses...|$|R

Data {{used for the}} study were obtained using structured questionnaires administered to 100 randomly selected irrigated tomato farmers from Kontagora and Wushishi Local Government Areas of the state. Descriptive statistics, gross margin, production function analysis and resource-use efficiencies were used for {{analysis of the data}} obtained. The result showed that irrigated tomato production is profitable in the area with net farm income of N 85306. 92 per hectare. Estimated multiple regression analysis revealed that semi-log regression chosen as the lead equation. The R 2 value was 0. 757. Farm size (X 1), quantity of seed (X 4) and agrochemical (X 5) are the significant factors influencing output level of irrigated tomato at 1 % level of probability. Labour is also a significant factor at 5 % level of probability. Estimated efficiency-ratio (r) showed that the resources were not efficiently utilized. Estimated elasticity of factor inputs and return to scale showed that there is increasing return to scale. It was therefore recommended that loans and credit facilities should be provided for irrigated tomato farmers in the area.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was carried out to {{determinate}} the Possibility of utilization of Karkheh River water for drip irrigation. Regarding climatic conditions of Iran, it is necessary to apply high efficiency irrigation methods particularly for crops with high water requirement. Clogging of droppers is the most important and serious issue that threatens a trickle irrigation system. In the present article, in order to study the potential of Karkheh River as a water source, the water quality of the river was examined in 5 stations along the river in a 30 -year period. To prognosticate the potentiality of carbonate calcium sedimentation and the corrosion in the <b>irrigation</b> <b>equipments,</b> Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) and Ryzner Stability Index (RSL) were used, respectively. The results showed that, based on Wilcox diagram, the water of this river enjoys appropriate quality for agricultural purposes in most cases (with the exception of droughts). The results also showed that the LSI w as positive in all stations and it is possible that droppers clog due to carbonate calcium deposition. While, RSL was in most cases below 6. 8 and there is little possibility of metal parts corrosion in trickle irrigation system. It can be recommended that, regarding limited water sources, downstream lands of this river can be irrigated through trickle irrigation systems with droppers that are less sensitive to clogging in order to prevent from chemically clogging of droppers. Finally, acid washing by collecting watering pipes and droppers in one place and injection of acid after is recommendable...|$|R
