Abbey National Whilst on the surface the Supreme Court has dealt with a small point of construction, its unanimous decision in Office of Fair Trading v. Abbey National Plc 1 to overturn the decision of the Court of Appeal 2 has significantly limited the scope of protection provided for consumers. Macdonald’s statement that the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations “are possibly the single most significant piece of legislation in the field of contract law” 3 may need to be revised. 1. Drafting The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 are the United Kingdom’s second attempt to implement the EC Council’s Unfair Terms Directive, 4 a minimum <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measure</b> designed to ensure that contracts concluded with consumers do not contain unfair terms. 5 In implementing it, the Regulations broadly “copy out” its provisions. 6 The Regulations subject terms contained within contracts concluded between a seller or a supplier and a consumer 7 which have not been individually negotiated 8 to a test of fairness. 9 Terms held to be unfair do not bind the consumer, 10 although the contract continues to bind the parties if it is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair term. 11 The test of fairness does not apply to all terms. Art 4 (2) of the directive states: “Assessment of the unfair nature of the terms shall relate neither to the definition of the main subject matter of the contract nor to the adequacy of the price and remuneration, on the one hand, as against the services or goods supplies[12] in exchange, on the other, in so far as these terms are in plain intelligible language”. 1.

This situation can be illustrated by the Commission seizing upon mutual recognition as a strategy for market integration {{in the wake of the}} Cassis de Dijon judgment. An open market may impact the weaker economies that could suffer in the increased competitiveness of more open markets. As Dehousse argues, “market integration has to be accompanied by improvements in social and economic cohesion, if it was to be politically acceptable. ” Similarly, Armstrong notes that the removal of barriers to trade through mutual recognition can create positive trade possibilities for states with efficient production, while less efficiently producing states face the prospect of domestic production being displaced by competition, which may need to be cushioned through negotiations of Structural Funds...|$|R

40|$|The EU {{has most}} {{frequently}} resorted to harmonisation {{as a model}} to achieve its in-ternal market. This contribution examines the dynamics of legal differentiation in EU’s internal market law laid down in Article 114 TFEU and secondary laws. It con-cludes {{that there has been}} a modest number of invocations of the derogation possibili-ties under Article 114 (4) and (5) TFEU and the safeguard clauses. The low number may be due to the fact that may both the Commission and the Courts have a very rig-id reading of the procedure whilst the grounds for invocation are very limited. This low number nevertheless does not automatically imply that Member States agree with the level of protection laid down in the EU’s <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measures</b> or that the opt out mechanisms are not relevant. Derogation mechanisms may play an important role in the negotiations of the level of protection in the draft legislative acts. This study moreover reveals that the derogation mechanisms may be important devices of regulatory adjustment and learning in the fields of public health and environmental protection in the EU. They ultimately may rather strengthen the uniformity of regula-tory requirements in the EU internal market instead of leading to regulatory diversity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{shed some light}} on the nature, scope and impact of {{harmonisation}} of national criminal law by the European Union. It will, more specifically, attempt to understand what is the main rationale behind the adoption of European criminal measures which harmonise national criminal offences and evaluate their impact on national legal orders. It will be argued that a main paradox emerges from this body of law, namely that notwithstanding the fact that the Treaty of the European Union envisaged harmonisation of national criminal law as being minimal, its scope and influence have been very broad, potentially bringing about a harsher criminal law across the EU. This broad scope was facilitated by a discourse of fight against organised crime which became the main rationale for the adoption of <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measures.</b> The EU’s viewpoint on organised crime has been far-reaching. This is seen mainly in three elements: in the adoption of a very broad understanding of what a criminal organisation is; in the criminalisation {{of a wide range of}} offences under the “umbrella’ of the fight against organised crime; and, finally, in the potential application of the measures adopted under this rationale to common criminality and to the indirect achievement of other goals. Ultimately, this broad approach led to an increase in criminalisation at national level, namely through the creation of new offences and through the expansion of the scope of existent ones...|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the effectiveness of}} measures of European Community law to harmonise intellectual property protection throughout the Community, focusing on two consequences of these measures: first, the adverse impact on the commercial value of the intellectual property {{in the hands of the}} proprietor or licensee and, secondly, the implications for the due diligence enquiry of the scope of protection conferred by intellectual property rights undertaken whenever an interest in intellectual property is acquired. The position of the national law of Member States following accession to the Community is examined, in particular its limits to confer monopoly or quasi monopoly protection on the intellectual property proprietor. The effect of international cooperation (such as the Berne Convention) in shaping national law is considered by way of essential background to determine the extent to which obstacles to the implementation of Community principles result. Particular attention is given to the inter-relation between the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and national law, insofar as the free movement principles of Articles 30 to 36 and the competition law prohibition of Article 85 (1) conflict with the scope of intellectual property rights conferred nationally. The role of Commission Regulations conferring exemption from Article 85 (1) for intellectual property agreements is illustrated by reference to Commission Regulations EC 240 / 96 (concerning technology transfer agreements) and EC 418 / 85 (concerning research and development agreements). Finally an assessment is made of the effectiveness of selected Council Directives (91 / 250 EEC and 93 / 98 EC concerning computer software and duration of copyright) as <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measures,</b> taking into account existing sources of law and the needs of emerging technologies...|$|R
40|$|As {{financial}} disclosure {{in the highly}} globalised financial markets serves to equalise market opportunities, poor and inaccurate disclosure leads to inequality among investors, governments, and institutions. There has been a steady but rather slow process of harmonisation of national sanctions for companies breaching their disclosure obligations. Without compromising the potential efficiency of these <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measures,</b> included in the Prospectus, Transparency and Market Abuse Directives, this paper aims to create and propose an alternative method {{to increase the efficiency}} of sanctions in corporate law. By focusing on the importance of time, as an element that influences - at least in theory - corporate decisions in relation to the eventual breach of disclosure obligations, this paper seeks to re-conceptualise the importance of sanctions in this area and to link their severity to the element of time that is potentially instrumentalised by listed companies. In this study, we argue that linking sanctions and time should prompt the legal framework to accentuate the severity of sanctions imposed in certain circumstances, while also adopting a differentiated approach to the types of sanctions imposed for the breach of specific disclosure obligations. This novel approach proposes to accentuate the targeting function of sanctions by associating them with the violation of different types of disclosure obligations and to create indirectly a de facto harmonisation trend amongst regulators and judges at the national level. This will become feasible through the creation of specific "aggravating circumstances" in the area of disclosure obligations, which will allow more severe sanctions to be imposed and national frameworks to converge gradually.   If listed companies are sanctioned in a more targeted way when they violate disclosure obligations, the inequality between their strategies and the need for reliable information will gradually decrease. This novel approach proposes to accentuate the targeting function of sanctions and therefore tackle inequality in capital markets expressed by informational asymmetry and lack of sophistication...|$|R

This emphasis on activities has been criticised as it ignores the large quantity of time parents spend supervising their children.

There has been debate {{about the extent to}} which these approaches each measure the same aspect of childcare. In addition, it is thought they may be sensitive to the way surveys have been designed, which can affect the extent to which they can be compared crossnationally.

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the effective and cost-efficient design {{of renewable energy}} sources (RES) support policies in the European Union along some major discussion lines of the European RES policy debate: {{the effectiveness of the}} different national support policies in the member states the cost savings potential of different cost reduction policies for reaching the 2020 RES target the role of market risk exposure and market integration for RES deployment and the cost-efficiency of RES support the role and design of cross-country cooperation mechanisms for efficient RES target achievement. The analysis showed that the effectiveness and efficiency of RES support policies is still low in many European member states but that top runner countries have gained significant experience in tailored RES policy design. The key recommendations for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of RES support policies across Europe are: Reducing policy and market risks, particularly those that have no or little potential to trigger cost-optimised behaviour of RES generators Ensuring long-term commitment and increasing the stability of the regulatory framework for RES Against the background of the risk-averse financial environment and the new budgetary constraints of the recent financial crisis, it has become even more important for governments to take measures to reduce RES financing risks. Without such risk reduction, it seems unlikely that sufficient investments will be attracted to reach the EU 2020 targets. Furthermore, stable and risk sensitive policies could reduce the policy costs for achieving the target by up to 4 billion Euro per year. In addition to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their national support instruments, policymakers should consider the increased use of cooperation mechanisms that could potentially further decrease the cost of European RES target achievement by 2 - 3 billion Euro per year, at least if the respective cooperation mechanisms do not introduce additional risks and uncertainties. From the analysis in this thesis, it appears that bottom-up cooperation between member states and alignment of regulatory frameworks according to best-practice criteria is a more promising approach than drastic <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measures</b> that will unsettle the market and require another learning period to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. We have seen that RES policy design has gone through a phase of intense policy learning in the last decade.

The question remains how the countries whose RES markets are lagging behind can be motivated to learn from this process and to improve their support policies and regulatory frameworks despite the existing economic constraints...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of this thesis is that deterrent regulation {{could have had}} prevented or, arguably, at least minimised the myriad forms of fraudulent misrepresentation {{at the core of}} the economic crisis. Therefore, white-collar crime had, and has, a central position in causing the economic crisis and deterrent regulation will be essential in reducing the risk of a crisis of this scale infecting in our legal systems again.   The background has been evaluated through the definition and origin of white-collar crime and Anglo-Irish bank has been used as a demonstrative example to illustrate this hypothesis.               The EU’s competence in creating criminal law is examined, through primary law, with the aim of elucidating the boundaries that are provided in the Lisbon Treaty. Before this, however, an evaluation of the definition of criminal law is necessary to establish the relationship between criminal law and administrative sanctions. The relevant bases in the context of the EU’s competence are: article 83 TFEU, and article 325 TFEU and the EU’s outspoken goals for the Union in the Stockholm programme. Article 83 TFEU is examined as it gives the EU an explicit legal basis for the adoption of criminal directives, thereby ensuring the effective implementation of EU policies that have been subjected to <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measures.</b> Further, article 325 TFEU stipulates the EU’s priority in fighting “fraud and any other illegal activities”. Through The Proposed Directive on the fight against fraud to the Union’s financial interests the article is given a supranational character in creating criminal law on the area of law.               The Proposed Directive on the fight against fraud to the Union’s financial interest and The Proposed directive on bank recovery and resolution have been found, through their scope and legal bases, to cover what could be argued to be different essential tools in the fight against white-collar crime. The first proposed directive presents a wide range of offences and holds both natural and legal persons liable by “deterrent” legislation i. e. minimum prison sentences. The second proposed directive is presented as a tool for the prevention of the occurrence of another economic crisis utilising the means of administrative sanctions in article 114 TFEU. However, whilst not classified as a “deterrent” (in accordance with the interpretation of deterrent found in article 325 TFEU), administrative sanctions has been given the competence to have a “punitive character” and therefore a controlling function without the competence of criminal law. However, in order to prevent and deter crimes of the magnitude of those that occurred at Anglo-Irish bank, it is argued that its legislation must be made sufficiently “deterrent” by incorporating a fear of being caught, given lengthy sentences and public shaming by thorough criminal investigations, proceedings, trials, convictions and/or a criminal records. ...|$|R
40|$|The EU and the Member States are {{party to}} the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The EU has been a long-standing proponent of the {{conceptual}} underpinnings of the 1982 Convention as a package deal that balances conflicting interests in an equitable manner. Among {{the provisions of the}} package which are particularly germane to achieving this objective are those that are in Part XIII which facilitate and encourage the conduct of marine scientific research (MSR). These provisions are increasingly important in attaining the overall objectives of the EU s Integrated Maritime Policy and its environmental pillar, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which among other matters aims to promote new approaches to marine resource management including the ecosystem approach. RonÃ¡n Long With a view to investigating the legal constraints and opportunities at an EU level for improving the implementation of this new normative concept in marine environmental management, this paper traces the progressive development of EU policy in relation to MSR and undertakes a brief review of current Member State practice in relation to implementation of Part XIII of the 1982 Convention. This is followed by a short account of EU regulatory instruments, which are relevant to improving access to data, samples and the results of scientific research on marine ecosystems. The paper concludes by suggesting a number of steps that could be taken by the EU to streamline the current consent regime that applies to foreign vessel MSR with a view to facilitating the practical implementation of ecosystem approach at a pan-European level. A brief analysis of a number of policy and legal options is undertaken with a view to improving the collection and provision of scientific information and data across the maritime boundaries of the Member States. The paper suggests that the proposed course of action will facilitate a gradual transition from the current fragmented approach to the authorisation of ship-based MSR towards a fully integrated governance system in line with the requirements of a range of EU and international legal instruments. The proposed <b>harmonisation</b> <b>measures</b> sit comfortably with the 1982 Convention which places express obligations on States and competent international organisations to create favourable conditions for the conduct of MSR and requires them to adopt reasonable procedures that promote and facilitate MSR. The author contends that the proposed governance structure and harmonisation instrument will support the sustainable and integrated management of marine ecosystems. The identification of such structures and the streamlining of administrative procedures is one of the core objectives of the EU funded ODEMM project which is examining various options for ecosystem-based management in the European marine environment.

The main {{aim of this}} paper is investigate to what extent international policy measures on foreign trade, international recycling and harmonisation of legislation can contribute in effectively reducing environmental pressure caused in the truck tyre life cycle. A two-region simulation model, representing Western and Eastern Europe, is developed that integrates the complete life cycle, incorporates environmental impacts in its economic analysis, is technically dynamic by accounting for learning-by-doing effects, and allows for variations in trade of new and old truck tyres. In this study the economic, environmental and social effectiveness of <b>harmonisation</b> and trade <b>measures</b> in the European life cycle for truck tyre is tested. Several conclusions can be drawn from the model simulations. First, the environmental effects caused by the trade of used tyres from Western to Eastern Europe are of limited impact on the overall environmental damage caused by truck tyres. The consumption stage is by far the main contributor to environmental damage. Within the marginal analysis of trade, harmonisation of disposal fees illustrated to generate very limited positive results. The private and external costs in the soli...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990, organic farming has {{experienced}} a rapid growth in Europe due to increased consumer awareness towards organic products and various policy support measures. In particular, organic farming schemes based on the agri-environmental regulation (2078 / 92) and the rural development regulation (1257 / 1999) offer financial compensation for a lower income and support for marketing and processing activities (Lampkin et al., 1999). Organic farming policies {{as part of the}} general CAP are increasingly affected by the liberalisation of agricultural markets. Trade liberalisation takes place at three different areas: first, free-trade zones are established or extended (such as the EC); second, bilateral agreements facilitate trade between countries; and third, at global level, a further reduction of trade barriers are achieved through the WO talks. As a result of the liberalisation policies, competition on the supply side increases, producer prices drop down and state impact on markets are reduced. Regarding organic farming policies, liberalisation will lead to a greater <b>harmonisation</b> of support <b>measures</b> as well as production and processing standards. In the light of the ongoing WTO talks, it is expected that agri-environmental programmes will become stronger related to desired positive effects and less trade-distortive. Due to the increased economic pressure in the organic farming sector, it will be crucial for many farmers to maximise their income through environmental services, marketing activities and improved quality. ...|$|R

This methodology is applied in measure of de facto harmony for major areas of accounting diversity. The results allow us to identify areas of 'high', 'medium' and 'low' harmony. The highest levels of harmony are observed in the translation of foreign financial statements and in the recognition of acquired intangible assets. But more importantly, our measurement method is a useful diagnostic tool for it identifies low levels of harmony, which ought to be the focus of attention by those responsible for effecting accounting harmonisation. We observed the lowest levels of harmony in the recognition of temporary differences in deferred taxes and measurement of inventories. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologi...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the international, regional and domestic legal instruments for conserving and managing Pacific sea turtles through habitat protection and the regulation of bycatch and harvest. States are obliged to protect threatened wildlife such as turtles under a number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). An integrated and harmonised legal framework for protecting sea turtles is needed to provide states with the minimum legal standards for conservation and management. In the South Pacific, there is also no formalised regional arrangement that focuses on Pacific sea turtles. Regional cooperation is a priority for conserving Pacific turtles and there is the prospect {{for the development of a}} regional sea turtle agreement. In 2003, the Bellagio Blueprint for Action on Sea Turtles (hereafter, Bellagio Blueprint) was developed by 25 leading experts from leading institutions in the Pacific as a guideline on measures required for the conservation of Pacific sea turtles. The priority areas listed under the Bellagio Blueprint (bycatch minimisation, harvest limits, habitat protection and regional cooperation) provide distinct criteria for examining existing legal measures. A comparison of the different compliance regimes in the two case studies (Australia [Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Queensland) ] and Fiji), provide additional perspectives on developing and developed states in the regional governance framework. There are a number of principles and specific obligations under various MEAs which can address priority areas in the Bellagio Blueprint. These international obligations may be implemented at regional or national levels in the context of turtles through their regulatory frameworks. This study reveals several gaps within the regulatory framework at all three levels that provide justification for a formalised South Pacific regional cooperation arrangement. The evaluation of the regional and national regulatory frameworks also revealed gaps similar to those found in the international framework. Areas for improvement include traditional turtle fisheries management and bycatch in coastal fisheries. Australia showed greater compliance with general obligations or principles in international law in the context of turtles compared with Fiji, but both states could improve their levels of compliance. A regional arrangement is needed for states to protect Pacific sea turtles in compliance with all applicable principles and specific obligations under international law. This is because regional cooperation can address identified gaps. A regional arrangement can also improve integration and <b>harmonisation</b> of <b>measures</b> among states. Formalised regional arrangements need to be supported within the regional governance framework due to existing policies for cooperation that integrate regional priorities, such as sustainable development. Turtles need to be conserved in the South Pacific to maintain ecological and traditional sustainability...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{international}} and European legal instruments which provide a legal {{basis for the}} establishments of marine protected areas (MPAs) {{for the purpose of}} improving fishery management in the marine environment. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of MPAs remains open to debate and considerable attention is now focussed at international and European levels on how to improve the enforcement of regulations in MPAs. In this context, there is little doubt but that monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) are indispensable tools for improving law enforcement and compliance in such areas. Indeed, recent experience in the European Union suggests that the effectiveness of MCS ought to be a primary consideration when designated areas to be protected in the marine environment. Accordingly, the aim {{of this article is to}} focus on some of the difficulties that must be overcome in order to improve the effectiveness of MCS in MPAs. Particular emphasis is placed on the problems that stem from the absence of common definitions regarding the characteristics of the area to be protected, the absence of harmonisation of MCS in such areas, as well as the problems that stem from practical considerations such as the size, shape and location of MPAs. The article also reviews basic fishery enforcement measures which can improve the effectiveness of MPAs including: hydrofencing, special fishing permits, one gear rule, as well as specific monitoring systems and security enforcement zones. Although the total <b>harmonisation</b> of regulatory <b>measures</b> is desirable from a law enforcement perspective, the article nonetheless concludes that it is also possible to have specific MCS solutions tailored to meet the characteristics of the area that needs to be protected...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{its work}} on regionalism, the OECD Trade and Agriculture Directorate has {{completed}} {{a series of studies}} that compare rule-making provisions in regional trade agreements with those in the World Trade Organisation (e. g., in the area of services, investment and competition). This paper aims to complement existing studies, by examining legal provisions regarding "technical barriers to trade" (i. e., technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures) in selected bilateral and regional trade agreements, and their degree of similarity and convergence with the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, and with each other. The study reveals that most provisions regarding technical barriers to trade (TBT) included in bilateral and regional trade agreements converge towards the multilateral trading system. When implemented effectively, agreements seeking deeper economic integration and regulatory cooperation, in particular, can complement and strengthen the implementation the WTO Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade by setting the pace for improved regulatory practices and TBT-related infrastructure in member countries (e. g., through regional consultation fora and joint standardisation and accreditation bodies). Some caveats however remain. When overlapping agreements promote different criteria for the <b>harmonisation</b> of standard-related <b>measures</b> and when bilateral or regional initiatives are conducted in isolation from international efforts and divert attention from multilateral trade and standards-related negotiations, new obstacles may arise both for regulators and businesses. Such constraints are further magnified for low income countries afflicted by administrative and technical capacity-related problems. To remedy these potential problems, the study proposes a number of policy recommendations. standards, technical barriers to trade, technical regulations, bilateral free trade agreements, multilateral trading system, mutual recognition agreement, certification, regulatory measures, testing, metrology, WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, equivalence, non-tariff barriers, regionalism, regional trade agreements, TBT, conformity assessment procedures, harmonisation, custom unions...|$|R
40|$|In <b>measuring</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> prior {{research}} has focused almost exclusively on the country of domicile of the firm in quantifying differences in financial reporting practices. However, this approach offers little by way of explanation {{of the impact of}} the harmonisation process, particularly as different financial reporting treatments may be attributable to the specific characteristics of the firms that are selected for analysis. The main aim of the present study is to address this issue and to measure de facto accounting harmonisation by taking into account firms' operating circumstances. Specifically, it seeks to assess the combined effects of each firm's country of domicile and sector of operations on its choice of accounting methods, together with the firm's size and international exposure, and any changes in these factors through time. In addition, it assesses the impact of sector diversifications on accounting policy choice. This research sets out the results of a statistical analysis of financial reporting harmonisation, obtained by employing a logistic regression to predict the odds of using alternative accounting methods. The policies studied concern inventory, depreciation and goodwill. The empirical results suggest that country of domicile and sector of operations are each significant determinants of the choice of accounting method across the European Union. However, country differences still appear to be greater than sector differences, even allowing for differences between countries in industrial structure, which is inconsistent with harmonized accounting. In addition, international listing and firm size appear to be significant variables. Indeed, there has been little significant change in policy choices through time amongst European firms. This leads to the conclusion that, rather than a process of convergence, a combination of structural factors at the finn level that demand different accounting treatments and barriers to han-nonisation at the country level that restrict choice are the likely causes of persistent international differences in accounting. Prior research that attempts to measure harnionisation on the basis of convergence towards uniformity without allowing for the use of different accounting methods in different circumstances is entirely misinformed. Indeed, comparability between financial statements requires that the reported results reflect the different circumstances in which firms operate, and the harmonisation metric must take this into account...|$|R
