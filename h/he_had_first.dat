5|$|From 1991–1996 he was artistic {{director}} and principal {{conductor of the}} National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, a group <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> directed in 1985. He subsequently served as its artistic advisor during the 1996–1997 and 1997–1998 seasons, including {{a tour of the}} USA with the performance and recording of Beethoven's 1st and 5th piano concertos with Grigory Sokolov as soloist. He has made occasional return visits to the orchestra since relinquishing his formal position with them.|$|E

5|$|Johnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, {{traveling}} {{mostly on}} foot. After {{a brief period}} in Knoxville, he moved to Mooresville, Alabama. He then worked as a tailor in Columbia, Tennessee, but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather, who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west. Johnson and his party traveled through the Blue Ridge Mountains to Greeneville, Tennessee. Andrew Johnson {{fell in love with}} the town at first sight, and when he became prosperous purchased the land where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> camped and planted a tree in commemoration.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a letter}} written to General Cheatham from Judge Mangum post war, Cleburne's remains were first laid to rest at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee. At the urging of Army Chaplain Biship Quintard, Judge Mangum, staff officer to Cleburne and his law partner in Helena, Cleburne's remains were moved to St. John's Episcopal Church near Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, where they {{remained}} for six years. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> observed St. John's during the Army of Tennessee's march into Tennessee during the campaign {{that led to the}} Battle of Franklin and commented that it was the place he would like to be buried because of its great beauty and resemblance to his Irish homeland. In 1870, he was disinterred and returned to his adopted hometown of Helena, Arkansas, with much fanfare, and buried in the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery, overlooking the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of}} the book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E

60|$|But <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>first</b> loved us, my friends. The {{dark and}} cruel notions about God--which are too common, {{and have been}} too common in all ages--are not what the world about us teaches, nor what Scripture teaches us either.|$|R
5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through {{the inclusion of}} a German villain, Dr. Müller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Ray {{directed}} Kanchenjungha. Based on {{his first}} original screenplay, {{it was his first}} film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present {{at the same time in}} Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.|$|E
5|$|In the 1926 {{season as}} a whole, Larwood took 137 wickets at 18.31; with the bat he scored 451 runs at 12.88. No Tests were played in 1927; Larwood's {{performances}} for Nottinghamshire, however, lifted him {{to the top of}} the national bowling averages—100 wickets at 16.95—and he was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His efforts could not quite secure the County Championship title for Nottinghamshire; they finished second after losing their final match to Glamorgan. The 1927 season saw the first appearance in the Nottinghamshire side of Bill Voce, a 17-year-old ex-miner who, after beginning as a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, later became Larwood's principal fast bowling partner for county and country. At the season's end, Larwood was married, in a quiet and private ceremony, to Lois Bird, a miner's daughter whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> met in 1925.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, he {{obtained}} {{a position at}} DC Thomson, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his <b>first</b> real exposure to commercial illustration. Through his colleagues, {{many of whom had}} attended art school, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his <b>first</b> introduction to contemporary European art and literature; Cézanne and Monet were particularly important to him.|$|R
50|$|As of November 2007, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his <b>first</b> child, Xander.|$|R

5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs {{was living}} with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, {{at the time of}} the riot. He had spent time in a {{residential}} school in Reading, and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew. He was named shortly after the riot by two of those arrested, and was arrested himself five days later on suspicion of murder. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and a container of rocks, though he told them <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> arrived at the estate after midnight, two hours after Blakelock was killed. In the end he was charged with affray, and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison (the longest sentence handed out for affray during the riot, according to Rose), reduced on appeal to six years. Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good {{physical and mental}} condition {{for most of the}} last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of judicial activism, a position <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> his <b>first</b> {{major role}} in Millions in the Air (1935).|$|R

5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> met in 1919, in {{the power}} struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 1958 he was {{appointed}} {{a member of the}} de Havilland board, but the company was sold and merged into Hawker Siddeley in 1960. With the Siddeley company, he was instrumental in the development in the Hawker Siddeley Trident in 1962. Cunningham worked under the managing director Arnold Alexander Hall, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> met in 1940 to iron out the malfunctions in the Beaufighter gun sight. Later Cunningham acted as a consultant and advisor to the Chinese Government from 1972–79 as the company sought to increase its revenue by selling aircraft to China. At their insistence, he postponed his retirement for three years to complete a series of aircraft sales. On 1 May 1975 the British Government announced the nationalisation of the industry and British Aerospace consumed all the nation's manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 2008, Behan was {{questioned}} by the Carabinieri (Italian military police) {{in connection with the}} murder of a 72-year-old woman, Silvana Abate Francescatti, at her home on Monte Amiata, Arcidosso, in Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy. The woman was found on 11 July with 13 stab wounds, including a fatal throat wound, but was believed to have died the previous day. Behan, who had been resident in Arcidosso for part of the year since 2006, was arrested after seeking treatment twice at a hospital near Arcidosso for a cut on his thigh. In an interview with The Irish Times, he claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>first</b> gone to the hospital on 10 July after cutting himself in the thigh while unpacking furniture and other objects delivered from the USA. However, hospital staff had mistakenly decided he had been acting suspiciously due to his poor spoken Italian, {{and the fact that he}} had expressed annoyance at how the hospital was managed and its bad signage.|$|E
50|$|The same year, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his <b>first</b> {{exhibition}} in the United States.|$|R
