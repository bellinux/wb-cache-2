Short-term peak number concentrations exceeded 100, 000 cm- 3 on a number of occasions. The source strength was conservatively estimated at about 6 X 1012 ultrafine particles produced per drying episode. These values are underestimates, since the part of the peak below 9. 8 nm was not measured. Averaged over 150 hours of operation, the number concentration showed a major peak at the smallest size measured (9. 8 nm) and a secondary peak at 30 nm. Loss rates of the ultrafines due to diffusion, deposition, and particle growth (1 - 2 h- 1) were high compared to losses due to air exchange (0. 1 - 0. 6 h- 1).

40|$|This program {{covered the}} {{development}} of two separate products; an electric heat pump clothes dryer and a modulating <b>gas</b> <b>dryer.</b> These development efforts were independent of one another and are presented in this report in two separate volumes. Volume 1 details the Heat Pump Dryer Development while Volume 2 details the Modulating <b>Gas</b> <b>Dryer</b> Development. In both product development efforts, the intent was to develop high efficiency, high performance designs that would be attractive to US consumers. Working with Whirlpool Corporation as our commercial partner, TIAX applied this approach of satisfying consumer needs throughout the Product Development Process for both dryer designs. Heat pump clothes dryers have been in existence for years, especially in Europe, but {{have not been able}} to penetrate the market. This has been especially true in the US market where no volume production heat pump dryers are available. The issue has typically been around two key areas: cost and performance. Cost is a given in that a heat pump clothes dryer has numerous additional components associated with it. While heat pump dryers have been able to achieve significant energy savings compared to standard electric resistance dryers (over 50 % in some cases), designs to date have been hampered by excessively long dry times, a major market driver in the US. The development work done on the heat pump dryer over the course of this program led to a demonstration dryer that delivered the following performance characteristics: (1) 40 - 50 % energy savings on large loads with 35 F lower fabric temperatures and similar dry times; (2) 10 - 30 F reduction in fabric temperature for delicate loads with up to 50 % energy savings and 30 - 40 % time savings; (3) Improved fabric temperature uniformity; and (4) Robust performance across a range of vent restrictions. For the <b>gas</b> <b>dryer</b> development, the concept developed was one of modulating the gas flow to the dryer throughout the dry cycle. Through heat modulation in a <b>gas</b> <b>dryer,</b> significant time and energy savings, combined with dramatically reduced fabric temperatures, was achieved in a cost-effective manner. The key design factor lay in developing a system that matches the heat input to the dryer with the fabrics ability to absorb it. The development work done on the modulating <b>gas</b> <b>dryer</b> over the course of this program led to a demonstration dryer that delivered the following performance characteristics: (1) Up to 25 % reduction in energy consumption for small and medium loads; (2) Up to 35 % time savings for large loads with 10 - 15 % energy reduction and no adverse effect on cloth temperatures; (3) Reduced fabric temperatures, dry times and 18 % energy reduction for delicate loads; and, (4) Robust performance across a range of vent restrictions...|$|E
40|$|Drying is a {{critical}} activity in rice postharvest handling. Any delay in drying will result in quality and quantity losses. Farmers and traders prefer to sell wet grain rather than dried grain of unhulled rice due to less attractive incentive {{for them to do}} drying. The study was conducted in Subang District, West Java, during March-June 2011 using survey method to analyze the financial feasibility of rice dryers. The respondents interviewed were 15 rice millers who have either sun-drying floor or mechanical dryer, or both. The main collected data were the investment cost, operational cost, maintenance cost, and the revenue of the dryers. The data were analyzed by using shortterm and long-term financial analyses to assess the profitability and feasibility of some drying technologies. The results showed that there were at least three drying technologies in the study area, namely sun-drying floor, flatbed dryer using gas fuel (<b>gas</b> <b>dryer),</b> and flatbed dryer using rice husk fuel (husk dryer). Under the mean capacity, the short-run MBCR of technological change from sun dryer to <b>gas</b> <b>dryer</b> was 1. 29, while from sun dryer to husk dryer was 1. 45. The long-run analysis showed that the IRRs were 44. 44 % for sun dryer, 233. 47 % for <b>gas</b> <b>dryer,</b> and 260. 49 % for husk dryer. These results showed that among the three drying technologies, husk dryer is the most profitable, most feasible, and most prospective to be adopted. Therefore, this type of dryer should be intensively promoted to the farmers’ group associations, rice traders, and rice millers. The government support in terms of rice dryers for farmers’ group associations should be focused on husk dryer. </p...|$|E

Rapid preconcentration and recovery have been achieved with films made of mesoporous silica nanoparticles assembled on a quartz plate. The resulting nanoparticle films displayed high transmittance and allowed the detection of toluene up to 1 ppm within {{a minute and a}} regeneration of the sensor in less than 30 s. The sensor response increased while increasing the concentration of benzene (detection at 252 nm), toluene (detection at 267 nm) or p-xylene (detection at 274 nm) in the polluted air from 1 to 100 ppm. The order of sensitivity, i. e. p-xylene > toluene > benzene, was correlated with their respective molar extinction coefficients.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and evaluates different energy efficient options for integrating drying and pelletising of biofuel with a modern energy efficient pulp mill process. When drying biofuel, {{a large amount}} of the heat input can often be recovered. One option for heat recovery is to cover low-temperature heat demand in the pulping process. Alternatively available excess heat from the pulp mill can be used for drying. Both alternatives will contribute to a better energy efficiency for the combined pulp mill and biofuel upgrading facility. Pinch analysis tools can be used to estimate the excess heat potential at different temperature levels in the pulp mill. Three different technologies for pulp mill integrated biofuel drying were chosen for the study, namely steam drying, flue gas drying and vacuum drying. The different technologies are evaluated on the basis of energy usage, global CO 2 emissions and resulting pellets production cost, using stand-alone pellets production as a reference. The pulp mill assumed for the calculations is the Eco-Cyclic reference pulp mill. The results of the study indicate that the most attractive integrated drying technology option is the flue <b>gas</b> <b>dryer,</b> using flue gases from the black liquor boiler.

Experimental emission rates were 0. 87 pounds per hour for particulates and 16. 02 pounds per hour for gaseous hydrocarbons...|$|R
30|$|The {{initial and}} final temperatures, the flow {{rates and the}} heat loads of the streams were {{exported}} from Aspen Plus. The overall mass heat capacity was calculated using the heat load and the temperature before being inserted into AEA version 7.2. The global minimum temperature difference (ΔT) in the heat exchangers was set to 10 °C, but lower and higher temperature variations were applied to specific streams. No changes, such as varying the pressures in the distillation or evaporation stages, or modifying the drying <b>gas</b> in the <b>dryer,</b> {{were made to the}} original processes. These investigations can be performed by extracting the selected stages from the analysis, the remaining energy flows will then be known as the background process.|$|R
