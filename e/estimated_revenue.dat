500|$|By {{the end of}} 2003, {{sales of}} Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time had reached 2 million copies, and Ubisoft {{highlighted}} the game's success in Europe in a quarterly business report.

During its North American debut, the game suffered from poor sales: by December, the PS2 version had sold 218,000 copies, the Xbox version 128,000 copies, and the GameCube version 85,000 copies. Its combined sales since release at that time totaled 272,000 (PS2), 172,000 (Xbox), and 100,000 copies (GameCube). It was speculated that its sales were negatively affected by the concurrent release of Beyond Good & Evil, alongside other prominent releases at the time. In response to this, Ubisoft offered copies of their other games free with purchases of The Sands of Time, providing a boost to sales. By July 2006, the game's PlayStation 2 version alone had sold 700,000 copies in North America, bringing an <b>estimated</b> <b>revenue</b> of $24 million. During its week of release in Japan, the game reached seventh place in the charts, selling 14,000 copies. This was noted as being high for a western game released in Japan.

2500|$|Britain {{entered the}} Crimean War in February 1854, and Gladstone {{introduced}} his second budget on 6 March. Gladstone had to increase expenditure {{on the military}} and a vote of credit of £1,250,000 was taken to send a force of 25,000 to the East. The deficit for the year would be £2,840,000 (<b>estimated</b> <b>revenue</b> £56,680,000; estimated expenditure £59,420,000). Gladstone refused to borrow the money needed to rectify this deficit and instead increased income tax by half, from sevenpence to tenpence-halfpenny in the pound (From ≈2.92% to ≈4.38%). He proclaimed that [...] "the expenses of a war are the moral check which it has pleased the Almighty to impose on the ambition and the lust of conquest that are inherent in so many nations". By May £6,870,000 was needed to finance the war and introducing another budget on 8 May, Gladstone raised income tax from tenpence halfpenny to fourteen pence in the pound to raise £3,250,000. Spirits, malt, and sugar were taxed to raise {{the rest of the}} money needed.|$|E
2500|$|Cost. [...] Robert Stack {{provided}} the Treasury position that [...] "Treasury and the IRS have designed our regulations {{in a way}} that minimizes administrative burdens and related costs." [...] Estimates of the additional revenue raised seemed to be heavily outweighed by the cost of implementing the legislation. In March 2012 the Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists (ACFCS) said FATCA was expected to raise revenues of approximately US$800 million per year for the US Treasury with the costs of implementation more difficult to estimate. ACFCS claimed it was extremely likely that the cost of implementing FATCA, [...] borne by the FFIs, would far outweigh the revenues raised by the U.S. Treasury, even excluding the additional costs to the US Internal Revenue Service for the staffing and resources needed to process the data produced. Contrary to established congressional practice, FATCA was not subject to a cost/benefit analysis by the Committee on Ways and Means. Perhaps not considered by Congress, the cost to the global financial institutions to implement FATCA has been reported to range from Forbes's estimate of US$8 billion a year (approximately ten times the amount of <b>estimated</b> <b>revenue</b> raised), to US$200 billion (based on per capita costs for Australia and the UK), to 1-2 trillion USD (chapter of the Chamber of Commerce).|$|E
2500|$|NPD Group {{reported}} that Rock Band 4 was the tenth best selling game for October 2015 based on units, while accounting for price, {{was the fourth}} best selling game. Analyst Michael Pachter <b>estimated</b> <b>revenue</b> from Rock Band 4 sales were about $100 million in early 2016. Mad Catz, prior to release, had anticipated high sales of Rock Band 4 in part to avoid defaulting to their current debtor; however, sales were lower than expected based on their 2016 Fiscal Year results. Though Rock Band 4 contributed significantly towards sales of controller hardware for Mad Catz, the company found the game's [...] "sell-through was lower than originally forecast resulting in higher inventory balances as well as lower margins due to increased promotional activity with retailers". Alongside reporting of these results, several senior executive members resigned from the company, and the company laid off 37% of its staff {{as part of a}} restructuring plan. In their financial earnings report given mid-2016, Mad Catz reported a total loss of more than $11 million, much of it attributed to unsold Rock Band 4 inventory. Harmonix subsequently announced in March 2016 that Mad Catz would be replaced by PDP as the game's publishing and hardware partner. In Mad Catz's 2016 annual financial report, the company said that its partnership with Harmonix for Rock Band 4 had been a [...] "burden" [...] on the company, as though they ultimately sold all stock of their instruments, the revenues were not as great as anticipated.|$|E
