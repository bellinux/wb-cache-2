It has innumerable social, cultural, demographic, political and economic dimensions, knowing no boundaries, the virus cuts across all population groups. The virus is preferentially bent towards those who are primarily in their economically productive years, i. e. 15 years to 49 years. This makes it even more vital to understand its impact on populations who are directly and indirectly shaping the economy. Being in the most productive age group, they are important contributors to the family, society and the economy.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Not only in South-Africa, but worldwide, HIVIAIDS is a {{morbidity}} {{that increases}} {{on a daily}} basis. Currently, {{it can be seen}} as the hugest health dilemma in <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aids <b>pandemic</b> on community structures are distressful. It is estimated that just as many people will die of Aids as from any other cause. A positive HIV test result has an enormous impact on <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person. A person's whole life changes the very moment he is informed that he is HIV positive. The person who is diagnosed with HIV as well as the people around him need to make life-changing decisions. These decisions should be made to deal with demands of HIV in an effective manner. According to people with HIVIAIDS from different communities, negative responses from fellow community members have a far more negative impact on them than having to deal with the positive HIV-status itself. It therefore is essential that a supporting environment be established in which in people living with HIVIAIDS can be accepted. To be able to understand and manage the situation better it is necessary to establish which processes made it possible for people to disclose their positive HIVIAIDS-status and what <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> a person was after disclosure. The study established which processes were present to enable him to disclose and what support systems are necessary for people to disclose a positive HIVIAIDSstatus. A case study was used.

40|$|This {{study has}} as its {{starting}} point the central contention that <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AIDS <b>pandemic</b> in sub-Saharan Africa affect {{a wide range of}} societal structures including all levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education system. This multilevel qualitative case study of Botswana’s education system sets out to complement national quantitative HIV/AIDS impact studies. Using the draw-and-write technique and unstructured and semi-structured interviews, the study examines <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> HIV/AIDS on <b>the</b> pupil, classroom, school and contextual levels, as experienced by primary age pupils, teachers, head teachers, regional educational officers and officers at the ministerial level, in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> data reveals that HIV/AIDS does not only have an impact on orphans and vulnerable children, but affects <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> children’s psychosocial well-being, perception of self, hopes, beliefs and aspirations for the future, as well as, teaching, learning and <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> learning. Moreover, <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> influenced many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors that have been shown to correlate positively with pupils’ achievements in School Effectiveness (SER) research. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study thus challenge SER’s goal of universality and its narrow focus on academic outcomes. Consequently, the researcher argues that HIV/AIDS needs to be regarded as a contextual variable that not only influences processes and pupils’ outcomes at all levels in the education system, but also as variable that must necessitate a shift in the goals, content and role of education, in order for schools to be regarded as ‘effective’ within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> AIDS. <b>The</b> study identifies a number of academic and affective educational outputs, outcomes and processes that should be integrated into the primary school phase in order for pupils and schools to not only mitigate <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> but in order that they can become active change agents in reversing the current AIDS trend. The researcher proposes that through a synthesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> School Effectiveness and the Educational Indicator Research Paradigms, effective process variables can be identified, measured and monitored against relevant outputs and outcomes to support <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> turning <b>the</b> HIV/AIDS trend around.

40|$|We thank McCaw et al. {{for their}} comments. Cross-immunity between new {{pandemic}} strains and preexisting influenza viruses is an intriguing possibility {{that has been}} explored in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> explaining inter-subtype competition in pandemics (1). Indeed, preliminary published data suggest limited cross-reactive immunity to the novel H 1 N 1 virus in the elderly (2). In terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative merits <b>of</b> referring to <b>the</b> basic versus the effective reproduction number (R 0 versus R), we used R 0 because we were describing <b>the</b> spread <b>of</b> a novel influenza virus in a large population {{that had not been}} previously exposed to this virus strain. R 0 is a population-specific composite variable (not a fundamental biological parameter) and is only well-defined in a large population; there are examples of higher attack rates in past pandemics in close-contact closed communities, but these were not representative of spread in large populations. Variation in attack rates by age may indeed suggest age-dependent susceptibility, but this was not caused by previous exposure to this novel virus and could equally be due to innate immunity or other biological mechanisms. We therefore felt that it was appropriate to describe spread using the term R 0. However, we agree that <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> exposure to previous subtypes conferring partial immunity to the new H 1 N 1 virus may—together with antigenic evolution—have <b>implications</b> for transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> virus over <b>the</b> coming months...|$|R
40|$|HIV/AIDS is a slow-moving, devastating {{shock that}} kills the most {{productive}} members of society, increases household dependency ratios, reduces household productivity and caring capacity, and impairs <b>the</b> intergenerational transfer <b>of</b> knowledge. It is socially invisible, complicated by silence, denial, stigma, and discrimination. While it affects both rich and poor, it is the poor who are most severely impacted. Though it affects both sexes, it is not gender neutral. Though AIDS {{is far more than}} just another health problem, many development organizations have yet to undertake thorough analyses of its impact on what they do and how they do it. Even fewer have actually changed their policies and procedures to adjust to the new realities. In <b>the</b> era <b>of</b> AIDS, food and nutrition security is becoming even more of a priority for many households and communities. We know that food and nutrition are fundamentally intertwined with HIV transmission and <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> AIDS. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ways in which food insecurity and malnutrition may increase susceptibility to HIV as well as vulnerability to AIDS impacts, and how HIV/AIDS in turn exacerbates these conditions is increasingly well documented. Food and nutrition security is fundamentally relevant to all four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional pillars <b>of</b> HIV/AIDS response [...] prevention, care, treatment, and mitigation [...] and food aid can be an important addition to the arsenal.

40|$|We analyze <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HIV/AIDS <b>pandemic</b> in Tanzania {{for labor}} markets and human capital accumulation. Three {{analyses}} are undertaken. First, {{we examine the}} 2000 / 01 Labor Force Survey and compare it with the 1990 / 91 Labor Force Survey. Since these two surveys encompass a period where accumulated AIDS deaths increased dramatically, their comparison provides {{an opportunity to make}} inferences about <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> HIV/AIDS over that period. Second, we study rates of human capital accumulation, proxied by educational attainment, for the period 1991 to 2000. While the most obvious impact of HIV/AIDS on human capital comes about through <b>the</b> deaths <b>of</b> skilled people, this might not be the greatest concern in terms of long run economic impact. In poor countries with low levels <b>of</b> human capital, <b>implications</b> for rates <b>of</b> human capital accumulation might be of greater concern. We estimate education transition matrices to assess human capital accumulation over the 1990 s and assess the trends in transition probabilities and regional variations in these trends. Finally, we analyze <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> skills upgrading using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Tanzania. We find that <b>the</b> age structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labor force is changing with 10 - 14 year olds and juveniles comprising a significantly larger share and prime age adults aged 20 - 35 a smaller share compared with 1990 / 91. The growth in the child and juvenile labor force is matched by a trend towards an increased tendency to exit primary school and an overall lower share of children aged 5 - 14 enrolled in primary school. We conclude that workforce experience and rates of human capital accumulation are declining with HIV/AIDS being a prime factor underlying these trends. The CGE analysis indicates that skills upgrading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population has particularly large first order (segmented rural and urban labor markets) impacts on the agricultural sector since <b>the</b> large majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population is rural. If migration is permitted, <b>the</b> enhanced productivity <b>of</b> a more skilled rural labor force permits substantial growth in agricultural and non-agricultural output generating a development pattern similar to those advocated by Mellor (1976) and Adelman et al. (1989). Reduced rates of skills upgrading would slow these trends. " [...] Authors' Abstract. Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; Health, Diet and NutritionTM...|$|R

As South Africa is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{countries}} {{with the highest}} HIVJAids prevalence in the world, many South Africans are affected by <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structures being endangered by <b>the</b> HIVJAids <b>pandemic</b> is <b>the</b> education system. Educators are especially affected by <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> due to <b>the</b> fact that they {{not only have to}} cope with infected colleagues who are often absent, but are also burdened with numerous orphans and vulnerable children at their schools because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Sometimes these affected educators even have to care for their own loved ones who suffer from or die <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> is personal stress, such as depression and suicidal ideation, plus professional impairment such as through increased workload and staff negativity. Affected educators are vulnerable, struggle to cope and are desperately in need of support, due to the pressure they experience regarding <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Current literature reports little support for educators affected by HIVJAids with regard to the personal and professional impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> This study focuses on determining <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> REds (Resilient Educators), a support programme compiled to empower educators who are affected by HIVJAids, <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> which was also piloted by this study. A qualitative research design which included experimental and action research which focused on the latter (action research) was used. A purposive convenience sample consisting of eight volunteers from local primary schools participated. The researcher made use of a mixed-methods design for the pre and post-tests which included both qualitative and quantitative measuring instruments. REds was implemented over a period of nine consecutive weeks in a group setting and was continuously evaluated by the participants who proposed changes in order to improve the programme. In spite of being realistic about the obstacles they will face with regard to <b>the</b> HIVIAids <b>pandemic,</b> participants reported to be relieved, empowered and motivated to fight <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> <b>The</b> quantitative results show some improvement in participants' experience of secondary trauma resulting from <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest that REds was efficacious, but that educators need continued support.

The social, cultural, economic, and political impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> are also increasing. The community, national, and international approach to control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> must continue to evolve, taking into account <b>the</b> specific conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern world, <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> global interdependence <b>of</b> health has become the major new factor. On 5 June 1981, a report from the Centers for Disease Control signaled the discovery ofAIDS [1]. A decade later, it is now possible to present a clearer picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pandemi...|$|R
30|$|Pandemic {{influenza}} has posed {{an increasing}} threat {{to public health}} worldwide in the last decade. In the 20 th century, three human pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968, causing significant mortality. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence and development of pandemic viruses, including direct introduction into humans from an avian origin and reassortment between avian and previously circulating human viruses, either directly in humans or via an intermediate mammalian host. However, <b>the</b> evolutionary history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> viruses has been controversial, largely due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> background genetic information and rigorous phylogenetic analyses. <b>The</b> <b>pandemic</b> that emerged in early April 2009 in North America provides {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate its emergence and development both in human and animal aspects. Recent genetic analyses of data accumulated through long-term influenza surveillance provided insights into <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> this novel pandemic virus. In this review, we summarise the recent literature that describes <b>the</b> evolutionary pathway <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> viruses. We also discuss <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> these findings on the early detection and control of future pandemics.|$|R
