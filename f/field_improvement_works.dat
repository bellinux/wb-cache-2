40|$|Global {{competition}} has caused {{fundamental changes in}} the competitive environment of manufacturing industries. Firms must develop strategic objectives which, upon achievement, result in a competitive advantage in the market place. However, for almost all manufacturing industries, an increased productivity and better overall efficiency of the production line {{are the most important}} goals. Innovation is a necessary process for the continuous changes in order to contribute to the economic growth in the manufacturing industry, especially to compete in the global market. In addition to innovation as a mode for continued growth and change, there are many other vehicles for growth in the manufacturing industry. One in particular that has been gaining momentum is the idea of World Class Manufacturing (WCM) developed by Richard J. Schonberger (in the 80 s).

As {{part of a broader}} study surveying managers' (n = 2313) view of <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> in Swedish health care, this study focused on those 845 managers who regarded their <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> as bringing about benefits.

More than 50 % of the respondents perceive a complexity in the practices and techniques associated with <b>improvement</b> <b>work.</b> Furthermore, approximately 50 % of the managers recognize a conflict in the meeting between the <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> and the organization. This indicates that adaptation is a primary concern in this work.

40|$|Increasing {{recognition}} of the role and value of theory in <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> in healthcare offers the prospect of capitalising upon, and consolidating, actionable lessons from synthesis of improvement projects and initiatives. We propose that informed use of theory can (i) provide a mechanism by which to collect and organise data from a body of <b>improvement</b> <b>work,</b> (ii) offer a framework for analysis and identification of lessons learnt and (iii) facilitate {{an evaluation of the}} feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of improvement programmes. Improvement practitioners can benefit from using an underpinning external structure as a lens by which to examine the specific achievements of their own projects alongside comparable initiatives led by others. We demonstrate the utility of a method known as 'best fit framework synthesis' (BFFS) in offering a ubiquitous and versatile means by which to collect, analyse and evaluate <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> in healthcare. First reported in 2011, BFFS represents a pragmatic, flexible approach to integrating theory with findings from practice. A deductive phase, where a review team seeks to accommodate a substantial part of the data, is followed by an inductive phase, in which the team explores data not accommodated by the framework. We explore the potential for BFFS within <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> by drawing upon the evidence synthesis methodology literature and practical examples of <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> reported in BMJ Quality and Safety (2011 - 2015). We suggest four variants of BFFS that may have particular value in synthesising a body of <b>improvement</b> <b>work.</b> We conclude that BFFS, alongside other approaches that seek to optimise the contribution of theory to <b>improvement</b> <b>work,</b> represents one important enabling mechanism by which to establish the rigour and scientific credentials of the emerging discipline of 'improvement science'...|$|R

40|$|Lean Production {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{generally}} accepted concepts for increasing operational effectiveness. However, its implementation is still challenging for many companies as it implies not only changes of technical systems and management systems but also changes in attitudes and culture. Generalizable implementation steps have still not yet emerged and there are many ways to implement Lean Production. A Lean Production implementation is a never ending process since it is always possible to become leaner. Thus, the implementation of Lean Production is a long-term commitment for a company in order to reach success. There is a need for research on how to develop and integrate <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> in order to establish a successful implementation of Lean Production. Accordingly, the overall purpose of the research presented in this thesis is to contribute to an increased understanding of how to successfully implement Lean Production. Moreover, the objective is to develop a supportive framework for a successful Lean Production implementation and to describe this in a general process for the implementation of <b>improvement</b> <b>work.</b> Through literature reviews and three research studies, a supportive framework for the successful implementation of <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> has been developed. The first study is an explanatory literature and interview study to build a concept model of <b>improvement</b> <b>work.</b> The second study is an exploratory embedded single case study that was conducted to validate the model. Finally, the third study is an exploratory multiple holistic case study that investigated enablers for continuous improvement after a radical implementation of Lean Production. The resulting supportive framework consists of important actions to consider during the different stages of a process for the implementation of <b>improvement</b> <b>work.</b> In the first stage after a radical implementation phase, actions important to sustain change and enable continuous improvement include for example a focus on good leadership on shop floor and efforts in the area of control and follow-up of results in production teams. To develop continuous improvement several actions are defined, like the importance of understanding the context of <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> including important relations to operations and to develop the production strategy with objectives to align the <b>improvement</b> <b>work.</b> To reach long term success it is important to integrate continuous improvement into operations and important actions for this stage are for example to update the Operational Management System on the company-specific-production-system framework’s processes continuously, which includes visualisation of the overall <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> process. ...|$|R
