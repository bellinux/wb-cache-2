The capital block of Trajan's Column, with a weight of 53.3t, was even lifted to c. 34m above the ground. As such enormous loads far exceeded the lifting capability of any single treadwheel crane, it is assumed that Roman engineers set up a four-masted lifting tower in the midst of which the stone blocks were vertically raised by the means of capstans placed on the ground around it.|$|E

5000|$|The building's facade {{is covered}} in {{intricately}} decorated brick work, which features circular patterns reminiscent of the sun - a common image in Zoroastrian art from the region at that time which {{is reminiscent of the}} Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, who is typically represented by fire and light. The building's shape is cuboid, and reminiscent of the Ka'aba in Makkah, while the <b>heavy</b> <b>corner</b> buttresses are derived from Sogdian architectural styles. The syncretic style of the shrine is reflective of the 9th and 10th centuries - a time when the region still had large populations of Zoroastrians who had begun to convert to Islam around that time.|$|E

Its {{vertical}} framework comes from its <b>heavy</b> <b>corner</b> towers features and turrets that {{are one of}} three shapes: coned, hexagonal, and pyramid shaped. Randomly placed on the building are carving of animals, gargoyles, and other objects, fenestration, and intricate foliation. As fitting for a house to receive members of society in the Victorian Era, the interior features elaborately carved fireplaces, stained-glass windows, high ceilings in parlors and dining rooms, with carved arched fretwork leading the way into these rooms from the reception hall with its large staircase. The interior woodwork is cherry, bird's eye maple, and golden oak. Known for its parquet flooring, the designs mimic quilt patterns and feature the woodwork in the room.|$|E
5000|$|Comparisons {{with the}} firm’s first major success in tall buildings, the Wainwright are {{instructive}} {{insofar as the}} refinements of the Guaranty are more evident. [...] "Although this building Guaranty is considered by critics to be the [...] "twin" [...] of the Wainwright Building, the elegance of the underlying steel-frame construction behind the red terra-cotta tiles is more apparent here than in the Wainwright." [...] Unlike its predecessor, the entirety of street facades on the Guaranty are shrouded with the same material- red terracotta. Gone are the <b>heavy</b> <b>corner</b> piers of the Wainwright and in their place a constant rhythm of equal bays echoing the steel frame underneath. The two do share many traits: Simplicity of form, richness of detail. Red color not chaste white of renaissance typical buildings characterizes both buildings. The site for the Guaranty building is smaller than the Wainwright, yet called for an equivalent number of offices, resulting in an additional three stories. (Twombly 1986) Both the Guaranty and the Wainwright occupy corner lots."The Wainwright may indeed represent the single episode of most aesthetic consequence in the shift from the tall office building in masonry to its skeletal predecessor; yet {{not only does the}} masonry tradition persist in the Wainwright, ornament also assumes a traditional, even if exceptionally conspicuous, role in its design." [...] It is an explainable transition piece. The Guaranty Building is a radical departure however from the masonry prototype. Ornament and [...] "cladding" [...] cover the surface of the Guaranty’s steel frame, a thin covering over a flexible skeleton. (de Wit 1986) ...|$|E

Cars must also have two hydraulic brake circuits, full five-point racing harnesses, and must meet geometric templates for driver location in the cockpit for all drivers competing.

2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under <b>heavier</b> <b>cornering</b> loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under <b>heavier</b> <b>cornering.</b> [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a broader}} {{investigation}} into distress in the asphalt surface layer at a major Australian airport, significant testing was performed on cores taken from both trafficked and un-trafficked zones within two different asphalt mixes. Samples were compared for aggregate orientation, relative density, resilient modulus, wheel tracking, interface shear resistance and cyclic shear creep. There was {{a significant difference between the}} results from the trafficked and un-trafficked samples. It appeared that the changes to the asphalt caused by ‘straight-through’ aircraft trafficking increased the asphalt surface’s resistance to the severe shear forces induced by <b>heavy</b> braking and <b>cornering</b> of aircraft. It is suggested that where operationally practical, the surface should be exposed to frequent and heavy straight-through traffic for as long as possible prior to allowing harsh braking and turning operations.

40|$|We {{study the}} Dine-Fischler-Srednicki (DFS) {{model in the}} light of the recent Higgs LHC results and electroweak {{precision}} data. The DFS model is a natural extension of the two-Higgs doublet model endowed with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry and leading to a physically acceptable axion. For generic couplings, the model reproduces the minimal Standard Model showing only tiny deviations (extreme decoupling scenario) whereas all additional degrees of freedom (with the exception of the axion) are very <b>heavy.</b> Recently, new <b>corners</b> of this model have been highlighted where it may exhibit enlarged global symmetries making the corresponding models technically natural (naturalness scenario). In some cases an additional Higgs could be present at the weak scale. In this case, the new light 0 ^+ state would be accompanied by relatively light charged and neutral pseudoscalar Higgses. We will use the oblique corrections, particularly Δρ, to constrain the mass spectrum in this case. As a final result, we also work out the non-linear parametrization of the DFS model in the generic case where all scalars except the lightest Higgs and the axion have masses at or beyond the TeV scale.
