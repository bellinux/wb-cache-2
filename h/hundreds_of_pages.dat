5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling the Franklin Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E

Lateral load involves sideways force - the wind load on the entire area of an outside wall for example. Because papercrete walls are usually a minimum of twelve inches thick, and usually pinned with rebar, they may be strong laterally.|$|R

25|$|Of the 476 non-Christian manuscripts {{dated to}} the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are {{in the form of}} scrolls; however, eight Christian manuscripts are codices. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The {{adaptation}} of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians. The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the Pauline epistles), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages.</b>|$|E

Unsolicited e-mails were sent by Nick Williams, the acting inspector at the Metropolitan Police's Diamond Support Group, to Labour MPs. The Met declined repeated requests by the IPCC to disclose <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of internal papers that gave the Met's private assessment of the operation, including discussions about how much compensation the Met thought it should pay to the Menezes family; the risk that individual officers might face murder or manslaughter charges; the vulnerability of Blair and the Met to an action for civil damages; and whether Special Branch officers altered surveillance logs.|$|E
25|$|TRW {{suggested}} building three bases with thirty missiles each, {{and estimated}} {{that one of}} the three bases would survive an all-out counterforce attack. To ensure that 600 warheads would survive, each missile would have to carry about 20 warheads. These studies led to the Missile, Experimental, or MX, project, which started in 1971. The design rapidly firmed up, emerging with ten-warheads on more missiles in order to raise the survivors to 1,000 warheads. But the basing became not so much a specific concept as a catch-all program for every possible concept, from railway deployments, to underground racetracks, to mobile systems. A review of the options written in the mid-1970s ran into <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} an evident inherent inconsistency or arbitrariness in the axiomatic {{method in}} mathematics. Axioms, being obviously or inevitably true statements (without {{any need for}} a proof), may be a necessity {{in order for a}} mathematical reasoning to proceed; axioms are the premises based on which the mathematical reasoning proceeds, e. g., the axioms in Euclid’s THE ELEMENTS. That is, without axioms, or, premises, the reasoning cannot be carried out- there is nothing to reason with. However, we should be mindful of the use of axioms while carrying out our mathematical reasoning, as axioms may be arbitrary. What is an axiom or obviously true statement to one may not be so to another. For example, “ 1 + 1 = 2 ” is obviously true to all and can be regarded as an axiom (without any need of a proof). And yet in their monumental treatise PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead took a couple <b>of</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> dense mathematical reasoning to prove this simple, obvious fact...|$|R

On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. The ceremony was performed by her uncle, Father Vincent Liberto.

25|$|The initial {{chip design}} process begins with {{system-level}} design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft {{a proposal for}} a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers will meet at this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. This step is where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the functional requirements, verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as encodes in the MP3 format or implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of textual documentation.|$|E

50|$|Tarbell's biggest {{obstacle}}, however, {{was neither}} her gender nor Rockefeller's opposition.
