60|$|This {{erection}} was the wagon-house of {{the chief}} man of business hereabout, Mr. George Melbury, the timber, bark, and copse-ware merchant for whom Marty's father did work of this sort by the piece. It formed {{one of the many}} rambling out-houses which surrounded his dwelling, an equally <b>irregular</b> <b>block</b> of building, whose immense chimneys could just be discerned even now. The four huge wagons under the shed were built on those ancient lines whose proportions have been ousted by modern patterns, their shapes bulging and curving at the base and ends like Trafalgar line-of-battle ships, with which venerable hulks, indeed, these vehicles evidenced a constructed spirit curiously in harmony. One was laden with sheep-cribs, another with hurdles, another with ash poles, and the fourth, at the foot of which she had placed her thatching-spars was half full of similar bundles.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop the}} theory of <b>irregular</b> {{conformal}} <b>blocks</b> of the Virasoro algebra. In previous studies, expansions of <b>irregular</b> conformal <b>blocks</b> at regular singular points were obtained as degeneration limits of regular conformal blocks; however, such expansions at irregular singular points were not clearly understood. This is because precise definitions of irregular vertex operators had not been provided previously. In this paper, we present precise definitions of irregular vertex operators of two types and we prove {{that one of our}} vertex operators exists uniquely. Then, we define <b>irregular</b> conformal <b>blocks</b> with at most two irregular singular points as expectation values of given irregular vertex operators. Our definitions provide an understanding of expansions of <b>irregular</b> conformal <b>blocks</b> and enable us to obtain expansions at irregular singular points. As an application, we propose conjectural formulas of series expansions of the tau functions of the fifth and fourth Painlevé equations, using expansions of <b>irregular</b> conformal <b>blocks</b> at an <b>irregular</b> singular point. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

50|$|Of the Suebic occupation, {{there is}} a paleo-Christian {{basilica}} (5th-6th century), which was a reused and transformed domus. The robust, rustic 1500 m walls imply an urgency in its construction. It was built using large, carved, <b>irregular</b> <b>blocks,</b> with most coming from other constructions. The height of the walls vary from 5 m to 6.5 m, suggesting the significance of its military feasibility.|$|R
6000|$|It {{might have}} been the Ten-legged White Spirit-Bear himself, or it {{might have been}} anything, for Kotuko and the girl were so starved that their eyes were untrustworthy. They had trapped nothing, and seen no trace of game since they had left the village; their food would not hold out for another week, and there was a gale coming. A Polar storm can blow for ten days without a break, and all that while it is certain death to be abroad. Kotuko laid up a snow-house large enough to take in the hand-sleigh (never be {{separated}} from your meat), and while he was shaping the last <b>irregular</b> <b>block</b> of ice that makes the key-stone of the roof, he saw a Thing looking at him from a little cliff of ice half a mile away. The air was hazy, and the Thing seemed to be forty feet long and ten feet high, with twenty feet of tail and a shape that quivered all along the outlines. The girl saw it too, but instead of crying aloud with terror, said quietly, [...] "That is Quiquern. What comes after?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{better to}} {{understand}} {{the shape of the}} ruins, we will ascend the <b>irregular</b> <b>block</b> which rises a few furlongs to the north-east of the palm-orchard. It has only three names: Araygat Badá ("Veinlet of Badá"); Zeba'yat Badá, [...] "the Low-lying (Hill) of Badá;" [...] and Shahíb el-Búm, [...] "the Ash-coloured (Hill) of the Owl." [...] I will prefer the latter, as we actually sighted one of those dear birds on its western flank. It is an outcrop of grey granite, pigeon-holed by weather, and veined by a variety of dykes. Here we find greenstone breccia'd with the blackest hornblende; there huge filons of hard, red, heat-altered clays, faced with iron, whilst the fracture is white as trachyte; and there filets of quartz, traversing large curtains and sheets of light-coloured argils. This was evidently the main quarry: the sides still show signs of made zigzags; and the red blocks and boulders, all round the hill, bear the prayers and pious ejaculations of the Faithful. The characters range between square Kufic, hardly antedating four centuries, and the cursive form of our day. Some are merely scraped; others are deeply and laboriously cut in the hard material, a work more appropriate for the miner than for the passing pilgrim.|$|E

50|$|Anecdotal and {{research}} {{evidence suggests that}} navigation (especially on foot) in a disconnected network of cul-de-sac and looped streets is inconvenient and non-intuitive, particularly when combined with curvilinear geometry. Loss of orientation and sense of direction is also a common experience in older cities with cul-de-sac streets (Medina of Arab cities or Mediterranean hill towns) {{as well as in}} cities with highly <b>irregular</b> <b>block</b> geometries and sizes and corresponding street alignments that produce a labyrinthine effect. The long history of such cities implies that an irregular, complicated street network that appears entirely illegible to a visitor is well understood and used by the inhabitants. More convincing about its workability for their permanent residents are the case histories of cities such as Regensburg that show a gradual transformation of an imported or imposed orthogonal, “legible” grid to the traditional “confusing” street networks.|$|E
50|$|Uniform grids with fixed {{cardinal}} directions can be mapped {{as easily}} on paper {{as on the}} mind. This quality — legibility — assists people in finding destinations and prevents the apprehension of being lost. However, this benefit is felt more by visitors to a district than by its residents. Many historic cities with labyrinthine plans, particularly in the medieval period and in the Islamic-Arab world, cause no anxiety to their permanent residents. (Some visitors, equipped with maps, see them as a delightful journey of discovery.) Many parts of Paris, France, for example, exhibit a highly <b>irregular</b> <b>block</b> dimensions and {{a wide range of}} street orientations not easily grasped by visitors. Residents quickly acquire many perceptual clues of direction and position without ever seeing printed maps of their domains and, in earlier times, without even the benefit of street signs. Legibility can be an advantage {{but it is not a}} necessary condition for a neighbourhood or a town to function well for its residents. While the uniform grid offers utmost legibility, mutated grids and other patterns can function adequately for finding directions.|$|E
50|$|During {{the civil}} {{wars of the}} 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by Oliver Cromwell in 1651 and twice by the Williamites in the 1690s. The Treaty of Limerick ended the Williamite war in Ireland which was fought between {{supporters}} of the Catholic King James II (Jacobites) and the Protestant King William of Orange (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant Irish Parliament which rather updated the Penal Laws against Catholics which had major implications for Irish history. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an <b>irregular</b> <b>block</b> of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: Urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli (An ancient city well studied in the arts of war).|$|E

40|$|Fields, i. e. {{enclosed}} areas of arable land, are distinguished according to parcel shape and size, land fragmentation, land dispersion, and land use. The {{description of characteristics}} of a space, including a field, is unique when expressed in measurable, i. e. quantifiable values (indicators or indices), {{and this was the}} subject dealt with in this doctoral thesis. We designed a set of mutually independent indices determined either at the level of a unit, a class, or an area. The values of the indices were determined for the selected 22 fields as <b>irregular</b> <b>blocks,</b> furlongs, continuous strips, and enclosures based on the 2015 data and for selected fields also the data from the Franciscan Cadastre. The analysis of the obtained index values and statistical data processing showed that field characteristics are well described by the parcel shape index (IOP), index of land fragmentation (K), index of land dispersion (SD), and the Simpson’s Diversity Index (SIDI). The low IOP index points to irregularly shaped parcels as fields in <b>irregular</b> <b>blocks</b> and enclosures. Furlongs and fields in winegrowing areas have a high IOP, which points to parcels of more regular shapes. Enclosures and fields in winegrowing areas have high K and SD indices, which points to small land fragmentation and land dispersion. In all other types of fields, land fragmentation and land dispersion are strong (low K and SD indices). Fields in winegrowing areas particularly stand out in terms of land use diversity (SIDI index). We also found that using only one index it is difficult to distinguish between the types of arable land division, while this is possible if we use more indices. This was confirmed using the hierarchical clustering method to classify the test fields, based on the statistical values of the indices, into <b>irregular</b> <b>blocks,</b> furlongs, continuous strips, and enclosures and, as a separate group, fields in winegrowing areas. Notably, due to the deviation of the indices for the fields in winegrowing areas from other types of arable land division, we propose that these fields are classified as a separate type of arable land division. The comparison of indices in two time periods confirmed the practical application of the indices for identifying the changes in space, which could be reasonably used in continuous monitoring of land use. The SIDI index points to significant changes in land use in two periods, while the parcel shapes as well as land fragmentation and dispersion did not change significantly. Even though the indices were formed to describe field characteristics, they can be also used for describing various spatial phenomena, as proposed in the final chapters of this thesis...|$|R
