40|$|Abstract Background This study {{identified}} optimistic biases {{in health}} and oral <b>health</b> <b>hazards,</b> and explored whether comparative risk judgements for oral <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> vary systematically with socio-economic characteristics and self-reported risk experience. Methods A simple random sample of 1, 190 residents born in 1972 was drawn from the population resident in three counties of Norway. A total of 735 adults (51 % women) completed postal questionnaires at home. Results Mean ratings of comparative risk judgements differed significantly (p Conclusion Optimism in comparative judgements for health and oral <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> was evident in young Norwegian adults.

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> of the application of these alternative paints. The composition of these paints was obtained by a questionnaire survey among the main producers and importers in The Netherlands. Physicochemical parameters and toxicity data of the constituents were used to estimate occupational and environmental <b>health</b> <b>hazards.</b> Mucous membrane or skin irritation and sensitization are predicted to be the most frequently occurring <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> after contact with these paints during professional or do-ityourself application. <b>Health</b> <b>hazards</b> from environmental pollution may be irritation of the mucous membranes when the indoor environment is painted and fish mortality due to slowly degradable polyacrylate binders.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to find out}} potential diseases and protection of health within travelling by using of services Czech republic travel bureaus. The target is to map the level and attitude of travel bureaus in relation to customers <b>health</b> <b>hazards.</b> The research question was: What is the position of travel bureaus to possible customers <b>health</b> <b>hazards.</b> The used method was a qualitative research with application of individual interviews and question-form, where the target themes was the destination, way of transportation, accommodations, customer interest about <b>health</b> <b>hazards,</b> gravid customer interest of travelling and interest to travelling of customer with children under three years. It was also investigate the level of travel bureaus employees knowledge about possible customers <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> in foreign countries, mainly in subtropical and tropical countries. In this context was the focus at identification if the travel bureaus are able to give advice about customer <b>health</b> <b>hazards,</b> preventive vaccination and necessity to take necessary personal medicine, whether are exists some areas not suitable for cardiac patients and other chronic disordered patients, where can customers get information about travel <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> and at last but not at least if the tours are offered health insurance inclusive. From the research results and content analysis were deduced these hypothesis: · Travel bureaus customer are interested in potential <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> combined with travelling practically only at ways to destinations out of Europe · Travel bureaus employee are acquainted with potential <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> and they are able to give advice about specific addresses or national (private) institutions, where customer can get more information about possible customers <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> in foreign countries · Travel bureaus have cognisance of customer <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> in foreign countries The hypothesis validity should be repeatedly verified in additional research. This work brings to traveller an overview about fundamentals life style in foreign countries and includes also an overview about <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> sequent upon diverse climatic effects or lower hygienic level and there are also included precautionary arrangements to health protection in foreign countries. Likewise are interpreted views of travel bureaus to customers <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> and level of own information related to this problem. Travel bureaus customer can mostly get information about health protection or he can get recommendations to trustfulness sources, where customer can take out the needed and correct information. Customer base should have been get the think on the brain and more be actively interested in regular vaccinations, hazards of sea bathing, overexposure to sunlight, hazardous sexual activities, observance of correct meal plan, insect prevention and medicine chest equipment. We would not have forget on possible damage as a result of clime incidence, psychic stress, form of transport or animal attack. The travellers are using very often the travel bureaus services and they suppose, that will become complex services.

5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a <b>health</b> <b>hazard</b> for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.|$|E

5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial <b>health</b> <b>hazard.</b> Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body {{responsible}} for local government) was already engaged in a debate {{about the future of the}} city's defensive walls. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public <b>health</b> <b>hazard</b> given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.|$|E
