500|$|While in Skinner's office, {{the camera}} angles and {{position}} of the characters reveals that the scene {{is intended to be}} a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting The Last Supper. Skinner is standing in Saint Peter's spot, and Scully is standing in Judas Iscariot's place. Bush argues that, in this manner, the show <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Scully, like Judas, directly affects the fate of the savior, in this case Mulder. She notes that Scully's actions result in a fate that [...] "could not be realized without her participation". This {{is not the first time}} Scully has been compared to Judas in the show: the previous seventh season episode [...] ""—which is heavily based on Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ—features Scully in a role with direct literary parallels to Kazantzakis's heroic interpretation of Judas.|$|E
500|$|A love poem, [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] is thematically {{centred on}} several concepts. The poem is {{primarily}} {{to do with}} evolving love; the movement from pure lust, in the first stanza, to a nascent and evolving spirituality which liberates the lovers because they no longer [...] "watch each other out of fear" [...] but can instead see clearly. The lovers' faith in each other allows them to be brave, unlike the Seven Sleepers, who were forced out of fear to hide their beliefs; with love, the lovers can allow others to pursue their own dreams, accepting that [...] "Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one" [...] – with each other, {{there is no need}} to search further for adventure. Harold Bloom notes the intertwining of both sensual and spiritual love, arguing that Donne <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible for those buried in sensual love, [...] "busying themselves in mundane matters", to experience true love. Donne's emphasis on the importance of spiritual love can be seen from the biblical allusions; Achsah Guibbory states that the tone and wording of the poem is an intentional reference to Paul the Apostle's description of divine, agapic love; [...] "At moments like these...eros merges with agape. Walls collapse, the veil parts, we know as we are known; our deepest, truest selves exposed". Alfred W. Satterthwaite, writing in The Explicator, argues that the story of the Seven Sleepers itself contains this theme; in the story, the Sleepers awoke to find themselves [...] "thunderstruck" [...] in their new environment, something analogous to [...] "the radiant revelation love grants to the lovers in the poem".|$|E

2500|$|According to Krugman, the {{key problem}} is that the scrip's value is fixed. Couples know that each scrip they save in the winter can be {{redeemed}} for {{the same amount of time}} in the summer, giving them incentive to save because, psychologically speaking, each scrip's value is worth more to them in the summer than in the winter. Instead, if the co-op modified the system so that the scrip is redeemable for less time in the upcoming summer than in the winter, there would be less incentive to save because members would get less [...] "bang for their buck" [...] if they chose to hold onto the scrip until the summer. In other words, Krugman <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the co-op should have an inflationary monetary policy.|$|E

2500|$|Cullen {{proposed}} that joint primary nominations {{should take place}} in Conservative-held ridings {{to determine the best}} possible local candidate to avoid vote splitting among 'progressives'. Cullen <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> each constituency association would have the choice of whether or not to run their respective campaign in this way, and {{that there would be no}} [...] "top-down" [...] directive to do so. In his policy papers thus far, Cullen has also advanced a number of other ideas such as: creating a national public transit strategy, instituting carbon cap-and-trade pricing, putting a moratorium on new genetically modified organisms, redefining the Canadian Wheat Board, and holding a referendum on voting reform (Nathan supports Mixed-member proportional representation as currently utilized in New Zealand and Germany).|$|E
2500|$|The couplet sums {{up with a}} {{potential}} answer {{to all of the}} questions that the author was posing throughout the entire sonnet. He says, [...] "thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee" [...] in the first line of the couplet. This <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated. It seems as if the speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. The last line of the couplet says, [...] "which usèd, lives th'executor to be." [...] Here {{it seems as if the}} speaker is saying that if the young man uses his beauty, then it will prolong his life. The word [...] "executor" [...] hints at both death and accounting.|$|E
2500|$|According to Deacon, this {{occurred}} between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, {{when we have}} the first fossil evidence of stone tool use and the beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends. More specifically, Deacon <b>is</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Australopithecines, like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of Australopithecine history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that [...] "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species." [...] This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the [...] "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus Homo.|$|E

2500|$|Eoraptor had {{a slender}} body that grew to about [...] in length, with an {{estimated}} weight of about [...] It had a lightly built skull with a slightly enlarged external naris. Like the coelophysoids which would appear millions of years later, Eoraptor had a kink in its upper jaws, between the maxilla and the premaxilla. Paul Sereno et al. (2013) observed that the lower jaw had a mid-mandibular joint. It ran digitigrade, and upright on its hind legs. The femur of the holotype specimen PVSJ 512 is , and the tibia <b>is</b> , <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> it was a fast runner. Its forelimbs are only half the length of its hindlimbs, suggesting that it was bipedal. All of its long bones have hollow shafts. Eoraptor had five digits on each 'hand', the three longest of which ended in large claws and were presumably used to handle prey. Scientists have surmised that {{the fourth and fifth}} digits were too tiny to be of any use in hunting. The ilium is supported by three sacral vertebrae, unlike that of the coeval Herrerasaurus which is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. Eoraptor had vertebral centra that are hollow, a feature present in some of its ancestors.|$|E
