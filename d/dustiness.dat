60|$|Of all {{the romantic}} towns in Wessex, Wintoncester is {{probably}} the most convenient for meditative people to live in; since there you have a cathedral with a nave so long that it affords space in which to walk and summon your remoter moods without continually turning on your heel, or seeming to do more than take an afternoon stroll under cover from the rain or sun. In an uninterrupted course of nearly three hundred steps eastward, and again nearly three hundred steps westward amid those magnificent tombs, you can, for instance, compare in the most leisurely way the dry <b>dustiness</b> which ultimately pervades the persons of kings and bishops with the damper <b>dustiness</b> that is usually the final shape of commoners, curates, and others who take their last rest out of doors. Then, if you are in love, you can, by sauntering in the chapels and behind the episcopal chantries with the bright-eyed one, so steep and mellow your ecstasy in the solemnities around, that it will assume a rarer and finer tincture, even more grateful to the understanding, if not to the senses, than that form of the emotion which arises from such companionship in spots where all is life, and growth, and fecundity.|$|E

60|$|They {{went to the}} lawn, and James was {{introduced}} {{to a pair of}} buxom, healthy-looking girls, panting a little after their violent exercise. They were dressed in white, in a rather masculine fashion, and the only sign of mourning was the black tie that each wore in a sailor's knot. They shook hands vigorously (it was a family trait), and then seemed at a loss for conversation; James, as was his way, did not help them, and they plunged at last into a discussion about the weather and the <b>dustiness</b> of the road from Ashford to their house.|$|E
60|$|Seen by daylight, Chitterlow was {{not nearly}} such a {{magnificent}} figure {{as he had been}} by the subdued nocturnal lightings and beneath the glamour of his own interpretation. The lines were the same indeed, but the texture was different. There was a quality about the yachting cap, an indefinable finality of <b>dustiness,</b> a shiny finish on all the salient surfaces of the reefer coat. The red hair and the profile, though still forcible and fine, were less in the quality of Michael Angelo and more in that of the merely picturesque. But it was a bright brown eye still that sought amidst the interstices of the baby-linen.|$|E
6000|$|She never {{recalled}} {{her first}} impression of Main Street; never had {{precisely the same}} despair at its ugliness. By the end of two shopping-tours everything had changed proportions. As she never entered it, the Minniemashie House ceased to exist for her. Clark's Hardware Store, Dyer's Drug Store, the groceries of Ole Jenson and Frederick Ludelmeyer and Howland & Gould, the meat markets, the notions shop--they expanded, and hid all other structures. When she entered Mr. Ludelmeyer's store and he wheezed, [...] "Goot mornin', Mrs. Kennicott.

60|$|The issue was, {{that after}} a rather {{roundabout}} drive they drew {{up in a very}} respectable side-street, before a large respectable-looking house, illuminated by two tall white lights flanking its portico. Pierre was glad to notice some little remaining stir within, spite of the comparative lateness of the hour. A bare-headed, tidily-dressed, and very intelligent-looking man, with a broom clothes-brush in his hand, appearing, scrutinized him rather sharply at first; but as Pierre advanced further into the light, and his countenance became visible, the man, assuming a respectful but still slightly perplexed air, invited the whole party into a closely adjoining parlor, whose disordered chairs and general <b>dustiness,</b> evinced {{that after a}} day's activity it now awaited the morning offices of the housemaids.|$|E

I desire no better for my fame, when my personal <b>dustiness</b> shall be past the control of my love of order, than such a biographer and such a critic. And again I say, most solemnly, that literature in England has never had, and probably never will have, such a champion as you are, in right of this book.|$|E
60|$|It is {{therefore}} {{the very essence}} of Browning's genius, and {{the very essence of}} The Ring and the Book, that it should be the enormous multiplication of a small theme. It is the extreme of idle criticism to complain that the story is a current and sordid story, for the whole object of the poem is to show what infinities of spiritual good and evil a current and sordid story may contain. When once this is realised, it explains at one stroke the innumerable facts about the work. It explains, for example, Browning's detailed and picturesque account of the glorious dust-bin of odds and ends for sale, out of which he picked the printed record of the trial, and his insistence on its cheapness, its <b>dustiness,</b> its yellow leaves, and its crabbed Latin. The more soiled and dark and insignificant he can make the text appear, the better for his ample and gigantic sermon. It explains again the strictness with which Browning adhered to the facts of the forgotten intrigue. He was playing the game of seeing how much was really involved in one paltry fragment of fact. To have introduced large quantities of fiction would not have been sportsmanlike. The Ring and the Book therefore, to re-capitulate the view arrived at so far, is the typical epic of our age, because it expresses the richness of life by taking as a text a poor story. It pays to existence the highest of all possible compliments--the great compliment which monarchy paid to mankind--the compliment of selecting from it almost at random.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{special to}} our story {{occurred}} at Littlebath {{during the next two}} or three months, except that Miss Mackenzie became more and more intimate with Miss Baker, and more and more anxious to form an acquaintance with Miss Todd. With all the Stumfoldians she was on terms of mitigated friendship, and always went to Mrs Stumfold's fortnightly tea-drinkings. But with no lady there,--always excepting Miss Baker,--did she find that she grew into familiarity. With Mrs Stumfold no one was familiar. She was afflicted by the weight of her own position, as we suppose the Queen to be, when we say that her Majesty's altitude is too high to admit of friendships. Mrs Stumfold never condescended--except to the bishop's wife who, in return, had snubbed Mrs Stumfold. But living, as she did, in an atmosphere of flattery and toadying, it was wonderful how well she preserved her equanimity, and how she would talk and perhaps think of herself, as a poor, erring human being. When, however, she insisted much upon this fact of her humanity, the coachmaker's wife would shake her head, and at last stamp her foot in anger, swearing that though everybody was of course dust, and grass, and worms; and though, of course, Mrs Stumfold must, by nature, be included in that everybody; yet dust, and grass, and worms nowhere exhibited themselves with so few of the stains of humanity on them as they did within the bosom of Mrs Stumfold. So that, though the absolute fact of Mrs Stumfold being dust, and grass, and worms, could not, in regard to the consistency of things, be denied, yet in her <b>dustiness,</b> grassiness, and worminess she was so little dusty, grassy, and wormy, that it was hardly fair, even in herself, to mention the fact at all.|$|E
60|$|The two windows {{looked out}} over the park, and thence it was that while Morris, the maid, was {{unpacking}} and putting away the new purchases, and Nuttie was standing, scarcely realising that such pretty hats and bonnets could be her very own, when her mother beheld the Canon and Mark advancing up the drive. It was with a great start that she called Ursula to come down directly with her, as no one would know where to find them, hastily washing the hands that had picked up a sense of <b>dustiness</b> during the exploration, and taking a comprehensive glance in the cheval glass, which showed her some one she felt entirely unfamiliar to her in a dainty summer costume of pale gray silk picked out with a mysterious shade of pink. Ursula too thought Miss Egremont's outer woman more like a Chelsea shepherdess than Nuttie's true self, as she tripped along in her buckled shoes and the sea green stockings that had been sent home with her skirt. With crimson cheeks and a throbbing heart, Alice was only just {{at the foot of the}} stairs when the newcomers had made their way in, and the kind Canon, ignoring all that was past, held out his hands saying, 'Well, my dear, I am glad to see you here,' kissing Mrs. Egremont on each cheek. 'And so this is your daughter. How do you do, my dear--Ursula? Isn't that your name?' And Ursula had again to submit to a kiss, much more savoury and kindly than her father's, though very stubbly. And oh! her uncle's dress was like that of no one she had ever seen except the rector of the old church, the object of unlimited contempt to the adherents of St. Ambrose's.|$|E
60|$|Considering that Doctor Grimshawe, when {{we first}} look upon him, had dwelt {{only a few years}} in the house by the graveyard, it is {{wonderful}} what an appearance he, and his furniture, and his cobwebs, and their unweariable spinners, and crusty old Hannah, all had of having permanently attached themselves to the locality. For a century, at least, it might be fancied that the study in particular had existed just as it was now; with those dusky festoons of spider-silk hanging along the walls, those book-cases with volumes turning their parchment or black-leather backs upon you, those machines and engines, that table, and at it the Doctor, in a very faded and shabby dressing-gown, smoking a long clay pipe, the powerful fumes of which dwelt continually in his reddish and grisly beard, and made him fragrant wherever he went. This sense of fixedness--stony intractability--seems to belong to people who, instead of hope, which exalts everything into an airy, gaseous exhilaration, have a fixed and dogged purpose, around which everything congeals and crystallizes. [Endnote: 1] Even the sunshine, dim through the <b>dustiness</b> of the two casements that looked upon the graveyard, and the smoke, as it came warm out of Doctor Grimshawe's mouth, seemed already stale. But if the two children, or either of them, {{happened to be in the}} study,--if they ran to open the door at the knock, if they came scampering and peeped down over the banisters,--the sordid and rusty gloom was apt to vanish quite away. The sunbeam itself looked like a golden rule, that had been flung down long ago, and had lain there till it was dusty and tarnished. They were cheery little imps, who sucked up fragrance and pleasantness out of their surroundings, dreary as these looked; even as a flower can find its proper perfume in any soil where its seed happens to fall. The great spider, hanging by his cordage over the Doctor's head, and waving slowly, like a pendulum, in a blast from the crack of the door, must have made millions and millions of precisely such vibrations as these; but the children were new, and made over every day, with yesterday's weariness left out.|$|E
60|$|They will {{probably}} not keep a servant for two very excellent reasons, because {{in the first place}} they will not want one, and in the second they will not get one if they do. A servant is necessary in the small, modern house, partly to supplement the deficiencies of the wife, but mainly to supplement the deficiencies of the house. She comes to cook and perform various skilled duties that the wife lacks either knowledge or training, or both, to perform regularly and expeditiously. Usually it must be confessed that the servant in the small household fails to perform these skilled duties completely. But the great proportion of the servant's duties consists merely in drudgery that the stupidities of our present-day method of house construction entail, and which the more sanely constructed house of the future will avoid. Consider, for instance, the wanton disregard of avoidable toil displayed in building houses with a service basement without lifts! Then most dusting and sweeping would be quite avoidable if houses were wiselier done. It is the lack of proper warming appliances which necessitates a vast amount of coal carrying and dirt distribution, and it is this dirt mainly that has so painfully to be removed again. The house of the future {{will probably}} be warmed in its walls from some power-generating station, as, indeed, already very many houses are lit at the present day. The lack of sane methods of ventilation also enhances the general dirtiness and <b>dustiness</b> of the present-day home, and gas-lighting and the use of tarnishable metals, wherever possible, involve further labour. But air will enter the house of the future through proper tubes in the walls, which will warm it and capture its dust, and it will be spun out again by a simple mechanism. And by simple devices such sweeping as still remains necessary can be enormously lightened. The fact that in existing homes the skirting meets the floor at right angles makes sweeping about twice as troublesome as it will be when people have the sense and ability to round off the angle between wall and floor.|$|E

50|$|Various {{laboratory}} {{systems have}} been developed to test <b>dustiness</b> of fine powders. A European standard on <b>dustiness</b> testing has been established by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) since April 2006.

Recently, an aerosol generation system based on laboratory funnel (resembling a fluidized bed) has been developed, which has the potential to become an alternative or supplementary method to the existing systems in <b>dustiness</b> testing.

After applying shear forces, the particle mean size decreased while the particle generation rate increased.

5000|$|Some powders may be dustier than others. The {{tendency}} of a powder to generate {{particles in the}} air under a given energy input is called [...] "dustiness". It is an important powder property which is relevant to powder aerosolization process. It also has indications for human exposure to aerosolized particles and associated health risks (via skin contacts or inhalation) at workplaces. Various <b>dustiness</b> testing methods have been established in research laboratories, in order to predict powder behaviors during aerosolization.

5000|$|During the Last Glacial Maximum, much of {{the world}} was cold, dry, and inhospitable, with {{frequent}} storms and a dust-laden atmosphere. The <b>dustiness</b> of the atmosphere is a prominent feature in ice cores; dust levels were as much as 20 to 25 times greater than now. [...] This was probably due to a number of factors: reduced vegetation, stronger global winds, and less precipitation to clear dust from the atmosphere. The massive sheets of ice locked away water, lowering the sea level, exposing continental shelves, joining land masses together, and creating extensive coastal plains. During the last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, the sea level was about 125 meters (about 410 feet) lower than it is today.|$|E
50|$|Inhalation {{exposure}} {{is the most}} common route of exposure to airborne particles in the workplace. The deposition of nanoparticles in the respiratory tract is determined by the shape and size of particles or their agglomerates, and they are deposited in the lungs {{to a greater extent than}} larger respirable particles. Based on animal studies, nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream from the lungs and translocate to other organs, including the brain. The inhalation risk is affected by the <b>dustiness</b> of the material, the tendency of particles to become airborne in response to a stimulus. Dust generation is affected by the particle shape, size, bulk density, and inherent electrostatic forces, and whether the nanomaterial is a dry powder or incorporated into a slurry or liquid suspension.|$|E

5000|$|Engineering {{controls}} are physical {{changes to the}} workplace that isolate workers from hazards by containing them in an enclosure, or removing contaminated air from the workplace through ventilation and filtering. They are used when hazardous substances and processes cannot be eliminated or replaced with less hazardous substitutes.

Well-designed engineering {{controls are}} typically passive, in the sense of being independent of worker interactions, which reduces the potential for worker behavior to impact exposure levels.

50|$|The Australian Blue Asbestos Company {{employed}} 6,500 men and 500 {{women in}} the mining and milling of crocidolite at Wittenoom between 1943 and 1966. This cohort has been traced periodically for vital status and cause of death since 1975. By 1986 there were 85 deaths from pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. None occurred within ten years of first exposure to crocidolite. A survey of <b>dustiness</b> in the industry conducted in 1966 has provided a basis for estimates of cumulative crocidolite exposure {{of the members of}} the cohort. Exposure-response relationships have been examined. Mesothelioma incidence rates increase exponentially with time since first exposure and also increase with intensity of exposure to crocidolite. Mathematical modelling of the relationship between mesothelioma incidence and intensity of exposure, duration of exposure and time since first exposure results in an estimate of up to 700 cases of mesothelioma in this cohort by the year 2020.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dustiness</b> may {{be defined}} as the {{propensity}} of a powder to form airborne dust by a prescribed mechanical stimulus; <b>dustiness</b> testing is typically intended to replicate mechanisms of dust generation encountered in workplaces. A novel <b>dustiness</b> testing device, developed for pharmaceutical application, was evaluated in the <b>dustiness</b> investigation of 27 fine and nanoscale powders. The device efficiently dispersed small (mg) quantities {{of a wide variety of}} fine and nanoscale powders, into a small sampling chamber. Measurements consisted of gravimetrically determined total and respirable <b>dustiness.</b> The following materials were studied: single and multiwalled carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and carbon blacks; fumed oxides of titanium, aluminum, silicon, and cerium; metallic nanoparticles (nickel, cobalt, manganese, and silver) silicon carbide, Arizona road dust; nanoclays; and lithium titanate. Both the total and respirable <b>dustiness</b> spanned two orders of magnitude (0. 3 - 37. 9 % and 0. 1 - 31. 8 % of the predispersed test powders, respectively). For many powders, a significant respirable <b>dustiness</b> was observed. For most powders studied, the respirable <b>dustiness</b> accounted for approximately one-third of the total <b>dustiness.</b> It is believed that this relationship holds for many fine and nanoscale test powders (i. e. those primarily selected for this study), but may not hold for coarse powders. Neither total nor respirable <b>dustiness</b> was found to be correlated with BET surface area, therefore <b>dustiness</b> is not determined by primary particle size. For a subset of test powders, aerodynamic particle size distributions by number were measured (with an electrical low-pressure impactor and an aerodynamic particle sizer). Particle size modes ranged from approximately 300 nm to several micrometers, but no modes below 100 nm, were observed. It is therefore unlikely that these materials would exhibit a substantial sub- 100 nm particle contribution in a workplace...|$|E
40|$|A {{rotating}} drum <b>dustiness</b> tester {{was used to}} characterize variability of <b>dustiness</b> in dependence of type and mass of test material, testing time, and surface adhesion. Powders of six common materials entered the study: bentonite, barium sulphate, talc, Aloxite, carbon black, and coal. Except for coal, <b>dustiness</b> was in general positively correlated to the mass of powder under testing. Surface adhesion tended to be aected from the type of test material. For a fixed dust dispersion time (180 sec) the dependence of <b>dustiness</b> on time was characterized {{in terms of the}} time required to arrive at the median of the cumulative distribution of mass delivered at the outlet of the drum. In general the time required was positively correlated to the mass of material under testing. A three-parameter multiplicative model for <b>dustiness</b> potential was developed for two of the test materials (bentonite and barium sulphate). The model included surface adhesion, time, and mass of material under testing as predictors. The model was highly significant (p< 0. 001) and accounted for more than 80 % of the observed variation in <b>dustiness.</b> It is concluded that for <b>dustiness</b> testing to become useful a careful control of all the operating parameters are required in order to have reproducible tests. Therefore standardization of the method is essential. # 199...|$|E

Three powders were used in the study, i. e. magnesium stearate, representing a very dusty powder, and aluminium oxide and calcium carbonate, representing low and very low dusty powders, respectively. Two scenarios of handling small volume of powders were included; sweeping/cleaning and scooping/ weighing/adding. Size-selective dust exposure was assessed using MultiDust (dual-fraction) IOM and RespiCon sampling heads. For the present operation scenarios, <b>dustiness</b> showed itself to be the major determinant of exposure and explained 70 % of the exposure variances. The ratios of respirable and inhalable fractions as determined by <b>dustiness</b> tests were com-parable with the ratios observed for exposure.

40|$|Dust is {{generated}} from bulk materials during handling, free fall and through belt conveyor transfers, creating air pollutants which can affect human communities, industrial {{equipment and the}} environment. A {{greater understanding of the}} generation of dust from bulk material requires knowledge of the mechanisms of bulk material flows. The purpose of this research was to investigate the mechanisms of bulk material flow in <b>dustiness</b> testers by using numerical simulations and by comparing these results with experimental data. The experiments were carried out using three types of bulk materials with different properties, namely, polyethylene pellets, iron ore and coal. In these experiments, the flow of bulk materials are measured in rotating drums using two types of standard <b>dustiness</b> testers. The two standard <b>dustiness</b> testers that were chosen in this study are the International Standard (IS) <b>dustiness</b> tester and the Australian Standard (AS) <b>dustiness</b> tester. Even though both of these <b>dustiness</b> testers are very similar in their operations, they differ in terms of: (i) the air flow and velocity of the drum rotations and, (ii) the volume of materials used in the experiments. Four types of particle heaps were considered in this work, namely, particles that are: spread from the front {{to the back of the}} drum, in the middle, at the front and at the back of the drum.

40|$|<b>Dustiness</b> quantifies the {{propensity}} of a finely divided solid to be aerosolized by a prescribed mechanical stimulus. <b>Dustiness</b> is relevant wherever powders are mixed, transferred or handled, and {{is important in}} the control of hazardous exposures and the prevention of dust explosions and product loss. Limited quantities of active pharmaceutical powders available for testing led to the development (at University of North Carolina) of a Venturi-driven <b>dustiness</b> tester.
