His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for Sánchez; he <b>has</b> <b>walked</b> 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes out a lot of batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E

50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note one instance where all translators, except one, have decidedly diverted from the temporal sense of the text. The first line haajaar bochor dhore aami path haatitechi prithibir pothey is in present perfect continuous tense. Most translations have rendered this either into simple past tense or present perfect tense. Oblivious of the continuity of the act Martin Kirkman translated : A thousand years I have wandered upon the earth. Amitabha Mukerjee translated : A thousand years I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> these paths. Sukanta Chaudhuri rendered : I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the roads across the earth’s breast for a thousand years. Ananda Lal also used present perfect tense : I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the paths of earth for thousands of years. Now the translation by Joydeep Bhattacharya : I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> earth’s byways for millennia. Fakrul Alam followed suit by writing : For a thousand years I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the ways of the world.|$|R

It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: [...] "The lady has not just looked glamorous but she <b>has</b> <b>walked</b> with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness.

500|$|Two other {{characters}} also reappear several times within the quest. Waka appears to Amaterasu {{several times in}} the game as a beautiful young flute-playing man in costume resembling a tengu (more precisely, a tengu dressed like a yamabushi, which is a frequent tengu appearance). He is aware of the goddess's true identity and foretells her future and at times battles with her. He leads the Tao Troopers whose members Abe and Kamo are based on the two famous onmyōji Abe no Seimei and Kamo no Yasunori. Waka's dialogue, dropping French affectionate terms at times, conveys a sense of familiarity with Amaterasu, as it turns out that Waka is much older than he appears and <b>has</b> <b>walked</b> with Amaterasu on the Celestial Plain hundreds of years ago. The other is Orochi, the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times. Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman. Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of sake available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor. Amaterasu trusts Queen Himiko, the ruler of [...] "Sei-an City", who is killed by one of the demons.|$|E
