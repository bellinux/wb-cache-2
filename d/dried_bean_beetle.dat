40|$|During 1994 to 1996, {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in western Nebraska, to develop a pest management program for Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> (Epilachna varivestis Mulsant) in <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) based on egg mass sampling. A sampling survey to describe the spatial and probability distributions of egg masses produced a data set of 12, 290 egg mass samples from four fields over two years. Semivariograms {{showed no sign of}} aggregation, even though the presence of macroscale trends indicated that Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> egg densities may be greater in areas of the field near edges adjacent to beetle overwintering sites. Egg masses had a negative binomial distribution. ^ Life tables were developed by following known Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> cohorts (egg masses) in three fields in each of two years. High mortality occurred in the egg and first two larval stages. Egg mortality was related to drought-stressed bean plants, because stressed plants turn over their leaves and expose eggs to sunlight. The cumulative mortality ranged from 92. 07 % to 95. 82 %, in 1995 and from 60. 89 % to 75. 6 % in 1996. No parasitized larvae were observed in the study fields or those held for parasitism tests. ^ Yield-loss relationships for Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> on <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> were determined in a third study. Results from a series of experiments were combined with data from the other two studies to develop economic injury levels (EILs) and economic thresholds (ETs) and a sequential sampling program for Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle.</b> The EILs calculated in larvae/row-m were converted to egg masses/row-m and adjusted to reflect the average survivorship to the adult stage. Because sampling is based on egg masses, growers can make management decisions and take management actions before significant injury will occur. An interactive spreadsheet was developed to calculate Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> EILs, ETs, and sequential sampling plans. The spreadsheet allows users to input economic and other data specific to their situation. The pest management tools presented in this work should provide a useful model for management programs for other insects pests in other systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Current {{reforms in}} {{undergraduate}} biology education are advancing research experiences in laboratory courses. Such experiences in evolutionary biology {{have largely been}} limited to microbial systems. Methods We designed a guided-inquiry experiment in which students {{examine the effect of}} evolutionary history on the potential for adaptation in the <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> (Callosobruchus maculatus), an insect model system widely used in evolutionary biology research. <b>Bean</b> <b>beetles</b> lay their eggs on a variety of species of <b>dried</b> <b>beans</b> (seeds of species in the Fabaceae) and the larvae develop within the bean. They are an ideal model system for studies of experimental evolution in teaching laboratories as they are easy to rear, handle and manipulate. In this study, students design an experiment to determine if adaptation to a particular bean host pre-adapts their offspring to be more successful on a new bean host. Results Preliminary experiments by our students suggest that beetles adapted to a lower quality host (adzuki beans, Vigna angularis) are more successful on a new higher quality host (black-eyed peas, Vigna unguiculata) than beetles adapted to a higher quality host (mung beans,Vigna radiata). However, beetles adapted to black-eyed peas are more successful on mung beans than adzuki beans. Conclusions Taken together, their results show that an evolutionary history on a low quality host might allow <b>bean</b> <b>beetles</b> to be more successful at invading new hosts...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} and {{life cycle of}} the <b>bean</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> are discussed along with scouting techniques, economic thresholds, and cultural control tactics. The <b>bean</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> is a common insect found in Nebraska soybean fields. The insect also feeds on peas, snap <b>beans,</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>beans.</b> Although present in alfalfa and sweet clover {{in the early spring}} before soybean emerges, the insect is not known to damage either legume. Use integrated pest management (IPM) when planning how to reduce <b>bean</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> damage. Integrated pest management is a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health, and environmental risks. Economic risks can be minimized by using approved <b>bean</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> scouting techniques and economic thresholds to make management decisions. Health risks can be minimized by avoiding pesticide use and by following all safety directions provided on pesticide labels when chemical intervention is needed. Environmental risks can be minimized by avoiding pesticide use when possible and by following all environmental or wildlife safety guidelines provided on the pesticide label when pesticides must be used.

5000|$|Beginning in 1966, Pediobius foveolatus was {{imported}} to the United States to {{be tested}} for potential control of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle.</b> Initial testing determined that Pediobius foveolatus would readily parasitize the larvae of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle,</b> while leaving native, predatory coccinellids unharmed. In 1972, Maryland, then other states, began releasing Pediobius foveolatus to control Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle.</b> USDA branches in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia released wasps throughout these states, focusing on areas with large soybean acreage and high Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> populations. [...] Inoculative releases of Pediobius foveolatus yielded positive results; parasitism rates of 80 to 100% of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae were commonly documented near release sites. However, Steven et al. (1975) also reported slow population dispersal from these sites. Also, Pediobius foveolatus cannot overwinter in the United States due to cold winters and the lack of an overwintering host. In Pediobius foveolatus native territory, the weather either is conducive for year-round exposure, or wasps overwinter in their hosts, which overwinter as larvae. Because Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> overwinter as adults, wasps are without adequate winter refuge in the United States [...] Because Pediobius foveolatus can neither overwinter successfully nor spread rapidly, management with this wasp requires yearly releases in more locations than is practical to control of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> on a large scale. By the mid-1980s, all states except New Jersey had discontinued state-run releases of P. foveolatus. At this time, pest pressure from Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> began its sharp decline as well, especially in soybean.|$|R
50|$|Managing Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> using Pediobius foveolatus can be {{difficult}} due to its sensitivity to cool, wet weather, {{and the need for}} a release date to line up with the phenology of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. Ideally, Pediobius foveolatus is released at both one and two weeks after first instar Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae are discovered in beans. Pediobius foveolatus wasps reproduce most successfully within the older and larger beetle larvae; if older, larger Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> instars are present when Pediobius foveolatus is released, they will be without a host. Pediobius foveolatus is also sensitive cold and wet weather, and are unlike to survive when released in these conditions. Wasps are generally released rate of 1000 wasps (or 50 mummies) per 3600 square feet of beans. Successful parasitism and emergence of the next generation of wasps is visibly monitored by the presence of dark-brown, dead Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae (“mummies”).
