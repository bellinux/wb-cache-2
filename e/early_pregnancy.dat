5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage. Hypothyroidism in <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> even with limited or no symptoms, may {{increase the risk of}} pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{firm believer}} that human life begins the moment an egg is fertilized, and that from that moment {{has a right to}} life that {{government}} is charged with protecting, Paul has also been challenged for simultaneously holding the apparently contradictory position of supporting access to emergency contraception, such as the morning-after pill, in cases of “honest rape.” [...] He wrote, in Liberty Defined, published in 2011, “Very <b>early</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and victims of rape can be treated with the day after pill, which is nothing more than using birth control pills in a special manner. These very <b>early</b> <b>pregnancies</b> could never be policed, regardless. Such circumstances would be dealt with by each individual making his or her own moral choice.” ...|$|R
5|$|In <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
40|$|Early fetal growth {{delay and}} early {{oligohydramnios}} have been suspected {{as signs of}} embryonal jeopardy. However, little information is available for the prediction of early abortion. Sonographic examination of 111 <b>early</b> <b>pregnancies</b> between the sixth and ninth gestational week with regular, 28 day menstrual cycles was performed to investigate predictable sonographic findings of early abortion. Sonographic measurements of the gestational sac (G-SAC), crown-rump length (CRL) and fetal heart rate (FHR) were performed using a linear array real time transducer with Doppler. All measurements of 17 early abortions were compared to those of 94 normal pregnancies to investigate the objective rules for the screening of early abortion. Most of the <b>early</b> aborted <b>pregnancies</b> were classified correctly by discriminant analysis with G-SAC and CRL (G-SAC = 0. 5222 CRL + 14. 6673 = 0. 5 CRL + 15, sensitivity 76. 5 % specificity 96. 8 %). With the addition of FHR, 94. 1 % of early abortions could be predicted. In conclusion, sonographic findings of early intrauterine growth retardation, early oligohydromnios and bradycardia can be predictable signs for the poor prognosis of <b>early</b> <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R
50|$|Statistical {{reports are}} {{published}} yearly and {{are based on}} data from all clinics and hospitals where abortions are performed.

50|$|Married on 15 December 1990, Berlusconi and Lario {{have three}} {{children}} together: Barbara Berlusconi (1984), Eleonora (1986), and Luigi (1988). In the 80s, before {{the birth of the}} first-born daughter Barbara, Lario terminated an <b>earlier</b> <b>pregnancy</b> with an induced abortion, in order not to give birth to a child affected by significant morbidity.|$|R
5|$|During <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Bacterial vaginosis is an {{imbalance}} of naturally occurring bacterial flora in the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis an intercurrent disease in pregnancy {{may increase the}} risk of pregnancy complications, most notably premature birth or miscarriage.

40|$|For {{women in}} the <b>early</b> stages of <b>pregnancy,</b> the intrauterine gestational sac cannot yet be seen.

25|$|The precise rate is {{not known}} because {{a large number of}} miscarriages occur before pregnancies become {{established}} and before the woman is aware they are pregnant. In addition, those with bleeding in <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding. Some studies have attempted to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very <b>early</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> although these would also not be representative of the wider population. A systematic review found that the cumulative risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks of gestation varied from 11% to 22% in studies assessing miscarriage rates. Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.|$|E
