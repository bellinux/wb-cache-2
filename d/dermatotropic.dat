However, PRR functioning can also be detrimental, even during infections. This review discusses the current knowledge on PRRs that recognize <b>dermatotropic</b> pathogens, and potential therapeutical implications...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, three {{strains of}} the herpes virus have been dealt with. The H. F. II strain was {{obtained}} from the subject H. F. 4 years after the H. F. I strain was secured. H. F. is a victim of recurrent herpes. If the subject is also a chronic carrier of the herpes virus, then it is not one, but two or more strains which are persistently carried. The H. F. II strain is of mitigated pathogenic action for the rabbit, as compared with the H. F. I strain; it is to be classed as <b>dermatotropic</b> rather than neurotropic. And yet, in the subject there was no indication that the attack of herpes provoked was different from the other attacks associated with the H. F. I virus. The other two herpes strains derive their interest from the fact that they came also from persons who suffer from repeated attacks of labial herpes. One strain proved highly neurotropic, resembling in this respect the H. F. I strain; the other was hardly neurotropic at all, but was none the less definitely <b>dermatotropic.</b> It may be possible at a later date to secure other samples of virus from these individuals for comparison. The <b>dermatotropic</b> F. strain penetrates to the central nervous system far more readily and certainly from the skin than from corneal surfaces. The recovered inoculated rabbits showed only relative protection to reinoculation of the herpes virus. A notable difference appeared in the degree of protection acquired, on the one hand by the cornea and on the other by the brain. While the one was partial, the other was complete. The complete resistance of the brain was shown (a) by the complete failure of the intracerebral inoculation, and (b) by the absence of circling movements following corneal inoculation...|$|E
40|$|In Japan we {{have had}} two {{outbreaks}} of hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with disorders of the central nervous system, one in 1973 {{and the other in}} 1978. The isolated virus in both outbreaks was enterovirus 71. Central nervous system disorders were present in 24 % of patients in 1973 and in 8 % of patients in 1978. These disorders were localised encephalitis with cerebellar signs as the main feature, aseptic meningitis, and polio-like paresis. The enterovirus 71 isolated in Japan had strong <b>dermatotropic</b> as well as neurotropic tendencies. However in cross-neutralisation tests, no difference in antigenicity from the prototype, BrCr strain, was recognised...|$|E
40|$|Skin infections {{with type}} 1 {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV- 1) were {{compared}} with skin infections with type 2 virus (HSV- 2). Five strains each of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 were tested by injecting 10 (3) 50 % tissue culture infective doses of each strain subcutaneously into 1 -day-old New Zealand white rabbits. All five strains of HSV- 2 produced severe skin lesions that resulted in wide dissemination of the infection to many organs, paralysis of the hind legs, and finally death. The virus could be isolated frequently from skin lesions, from various organs (liver, lungs, adrenal glands, brain, and eyes), and from circulating leukocytes and plasma. In contrast, all five strains of HSV- 1 failed to produce significant skin lesions or dissemination of virus, {{only half of the}} skin lesions yielded HSV, and no virus could be isolated from the blood. These results indicate that HSV- 1 dose not grow well in the skin of newborn rabbits and fails to disseminate, whereas HSV- 2 is <b>dermatotropic</b> and disseminates readily to many organs by hematogenous routes...|$|E
40|$|Molluscum contagiosum {{virus is}} a human and animal <b>dermatotropic</b> pathogen, which causes a severe disease in immunocompromised individuals. MCV belongs to the Poxviridae family whose members exert {{immunomodulatory}} effects on the host antiviral response. Poxviruses interfere with cell signaling pathways {{that lead to the}} activation of nuclear factor кB, a pleiotropic transcription factor which is crucial for regulation of the immune response, the cell cycle and apoptosis. In resting cells, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm, where it is associated with inhibitor κB. Upon stimulation by activators, such as proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial or viral products, the inhibitory protein undergoes phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. NF-κB, in turn, translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of various genes that are essential for processes mentioned above. Since poxviruses replicate exclusively in the cell cytoplasm, NF-кB became a good target for poxviral immunomodulation. MCV encodes various proteins which interfere with the signaling pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB. Ligand inhibitor encoded by MCV, MC 54, binds interleukin- 18 and inhibits interferon-γ production. Other MCV proteins, MC 159 and MC 160, belong to intracellular inhibitors of NF-κB and are members of viral FLICE-inhibitory proteins (vFLIPs). MC 159 protein encoded by MCV was shown to inhibit apoptosis of virus-infected cells. Such interactions serve immune evasion and are responsible for the persistence of MCV. ...|$|E
40|$|Mortality after {{intravenous}} {{challenge with}} 10 (4) Cryptococcus neoformans demonstrated that doubly immunodeficient beige athymic (bg/bg nu/nu) mice were {{more susceptible to}} systemic cryptococcosis than either bg/bg or nu/nu mice. Infected bg/bg nu/nu mice also had a shortened lifespan compared with their bg/bg nu/+ littermates. Beige athymic (bg/bg nu/nu) but not bg/bg nu/+mice developed cryptococcal lesions in the skin, demonstrating that C. neoformans is <b>dermatotropic</b> in a T-cell-deficient host. Higher numbers of C. neoformans were isolated from the lungs and spleen of infected bg/bg nu/nu than bg/bg nu/+ mice as early as day 3 after challenge, indicating that in lymphoid-rich organs, T cells can alter the course of systemic cryptococcosis early in the infection. Despite extensive abscess formation in the brains of bg/bg nu/+ mice, dissemination and growth rate of C. neoformans in the brain was similar in both genotypes. The primary histopathological feature in tissues from bg/bg nu/nu mice infected with C. neoformans consisted of foci of encapsulated yeast cells with minimal to no inflammatory response. In contrast to bg/bg nu/nu mice, bg/bg nu/+ mice mounted a vigorous inflammatory response to C. neoformans that progressed from acute to chronic inflammation. Beige athymic mice are a new animal model that will be useful in clarifying the innate and acquired immune factors important in resistance to cryptococcosis...|$|E
40|$|Skin keratinocytes {{provide a}} {{first line of}} defense against invading {{microorganisms}} in two ways: (i) by acting as a physical barrier to pathogen entry and (ii) by initiating a vigorous innate immune response upon sensing danger signals. How keratinocytes detect virus infections and generate antiviral immune responses is not well understood. Orthopoxviruses are <b>dermatotropic</b> DNA viruses that cause lethal disease in humans. Virulence in animal models depends on the virus-encoded bifunctional Z-DNA/double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) -binding protein E 3. Here, we report that infection of mouse primary keratinocytes with a vaccinia ΔE 3 L mutant virus triggers the production of beta interferon (IFN-β), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), CCL 4, and CCL 5. None of these immune mediators is produced by keratinocytes infected with wild-type vaccinia virus. The dsRNA-binding domain of E 3 suffices to prevent activation of the innate immune response. ΔE 3 L induction of IFN-β, IL- 6, CCL 4, and CCL 5 secretion requires mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; an adaptor for the cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA 5) and the transcription factor IRF 3. IRF 3 phosphorylation is induced in keratinocytes infected with ΔE 3 L, an event that depends on MAVS. The response of keratinocytes to ΔE 3 L is unaffected by genetic ablation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3), TRIF, TLR 9, and MyD 88...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{have sought to}} show that unequivocal strains of herpes virus exist in man, which, in the rabbit, exhibit a degree of encephalitogenic power not exceeded, and perhaps rarely equalled, by any strain of the so called {{encephalitis}} virus. The fact that such highly encephalitogenic strains of the herpes virus exist in nature has, at the moment, theoretical and practical importance. Until recently, the view has been accepted by certain workers in the field that two biologically distinct viruses of this class occur—one inducing epidemic encephalitis and the other febrile herpes in man. This view, is, indeed, being supplanted {{at the present time}} by the notion, advocated by Levaditi, Nicolau, and Poincloux, of a group of closely related virus organisms for which the name "herpetico-encephalitic" is proposed. Within this group they distinguish strains of virus displaying special affinities for the central nervous organs and others exhibiting equal affinities for skin and membrane (cornea) structures. The first mentioned strains are responsible, under suitable circumstances, for epidemics of encephalitis in man; the others give rise to ordinary attacks of febrile herpes. The H. F. virus described in this paper does not conform to the classification indicated. While being a true febrile herpes strain, it possesses, nevertheless) a high degree of power to attack the central nervous system as well as marked capacity to implant itself on the skin and the cornea of the rabbit. Not only does virus encephalitis follow invariably upon the intracranial injection of the H. F. virus, but as regularly upon corneal, skin, nasal, blood, and testicular modes of inoculation. The symptoms of virus encephalitis thus provoked and the character of the brain lesions induced are precisely those, in all their detail and variety, including the presence of intracellular inclusion bodies, which have been described for the so called virus of encephalitis. Moreover, the H. F. virus is durably glycerol-resistant, is filterable through Berkefeld candles, and behaves immunologically as do the usual strains of herpes and of encephalitis virus. On the basis of the experimental data presented, we conclude that any distinction made regarding, on the one hand, encephalitogenic power as a special property of a virus secured from cases of epidemic encephalitis, and, on the other hand, of ectotropic action as an equally special quality of a virus yielded by febrile herpes, is in its nature artificial and not in harmony with ascertained fact. What can, indeed, be distinguished are stronger and weaker strains of a virus) probably always herpetic in origin, as determined by the inoculation of rabbits. While a strong herpes virus is both <b>dermatotropic</b> and neurotropic, a weak virus tends, in its multiplication, to remain confined to the site of inoculation, to act chiefly on the tissues on which it is immediately implanted, and not to extend to distant parts. And this is equally true whether the strain of virus came originally from cases of epidemic encephalitis, or merely from cases of febrile herpes in man. Hence direct comparison cannot be made between the stronger encephalitogenic and weaker non-encephalitogenic strains, according to any specific etiological property. The viruses we are discussing do, indeed, compose one group but it is the group of febrile herpes with which epidemic encephalitis is associated accidentally, if at all. It happens, indeed, that the Levaditi strain (souche) C and the Doerr Basel strain, both supposedly originating in cases of encephalitis in man, are less encephalitogenic for the rabbit than the true herpes strains, H. F. and Goodpasture M...|$|E
