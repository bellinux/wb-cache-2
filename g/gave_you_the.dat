500|$|Lawrence Gordon Clark {{had made}} his name as a BBC {{documentary}} director during the 1960s. The Stalls of Barchester was the first dramatic production he directed. Clark recalled in an interview for the BFI's DVD release in 2012 that [...] "the BBC at that time <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> space to fail, and generously so too. They backed you up with marvellous technicians, art departments, film departments and so forth." ...|$|E
500|$|Universal {{initially}} projected a $600,000 budget, {{but added}} an additional $175,000 once producer Francis Ford Coppola signed on. This {{would allow the}} studio to advertise American Graffiti as [...] "from the Man who <b>Gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>The</b> Godfather (1972)". However, Lucas was forced to concede final cut privilege. The proposition also gave Universal first look deals on Lucas's next two planned projects, Star Wars (1977) and Radioland Murders (1994). As he continued {{to work on the}} script, Lucas encountered difficulties on the Steve and Laurie storyline. Lucas, Katz and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.|$|E
500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

500|$|One {{poster for}} the film {{included}} the statement: [...] "Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> wonder of King Kong, now brings you his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E
500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> opportunities to do things that would really be memorable, if you could sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E

500|$|Gore {{himself would}} later {{poke fun at}} the controversy. In 2000, while on the Late Show with David Letterman he read Letterman's Top 10 List (which for this show was called, [...] "Top Ten Rejected Gore – Lieberman Campaign Slogans") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: [...] "Remember, America, I <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> Internet, and I can take it away!" [...] In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award [...] "for three decades of {{contributions}} to the Internet" [...] at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): [...] "Please don't recount this vote." [...] He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: [...] "We all invented the Internet." [...] Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: [...] "It is time to reinvent the Internet {{for all of us}} to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reception from critics. In the Blender magazine {{review of}} the album, critic Andy Greenwald, wrote: [...] "The title track , bursting with buzzing distortion, builds into a satisfying anti-glitz rant." [...] Tom Beajour of Entertainment Weekly reported that the song [...] "crams all of the genre's essential tropes — distorted power chords, abrupt dynamic shifts, and singsong melodies — into {{three and a half}} minutes of radio-friendly fire." [...] Chris Saunders of MusicOMH noted that the song is laden with [...] "memorable hooks, quiet/loud dynamics and emotive lyrics which will no doubt cut through to many a disenchanted youth: 'They <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> end but not the where to start / not how to build, how to tear it apart.'" [...] Saunders concluded that the song [...] "is as lively and rousing as most of their best tracks." [...] Sputnikmusic wrote: [...] "The adventure is only on the second track [...] and the guys of Yellowcard are just getting started. This is by far the best tune on the album." [...] Bart Gottula of The Clarion wrote: [...] "The album's single and title cut, 'Light's and Sounds', follows with an amazing performance by every band member. The song provides a quick, hard-hitting beat that brings back Yellowcard's hybrid punk and emo music that the band explored in its previous single, 'Way Away'." ...|$|E

In {{the next year}} he {{supported}} an Australian tour by Roberta Flack. He released a succession of singles on the label and followed in August 1976 with a third album, Man of the 20th Century. For that album he used session musicians including Russell Dunlop on drums; Wayne Findlay on keyboards; Jim Kelly, Kirk Lorange, Mark Punch, and Rory O'Donoghue on guitars; and Tim Partridge on bass guitar. Later that year he toured Europe and appeared on a TV special broadcast into France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland. His single, [...] "Grab the Money and Run", appeared on the Irish charts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, Davis {{was awarded}} the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year award.

At {{the end of the}} 1970s, he moved to Casablanca Records, which was best known at the time for its successes with disco star Donna Summer and rock'n'roll band Kiss. His first success for the company in 1980 was the novelty song [...] "It's Hard To Be Humble", a light-hearted look at how {{popularity}} and good looks could go to one's head. The song became his first Country music top 10 and a rare top 30 hit in the UK. (It was translated into Dutch as [...] "Het is moeilijk bescheiden te blijven" [...] and became a hit for the Dutch singer Peter Blanker in 1981). Later that year, he also had another top 10 song with [...] "Let's Keep It That Way". In November, [...] "Rock'n'Roll (I <b>Gave</b> <b>You</b> <b>The</b> Best Years Of My Life)" [...] was played by KHJ in Los Angeles as its last song before it switched from Top 40 to Country music.

2500|$|In 1911, Cavafy wrote [...] "Ithaca", {{inspired}} by the Homeric return journey of Odysseus to his home island, as depicted in the Odyssey.

To Homer, and to the Greeks in general, not the island, {{but the idea of}} Ithaca is important. Life is also a journey, and everyone has to face difficulties like Odysseus, when he returned from Troy.
