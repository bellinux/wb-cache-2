For example, an intelligence GCTA estimate of 0.31, based on an <b>intelligence</b> <b>measurement</b> with test-retest reliability , would after correction (...) , be a true estimate of ~0.48, indicating that common SNPs alone explain half of variance.

The research study focus on {{a small group of}} 15 subjects submitted to electric encephalograms, previously chosen from a larger group of 77 classmates on the basis of scores on the WISC-III IQ Test. The results suggest continuous predominance of Alpha waves for the gifted group (higher frequency percentile and higher amplitude) what was not observed in the group without any superior intellectual ability. Even taking into account methodological limitations, this study may contribute to the understanding of a relationship between the intellectual quotient (IQ) and alpha waves frequency and amplitude, as observed during performance on cognitive tasks.

40|$|AbstractEmotional Intelligence {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{as one of}} the dominant factors contributing to superior educational and professional performance. Previous research has determined the contribution of Emotional Intelligence and some factors that influence Emotional Intelligence. Researchers have introduced measurement tools for Emotional Intelligence. Those that have been accepted internationally; Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale (MSCEIT) of Mayer, Caruso, and Salovey (2000); Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i) of Bar-on (2002); and Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI- 360) of Goleman, Boyatzis and HayGroup (1999). These models are generally accepted but constructed for Western empirical setting and written in the English language. Moon (2011) suggest that EI cannot be fully or meaningfully understood without consideration of people's cultural values and beliefs due to the existence of cross-cultural differences in EI. Instead of adopting a standard for Emotional Intelligence according to a western approach, it is important to develop an innovative Emotional <b>Intelligence</b> <b>measurement</b> tool according to the context of Indonesia because Indonesia is a multi-cultural country in South East Asia with too strong different characteristic when compared with Western nations. Wang (2009) argues that Eastern and Western cultures have numerous differences because Eastern and Western people live in different environment and are educated in distinctively different way. As a result, the characteristics of each culture are shown in its people behaviour, their attitude toward life and love, and their personalities (Wang, 2009). This research is done by innovatively analyse the current research on Emotional Intelligence in Indonesia and further research recommendation on innovative Emotional <b>Intelligence</b> <b>measurement</b> for Indonesia context. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to learn about and to compile some research on Emotional Intelligence specific to Indonesia's context and its impact on determining success. The various research components such as literature review, exploratory research and descriptive research have been implemented. Self Assessment Questionnaires were designed for Indonesian Business School graduates (undergraduates and master program), leaders of multi-sectors companies, and government employees. At the end, structured equation modelling was utilized to create a path model. The findings indicate that in Indonesia, Emotional Intelligence and Competencies have an important role in determining success and influencing performance.

50|$|Cattell’s {{research}} on individual differences {{played a significant}} role in introducing and emphasizing the experimental technique and importance of methodology in experimentation in America. Regarding the beginnings of his mental tests, in Leipzig, Cattell independently began to measure “simple mental processes” Between 1883 and 1886, Cattell published nine articles discussing human reaction time rates and individual differences. As professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Cattell administered a battery of ten tests to student volunteers, and for the first time introduced the term “mental tests” as a general term for his set of tests which included measures of sensation, using weights to determine just-noticeable differences, reaction time, human memory span, and rate of movement. When Cattell moved to Columbia University, the battery of tests became compulsory for all freshmen. Cattell believed that his mental tests were measuring intelligence; however, in 1901 Clark Wissler, a student of Cattell, demonstrated that there was no statistical relationship between scores on Cattell's tests and academic performance. The tests were finally rendered irrelevant with the development of Alfred Binet’s <b>intelligence</b> <b>measurements.</b>|$|R

The results show that reading ability is better predicted by fixation duration and fixation count measurements of eye movements for 8 - 9 old children, whereas verbal ability in general does not predict reading ability. The better link with level of reading is provided by measurements of eye movements, but not so accurately reflected by verbal ability in appropriate age group, when the acquisition of reading ability still continues. No relationships among children‘s fluid intelligence, reading ability and measurements of eye movements were reported...|$|R
