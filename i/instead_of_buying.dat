5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of wheelchair spaces, the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and general improvement of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the air-conditioning system on some trains. The company chose this option <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E

5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the real}} impetuses for United States {{entering}} the Industrial Revolution was {{the passage of the}} Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812 (1812–14) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) which cut off supplies of new and cheaper Industrial revolution products from Britain. The lack of access to these goods all provided a strong incentive to learn how to develop the industries and to make their own goods <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> simply <b>buying</b> the goods produced by Britain.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} {{method of}} waste management is {{the prevention of}} waste material being created, also known as waste reduction. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> new, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material {{to achieve the same}} purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).|$|E

5000|$|A {{variant of}} the pump and dump scam, the [...] "short and distort" [...] works in the {{opposite}} manner. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> first <b>buying</b> the stock, and then artificially raising its price before selling, in a [...] "short and distort" [...] the scammer first short-sells the stock, and then artificially lowers the price, using the same techniques as the pump and dump but using criticism or negative predictions regarding the stock. The scammer then covers their short position when they buy back the stock at a lower price. This tactic is commonly used by institutions and brokers to dupe individual traders in the Korean stock market, as only institutional traders are allowed to shortsell stocks.|$|R
25|$|As a whole, a {{functional}} organization is best suited {{as a producer}} of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in {{a functional}} structure, which makes producing {{a limited amount of}} products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost. For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> them.|$|E
25|$|Emerson Radio and Phonograph paid $6 {{million to}} {{purchase}} the consumer products division of DuMont Laboratories in 1958. With this acquisition, a higher-priced line of television sets, phonographs and high-fidelity and stereo instruments, along with the DuMont trademark was added to Emerson's products. However, by this time, the US television market was saturated, and many customers who were in need of another set were waiting for color television <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> a replacement.

25|$|In August 1995, the Secretary of the Navy {{authorized}} the Marine Corps to upgrade its utility and attack helicopters {{as a bridge}} until the Joint Replacement Aircraft was available in 2020. In 1996, the Marine Corps launched the H-1 upgrade program by signing a contract with Bell for upgrading 180 AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs and upgrading 100 UH-1Ns into UH-1Ys. While the original contract called for upgrading existing airframes, it was later modified in 2008 to manufacture completely new aircraft. The program also includes aircraft simulators. Richard Aboulafia, {{an analyst at the}} Teal Group, suggests that the motivation to upgrade the H-1s <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> new Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters was to avoid risk to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey program.|$|E

40|$|Africa’s {{urban poor}} {{increasingly}} represent a key constituency for electoral mobilization. Opposition parties, which are pivotal for democratic consolida-tion, have nevertheless exhibited disparate success at obtaining votes from this constituency. To explain why, this study {{focuses on the}} case of Zambia and draws on interviews with political elites as well as a survey of informal sec-tor workers in Lusaka. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> vote <b>buying,</b> ethnic alignments, or economic voting, these data show that the urban poor’s voting decisions are related to the strategies used by political parties to incorporate them into the political arena. Opposition parties that employ populist strategies are more likely to win support from the urban poor than parties reliant on alternative modes of mobilization. The advantages of a populist strategy include greater differ-entiation from the myriad of purely personalistic parties in Africa and greater congruence with the policy priorities of the urban poor, including service delivery and jobs...|$|R
25|$|Adolf Miethe {{designed}} a high-quality, sequential-exposure color camera, which was manufactured by Bermpohl and became available commercially in 1903. Prokudin-Gorsky published {{an illustration of}} it in Fotograf-Liubitel in 1906. The most common model used a single oblong plate 9cm wide by 24cm high, the same format as Prokudin-Gorsky's surviving negatives, and it photographed the images in unconventional blue-green-red sequence, {{which is also a}} characteristic of Prokudin-Gorsky's negatives if the usual upside-down image in a camera and gravity-compliant downward shiftings of his plates are assumed. An inventor as well as a photographer, Prokudin-Gorsky patented an optical system for cameras of the simultaneous-exposure type, and it is often claimed or implied that he invented, or at least built, the camera used for his Russian Empire project. No definite written or photographic documentation of his field equipment is known to exist, only the evidence inherent in the photographs themselves, and no rationale has been suggested for going to the trouble and expense of building a functionally identical copy of a Miethe-Bermpohl camera <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> simply <b>buying</b> one.|$|R
