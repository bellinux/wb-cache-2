40|$|With the {{technological}} developments and rapid changes in demand pattern, diverse varieties of <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> are entering {{into the market}} with reduced lifecycle {{which leads to the}} environmental problems. The awareness of <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> take-back and recovery has been increasing in <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> supply chains. In this paper, we build a system dynamics model for <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> closed-loop supply chain distribution network with the old-for-new policy and three <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> recovery ways, namely, <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> remanufacturing, <b>electronic</b> component reuse and remanufacturing, and electronic raw material recovery. In the simulation study, we investigate the significance of various factors including the old-for-new policy, collection and remanufacturing, their interactions and the type of their impact on bullwhip, and profitability through sensitivity analysis. Our results instruct that the old-for-new policy and three <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> recovery ways can reduce the bullwhip effect in the retailers and the distributors and increases the profitability in the closed-loop supply chain distribution network...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} extend {{ecological}} footprint analysis (EFA) to <b>electronic</b> <b>products,</b> new methods {{had to be}} developed which associate the world average bioproductive space per capita and year- the fair Earth share- with an individual product. The problem analysed in this thesis {{is the need for}} an environmental assessment tool for <b>electronic</b> <b>products,</b> which uses natural capital accounting. This need arose because so far, <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> were mainly assessed using life cycle analysis with a focus on toxicity. Since the ecological footprint (EF) is a sustainability indicator, the sustainability discussion and in particular its relevance and implications with regard to the EF is reviewed. The <b>electronic</b> <b>products</b> assessed in this thesis are a personal computer (PC) in an exploratory study, and three mobile phones (two main case studies and one updated case study).

25|$|A primary RFID {{security}} {{concern is}} the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised {{with respect to the}} United States Department of Defense's recent adoption of RFID tags for supply chain management. More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed <b>electronic</b> <b>product</b> code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to skimming and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>Electronic</b> <b>Product</b> Code (EPC) is {{one common}} type of data stored in a tag. When written into the tag by an RFID printer, the tag {{contains}} a 96-bit string of data. [...] The first eight bits are a header which identifies the version of the protocol. The next 28 bits identify the organization that manages {{the data for this}} tag; the organization number is assigned by the EPCGlobal consortium. The next 24 bits are an object class, identifying the kind of product; the last 36 bits are a unique serial number for a particular tag. These last two fields are set by the organization that issued the tag. Rather like a URL, the total <b>electronic</b> <b>product</b> code number {{can be used as a}} key into a global database to uniquely identify a particular product.|$|E
2500|$|Tags {{may either}} be read-only, having a factory-assigned serial number {{that is used}} as a key into a database, or may be read/write, where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user.

Products are rated Gold, Silver, or Bronze, depending on how many optional criteria they meet. On 2007-01-24, President George W.

Apple {{states that}} 100% of its U.S. {{operations}} run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy. However, the facilities {{are connected to}} the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use. The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Product</b> Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times, the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573million gallons in 2015.|$|E
