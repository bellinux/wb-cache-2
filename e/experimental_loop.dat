40|$|The {{inherently}} nonlinear {{phenomenon of}} hysteresis is notoriously difficult to model. Of notable interest are the inverse models of hysteresis which identify {{the parameters of}} a particular model to closely match experimental data. Two major models of hysteresis are the Preisach and Bouc-Wen models. As researchers typically deal with solely one model for their analyses, this thesis initially develops techniques to convert from the Bouc-Wen model to the Preisach model, using first a least squares fit followed by using artificial neural networks. The parameters {{of each of the}} two models are investigated in further detail, with emphasis on how each parameter affects the loop and how to arrive at an adequate initial estimate for the identification problem algorithms. The techniques are then evaluated and compared against several sets of experimental data for hysteresis loops supplied by the Air Force Research Lab. Their optimized solutions are compared to assess the flexibility and viability of each model. Generally, it is found that, while both models are successful, the Preisach model is more flexible in fitting different types of <b>experimental</b> <b>loops.</b> Lastly, both <b>experimental</b> <b>loops</b> and theoretical loops subjected to white noise are identified using Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) algorithms via the Preisach model.

The Neutron Scattering Facility will be utilized for advanced fields of Material and Life science using high intensity neutron generated by the spallation reaction of a 1 MW pulsed proton beam and mercury target. Design of the spallation mercury target system aims to obtain high neutron performance with high reliability and safety. Since the target system is using mercury as the target material and contains large amount of radioactive spallation products, it is necessary to estimate reliability for strength of instruments in a mercury flow system during lifetime of the facility. Piping and components in the mercury flow system would be damaged by erosion with mercury flow, since these components will be weak by thickness decreasing. This report presents experimental results of wall thickness change by erosion using a mercury <b>experimental</b> <b>loop.</b> In the experiments, an erosion test section and coupons were installed in the mercury <b>experimental</b> <b>loop,</b> and their wall thickness was measured with an ultra sonic thickness gage after every 1000 hours. As a result, under 0. 7 m/s of mercury velocity condition which is slightly higher than the practical velocity in mercury pipelines, the erosion is about 3 mu m in 1000 hours. The wall thickness decrease during facility lifetime of 30 years is estimated to be less than 0. 5 mm. According to the experimental result, it is confirmed that the effect of erosion on component strength is extremely small. Moreover, a measurement of residual mercury on the piping surface was carried out. As a result, 19 g/m sup 2 was obtained as the residual mercury for the piping surface. According to this result, estimated amount of residual mer...|$|E
