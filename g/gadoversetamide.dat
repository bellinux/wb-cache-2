50|$|Most {{patients}} with NSF have undergone hemodialysis for kidney failure, some have never undergone dialysis {{and others have}} received only peritoneal dialysis. Many people with NSF have taken immunosuppressive medications and have other diseases, such as hepatitis C. Four of the seven gadolinium contrast agents approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have been principally implicated in NSF, including gadodiamide, gadopentetate, and <b>gadoversetamide.</b> Gadobenate has also been associated with NSF, but further {{research has shown that}} gadobenate diglumine might be safe even in patients undergoing dialysis.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare total left {{ventricular}} mass assessment using steady state free preces-sion (SSFP) and inversion recovery fast gradient echo (IR GRE) imaging and further {{to assess the}} influence of contrast dosage on mass by IR GRE and its implications on relative infarct size assessment with both methods. Methods: Forty-three patients with first documented my-ocardial infarction and single vessel disease underwent measurement of total myocardial mass using SSFP technique and an IR GRE sequence. As part of a Phase 2 multi-center dose rang-ing study for infarct identification patients received 1 of 4 possible dosages (0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2 or 0. 3 mmol/kg body weight) of the contrast agent <b>gadoversetamide</b> (OptiMARK, Tyco Healthcare Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, MO, USA). Results: Left ventricular mass assessment using IR GRE resulted in a slightly greater detection of myocardial mass than from the SSFP images (160. 1 and 156. 4 g, respectively, p < 0. 001). The overall good correlation of both methods (R 2 = 0. 97 for the total study group, p < 0. 001) was further improved by using <b>gadoversetamide</b> at doses of 0. 2 or 0. 3 mmol/kg (R 2 = 0. 99, p < 0. 001), mainly {{as a result of}} a considerably higher blood-myocardial contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the IR GRE images.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the ability of}} different types of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to stimulate fibroblast proliferation in monolayer cell culture. Materials and Methods: The National Health Service West Glasgow Ethics Committee granted approval for this study. Fibroblasts established from healthy volunteers (control subjects) and from lesional skin of patients with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis were exposed to a range of concentrations of ionic and nonionic linear and macrocyclic contrast agents over 4 days, and the effect on growth was determined. The lowest concentration of contrast agent that stimulated the maximum effect on fibroblast growth was selected for determination of its effect on fibroblast growth over 8 days. The effect of contrast agents on hyaluronan and collagen synthesis was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Responses were assessed with analysis of variance (general linear model). Results: The linear gadolinium contrast agents (gadodiamide, <b>gadoversetamide,</b> gadopentetate dimeglumine, and gadobenate dimeglumine) produced a maximum stimulation of fibroblast proliferation at a concentration of 0. 1 mmol/L, with cell numbers increasing up to 2. 3 -fold. The macrocyclic contrast agents (gadoteric acid and gadoteridol) produced a maximum stimulation of fibroblast proliferation at a concentration of 5 mmol/L. The reference gadolinium agents (N-methylglucamine gadolinium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and gadolinium trichloride) stimulated fibroblast proliferation at a concentration of 0. 01 mmol/L and were toxic at a concentration greater than 1 mmol/L. Growth curves supported the dose-response observations. Hyaluronan synthesis was stimulated by <b>gadoversetamide,</b> gadobenate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, and gadopentetate dimeglumine at a concentration of 0. 1 mmol/L and by gadolinium trichloride at a concentration of 0. 01 mmol/L, whereas collagen synthesis was unaffected. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that different classes of gadolinium chelates stimulate human fibroblast proliferation...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Breastfeeding is a well-recognised {{investment}} in {{the health of the}} mother-infant dyad. Nevertheless, many professionals still advise breastfeeding mothers to temporarily discontinue breastfeeding after contrast media imaging. Therefore, we performed this review to provide health professionals with basic knowledge and skills for appropriate use of contrast media. Methods A joint working group of the Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM), Italian Society of Paediatrics (SIP), Italian Society of Neonatology (SIN) and Task Force on Breastfeeding, Ministry of Health, Italy prepared a review of the relevant medical literature on the safety profile of contrast media for the nursing infant/child. Results Breastfeeding is safe for the nursing infant of any post-conceptional age after administration of the majority of radiological contrast media to the mother; only gadoliniumbased agents considered at high risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, <b>gadoversetamide)</b> should be avoided in the breastfeeding woman as a precaution; {{there is no need to}} temporarily discontinue breastfeeding or to express and discard breast milk following the administration of contrast media assessed as compatible with breastfeeding...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common type of arrhythmia. Left atrial abnormalities in AF require further investigation. Aim: To evaluate characteristics of myocardial structure of the left atrium by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with delayed contrast enhancement in patients with AF associated with essential hypertension (EH), in those without any cardiovascular disorders, and in patients with AF after cryoablation of the pulmonary artery orifice. Materials and methods: The study enrolled 53 patients with AF (mean age 56 years). Twenty eight of them had AF without any associated cardiovascular disorders (lone AF, or LAF group), 25 patients had AF related to EH (AF + EH group). Three patients had undergone anti-arrhythmic intervention. Cardiac MRI was performed in all patients with high resolution late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at 15 – 20 min after i. v. <b>gadoversetamide</b> (0. 15 mmol/kg). For LGE MRI, we used a novel high resolution inversion recovery (inversion times 290 – 340 ms) magnetic resonance pulse sequence with isotropic voxel (size 1. 25. 1. 25. 2. 5 mm) and fat saturation. Left atrium walls were segmented semi-automatically on the LGE images. Left atrium fibrosis quantification was performed with the original software LGE Heart Analyzer, developed in Russian Cardiology Research and Production Complex (Moscow). Results: Left atrium fibrosis (mean, 9 [1. 7; 18] %) was found both in patients with AF + EH and with lone AF. There was a trend towards more significant left atrial fibrosis in the group of AF + EH, compared to that in the lone AF group (10. 972 [6. 98; 19. 366] % vs 4. 37 [0. 893; 18. 575] %, respectively, p = 0. 1). The extent of left atrium fibrosis correlated with left atrium dilatation (r = 0. 37, p < 0. 001) and with the decreased ejection fraction (r = - 0. 4, р < 0. 001). The patients who had undergone an antiarrhythmic intervention, demonstrated formation of intensive LGE zones in the ablation areas. Conclusion: Quantification of atrial myocardial fibrosis by high resolution LGE MRI in AF patients is feasible with the use of the original software LGE Heart Analyzer.  </p...|$|E
30|$|A {{decrease}} in {{the total number of}} CE-MRA studies was observed in 2007 / 08, reducing from 580 to 509 studies (a 12.2  % drop). This was largely due to the large relative reduction in renal studies in this period, demonstrated in Fig.  5, attributable to the initial reporting in May 2006 of an association between the use of GBCAs and the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF is a serious disorder characterised by hardening and thickening of the skin and body tissues. Initially described as ‘scleromyxoedema-like skin thickening’ affecting the limbs and trunk [18], it was solely seen in dialysis patients and was first titled nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy [19], subsequently renamed nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Reviews noted the universal setting of renal failure but not the cause [20 – 22]. Prior to this there had been no concerns regarding the use of GBCA in haemodialysis patients, with prompt excretory rates at haemodialysis following GBCA administration and initial research suggesting GBCAs in the doses usually employed had an excellent safety profile and were less nephrotoxic than iodinated contrast [5, 23]. This led to widespread use of CE-MRA in patients with impaired renal function where examinations employing iodine-based contrast media engender significant risk. In 2006, GBCAs were first proposed as a potential factor in the development of NSF [5], and research indicated an association with the recent use of GBCAs, particularly in high dose on a background of chronic dialysis-dependent renal failure (or less commonly acute renal failure) [24]. Further evidence was the discovery of traces of gadolinium in tissue biopsies from affected patients [25, 26]. A United States Food and Drug Administration warning regarding the use of GBCAs was released in June 2006 [27]. Currently, the linear chelate compounds (gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadodiamide and <b>gadoversetamide)</b> are contra-indicated in those patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30  ml/min and avoiding GBCA use with other compounds is recommended unless absolutely clinically necessary and then with minimum dose. This has led to a change in clinical practise in order to identify those at risk such as those with diabetes, hypertension or on nephrotoxic medication in whom knowledge of GFR is important prior to decision making on imaging mode [28]. Recent reviews indicate that the risk of NSF can be eliminated by careful management of risk factors, with up to a ten-fold risk reduction by elimination of just one risk factor [29]. This reduction in the applicability of CE-MRA has spurred the development of newer non-enhanced MRA techniques, such as arterial spin labelling for aortic or renal imaging, as well as ECG-gated 3 D partial-Fourier fast spin echo sequences in the evaluation of peripheral arterial disease [30, 31] for those patients with end-stage renal disease.|$|E
