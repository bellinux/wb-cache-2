40|$|It {{is widely}} {{suggested}} in the literature that words are based on words, roots, or stems, but not on phrases (the "No Phrase" Constraint). In Modern Georgian, constructions such as megobar-ta-gan-i '[one, some] of the friends' are common; they appear to violate the "No Phrase" Constraint because gan 'from' is traditionally considered a postposition. In this example, -i, the marker of the nominative case, serves as both inflectional and derivational morphology, deriving a substantive, apparently from the postpositional phrase. The paper demonstrates that the construction at issue originated in <b>double</b> <b>case</b> marking. Old Georgia had case marking of this sort, in which case markers occurred not only on head nouns, but also at the right edges of phrases. The same phenomenon was found with postpositional phrases inside an NP, and it is proposed here that although Modern Georgian does not have <b>double</b> <b>case</b> marking, it is {{the origin of the}} modern construction discussed here...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine a}} supply chain in which the final product {{consists}} of components made by a buyer and a supplier. In the single moral-hazard case, the buyer's quality is observable, whereas in the <b>double</b> moral-hazard <b>case,</b> the buyer's quality is not observable. The supplier's quality is not observable in both the single and <b>double</b> moral-hazard <b>cases.</b> In each case, we examine a warranty/penalty contract between the buyer and the supplier based on information from incoming inspection and external failures. When the warranty contract is based on information from external failures in the single moral-hazard case, the first-best quality is achieved, whereas in the <b>double</b> moral-hazard <b>case,</b> the first-best quality is achieved if the supplier is not {{held responsible for the}} buyer's defects. When the warranty contract is based on information from incoming inspection, the first-best is achieved in both the single and <b>double</b> moral-hazard <b>cases,</b> even when the incoming inspection does not identify all of the supplier's defectives. An analysis of whether the penalty on the supplier in each case meets a fairness criterion [...] -that is, the penalty does not exceed the manufacturer's external failure cost [...] -indicates that the fairness criterion is met by the warranty contract based on information from incoming inspection when the first-best incoming inspection is sufficiently high. However, if the first-best incoming inspection is low and the precision of pinpointing the supplier's responsibility for external failure is sufficiently high, the warranty contract based on external failures could satisfy the fairness criterion. incentives, supply chain, moral hazard, warranty, fairness criterion, legal constraint, quality management...|$|R
