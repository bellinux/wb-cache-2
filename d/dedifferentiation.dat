5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of <b>dedifferentiation</b> by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} are {{frequently}} used in various medical therapies (e.g., bone marrow transplantation). Stem cells can now be artificially grown and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through somatic cell nuclear transfer or <b>dedifferentiation</b> have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies. Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s.|$|E

"Strategies {{include the}} {{rearrangement}} of pre-existing tissue, {{the use of}} adult somatic stem cells and the <b>dedifferentiation</b> and/or transdifferentiation of cells, {{and more than one}} mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal. All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form." [...] During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of cell as they differentiate into different tissues.

This {{should not be confused with}} the [...] transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dedifferentiation,</b> or {{integration}} is a cellular process {{often seen in}} more basal life forms such as worms and amphibians in which a partially or terminally differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stage, usually {{as part of a}} regenerative process. <b>Dedifferentiation</b> also occurs in plants. Cells in cell culture can lose properties they originally had, such as protein expression, or change shape. This process is also termed <b>dedifferentiation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Deletion of {{a single}} {{transcription}} factor enables mature B cells to transform into T cells via <b>dedifferentiation</b> and redifferentiation. Technologies that can control cell fate include strategies to induce pluripotent stem cell formation and using small molecules to induce stem cells to differentiate into specific cell types. <b>Dedifferentiation</b> {{could be used to}} turn autoimmune cells into inactive progenitors or to suppress rejection of transplanted organs.|$|E
50|$|Reversine, or 2-(4-morpholinoanilino)-6-cyclohexylaminopurine, {{is a small}} {{molecule}} {{developed by}} the group of Peter G. Schultz, used for stem cell <b>dedifferentiation.</b>|$|E
50|$|A small {{molecule}} dubbed reversine, a purine analog, {{has been}} discovered that has proven to induce <b>dedifferentiation</b> in myotubes. These dedifferentiated cells could then redifferentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes.|$|E
50|$|It is {{currently}} unclear {{as to whether}} cancer stem cells arise from adult stem cell transformation, a maturation arrest of progenitor cells, or {{as a result of}} <b>dedifferentiation</b> of mature cells.|$|E
5000|$|Such loss of {{structural}} differentiation is especially seen in most, but not all, malignant neoplasms. Sometimes, the term also includes an increased capacity for multiplication. Lack of differentiation {{is considered a}} hallmark of aggressive malignancies (for example, it differentiates leiomyosarcomas from leiomyomas). The term anaplasia literally means [...] "to form backward". It implies <b>dedifferentiation,</b> or loss {{of structural}} and functional differentiation of normal cells. It is now known, however, {{that at least some}} cancers arise from stem cells in tissues; in these tumors failure of differentiation, rather than <b>dedifferentiation</b> of specialized cells, account for undifferentiated tumors.|$|E
50|$|IL-4 {{also has}} been shown to drive mitogenesis, <b>dedifferentiation,</b> and {{metastasis}} in rhabdomyosarcoma. IL-4, along with other Th2 cytokines, is involved in the airway inflammation observed in the lungs of patients with allergic asthma.|$|E
50|$|Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) {{is a form}} of thyroid cancer {{which has}} a very poor {{prognosis}} due to its aggressive behavior and resistance to cancer treatments. Its anaplastic cells have poor differentiation, including <b>dedifferentiation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some believe <b>dedifferentiation</b> is an {{aberration}} {{of the normal}} development cycle that results in cancer, whereas others {{believe it to be}} a natural part of the immune response lost by humans at some point as a result of evolution.|$|E
50|$|Prognosis is {{good for}} acinic cell {{carcinoma}} of the parotid gland, with five-year survival rates approaching is 90%, and 20-year survival exceeding 50%. Patients with acinic cell carcinomas with high grade transformation (sometimes also called <b>dedifferentiation)</b> have significantly worse survival.|$|E
50|$|Specialized tissues {{in culture}} are {{urgently}} needed in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, biomaterial research and advanced toxicity testing of newly developed pharmaceuticals. However, {{it is often}} observed that raised tissues do not exhibit expected functional features. Instead <b>dedifferentiation</b> is observed 1-4. These cell biological alterations arise after isolation of cells and proceed during static culture in a dish due to suboptimal fluid environment and minor adhesion on biomaterials. Further uncontrolled supply with nutrition and respiratory gas, an overshoot of metabolites and paracrine factors or missing rheological stress can increase the degree of <b>dedifferentiation.</b> In consequence, regarding an optimal generation of specialized tissues a powerful strategy has to exclude {{as much as possible}} harmful parameters, while factors supporting the process of tissue development must be intensified 5.|$|E

50|$|The ectopic {{transcription}} factors {{turn off}} the host repertoire of gene expression {{in each of the}} cells. However, the alternate desired repertoire is being turned on only in a subpopulation of predisposed cells. Despite the massive <b>dedifferentiation</b> - lineage tracing approach indeed demonstrates that transdifferentiation originates in adult cells.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,4 D {{has been}} used in {{laboratories}} for plant research as a supplement in plant cell culture media such as MS medium since at least 1962. 2,4-D is used in plant cell cultures as a <b>dedifferentiation</b> (callus induction) hormone. It is classified as an auxin plant hormone derivative.|$|E
50|$|The tumor-induced stromal change {{hypothesis}} {{claims that}} tumor cells can dedifferentiate into fibroblasts and, themselves, secrete more collagen. This {{was observed in}} desmoplastic melanoma, in which the tumor cells are phenotypically fibroblastic and positively express genes associated with ECM production. However, benign desmoplasias do not exhibit <b>dedifferentiation</b> of tumor cells.|$|E
5000|$|For Margaret Mahler and her colleagues, {{autism is}} {{a defense of}} {{children}} who cannot experience the mother as the living primary-object. According to them, autism is an attempt at <b>dedifferentiation</b> and deanimation. The symbiotic autistic syndrome {{used to be called}} the [...] "Mahler syndrome" [...] because Mahler first described it: The child is unable to differentiate from the mother.|$|E

50|$|Analysis by RNA-Seq pinpointed {{a series}} of {{differentially}} expressed genes, involved in cytokine and hormone signaling and cell division-related processes. Further analyses pointed to a possible <b>dedifferentiation</b> process and suggested {{that most of the}} transcriptomic dysregulations might be mediated by a limited set of transcription factors perturbed by AKT1 activation.These results incriminate somatic mutations of AKT1 as major probably driver events in the pathogenesis of JGCTs.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, <b>dedifferentiation</b> of {{progenitor}} cells {{induced by}} ACA-dependent signaling pathway leads to ACA-induced pluripotent stem cells, capable of differentiating in vitro into cells {{of all three}} germ layers.The study of lectins' ability to maintain a culture of pluripotent human stem cells {{has led to the}} discovery of lectin Erythrina crista-galli (ECA), which can serve as a simple and highly effective matrix for the cultivation of human pluripotent stem cells.|$|E
50|$|Induced {{stem cells}} (iSC) are stem cells derived from somatic, reproductive, {{pluripotent}} or other cell types by deliberate epigenetic reprogramming. They {{are classified as}} either totipotent (iTC), pluripotent (iPSC) or progenitor (multipotent—iMSC, also called an induced multipotent progenitor cell—iMPC) or unipotent—(iUSC) according to their developmental potential and degree of <b>dedifferentiation.</b> Progenitors are obtained by so-called direct reprogramming or directed differentiation and are also called induced somatic stem cells.|$|E
50|$|Estep {{has been}} openly {{critical}} of SENS and of Aubrey de Grey for alleged misrepresentation of scientific evidence, and {{he suggests that}} the SENS plan does not {{address some of the}} most challenging aspects of aging including unrepaired DNA damage, noncancerous mutation and epimutation of the nuclear genome, and drift of cell and tissue-specific chromatin states. This latter damage type is generally considered a primary cause of cellular <b>dedifferentiation</b> and transdifferentiation, which degrade organismal function.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{injury to}} the retina, {{it has been shown}} in {{zebrafish}} that Müller glia undergo <b>dedifferentiation</b> into multipotent progenitor cells. The progenitor cell can then divide and differentiate into a number of retinal cell types, including photoreceptor cells, that may have been damaged during injury. Additionally, further research has shown that Müller glia act as light collectors in the mammalian eye, analogous to the fiber optic plate, funneling light to the rod and cone photoreceptors.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, callus {{undergoes}} <b>dedifferentiation</b> as differentiated cells acquire {{ability to}} differentiate; but genetic variation is inevitable {{in the process}} because the cells consist of somatic undifferentiated cells from an adult subject plant. Unlike true stem cells, callus is heterogeneous. Due to this reason, continuous and stable cell division of callus is difficult. Hence plant stem cell originated from cambium is an immortal cell while callus is a temporary dediffertiated cell obtained from stimulating the somatic cell.|$|E

50|$|Neurogenin 3 (NGN3) is {{expressed}} by 2-10% of acinar and duct {{cells in the}} histologically normal adult human pancreas. NGN3+ cells isolated from cultured exocrine tissue by coexpressed cell surface glycoprotein CD133 have a transcriptome consistent with exocrine <b>dedifferentiation,</b> a phenotype that resembles endocrine progenitor cells during development, and a capacity for endocrine differentiation in vitro. Human and rodent exocrine cells have been reprogrammed into cells with an islet cell-like phenotype following direct expression of NGN3 or manipulation that leads to its expression.|$|E
50|$|In humans, the NKX3-1 gene {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 8p21.2 with 4 exons. The 8p chromosome is a region that is frequently reported to undergo a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) associated with tissue <b>dedifferentiation</b> and loss of androgen responsiveness during the progression of prostate cancer. LOH {{has been reported to}} be observed in 12-89% of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and 35-86% of prostatic adenocarcinomas. The frequency of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 8p is seen to increase with advanced prostate cancer grade and stage.|$|E

50|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer in American men and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. Prostate cancer predominantly occurs in the peripheral zone of the human prostate, with fewer than 10% of cases found in the central zone. The disease develops {{as a result of}} the temporal and spatial loss of the basal epithelial compartment as well as increased proliferation and <b>dedifferentiation</b> of the luminal (secretory) epithelial cells. Prostate cancer is typically found in men of ages older than 60 and its incidence increases with increasing age.|$|E
50|$|Another way of {{reprogramming}} is {{the simulation}} {{of the processes}} that occur during amphibian limb regeneration. In urodele amphibians, an early step in limb regeneration is skeletal muscle fiber <b>dedifferentiation</b> into a cellulate that proliferates into limb tissue. However, sequential small molecule treatment of the muscle fiber with myoseverin, reversine (the aurora B kinase inhibitor) and some other chemicals: BIO (glycogen synthase-3 kinase inhibitor), lysophosphatidic acid (pleiotropic activator of G-protein-coupled receptors), SB203580 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor), or SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) causes the formation of new muscle cell types {{as well as other}} cell types such as precursors to fat, bone and nervous system cells.|$|E
50|$|Anaplasia or de{{differentiation}}: loss of {{differentiation of}} cells {{and of their}} orientation {{to one another and}} blood vessels, a characteristic of anaplastic tumor tissue. Anaplastic cells have lost total control of their normal functions and many have deteriorated cell structures. Anaplastic cells often have abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and many are multinucleated. Additionally, the nuclei of anaplastic cells are usually unnaturally shaped or oversized. Cells can become anaplastic in two ways: neoplastic tumor cells can dedifferentiate to become anaplasias (the <b>dedifferentiation</b> causes the cells to lose all of their normal structure/function), or cancer stem cells can increase their capacity to multiply (i.e., uncontrollable growth due to failure of differentiation).|$|E
5000|$|Callus, or dedifferentiated cells, are {{somatic cells}} that undergo <b>dedifferentiation</b> to {{give rise to}} {{totipotent}} embryogenic cells, which temporarily gains the ability to proliferate and/or regenerate an embryo. Since embryogenic cells were considered totipotent cells based {{on their ability to}} regenerate or develop into an embryo under given conditions, dedifferentiated cells were generally regarded as stem cells of plant: [...] "…we propose to extend the concept of stem cells to include embryogenic stem cells that arise from plant somatic cells. We examine the cellular, physiological and molecular similarities and differences between plant meristematic stem cells and embryogenic stem cells originating directly from single somatic cells." ...|$|E
