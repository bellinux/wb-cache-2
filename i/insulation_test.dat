40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{describes}} {{an evaluation of}} the mechanical properties and sound insulation effects of composites made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and carbon-black using the design of experiment (DOE) approach. The solution blending process and method are presented. The effect of the acetone content in ABS during the drying process was studied by conducting tensile tests of injection-molded specimens. ABS was dissolved in acetone, and carbon-black was dispersed in the ABS/acetone mixture with varying conditions according to the orthogonal array table used to reduce similar experiments. The tensile specimens were produced by injection molding in each of the DOE cases, and the elastic modulus and maximum tensile strength of ABS/carbon-black composites were eval-uated with a tensile test to determine the main effects of those factors. A sound <b>insulation</b> <b>test</b> was conducted with a modified impedance tube by using the DOE orthogonal array table, and a correlation between carbon-black and the sound insu-lation was revealed by a main effect analysis.

40|$|Much {{focus has}} been {{recently}} placed on improving the energy efficiency of buildings through improved insulation in order to lower both energy consumption and carbon emissions worldwide. A new type of building insulation, smart insulation, shows great potential for lowering the heating and cooling energy usage of buildings by turning off the insulation whenever certain outside environmental conditions exist {{where it would be}} beneficial to remove the insulation. The specific type of smart insulation proposed is a thermal semiconductor that can be actuated to switch between a thermal conductor and a thermal insulator depending on the temperature gradient across the insulation. After careful examination of many different potential concepts thermal semiconductors, two main concepts involving contacting/non-contacting aluminum fins which allow or break a thermal conduction path and an inflatable honeycomb-like structure were chosen for fabrication and testing. Within these two main concepts, several different designs were developed and tested using an <b>insulation</b> <b>test</b> chamber constructed to reproduce the conditions the smart insulation prototypes would encounter in an real-world building setting. Once the experiment testing was completed, the different smart insulation devices were compared against each other and to a benchmark <b>insulation</b> <b>test</b> piece composed of conventional building insulation to evaluate their performance. Finally, a theoretical, finite element model was formulated for the testing of one of simplest smart insulation prototypes to better understand the results of the experimental testing and to examine other designs for smart insulation that were not experimentally tested...|$|E
40|$|Presented in {{the paper}} are results of water treeing tests on theinsulation of unaged, {{cross-linked}} polyethylene cable which has been thermally preoxidized to levels typical of those measured in field aged cable insulations {{after several years of}} service. The tests showed that moderate levels of oxidation present in the insulation prior to voltage aging have no significant effect on initiation and growth of vented water trees. However preoxidized specimens grew fewer and shorter bow-tie trees than non-preoxidized specimens. <b>Insulation</b> <b>tested</b> at a lower electric stress exhibited larger retention of the initial breakdown strength after aging than the <b>insulation</b> <b>tested</b> at a higher stress even though the lengths of the water trees were comparable for both insulations. For all preoxidation conditions water treeing caused some depletion of the antioxidant from the insulation. Non-preoxidized specimens did not show any excess of oxidation with time of electrical aging even after development of very heavy treeing. However preoxidized samples did show increasing oxidation inside water treed regions as compared with electrically unaged specimens. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

On-board cable in {{the subway}} is an essential competent in the whole power system for the electric transmission, power allocation and signal control.
