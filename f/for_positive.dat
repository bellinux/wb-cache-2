There are two sets of continuo parts from 1726: one is a score transposed <b>for</b> <b>positive</b> organ with figuration added by Bach {{in the first three}} movements; the other has annotations by the copyist for violoncello and double bass.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds <b>for</b> <b>positive</b> identification. The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E

5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (<b>for</b> <b>positive</b> n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated. If for some i all maps are null homotopic, then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence <b>for</b> <b>positive</b> cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} was in power, press {{secretary}} Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co-ordinate government communication and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers. Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's press officer, was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former's attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives; this continued until his resignation in 1999. Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations {{to ensure that a}} clear message was presented, and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction. Campbell used his own experience in journalism; he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of sound bites. Campbell developed a relationship with News International, providing their newspapers with early information in return <b>for</b> <b>positive</b> media coverage.|$|E

5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need <b>for</b> <b>positive</b> pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E
