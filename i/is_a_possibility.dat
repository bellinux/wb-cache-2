5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, {{it is also possible that}} they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E

5|$|In February 2017, James Mangold {{stated that}} with the {{introduction}} of Laura / X-23 in Logan, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that the character will appear in future films. Later that month, Kinberg said that a film for Laura Kinney / X-23 is in development. By October of the same year, it was announced that script is being co-written by Craig Kyle and James Mangold; creator of the character, and director of The Wolverine and Logan, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> {{that he or she}} may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal {{plaintiff}} in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing {{on the part of the}} individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E

5|$|Winch {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch {{may also be}} used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of {{the shape of the}} field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> for which pilots are trained.|$|E
5|$|A single {{reference}} in {{the tomb of}} Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. Unfortunately for this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility,</b> since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.|$|E
5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E

5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility.</b> Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in the}} length of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward over the Pacific Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, when it began a turn to the east. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that the depression completed a small loop between the downgrade and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1995, the band {{underwent}} changes on the business side. Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company. Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager, a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company, to be the band's new creative manager. As with Max Norman before him, Prager {{would go on to}} be highly influential in shaping the direction of the band. In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner, Mustaine revealed that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that Megadeth are going to perform the album in its entirety in 2014, honoring the 20-year anniversary of the record's release.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} 2015 to 2020, Avinor {{plans to build}} a new control tower and a new fire- and rescue station. The former is located too close to the runway while the latter is too small and out of date. There are also plans to expand the {{terminal}} building to allow the simultaneous handling of two large and two small aircraft. Finnmark County Municipality is considering establishing a fast ferry service between Kirkenes and Vadsø which would have a service time of 45 minutes. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of marketing Kirkenes as an alternative airport for Murmansk as Kirkenes can offer cheaper flights to Oslo than what is available from Murmansk to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E

5|$|Penda's brother Eowa {{was also}} said by the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae {{to have been}} a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The {{question}} of what sort of relationship of power existed between the brothers before the battle is a matter of speculation. Eowa may have simply been a sub-king under Penda and {{it is also possible that}} Penda and Eowa ruled jointly during the 630s and early 640s: joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively. That Penda ruled the southern part <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda's death, his son Peada was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of judicial {{members on the}} Council may also pose additional problems. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of conflict of interest for judges who sit {{as members of the}} Council if they find themselves having to review the very Acts of Parliament that they have either endorsed or rejected previously. This is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} Council, in examining the legitimacy of Bills, plays a quasi-judicial role. There may be confusion as regards the legality of a piece of legislation if, for example, it was initially condemned by the Council but enacted by the Government and later endorsed by the courts upon judicial review. When the potential conflict between the Chief Justice's role as head of the judiciary and as Chairman of the Council was raised in 2010 by Githu Muigai, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Tolerance, he was informed that the Chief Justice would recuse himself from any matter in which a conflict arose.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
