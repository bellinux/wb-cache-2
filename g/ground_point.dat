40|$|An {{important}} step for processing airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data is point cloud filtering. Points striking on vegetation and man-made objects and low points (points {{significantly lower than}} neighboring points) are filtered out, leaving <b>ground</b> <b>points</b> for generation of digital terrain models (DTM). A variety of filter algorithms have been developed, which have disparate performance in different landscape and environment. This study investigates the potential of integrating the results of different filter algorithms for improving the ground surface extraction from the LiDAR point cloud. A simple procedure was proposed based on a statistical approach to identify and remove filtering errors and combine <b>ground</b> <b>points</b> from each filtering result. The procedure was tested in an area with rugged terrain covered by dense vegetation of variable heights.

40|$|Most commercially {{available}} nanoelectrospray ionization (NSI) sources possess well-defined electrical ground {{points in the}} mobile phase flow path. Inclusion of a <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> eliminates possible safety hazards involving source high voltage. Most home-built sources, however, lack a specifically defined ground point; the <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> often resides in injection valves, auto-samplers, or chromatographic pumps. Poorly placed ground-points affect analytical performance because high-voltage (HV) source current flows to this point. HV for on-line NSI is commonly provided through an electrode contacting the mobile phase upstream from the emitter. Current flow between HV supply, <b>ground</b> <b>point,</b> and nanoelectrospray plume (e. g., the current that flows from emitter to inlet) engenders the functional equivalent of a voltage-divider circuit. Relative impedance between the <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> and HV supply, and the impedance between the HV supply and NSI plume, determines effective spray voltage at the emitter tip. If relative impedance to the <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> is too low, effective voltage at the emitter sinks below the HV supply, affecting plume stability or even preventing spray formation; this obstacle is amplified in gradient elution because mobile phase surface tension changes during the analysis. Periodic or chaotic spray drop-out is a typical result. Plume formation and stability with gradient elution will be investigated using zero-dead-volume, optically clear, platinum electrode assemblies for HV and ground connections. Figure 1 shows a 150 μm platinum wire for HV contact at the junction between 75 and 50 μm ID fused-silica tubing. HV contact is made through a 150 μm platinum wire.
