I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E

Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E

I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E

It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E

Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy.

In an interview with journalist Gloria Steinem during the 1968 US presidential campaign, soon-to-be First Lady Pat Nixon exposed the generational chasm in worldview between Steinem, 20 years her junior, and herself after Steinem probed Mrs. Nixon as to her youth, role models, and lifestyle. A hardscrabble child of the Great Depression, Pat Nixon told Steinem, [...] "I never had time to think about things like that, who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas.

5000|$|In November 2015, in an {{interview}} with Billboard, he spoke about the album, saying: [...] "You know, this album is, I feel like, most definitely gonna be a Rozay on a higher, intellectual level, just discussing a different array of things. When you listen to records like [...] "Foreclosure," [...] that's like me sitting in a room by myself just rapping about things that's running across my mind and things that have been bothering me.

I'm a muthafucka that flies six million miles a year and just to halt one day, out of the blue, for three weeks? It's just, [...] "Woah." [...] There's a lot of shit that I wrote and a lot of shit that I thought about. I came back out and scrapped a lot of music and I recorded some dope songs, but my first day home I recorded six records. So that's why I was able to put out the Black Dollar record and have been releasing a slew of freestyles, just feeding the fans and everybody that's been asking for that Rozay music." ...|$|R
6000|$|We talked {{pictures}} steadily till it {{was time}} to dress for dinner. At least, they did. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> sort of <b>sat</b> around.

It was the first time I had had a chance of breaking into the conversation with any effect, and I meant {{to make the most of}} it. The paper was in the pocket of my overcoat in the hall.

Father was quite furious; but in my heart I believe I sympathized with Miss Elizabeth.

60|$|I sat {{upon the}} box of the first wagon, eating my food, which {{consisted}} of some biltong and biscuit, for I had not bothered to shoot any game that day, which was very hot, and wondering whether Zikali were still alive, also whether I should take the trouble to walk up the kloof and find out. On the whole I thought that I would not, as the place repelled me, and I did not particularly wish to hear any more of his prophecies and fierce, ill-omened talk.

5000|$|Vic Cardinali {{from music}} site Play It on Repeat {{said of the}} song, [...] "It's a feel good, bright, upbeat dance pop song about being happy about what you've got in life ...

[...] Ellen Wapstra from V Music wrote, [...] "Okay, {{if you need a}} pick-me-up this should do it. A great little tune about chilling out and enjoying life." [...] Music site auspOp said the song was as [...] "bright as sunshine". David Lim, a music journalist and announcer on radio station Joy 94.9 wrote, [...] "It's feel good, sun-soaked and universally appealing in a way that you'd expect for an artist of his brand and following to be. Sonically, it's very pleasing to hear him stick to a more Bruno Mars-style pop. The warmer musical textures compliments Guy's voice like you won't believe ... 'Don't Worry Be Happy' is not here to snatch wigs, alter pop music trends, or fanfare a bold new direction for Guy. The concept really is as simple as the message behind the song - just a basic reminder to celebrate the simple things in life." ...|$|R

It was a moonlight night, and about one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.|$|E

I was reflecting on the foolhardiness of the average girl and remembering some other instances of the kind, when she came into view walking down the steep curve of the road. She had Mrs Fyne's walking-stick and was escorted by the Fyne dog. Her dead-white face struck me with astonishment, so that I forgot to raise my hat. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> and stared.
