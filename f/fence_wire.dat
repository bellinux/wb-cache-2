Arnold has a background as a float sculptor for the Indianapolis 500 Festival Parade. In 1983 he began creating wreaths and baskets from grapevines, which he sold at wholesale to local flower shops. He began his work with barbed wire and <b>fence</b> <b>wire</b> when he saw rolls of wire laying in a field at a four-way stop.

2500|$|Japanese bombings, {{destruction}} by retreating American troops, deprivations by bandit [...] "guerrilla" [...] bands, and hoarding by civilians {{had significantly}} reduced available war supplies, {{as well as}} those items necessary to run an effective government. Fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped Americans and resisting Filipinos to create many supplies from scratch. For example, tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles, batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba, soda bottles and <b>fence</b> <b>wire</b> were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications, curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for [...]30 caliber rifles, steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles, money was printed in both English and the local language using wooden blocks, and fisherman towed Japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder. Soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes. Then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel.|$|E

40|$|Detecting {{regions of}} change while {{reducing}} unimportant changes in multiple outdoor {{images of the}} same scene containing <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> (i. e., a chain-link mesh fence) acquired by a mobile camera from slightly different viewing positions, angles and at different times {{is a very difficult}} problem. Regions of change include appearing of new objects and/or disappearing of old objects behind <b>fence</b> <b>wires,</b> breaches in the integrity of <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> and attached objects in front of <b>fence</b> <b>wires.</b> Unimportant changes are mainly caused by camera movement, considerable background clutter, illumination variation, tiny sizes of <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> and non-uniform illumination that occurs across <b>fence</b> <b>wires.</b> There are several issues that arise from these kinds of multiple outdoor images. The issues are: (1) parallax (the apparent displacement of an object as seen from two different positions that are not on a line with the object) among objects in the scene, (2) changing in size of same objects as a result of camera movement in forward or backward direction, (3) background clutter of outdoor scenes, (4) thinness of <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> and (5) significant illumination variation that occurs in outdoor scenes and across <b>fence</b> <b>wires.</b> In this dissertation, an automated change detection method is proposed for these kinds of multiple outdoor images. The change detection method is composed of two distinct modules, which are a module for detecting object presence and/or absence behind <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> and another module for detecting breaches in the integrity of <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> and/or attached objects in front of <b>fence</b> <b>wires.</b> The first module consist of five main steps: (1) automated image registration, (2) confidence map image production by the Zitnick and Kanade algorithm, (3) occlusion map image generation, (4) significant or unimportant changes decision by the first hybrid decision-making system and (5) false positives reduction by the template subtraction approach. The second module integrates: (1) the Sobel edge detector combined with an adaptive thresholding technique in extracting edges of <b>fence</b> <b>wires,</b> (2) an area-based measuring in separating small and big objects based on their average areas determined once in the calibration process and (3) the second hybrid decision-making system in classifying objects as significant or unimportant changes. Experimental results demonstrate that the change detection method can identify and indicate approximate locations and possible percentages of significant changes whilst reducing unimportant changes in these kinds of multiple outdoor images. The study has utilized occluded regions in a confidence map image produced by the Zitnick and Kanade algorithm as potential significant changes in the image change detection research. Moreover, the study proves that the use of the Sobel edge detector combined with an adaptive thresholding technique is applicable in extracting edges of outdoor <b>fence</b> <b>wires.</b> In the future, the method could be integrated into patrol robots in order to provide assistance to human guards in protecting outdoor perimeter security.

60|$|Outside stood some timbers {{which had}} once formed part of a shack, and a few strands of <b>fence</b> <b>wire,</b> {{trailing}} from tottering posts, ran into the grass. The place {{appeared to have been}} a farm, whose owner had, no doubt, abandoned it after finding the soil too light, or after losing a crop by frost; but George was more curious to discover if there were any other homesteads in the vicinity. His view was restricted, {{but there was no sign}} of life on the quarter-circle it commanded. A flat, grassy waste, broken only by a few clumps of brush, ran back to the horizon, and by the cold blue of the sky and the drift of a few light clouds floating before the prevalent westerly wind, he knew he was looking north. This was the way he must take if he could escape, but there was no house in which he could seek refuge, and scarcely any cover. It was clear that he must obtain a good start before he was missed. He had an idea that he would escape, though he admitted that it was more optimistic than rational.|$|E
60|$|As it happened, George had {{received}} {{only a few}} bruises in the bluff, and, after realizing {{that there was no}} chance of escape for the present, he lay still {{in the bottom of the}} wagon. He blamed himself for riding so readily into the trap, since it was obvious that his assailants had known he was going to visit Grant, and had stretched a strand of <b>fence</b> <b>wire</b> or something of the kind across the trail. They would have removed it afterward and there would be nothing left to show what had befallen him. This, however was a matter of minor consequence and he endeavored to determine which way his captors were driving. Judging the nature of the trail by the jolting, he decided that they meant to leave the wood where he entered it, which suggested that they were going south, and this was what he had anticipated. Though he was sore from the effect of his fall and the rough handling which had followed it, he did not think he would suffer any further violence, so long as he made no attempt to get away. The men, no doubt, only intended to prevent his giving evidence, by keeping him a prisoner until after the trial.|$|E

50|$|This {{creates an}} {{electrical}} circuit that is monitored by signaling equipment. In normal operation, the electric current in the <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> causes a relay to energize, {{indicating that the}} fence is intact.

A contact of the relay is typically used to prevent the approaching signal from displaying a proceed aspect if the fence has been broken. Restoring normal operation requires splicing the broken <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> back together.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new automated change detection method for detecting breaches in {{the integrity of}} and attached objects in front of <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> in multiple outdoor images of the same scene containing <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> acquired by a mobile camera from slightly different viewing positions, angles and at different times. To detect significant changes, edges of <b>fence</b> <b>wires</b> firstly have to be extracted from multiple outdoor images {{using a combination of}} the Sobel detector and an adaptive thresholding technique. Secondly, morphological operations such as dilation and erosion are applied into binary images produced by the previous process in enhancing the binary images. Next, an area-based algorithm is applied to enhanced binary images in separating small and big objects based on their average areas determined once in the calibration process. Finally, objects that survive are then fed into a fuzzy inference system in calculating their possibility values. Based on these possibility values, the survived objects can be classified as significant or unimportant changes. Experimental results demonstrate that the method has a high success rate (94. 12 %) in detecting true positives in these kinds of multiple outdoor images.

Spotted bowerbirds are accomplished vocal mimics and have been known to simulate the calls of many birds as well as other sounds. When approached by humans or other potential threats, males at bowers and females at nests often mimic the calls of predatory birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus), pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), australian raven (Corvus coronoides), apostlebird (Struthidea cinerea) and honeyeaters (Meliphagidae spp.) among others.

25|$|Barbed wire {{is a type}} of <b>fencing</b> <b>wire</b> {{constructed}} with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strands. It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls surrounding secured property. It is also a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare. A person or animal trying to pass through or over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury. Barbed <b>wire</b> <b>fencing</b> requires only <b>fence</b> posts, <b>wire,</b> and fixing devices such as staples. On June 25, 1867, Lucien B. Smith of Kent, Ohio, patented barbed wire. Shortly thereafter, several other inventors, such as Joseph F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois, patented inventions for similar products, but Smith patented his first, allowing him to claim that he invented barbed wire.|$|R
