5|$|Another issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> {{inherited}} genetic {{factors in}} shaping attachments: for example {{one type of}} polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor {{has been linked to}} anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} Presidency is {{administrative}} and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising {{the work of the}} Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of COREPER and other committees and working groups. The political element <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence {{in the work of the}} Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for a creator god (Zanahary), the ancestors, and fady (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include joro (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of God or the ancestors), burial in family tombs, the famadihana reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (tsangambato), land (tany masina), and shrines (doany, tony and jiro). Another major element of this tradition <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> ambalavelona, {{believed to be the}} spirits of the ancestors themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka show respect for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to fady.|$|E
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E

25|$|The {{topic of}} the fifth novel, Marx Deceased, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> a writer's earlier bestsellers for the {{assessment}} of a new work - in contrast to the assessment of an anonymous work or one of a formerly unknown author. He plays with this topic also in Bourbaki Gambit.|$|E
25|$|Another area of {{research}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> nicotinic receptors in schizophrenia and smoking. Studies show increased numbers of exposed nicotinic receptors, which could explain the pathology of both smoking and schizophrenia. However, others argue {{that the increase in}} nicotinic receptors is a result of persistent heavy smoking, rather than schizophrenia.|$|E

25|$|Connected {{with many}} of these {{questions}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> women in the sciences (including researchers’ wives and female friends). Djerassi’s plays recognize the special contributions women make as scientists and to science, both directly and indirectly. His female characters are usually depicted as strong and independent, proving a strong impact of feminist thinking on his work.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of affect or emotion {{in the art}} of memory is frequently discussed. The role of emotion in the art can be divided into two major groupings: the first <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> emotion in the process of seating or fixing images in the memory, the second {{is the way in which}} the recollection of a memory image can evoke an emotional response.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{question}} that the mission addresses <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> size and water in determining {{the evolution of the}} planets. Ceres and Vesta are highly suitable bodies with which to address this question, as they are two of the most massive of the protoplanets. Ceres is geologically very primitive and icy, while Vesta is evolved and rocky. Their contrasting characteristics are thought to have resulted from them forming in two different regions of the early Solar System.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{his films}} have {{featured}} corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in The Departed and politicians in Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Guilt is a prominent theme {{in many of}} his films, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Bringing Out the Dead, Mean Streets, Who's That Knocking at My Door, The Departed, Shutter Island). He has been noted for his liberal usage of profanity and violence.|$|E

Melbourne City (known {{at the time as}} Melbourne Heart) came out on top with a 2–1 victory. A {{significant}} narrative in derby history <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> Melbourne Victory as a more successful club {{both on and off the}} field, having joined the A-League five years earlier than City. The rivalry is one of the most intense and well respected in the A-League, producing noticeable atmosphere and some of the largest attendances in the league.|$|E
