40|$|BACKGROUND: Oxygen {{therapy is}} an {{important}} therapeutic resource for patients with hypoxemia. When changing oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> we have observed that sometimes, even with the same oxygen flow setting as before, a different S-pO 2 is obtained. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the precision and accuracy of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> used in hospital settings. METHODS: An experimental study was performed to test oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> from a tertiary hospital, by using a calibrated flow analyzer. Used and new <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> accuracy was tested by reading in the gas analyzer a single measurement at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 91 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and they were compared using the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. <b>Flow</b> <b>meter</b> precision was tested by reading in the flow analyzer 3 repetitive measurements set at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 11 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and the reproducibility of these measurements was conducted by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Friedman test. RESULTS: the mean measured flow rates were slightly lower than the stipulated flow rate at 1 L/min, very close for 3 L/min, and higher for the 5 and 10 L/min flow rates. There was a large variability among the measurements from different <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> mainly at low flow rates (1 and 3 L/min). There {{was no difference between}} new and used <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at the <b>flow</b> rates measured, except at 10 L/min. <b>Flow</b> <b>meters</b> precision analysis showed a good reproducibility in 3 repetitive measurements for each flow rate (minimum 0. 95, maximum 0. 99 intraclass correlations).

40|$|Balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are recent {{additions}} to an established class of simple, rugged <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> that contain no moving parts {{in contact with}} flow and are based on measurement of pressure drops across objects placed in flow paths. These <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are highly accurate, minimally intrusive, easily manufacturable, and reliable. A balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> can be easily mounted in a flow path by bolting it between conventional pipe flanges. A balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{can be used to}} measure the flow of any of a variety of liquids or gases, provided that it has been properly calibrated. Relative to the standard orifice-plate <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> introduces less turbulence and two times less permanent pressure loss and is therefore capable of offering 10 times greater accuracy and repeatability with less dissipation of energy. A secondary benefit of the reduction of turbulence is the reduction of vibration and up to 15 times less acoustic noise generation. Both the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and the standard orifice-plate <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> are basically disks that contain holes and are instrumented with pressure transducers on their upstream and downstream faces. The most obvious difference between them is that the standard orifice plate contains a single, central hole while the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> contains multiple holes. The term 'balanced' signifies that in designing the meter, the sizes and locations of the holes are determined in an optimization procedure that involves balancing of numerous factors, including volumetric flow, mass flow, dynamic pressure, kinetic energy, all in an effort to minimize such undesired effects as turbulence, pressure loss, dissipation of kinetic energy, and non-repeatability and nonlinearity of response over the anticipated range of flow conditions. Due to proper balancing of these factors, recent testing demonstrated that the balanced flow-meter performance was similar to a Venturi tube in both accuracy and pressure recovery, but featured reduced cost and pipe-length requirements...|$|R

The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> tested were all ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> of sing-around type. The selection of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> contains in total seven meters of three different brands. All <b>meters</b> have a <b>flow</b> range from 0. 015 m 3 /h to 1. 5 m 3 /h. These meters are commonly used in heat meters in small district heating subscriber stations. The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are presented without identification. All tests were performed in a <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> calibration facility and in a flow range including the minimum and maximum flow of each <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> In the tests three different water tempera-tures and three different installations were investigated. Water temperatures of 20 Â°C, 50 Â°C and 70 Â°C were used. These temperatures are representative for district heating applications. The installations tested involved <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> mounted with long straight pipes both up-and down-stream representing ideal conditions, a single elbow and a double elbow out of plane both generating disturbed flow profiles. All set-ups are in accordance with the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> specifications. The results demonstrate that both the change in temperature and the disturbed flow profiles introduce errors in the flow measurements. The change from 20 Â°C to 50 Â°C and 70 Â°C can cause a shift in meter performance larger than the specified maximum permissible error. Compared with the ideal installation the installations generating disturbed flow profiles cause errors up to more than 2 %. The errors due to temperature and installation effects have a bias to add when combined. This might lead to even larger errors.

40|$|The U. S.

The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> had experienced various inconsistencies that had not been resolved prior to July 1993. Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, Washington, evaluated the operation of 10 out of 79 steam and compressed air <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at PWCSD. The evaluation was limited to analysis of historical information and review of existing operating procedures. On-site investigation of the <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> was limited to external observations of the flow-sensing equipment and a check of the flow computer program. PNL did not remove installed sensing equipment (i. e., <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> or temperature or pressure sensors) to evaluate existing condition or check calibration. Although many of the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> errors can be traced to improperly normalized readings and to meters improperly compensated for temperature and pressure, lack of regular maintenance, including proper calibration, was evidenced throughout this study. A strict calibration schedule should be established for all steam and air <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> including calibration of the temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and flow turbine. It is recommended that the most crucial <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> (such as the 10 evaluated in this study) be calibrated yearly.
