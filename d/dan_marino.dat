Against the Tennessee Titans, he went over 4,000 yards passing for the 11th time in a season, and tied <b>Dan</b> <b>Marino</b> with his 63rd regular season game with 300+ yards passing. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. The Colts ended up winning the AFC South for the seventh time in eight years, and Manning became the first quarterback in NFL history to lead his team to nine consecutive postseason berths (2002–2010). It was the 208th consecutive regular season start of his career, breaking Gene Upshaw's record. For the season, Manning finished with an NFL record 450 completions on 679 attempts (third most in history), and a career-high 4,700 yards passing.

5|$|Tittle was {{the fourth}} player to throw seven {{touchdown}} passes in a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by <b>Dan</b> <b>Marino</b> in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record.|$|E

When his record was broken by Eric Dickerson in 1984, Dickerson placed second in voting behind quarterback <b>Dan</b> <b>Marino,</b> who that year {{was the first to}} pass for 5,000 yards in a season. Marino's 5,084 yards stood as the record for 27 years before being broken by Drew Brees in 2011, who won that season's award.

5|$|He was {{the referee}} {{for the game}} between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, played December 17, 2006, that {{included}} Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre becoming the all-time leader for pass completions among quarterbacks in the NFL. Favre was unaware that his 4,968 pass completions were a record until he was informed during the game by Hochuli. Hochuli was the referee again for another Favre record-breaking moment when Favre threw his 421st touchdown pass of his career on September 30, 2007 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota to break the record previously held by <b>Dan</b> <b>Marino.</b> He also reffed the Week 17 game in 2008 in which the Lions became the first, and as of today, the only team in the NFL to finish 0–16.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006 season, Favre {{suffered}} {{his first}} career shutout against the Chicago Bears. Later in the season, the New England Patriots {{shut out the}} Packers in a game where he was injured before halftime and could not complete the game.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Patriots, Zolak was signed to a one-year {{contract}} by the New York Jets. With Vinny Testaverde considered the starter, Zolak was competing against Ray Lucas for a backup job. He was the second-string quarterback as training camp began, but his competition increased when the Jets signed Rick Mirer and left three quarterbacks to battle for two open spots on the team. Two days after acquiring Mirer from the Green Bay Packers, the Jets released Zolak. In October, Zolak was signed to a one-year deal by the Miami Dolphins {{to serve as the}} backup quarterback behind Damon Huard and Jim Druckenmiller. He was later made the backup behind Huard, and made his only appearance of the season on November 21, failing to complete a pass in four attempts against the Patriots. As the 1999 season wrapped up, the Dolphins signed Zolak to a contract extension, keeping him on the team for another year. Despite the retirement of <b>Dan</b> <b>Marino,</b> the Dolphins cut Zolak in May 2000. Zolak trained for the Detroit Lions during the summer after they lost Mike Tomczak for the season, but instead he signed on as a host for Patriots Gameday alongside Bob Lobel in August, ending his professional football career.|$|E
5|$|In all, Hutson caught 488 {{passes for}} 7,991 yards and 99 touchdowns.

He scored at least six receiving touchdowns {{in each of his}} eleven seasons. Hutson led the NFL in receptions eight times, including five consecutive times: 1941 to 1945. He led the NFL in receiving yards seven times, including four straight times: 1941 to 1944. He led the NFL in scoring five times: 1941 to 1945. As of 2016, Hutson still holds the highest career average touchdowns per game for a receiver, at 0.85. Hutson's single season record of 17 touchdown receptions in 1942 stood for 42 years until broken by receiver Mark Clayton in 1984, a year in which Miami's quarterback <b>Dan</b> <b>Marino</b> had more completions (362) than the entire 1942 Packers team's pass attempts (330). His four receiving touchdowns in a game has been surpassed three times and tied several times, but his four in a single quarter has yet to be matched. His record 99 touchdown receptions stood for 44 years, well into the modern era. In his eleven-year professional career, Hutson never missed a game due to injury. He invented many pass routes still in use today, including the chair route.|$|E
5|$|Needing a win {{to clinch}} the 5th {{seed in the}} playoffs, Manning had {{one of his best}} career {{performances}} in Jacksonville on Thursday Night Football.

Manning and the Colts tied an NFL record by winning three games in a season in which they trailed by at least 14 points. For his efforts Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in 2008.
