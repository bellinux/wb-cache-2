25|$|The {{confined}} {{gender roles}} for females allow {{the strength of}} characters such as Grace and Blanche to remain hidden. They're manipulation, sneaking, and hiding from the law is only successful because they are women. Both are believed by the other characters in the novel to be too submissive, shallow, and dim-witted {{to get away with}} their goals. Blanche soon discovers that she can unravel more of Grace and Everett's treacherous plot to inherit Mumsfield's money because she <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> whereas Nate, as a man, is working outside. The biggest twist, that Grace is the mass murderer and plotter of cheating her family out of their fortune, exposes the sexist notions that the readers themselves have rooted into their culture. Throughout the plot, Everett seems to be the most likely suspect to the murders and manipulation of the will, all the while making it easier for Grace to get away with mass murdering anyone in her path. Even though, the heroine and the villain of this novel evoke different emotions from the readers, there is a larger feminist theme in play that is made possible by taking advantage of the cloak of invisibility that society has placed over women.|$|E
500|$|In Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen opera cycle, {{the tree}} appears as Barnstock, when the hero Siegmund, {{with a great}} tug, pulls from it a sword that he names Nothung. The tree however <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Hunding, who {{takes the place of}} Siggeir as husband of Sieglinde and enemy of Siegmund. Barnstokkr has been theorized as English author and philologist J. R. R. Tolkien's {{immediate}} source for a scene in his 1954 work The Lord of the Rings depicting the fictional character of Frodo Baggins and his acceptance of the weapon Sting after it has been thrust [...] "deep into a wooden beam". Some of the structures described in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings have been described as [...] "recalling" [...] the position and placement of Barnstokkr in Völsunga saga, which Tolkien was well familiar with.|$|E
500|$|When Margaret returns home, {{her mother}} has taken {{a turn for the}} worse. [...] Margaret's brother arrives {{just in time to see}} his mother on her deathbed. [...] While Frederick <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> Thornton comes to visit his friend Mr. Hale, but he cannot be allowed in, in case he sees Fred. [...] Thornton interprets this as Margaret refusing to see him. [...] The family's servant, Miss Dixon (Pauline Quirke), sees a former member of Frederick's crew in Milton town, and it is decided that Frederick must leave at once, before he is {{discovered}} and arrested. He and Margaret are seen together at the railway station by Thornton, who thinks Margaret has a lover. Fred's friend in Milton spies him and Margaret at the station, and in the brief scuffle Fred pushes him down the stairs. It is later revealed that he died in hospital. Margaret denies to the police that she was at the station, in order to protect Fred, but Thornton, who is the magistrate and saw her there, is morally tested, but ultimately calls off the impending inquiry for the sake of Margaret.|$|E

500|$|The {{first record}} of {{a house on the}} site is in a {{manuscript}} folio dated 1465, but that house was demolished when construction of the present building began during the life of Piers LeghVII, {{in the middle of the}} 16thcentury. This house, by an unknown designer, was L-shaped in plan with east and north ranges; piecemeal additions were made to it during the 17thcentury. In the 1720s Giacomo Leoni, an architect from Venice, added a south range to the house creating a courtyard plan, and made other changes. While he retained some of its Elizabethan features, many of his changes were in a mixture of Palladian and Baroque styles. During the latter part of the 18thcentury Piers LeghXIII bought most of the furniture which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> today. However, the family fortunes declined and the house began to deteriorate. In the early 19thcentury the estate was owned by Thomas Legh, who commissioned Lewis Wyatt to restore the house between 1816 and 1822. Wyatt's alterations were mainly to the interior, where he remodelled every room. Leoni had intended to add a cupola to the south range but this never materialised. Instead, Wyatt added a tower-like structure (a hamper) to provide bedrooms for the servants. He also added a one-storey block to the east range, containing a dining-room. Later in the century William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, added stables and other buildings to the estate, and created the Dutch Garden. [...] Further alterations were made to the gardens by Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton and his wife during the early 20thcentury. [...] In 1946 Richard Legh, 3rdBaron Newton, gave Lyme Park to the National Trust.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{source of}} modern Maltese vocabulary is 52% Italian/Sicilian, 32% Siculo-Arabic, and 6% English, {{with some of}} the remainder being French. Today, most function words are Semitic. In this way, it is similar to English, which is a Germanic language that had large influence from Norman French. As a result of this, Romance language-speakers may easily be able to comprehend more complex ideas expressed in Maltese, such as [...] "Ġeografikament, l-Ewropa hi parti tas-superkontinent ta' l-Ewrasja" [...] (Geographically, Europe is part of the Supercontinent of Eurasia), while not understanding a single word of a simple sentence such as [...] "Ir-raġel qiegħed fid-dar" [...] (The man <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house),</b> which would be easily understood by any Arabic speaker.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> <b>The</b> <b>House</b> Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain <b>was</b> no longer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his <b>House</b> years, on <b>the</b> grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|R

2500|$|The Pesikta Rabbati {{taught that}} Joseph guarded himself against lechery and murder. That he guarded himself against lechery is {{demonstrated}} by the report of him in [...] “But he refused, and said to his master's wife: 'Behold, my master, having me, knows not what <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and he has put all that he has into my hand; he is not greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back any thing from me but you, because you are his wife.

2500|$|Later, Steve relives some {{repressed}} {{memories of}} {{a visit to the}} house with his drunken mother during which a ghostly Ellen Rimbauer appeared to him and called on Steve to aid her in continuing Rose Red's unending construction. Meanwhile, Emery suspects that Annie, not some [...] "spirit of Rose Red", is keeping the house sealed. Nick confirms Emery's suspicions, and then informs the group that Bollinger appeared to have hanged himself in the library. The group begins to speculate that Rose Red has never been in a dormant state, and that the mansion's supernatural powers are linked to Annie and Steve (whose psychic abilities become apparent only when he <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> because of his familial connection to the property). Nick correctly guesses that Joyce brought the psychics to the house in an attempt to reawaken Rose Red rather than simply investigate it.|$|E
2500|$|Elderly, single Cornelia Van Gorder is renting an old, {{isolated}} Long Island mansion {{owned by}} the estate of Courtleigh Fleming, a bank president who had reportedly died several months before. On a stormy evening, the electricity flickers on and off. Most of the servants, convinced that the house is haunted, have made excuses and fled. According to a news report, a mysterious criminal known as [...] "the Bat" [...] has eluded police in the area. Cornelia <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> with her maid, Lizzie, and Billy, a Japanese butler who is part of Fleming's household staff. They are joined by Brooks, a gardener recently hired by Cornelia's niece, Dale Ogden. Dale and Dr. Wells, the local coroner and {{an old friend of}} Fleming's, arrive for a visit. They tell Cornelia that Jack Bailey, a cashier at Fleming's bank, has disappeared and is suspected of stealing over a million dollars. Cornelia tells Lizzie and Dale that she has invited a police detective to visit because someone has been trying to break into the house at night. Wells leaves, and Detective Anderson arrives. Cornelia tells Anderson that she suspects Fleming embezzled from the bank and hid the money in the house. While Cornelia shows Anderson to his room, Dale warns Brooks (who is actually Jack Bailey, and Dale's fiancé) that Anderson is a detective. Brooks also believes that Fleming hid the money, and wants to clear himself by finding it. Dale summons Fleming's nephew, Richard (who rented the house to Cornelia), to learn about possible hiding places. Richard shows her a blueprint of the house, with a hidden room where the money might be. While they fight over the blueprint, a figure appears in the darkness and shoots Richard, ending the first act.|$|E
