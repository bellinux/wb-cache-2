5|$|The twenty days between Braden's {{perfect game}} and Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two perfect games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three perfect games in such short succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's perfect game would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked the only time that three consecutive no-hitters had been perfect games, the only time that three perfect games <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), the only time that three perfect games <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in a span shorter than a month, the only time four perfect games <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game in July 2009), and the only time that four perfect games <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Chemetco {{discharged}} contaminated {{storm water}} {{every time it}} rained on the plant.

25|$|Numerous eruptions <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the Holocene epoch 10,000years ago, when the vast Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated rapidly at the end of the last glacial period.

5|$|If the {{earthquake}} <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> {{during the early}} morning while residents were asleep, rather than mid-afternoon (1:52 pm local time), {{it could have been}} deadlier as housing in the epicentral area consisted chiefly of mud and brick.|$|E
5|$|In 132, Zhang {{introduced}} an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal {{direction of a}} distant earthquake. On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device, until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> about 400km (248mi) to 500km (310mi) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province.|$|E
5|$|St. Helens {{produced}} an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990 at least 21 periods of eruptive activity <b>had</b> <b>occurred.</b> The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.|$|E

5|$|A {{video of}} Franken at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2, 2009, {{engaging}} in a discussion {{with a group of}} Tea Party protesters on health care reform, began circulating on the Internet and soon went viral. The discussion was noted for its civility, in contrast to the explosive character of several other discussions between members of the 111th Congress and their constituents that <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> over the summer.|$|E
5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> near the earthquake's epicenter. Of the five, the first registered a magnitude of 3.7(ML) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by a magnitude 3.9(ML) tremor at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day; however, the strongest and final aftershock registered a magnitude of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E

5|$|During the pre-dawn {{coup and}} {{throughout}} the day, there was little reaction by the public who went about their daily life as though nothing had happened. Many appeared unaware that a coup <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> {{while they were still}} sleeping. There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Hershey was {{eliminated}} from the playoffs by the Providence Bruins despite winning {{the first two games}} in a best-of-five series, marking only the tenth time this <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in league history. Afterward, it was announced that French would not be retained for a fifth season as head coach. The 2012–13 season drew a club-record home attendance average of 10,046, only the fifth time a club's average had surpassed 10,000 in recorded league history.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the {{boundaries}} of the Clause were further defined when Senator William S. Kenyon was allowed to accept an appointment by President Warren G. Harding as circuit judge for the Eighth Circuit. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty concluded that no disqualifying event <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> because the increase in emoluments to that office <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving {{at the time of the}} nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed by the Clinton administration when Representative Bill Richardson was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No rollback was attempted when Senator Hugo Black was appointed to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Levitt, the court rejected, for lack of legal standing, an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections. The movant in the Black case, Albert Levitt, only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.|$|E
5000|$|Determining {{whether a}} {{positive}} or negative violation <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> can be difficult.

Stoke City were making their first appearance in the final. Their previous best was participation in the semi-finals, which <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> three times.|$|E
5|$|Much like <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> at {{the final}} podium {{celebrations}} for the 2009 Tour de France, the wrong national anthem was played for Contador.

The Spanish national anthem {{as it should have}} been played would have been purely instrumental.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of the meeting, co-founder of Rolls-Royce and pioneer aviator Charles Rolls was thrown from his plane, which {{disintegrated}} beneath him.

5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E
5|$|Several {{fires in}} high-oxygen test environments <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> before the Apollo fire. In 1962, USAF Colonel B.

5000|$|A shock {{detector}} [...] or impact monitor [...] is {{a device}} which indicates whether a physical shock or impact <b>has</b> <b>occurred.</b> These usually <b>have</b> a binary output (go/no-go) and are sometimes called shock overload devices.
