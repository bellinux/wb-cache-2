25|$|The {{history of}} the Forcade-Biaix branch is {{complicated}} by the publication of false information concerning its origins in several affluent publications on the topic of nobility in Prussia and Europe. The first known publication of such information was in 1767, about 80 years after immigration in Prussia. The same information was reproduced in various forms in publications {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. One can only speculate <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> was knowingly furnished as false, or if it was the innocent result of confusing names that had been handed down verbally from two earlier generations already deceased. Claims published in the same publications that they held the rank of Marquis were, however, deliberately false.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2014, the Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) {{federal agency}} issued an {{official}} diary offering a monetary reward of $1,500,000 pesos (approximately US$101,931) {{to anyone who}} provides information leading {{to the location of}} the five abductees: Rodolfo Cázares Garza, Manuel Alberto Cázares Garza, Héctor Cázares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio Cázares Solís, and Rubén Luna Mendoza. Another monetary reward of the same amount was offered to anyone who can provide information that can lead to the identity, location, and/or arrest of the people who planned and/or executed the kidnapping. If these stipulations are met, the reward can be given out in a number of ways. The money, which can be issued both in cash or in a bank account, will be rewarded proportionally to the number of people located, and to the utility of the information provided. If two or more people provide useful information to authorities, only the first person will receive the reward. But <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> is provided by two or more people simultaneously, the reward will be distributed proportionally. The information can be provided at the PGR offices in Colonia Guerrero, Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City; through the PGR's public email, or via phone number. The PGR vows that the information provided, as well as the person(s) that provide them, will be strictly reserved and anonymous. The reward information was published in the ad section of several daily newspapers across northeastern Mexico that week.|$|E
