50|$|Many binding {{chemistries}} {{may be used}} {{to adhere}} an enzyme to a surface to varying degrees of success. The most successful covalent binding techniques include binding via glutaraldehyde to amino groups and N-hydroxysuccinide esters. These <b>immobilization</b> <b>techniques</b> occur at ambient temperatures in mild conditions, which have limited potential to modify the structure and function of the enzyme.|$|E
50|$|The ne-waza {{system is}} the newest of the {{official}} competition systems and is similar to Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The ne-waza fight starts in standing position, and the competitors try to gain points with several throwing, take-down and <b>immobilization</b> <b>techniques,</b> sweeps (changing from lower to upper position starting with a guard), or to win the fight ultimately with submission techniques. If no competitor ends the fight with a submission technique, the referee announces the competitor with the most points as winner.|$|E
5000|$|Despite their {{excellent}} catalytic capabilities, enzymes {{and their}} properties must be improved prior to industrial implementation in many cases. Some aspects of enzymes {{that must be}} improved prior to implementation are stability, activity, inhibition by reaction products, and selectivity towards non-natural substrates. This may be accomplished through immobilization of enzymes on a solid material, such as a porous support. [...] Immobilization of enzymes greatly simplifies the recovery process, enhances process control, and reduces operational costs. Many <b>immobilization</b> <b>techniques</b> exist, such as adsorption, covalent binding, affinity, and entrapment. Ideal immobilization processes should not use highly toxic reagents in the immobilization technique to ensure stability of the enzymes. After immobilization is complete, the enzymes are introduced into a reaction vessel for biocatalysis.|$|E
2500|$|The PIT maneuver, or Pursuit Intervention Technique, is a pursuit tactic {{by which}} a {{pursuing}} car can force a fleeing car to abruptly turn sideways, causing the driver to lose control and stop. Other names include pit block, pit stop and blocking. It was developed and named by the Fairfax County Police Department of Virginia, United States. Other interpretations of the [...] acronym [...] "PIT" [...] include pursuit <b>immobilization</b> <b>technique,</b> pursuit intervention <b>technique,</b> precision <b>immobilization</b> <b>technique,</b> push it tough, parallel <b>immobilization</b> <b>technique,</b> and precision intervention tactic. [...] The technique {{is also known as}} tactical car intervention, tactical ramming, legal intervention, and fishtailing. The technique is typically used by law enforcement officers as a safer alternative with which to bring car chases to a conclusion.|$|R

50|$|However, many {{of these}} {{problems}} were resolved in 1998. In that year, {{it was announced that}} researchers had managed to completely oxidize methanol using a series (or “cascade”) of enzymes in a biofuel cell. Previous to this time, the enzyme catalysts had failed to completely oxidize the cell’s fuel, delivering far lower amounts of energy than what was expected given what was known about the energy capacity of the fuel. While methanol is now far less relevant in this field as a fuel, the demonstrated method of using a series of enzymes to completely oxidize the cell’s fuel gave researchers a way forward, and much work is now devoted to using similar methods to achieve complete oxidation of more complicated compounds, such as glucose. In addition, and perhaps what is more important, 1998 was the year in which enzyme “immobilization” was successfully demonstrated, which increased the usable life of the methanol fuel cell from just eight hours to over a week. Immobilization also provided researchers with the ability to put earlier discoveries into practice, in particular the discovery of enzymes {{that can be used to}} directly transfer electrons from the enzyme to the electrode. This process had been understood since the 1980s but depended heavily on placing the enzyme as close to the electrode as possible, which meant that it was unusable until after <b>immobilization</b> <b>techniques</b> were devised. In addition, developers of enzymatic biofuel cells have applied some of the advances in nanotechnology to their designs, including the use of carbon nanotubes to immobilize enzymes directly. Other research has gone into exploiting some of the strengths of the enzymatic design to dramatically miniaturize the fuel cells, a process that must occur if these cells are ever to be used with implantable devices. One research team took advantage of the extreme selectivity of the enzymes to completely remove the barrier between anode and cathode, which is an absolute requirement in fuel cells not of the enzymatic type. This allowed the team to produce a fuel cell that produces 1.1 microwatts operating at over half a volt in a space of just 0.01 cubic millimeters.|$|E

40|$|In several yeast-related industries, {{continuous}} fermentation systems offer important economical advantages {{in comparison with}} traditional systems. Fermentation rates are significantly improved, especially when {{continuous fermentation}} is combined with cell <b>immobilization</b> <b>techniques</b> to increase the yeast concentration in the fermentor. Hence the technique holds a great promise for the efficient production of fermented beverages, such as beer, wine and cider as well as bio-ethanol. However, there are some important pitfalls, and few industrial-scale continuous systems have been implemented. Here, we first review the various cell <b>immobilization</b> <b>techniques</b> and reactor setups. Then, the impact of immobilization on cell physiology and fermentation performance is discussed.
