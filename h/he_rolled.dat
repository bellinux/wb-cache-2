5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

He did not drop a single set in the entire tournament. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> past world No. 8 Tomáš Berdych in the semifinal (6–1, 6–0) and world No. 6 David Ferrer in the final (6–2, 6–2) for his fourth title of the year, and his last tour level match to date.|$|E
500|$|Erin McWhirter of The Daily Telegraph called George's {{character}} [...] "outrageous" [...] {{in response}} to the appendectomy. Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall was critical of the character, saying <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> his eyes in regard to her letting the interns perform procedures on her, sarcastically writing: [...] "Ooooh, she's damaged! And sexy! She takes off her top and then eagerly cuts herself for the other interns! That's hot!" [...] TV Guide Erin Lulevitch referred to her as a [...] "masochist" [...] due to her self-incision.|$|E

However, he had forgotten that Coventry striker Dion Dublin was still behind him, and Dublin quickly took advantage of the situation by rolling the ball into the empty net. The coincidence of the goalscorer's name quickly led to the popular word game among football fans that Given [...] "is the only Irishman who doesn't know where Dublin is" [...] and the goal itself is still regularly featured on lists compiled of bizarre goals.|$|E

500|$|Fletcher made {{economic}} development a priority, and Kentucky ranked fourth among all U.S. states {{in number of}} jobs created during his administration. One of his first actions as governor was to reorganize the executive branch, condensing the number of cabinet positions from fourteen to nine. He dissolved the former Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and instead created the Kentucky Horse Racing Authority to promote and regulate the state's horse racing industry. To improve the state's management of Medicaid, <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> {{back some of the}} program's requirements and unveiled a plan to focus on improvements in care, benefit management, and technology. Fletcher also launched [...] "Get Healthy Kentucky!," [...] an initiative to promote healthier lifestyles for Kentuckians.|$|E

He missed three weeks of spring training, and began the season on the disabled list. Washington said: [...] "We miss his presence. We miss his threat. We miss what he brings on the defensive end. We miss his leadership." [...] He made his initial 2010 appearance on April 30, after having missed the first 20 games of the season.|$|E
500|$|After some time, Jenner {{joined the}} Royal Navy, but deserted in New York City, United States. He soon joined the United States Navy. Jenner's {{daughter}} stated {{in an interview}} after his death that {{he learned how to}} gamble during this time and he soon developed the impulse control disorder of problem gambling. He became particularly attached to the game craps, which was popular in the United States at the time. He started to keep a rabbit's foot in the left upper pocket of his shirt, and would rub it with his left hand while <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> the dice with his right. His shipmates therefore began calling him [...] "Bones", a nickname that he retained {{for the rest of his}} navy career.|$|E

500|$|Kippax was an [...] "impeccably {{correct and}} elegant batsman, [...] an upright, easy stance at the wicket; like his schoolboy idol Victor Trumper, <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> his sleeves between wrist and elbow and excelled {{with the late}} cut", who was {{probably}} at his peak during the 1920s. His omission from the 1926 team to tour England caused great controversy at the time—especially as he hit a brilliant 271 not out against Victoria {{on the eve of}} selection. [...] Kippax was well into his thirties by the time he became a consistent selection for the Test team. Highly regarded by both fellow players and spectators, Kippax's innings of 83 in the Lord's Test of 1930 induced Neville Cardus to comment that, [...] "he pleased the eye of the connoisseur all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Coming off a {{successful}} second AHL season, Grabner {{was expected to}} challenge for a roster spot at the Canucks' 2009–10 training camp, but was sent {{back down to the}} Moose {{before the start of the}} regular season. [...] After a quick start with the Moose, however, scoring four goals in five games, he was called up by the Canucks on 14 October 2009, to replace injured star winger Daniel Sedin. Grabner then scored his first NHL goal on 21 October on the powerplay against Antti Niemi in a 3–2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks. Nine games into his initial stint with the Canucks, however, he injured himself during a pre-game warmup on 1 November. Grabner was kicking a soccer ball around with teammates before a game against the Colorado Avalanche when <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> over his ankle.|$|E
500|$|Pearson {{was born}} near Spartanburg, South Carolina. When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree {{at the local}} stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races. Pearson said, [...] "I'd always been {{interested}} in cars, and I decided right then that was what I wanted to do with my life." [...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> it over. His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|E

40|$|Each of two players, by turns, rolls a dice {{several times}} accumulating the {{successive}} scores until {{he decides to}} stop, or <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> an ace.

If <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> an ace, the dice is given to the opponent without adding any point.

500|$|On April 13, 1921, the Arizona Republican ran {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with Thomas Raines, a former resident of Tombstone. Raines described the gunfight as an ambush. He {{said that he}} remembered the Earps shot the Cowboys and killed Ike Clanton (when they actually killed his brother Billy) before the Cowboys {{had a chance to}} surrender. He recalled that the Cowboys [...] "were leading their horses out of the gate when they were confronted, almost from ambush, by four of the Earps, Virgil. Wyatt, Morgan and Jim and by Doc Holliday. Virgil Earp, armed with a sawed off express shotgun, and accompanying his demand with profanity, yelled [...] "Hands up!" [...] But he didn't wait for the action demanded and shot almost as soon as he spoke. Tom McLowery showed his empty bands, and cried. 'Gentlemen, I am unarmed.' Holliday answered with the discharge of his shotgun. Ike Clanton fell at the first fire, mortally wounded, but <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> over and fired two shots from his pistol between his bent knees." ...|$|E
500|$|Years later, Grossmith's {{obituary}} in The Times {{noted the}} comedian's [...] "nimbleness, his diverting tricks, his still more diverting dignity—the dignity {{of a man}} of few inches high or round—and his incomparable power of rapid speech and singing." [...] The Daily Telegraph wrote of his Jack Point: [...] "Whether giving expression to poor Jack’s professional wit, or hiding a sorry heart behind light words... Mr Grossmith was master of the part he assumed." [...] In 1883, The Times, reviewing a matinee performance of Iolanthe, wrote: [...] "Mr. Grossmith's impersonation of the Lord Chancellor has ... become an exquisitely refined satire." [...] On the other hand, his sketch comedy background had trained Grossmith to improvise comic business. [...] Gilbert and the actor had a famous exchange during rehearsals for The Mikado about an improvised bit of [...] "business" [...] in which Jessie Bond pushed Grossmith, as they kneeled before the Mikado, and <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> completely over. Gilbert requested that they cut out the gag, and Grossmith replied: [...] "but I get an enormous laugh by it". [...] Replied Gilbert: [...] "So you would if you sat on a pork-pie." ...|$|E
500|$|The weather {{conditions}} on the grid were dry before the race; the air temperature was [...] and the track temperature [...] The race started at 14:00 local time. A total of approximately 100,000 spectators attended the race. As the drivers were preparing to start the formation lap, both Minardis were in the pit lane due to technical difficulties. Both Alonso and Marques initially started from the pit lane. Both Williams drivers maintained first and second positions going into the first corner. Further back, Michael Schumacher slowed with an issue with his gear selection, which resulted in drivers being forced to swerve to avoid him. Burti was unable to view the Ferrari as Panis was blocking his view and hit the rear of Schumacher's car, launching Burti {{into the air and}} <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> over the top on Bernoldi's vehicle's and narrowly landed on Verstappen's Arrows. Burti's car lost one of its wheels, landing of Bernoldi's Arrows which resulted in a broken engine cover and rear wing for the Brazilian. Burti's car bounced across the gravel trap and came to a rest on the Nordkurve corner tyre barriers. The race was red-flagged as strands of carbon fibre were scattered across the track and marshals were needed to clear the debris.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an example}} of play, Our Hero, Rollo the Superspy, wants to impress Isvestia, a {{beautiful}} Ruritanian counterintelligence agent, at the casino in Monte Carlo. He adds his +2 skill in “Tango Dancing” to the 12 of his “Superspy” Job, which she will oppose with her 15 Nerve. <b>He</b> <b>rolls</b> a 13 while she rolls a 4. Both are [...] "successful", but his roll, being higher, {{is the one that}} succeeds. The result should be that he has her eating out of his hand, but Rollo also has “Overplays His Hand” for a Weakness with a Number of 13. <b>He</b> <b>rolls</b> a 9, and the Weakness wins and takes effect, thus releasing Isvestia from her fascination.|$|R

500|$|Once {{he had the}} sound, <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> off {{the bottom}} to [...] "take the muddiness out". It was {{actually}} double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, {{and the rest of}} the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was [...] "a little unorthodox" [...] and therefore, he tried to refine it. Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, [...] "... and in all honesty, whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up finding something you like about it, and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play." [...] Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in [...] "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that [...] " [...] could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers." [...] Swivel further said that it started with [...] "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" [...] kick, and he then added a little thump to it.|$|E
500|$|Burnham {{was first}} {{captured}} during the fighting at Sanna's Post in the Orange Free State. He gave {{himself up in}} order to obtain information on the enemy, which he did, and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching British occupied Bloemfontein safely after two days and nights on the run. [...] The second time he was captured was while trying to warn a British column approaching Thaba' Nchu. He came upon a group of Boers hiding {{on the banks of the}} river, toward which the British were even then advancing. Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush, while Burnham was at once taken prisoner. In the fight that followed, Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee, limping heavily and groaning with pain. He was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheels of the wagon, lowered himself, and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road. In an instant, the wagon had passed over him safely, and while the dust still hung above the trail <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open veld. He had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of [...] "mielies" [...] (i.e., maize).|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
