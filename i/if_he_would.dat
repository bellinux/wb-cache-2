5|$|Hurley also asks James <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like {{to watch}} Xanadu or a fictional film called Satan's Doom but James replies saying that he is reading a book. Hurley then plays Xanadu and we hear the film's title song.|$|E
5|$|A rebellious Nemo {{lives with}} his mother and her new partner, Harry, in Montreal. He sees a new girl, Anna, in his school and is {{immediately}} smitten. One day on the beach, Anna asks <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to swim with her and her friends. Nemo insults her friends and they barely see each other again.|$|E
5|$|At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Celski won bronze in the 1500m and the 5000m relay. Five {{months before}} the Olympics, Celski {{suffered}} a gruesome injury when he fell during a race and his right skate blade gashed his left thigh and was uncertain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to skate again.|$|E

5|$|Calleia {{was cast}} as the Spanish {{ambassador}} in the Broadway production of Princess Flavia (1925), Sigmund Romberg's musical adaptation of The Prisoner of Zenda. While {{he was waiting for}} the elaborate production to be mounted he sold pianos, with such success that the store owner offered him a store of his own <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stay.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play in the Gator Bowl or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to play}} at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Kallikrates – {{an ancient}} Greek, {{the husband of}} Amenartas, and {{ancestor}} of Leo. Two thousand years ago, he and Amenartas fled Egypt, seeking a haven in the African interior where they met Ayesha. There, She {{fell in love with}} him, promising to give him the secret of immortality <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> kill Amenartas. He refused, and, enraged, She struck him down.|$|E
60|$|He awoke. He {{could bear}} it no more. Perhaps he was mad, {{and these were}} visions of his madness, mocking visions {{that led him to}} his death. Well, <b>if</b> so, <b>he</b> still <b>would</b> follow them. Perhaps her body was buried in the north. <b>If</b> so, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be buried there also; perhaps her Soul dwelt in the north. If so, his soul would fly thither to join it. The Kaffirs would kill him in the pass. Well, <b>if</b> so, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> die with his face set northwards whither Rachel drew him.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} four, Botha {{was struck}} by {{meningitis}} in Lourenço Marques. He was treated at a small hospital in Barberton, Transvaal, and his mother vowed that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> survived, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> become a church minister.|$|R
50|$|The oldest went to {{the king}} to enter his service. The king set him to watch his seven foals all day {{and find out what}} they ate and drank. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> succeeded, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> marry the princess and receive half the kingdom; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> failed, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have three strips taken out of his back.|$|R
5|$|Nayyouf was {{repeatedly}} {{given the opportunity}} to be released <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sign a document recanting his criticism of the Syrian government, but also refused. In prison, Nayyouf continued to write and letters in as well as papers out by bribing prison guards.|$|E
5|$|The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top {{choice was}} Robert De Niro, who {{repeatedly}} turned the part down, as did {{a succession of}} other actors. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{net result}} was that little work was done on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
60|$|A tramp, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could sing, <b>would</b> be a troubadour; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could pray, <b>would</b> be a pilgrim friar--in {{either case}} a natural object of womanly solicitude. But {{as he could}} do neither, he was simply a curse.|$|R
50|$|Procopius {{indicated}} (Secret History 26.18) that {{he planned}} to write an ecclesiastical history himself and, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably have followed the rules of that genre. But, as far as it is known, the ecclesiastical history remained unwritten.|$|R
60|$|Oliver, {{more dead}} than alive, gasped out, 'Yes.' Sikes, {{pointing}} to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> faltered, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fall dead that instant.|$|R
5|$|Unable {{to secure}} funding for further work and {{allegedly}} suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director's health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ever direct another film.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl Dönitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be willing to provide information on the effects of the air war. Speer agreed, and over the next several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E
5|$|After Whitlam left, Kerr {{called in}} Fraser, {{informed}} {{him of the}} dismissal, and asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> form a caretaker government, to which Fraser agreed. Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief. Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that {{had been waiting for}} him, apologising to his guests and offering the excuse that he had been busy dismissing the Government.|$|E

60|$|Ellen {{wondered}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had heard}} of her meeting with Jean Isbel. <b>If</b> not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hear as soon as Simm Bruce and Lorenzo came back. She decided to forestall them.|$|R
5|$|After he {{was passed}} over by Johnny Behan for the {{position}} of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff's office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, but the plan was foiled when the three suspects—Leonard, Head and Crane—were killed in unrelated incidents.|$|E
5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to ask him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> consider coaching.|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> get the part and did not wish to be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E

5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So they asked him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from {{the ground floor of}} Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the Gospels.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, he would have to keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|David left London in March, {{arriving}} in Rome {{just before the}} Easter celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks {{at home and in}} restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E
