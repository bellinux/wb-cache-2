5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, and the room was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink <b>damask</b> which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E
5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, <b>damask</b> and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels include 16 silver {{trumpets}} {{dating from}} between 1780 and 1848. Nine {{of these are}} draped with red silk <b>damask</b> banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded by the Duke of Wellington as a cost-cutting measure in the 19thcentury. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "damask" [...] first {{appeared}} in records in a Western European language in the mid-14th century in French. By the 14th century, <b>damasks</b> were being woven on draw looms in Italy. From the 14th to 16th century, most <b>damasks</b> were woven in one colour with a glossy warp-faced satin pattern against a duller ground. Two-colour <b>damasks</b> had contrasting colour warps and wefts, and polychrome <b>damasks</b> added gold and other metallic threads or additional colours as supplemental brocading wefts. Medieval <b>damasks</b> were usually woven in silk, but weavers also produced wool and linen <b>damasks.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the <b>Damask</b> rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} the {{fortunes}} of Dunfermline lasted until {{the introduction of a}} linen industry in the early 18th century. One reason for which the town became a centre for linen was there was enough water to power the mills and nearby ports along the Fife Coast. These ports also did trade with the Baltic and Low Countries. Another reason was through an act of industrial espionage in 1709 by a weaver known as James Blake who gained access to the workshops of a <b>damask</b> linen factory in Edinburgh by pretending to act like a simpleton in order to find out and memorise the formula. On his return to his home town in 1718, Blake established a <b>damask</b> linen industry in the town. The largest of these factories was St Leonard's Mill which was established by Erskine Beveridge in 1851. A warehouse and office block was later added around 1869. Other linen factories were built on land to both the north and south ends of the burgh. During the mid-19th century, powerloom weaving started to replace linen <b>damask.</b> The latter did not survive, going into decline straight after the end of First World War. In 1909 the Royal Navy established Scotland's only Royal Naval Dockyard at nearby Rosyth.|$|E

50|$|Most Old Garden Roses {{of strict}} European {{heritage}} (albas, <b>damasks,</b> gallicas, etc.) are shrubs that bloom once yearly, {{in late spring}} or early summer, on two-year-old (or older) canes.

Hence pruning is usually restricted to just removing weak and spent branches, plus light trimming (if necessary) to reduce overall size.|$|R
