Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days <b>elapse</b> between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E

5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must <b>elapse</b> {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} determinant for the well-functioning of {{a criminal}} justice system is <b>elapsed</b> times. The <b>elapsed</b> time of a case is the period that is required to handle a case that pertains to a suspect or convict. Long <b>elapsed</b> times may be interpreted as delays in a criminal justice system, which in turn may lead to “justice delayed, justice denied”. Such a development may undermine the public trust in the government. Therefore insight in <b>elapsed</b> time is of crucial importance for policy-makers to define a sound and healthy justice policy. To gain this insight, we propose a model to measure the <b>elapsed</b> time of criminal cases...|$|R

5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to <b>elapse</b> between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{had almost}} opted {{out of the}} tour, citing {{business}} commitments in Australia; at the time, {{it was not possible}} to make a living from cricket. Prior to the campaign in England, Australia hosted India for a five-Test series during the southern hemisphere summer of 194748. Australia easily defeated the tourists 40, and Bradman and his fellow selectors Chappie Dwyer and Jack Ryder thus began planning for the tour of England. Bradman made it publicly known that he wanted his team to become the first to play an English summer without defeat. England had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, instead of the previous rule of after 200 runs had been scored. As the run rate was generally much slower than 3.64, 55 overs would usually <b>elapse</b> long before 200 runs were scored. This meant that the ball was in a shiny state more often, and thereby more conducive to fast and swing bowling. Bradman and his colleagues thus chose the team with an emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling, basing his strategy on an intense speed attack against England's batsmen. His 17-man squad sailed for England and arrived in mid-April.|$|E
40|$|Summary. We explore Bayesian {{analysis}} for continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models {{based on a}} conditional reference prior. For CTMC models, inference of the <b>elapsed</b> time be-tween chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the <b>elapsed</b> time increases. Moreover, improper priors on the <b>elapsed</b> time may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition to the <b>elapsed</b> time, an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes the CTMC. Usually, experts have good prior knowledge about {{the parameters of the}} infinitesimal rate matrix, and thus can provide well-informed priors. We show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the <b>elapsed</b> time yields a proper posterior distribution. Finally, we demonstrate that, when compared to anal-yses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, Bayesian analysis on the <b>elapsed</b> time based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The conditional reference prior therefore represents a better default prior choice for widely-used estimation software...|$|R

30|$|Execution time. As we logged all the bug {{localization}} runs, {{including the}} time <b>elapsed</b> for each run, we can {{assert that the}} modes that process more constructs (i.e., Mixed and Complete modes) do take longer to complete than the Default mode. However, in the first runs of the adapted modes, we perceived no {{significant increase in the}} <b>elapsed</b> time. Thus, we did not design a research question to evaluate the variation of the <b>elapsed</b> time for each bug localization run. Therefore, we did not implement measures to control the execution environment, such as avoiding parallel execution of other programs that could compromise any measurement of the <b>elapsed</b> time. Consequently, the data we collected regarding <b>elapsed</b> time cannot be used to compare the cost-benefit of each mapping mode formally.|$|R

40|$|Cross-sections of resin strands. Techniques were {{developed}} to make in situ measurements of gelled resin to determine linear shrinkage, stress-strain response and stress relaxation of single strands of SL 5170 epoxy and SL 5149 photocurable resins. Epoxy strands shrank approximately 1. 4 % and the acrylate strands about 1. 0 % after a single exposure. No forces were measured during cure shrinkage of strands following the first laser exposure. In multiple laser exposures, the acrylate continues to shrink; whereas (University of Dayton data) no additional shrinkage is observed in epoxy strands on a second hit. In force relaxation tests, a strand is drawn and then a 0. 5 % step strain is applied after different <b>elapsed</b> times. The epoxy initial modulus evolves (increases) with <b>elapsed</b> time following draw of the strand, and this evolution in modulus occurs after linear shrinkage has stopped. On the other hand, acrylates show no evolution of modulus with <b>elapsed</b> time following a single laser draw; i. e., once shrinkage stops after one laser hit, the initial modulus remains stable with <b>elapsed</b> time. Finally, relaxation response times of epoxy strands get larger with increasing <b>elapsed</b> time after laser draw. In acrylate strands there was no evolution in initial modulus with <b>elapsed</b> time after a single draw so relaxation times are not a function of <b>elapsed</b> time after a single hit with the laser...|$|R

Micropores smaller than 0.6 nm in wood decreased in number with <b>elapsed</b> time in the environment, and a negative correlation was found between cumulative pore volume for pores smaller than 0.6 nm and <b>elapsed</b> time in the environment. Cumulative pore volume in the 1000 -year sample was almost half {{of that in the}} 0.1 - year sample. Micropores smaller than 0.6 nm in wood with a few decades or more of <b>elapsed</b> time increased in number after rewetting and drying. Consequently, microstructures of wood with longer time <b>elapsed</b> in the environment were considered to be more stable, because of longer-term thermal motion and possibly more repeated moisture adsorption and desorption and/or temperature variation in the environment.|$|R

50|$|Currently, 50 {{years of}} Brahma have <b>elapsed.</b> The last Kalpa {{at the end}} of 50th year is called Padma Kalpa. We are {{currently}} in the first 'day' of the 51st year. This Brahma's day, Kalpa, is named as Shveta-Varaha Kalpa. Within this Day, six Manvantaras have already <b>elapsed</b> and this is the seventh Manvantara, named as - Vaivasvatha Manvantara (or Sraddhadeva Manvantara). Within the Vaivasvatha Manvantara, 27 Mahayugas (4 Yugas together is a Mahayuga), and the Krita, Treta and Dwapara Yugas of the 28th Mahayuga have <b>elapsed.</b> This Kaliyuga is in the 28th Mahayuga. This Kaliyuga began in the year 3102 BCE in the proleptic Julian Calendar. Since 50 years of Brahma have already <b>elapsed,</b> this is the second Parardha, also called as Dvithiya Parardha. The time <b>elapsed</b> since the current Brahma has taken over the task of creation can be calculated as 432000 × 10 × 1000 × 2 = 8.64 billion years (2 Kalpa (day and night)) 8.64 × 109 × 30 × 12 = 3.1104 Trillion Years (1 year of Brahma)3.1104 × 1012 × 50 = 155.52 trillion years (50 years of Brahma) (6 × 71 × 4320000) + 7 × 1.728 × 10^6 = 1852416000 years <b>elapsed</b> in first six Manvataras, and Sandhi Kalas in the current Kalpa 27 × 4320000 = 116640000 years <b>elapsed</b> in first 27 Mahayugas of the current Manvantara 1.728 × 10^6 + 1.296 × 10^6 + 864000 = 3888000 years <b>elapsed</b> in current Mahayuga 3102 + 2017 = 5119 years <b>elapsed</b> in current Kaliyuga.

As per the information above about Yuga periods, only 5,119 years are passed out of 432,000 years of current Kali Yuga, and hence another 426,881 years are left to complete this 28th Kali Yuga of Vaivaswatha Manvantara.|$|R
