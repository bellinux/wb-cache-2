5|$|Arab {{accounts}} from the 10th century place al-Battal alongside Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik during the latter's unsuccessful siege of Constantinople in 717–718, {{but as the}} Arab accounts of the siege are semi-legendary, {{it is impossible to}} <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> report contains any truth. In reliable historical sources (the chroniclers al-Ya'qubi and al-Tabari), al-Battal first appears in 727, in one of the annual raids against Byzantine Asia Minor. This campaign was commanded by Mu'awiya ibn Hisham, the son of the reigning Caliph Hisham (reigned 723–743). Al-Battal led the vanguard, with which he penetrated as far as the city of Gangra in Paphlagonia, which he captured and razed, before the army went on to unsuccessfully lay siege to Nicaea. Blankinship considers that al-Battal's capture of Gangra ranks {{as one of the greatest}} successes of Umayyad arms against the Byzantines in this period, along with the capture of Caesarea by Maslama in 726.|$|E
5|$|In April 1896, Chile ordered another armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats. Naval {{historian}} Robert Scheina {{states that}} Argentina replied {{in the same}} month with , a near-sister ship to Garibaldi which was under construction in Italy. However, {{he notes that the}} small time lapse between the orders makes it difficult or impossible to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>this,</b> the opposite, or either are true. As historian Jonathan Grant writes, the Argentines may have moved first to secure a definite, if momentarily tenuous, advantage over the Chilean Navy. In May 1898, the Chilean government found that the Argentines were planning on acquiring one, then two, Garibaldi-class cruisers. With tensions extremely high and war seemingly imminent, the two countries agreed to submit their boundary disputes to the British, which led to the Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 (Argentina, Chile). They also signed pacts which led to the resolution of the Puna de Atacama dispute. As the former arbitration took much time, the naval arms race, though it slacked during the time of eased tension which came with the agreements, continued.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{when war}} was declared, Genghis sent orders for a force already {{out to the}} west to {{immediately}} cross the Tien Shan mountains {{to the south and}} ravage the fertile Ferghana Valley {{in the eastern part of}} the Khwarezm Empire. This smaller detachment, no more than 20-30,000 men, was led by Genghis's son Jochi and his elite general Jebe. The Tien Shan mountain passes were much more treacherous than the Dzungarian Gate, and to make it worse, they attempted the crossing in the middle of winter with 5+ feet of snow. Though the Mongols suffered losses and were exhausted from the crossing, their presence in the Ferghana Valley stunned the Khwarezm leadership and permanently stole the initiative away. This march can be described as the Central Asian equivalent of Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, with the same devastating effects. Because the Shah did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> Mongol army was a diversion or their main army, he had to protect one of his most fertile regions with force. Therefore, the Shah dispatched his elite cavalry reserve, which prevented him from effectively marching anywhere else with his main army. Jebe and Jochi seem to have kept their army in good shape while plundering the valley, and they avoided defeat by a much superior force. At this point the Mongols split up and again maneuvered over the mountains: Jebe marched further south deeper into Khwarezm territory, while Jochi took most of the force northwest to attack the exposed cities on the Syr Darya from the east.|$|E

2500|$|Instances of this {{behavior}} {{have been found}} in the Bible. In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian Val Camonica a man is shown about to penetrate an animal. Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief, and so we do not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time. Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing. Dr [...] "Jacobus X", said to be a nom-de-plume for a French author, said this was clearly [...] "before any known taboos against sex with animals existed." [...] Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titillation of the reader. Masters said that since pre-historic man is prehistoric {{it goes without saying that}} we know little of his sexual behaviour, depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist's subjective preoccupations or thoughts.|$|E
