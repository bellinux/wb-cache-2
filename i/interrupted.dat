5000|$|A [...] "reentrant <b>interrupt</b> handler" [...] is an <b>interrupt</b> handler that re-enables <b>interrupts</b> {{early in}} the <b>interrupt</b> handler. This may reduce <b>interrupt</b> latency.In general, while {{programming}} <b>interrupt</b> service routines, it is recommended to re-enable <b>interrupts</b> {{as soon as possible}} in the <b>interrupt</b> handler. This practice helps to avoid losing <b>interrupts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In computing, <b>interrupt</b> latency is {{the time}} that elapses from when an <b>interrupt</b> is {{generated}} to when {{the source of the}} <b>interrupt</b> is serviced. For many operating systems, devices are serviced as soon as the device's <b>interrupt</b> handler is executed. <b>Interrupt</b> latency may be affected by microprocessor design, <b>interrupt</b> controllers, <b>interrupt</b> masking, and the operating system's (OS) <b>interrupt</b> handling methods.|$|R
30|$|MicroBlaze also {{supports}} reset, <b>interrupt,</b> user exception, break and hardware exceptions. For <b>interrupts,</b> MicroBlaze supports only one external <b>interrupt</b> source (connecting to the <b>interrupt</b> input port). If multiple <b>interrupts</b> are needed, an <b>interrupt</b> controller {{must be used}} to handle multiple <b>interrupt</b> requests to MicroBlaze. An <b>interrupt</b> controller is available for use with the Xilinx EDK software tools. The processor will only react to <b>interrupts</b> if the <b>interrupt</b> enable (IE) bit in the MSR is set to 1. On an <b>interrupt</b> the instruction in the execution stage will complete, while the instruction in the decode stage {{is replaced by a}} branch to the <b>interrupt</b> vector (address 0  ×  10). The <b>interrupt</b> return address (the PC associated with the instruction in the decode stage {{at the time of the}} <b>interrupt)</b> is automatically loaded into general-purpose register R 14. In addition, the processor also disables future <b>interrupts</b> by clearing the IE bit in the MSR. The IE bit is automatically set again when executing the RTID instruction.|$|R

5|$|Harvey {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Fitzroy on 12 May 1942 {{and was a member}} of the 30 Squadron. He served as an {{airframe}} fitter during World War II, which severely <b>interrupted</b> his sporting career, and first-class cricket was cancelled after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor prompted the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific. He was discharged on 25 January 1946 with the rank of aircraftman. According to cricket administrator Bill Jacobs, the war cost Harvey his prime cricketing years. Jacobs believed that Harvey would have been selected for Australia in the period otherwise <b>interrupted</b> by war.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, a vectored <b>interrupt</b> is a processing {{technique in}} which the <b>interrupting</b> device directs the processor to the appropriate <b>interrupt</b> service routine. This {{is in contrast to}} a polled <b>interrupt</b> system, in which a single <b>interrupt</b> service routine must determine the source of the <b>interrupt</b> by checking all potential <b>interrupt</b> sources, a slow and relatively laborious process.|$|R
50|$|External <b>interrupts</b> are {{triggered}} by falling/rising edges or high/low potential at the <b>interrupt</b> port, {{leading to an}} <b>interrupt</b> request (IRQ) in the controller. Hardware <b>interrupts</b> are divided into maskable <b>interrupts</b> and non-maskable <b>interrupts</b> (NMI). The triggering of maskable <b>interrupts</b> can be stopped in some time-critical functions. If an <b>interrupt</b> is called, the current instruction pointer (IP) is saved on the stack, and the stack pointer (SP) is decremented. The address of the <b>interrupt</b> service routine (ISR) is read from the <b>interrupt</b> vector table and loaded to the IP register, and the ISR is executed as a consequence.|$|R

The simulation results show the feasibility and stability of this kind of <b>interrupt</b> {{management method}}. In a word, the implementation of <b>interrupt</b> management by hardware improves not only the utilization rate of CPU, but also the real-time performance of the whole system...|$|R

50|$|After {{initialization}} UMMPS {{is entirely}} <b>interrupt</b> driven. The <b>interrupts</b> {{may be due}} to supervisor (SVC) or monitor (MC) call instructions issued by job programs to request services, page fault <b>interrupts</b> for virtual memory pages that are not in real memory when referenced by a job program, program <b>interrupts</b> caused by abnormal conditions in job programs, timer <b>interrupts</b> on behalf of job programs or used internally within the supervisor, <b>interrupts</b> from the input/output subsystem, machine check <b>interrupts,</b> external (operator initiated) <b>interrupts,</b> and <b>interrupts</b> from other processors in a multiprocessor configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Level-triggered <b>interrupt</b> {{is favored}} by some {{because it is}} easy to share the <b>interrupt</b> request line without losing the <b>interrupts,</b> when {{multiple}} shared devices <b>interrupt</b> at the same time. Upon detecting assertion of the <b>interrupt</b> line, the CPU must search through the devices sharing the <b>interrupt</b> request line until one who triggered the <b>interrupt</b> is detected. After servicing this device, the CPU may recheck the <b>interrupt</b> line status to determine whether any other devices also needs service. If the line is now de-asserted, the CPU avoids checking the remaining devices on the line. Since some devices <b>interrupt</b> more frequently than others, and other device <b>interrupts</b> are particularly expensive, a careful ordering of device checks is employed to increase efficiency. The original PCI standard mandated level-triggered <b>interrupts</b> because of this advantage of sharing <b>interrupts.</b>|$|R
50|$|VME also decodes {{all seven}} of the 68000's <b>interrupt</b> levels onto a 7-pin <b>interrupt</b> bus. The <b>interrupt</b> scheme is one of {{prioritized}} vectored <b>interrupts.</b> The <b>interrupt</b> request lines (IRQ1 - IRQ7) prioritize <b>interrupts.</b> An <b>interrupting</b> module asserts one of the <b>interrupt</b> request lines. Any module on the bus may potentially handleany <b>interrupt.</b> When an <b>interrupt</b> handling module recognizes an <b>interrupt</b> request at a priority it handles, it arbitrates for the bus in the usual fashion described above. It then performs a read of the <b>interrupt</b> vector by driving the binary version of the IRQ line it handles (e.g. if IRQ5 is being handled, then binary 101) onto the address bus. It also asserts the IACK line, along with the appropriate data transfer strobes for {{the width of the}} status/ID being read. Again, LWORD*, DS0* and DS1* allow status/ID read cycles to be 8, 16, or 32 bit wide transfers but most existing hardware interrupters use 8 bit status/IDs. The <b>interrupter</b> responds by transferring a status/ID on the data bus to describe the <b>interrupt.</b> The <b>interrupt</b> handling module (usually a CPU) will usually use this status/ID number to identify and run the appropriate software <b>interrupt</b> service routine.|$|R

5000|$|There was {{a single}} <b>interrupt</b> line on the PDP-8 I/O bus. The {{processor}} handled any <b>interrupt</b> by disabling further <b>interrupts</b> and executing a [...] to location 0000.

40|$|<b>Interrupts</b> and in {{particular}} precise <b>interrupts</b> constitute {{an integral part of}} all computer architectures. Implementing precise <b>interrupts</b> can substantially inhibit the performance of computers. To gain some insight into the problem, we divide common <b>interrupts</b> into four classes, and examine the cost of implementing precise <b>interrupts.</b> Two of these classes, external-critical and external-error, can be implemented cheaply on a pipelined processor, with little or no impact on performance. We propose that <b>interrupts</b> be implemented imprecisely, except during debugging, of a third class of <b>interrupts,</b> internal-error <b>interrupts.</b> Finally, we introduced some techniques {{that can be used to}} cheaply implement precise <b>interrupts</b> for the fourth class of <b>interrupts,</b> internal-critical <b>interrupts,</b> but may not apply generally. While the central concern is precision, or lack thereof, we also deal with several peripheral issues that arise when implementing <b>interrupts</b> on aggressive implementation [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The design {{philosophy}} of the Propeller is that a hard real-time multi-core architecture negates the need for dedicated <b>interrupt</b> hardware and support in assembly. In traditional CPU architecture, external <b>interrupt</b> lines are fed to an on-chip <b>interrupt</b> controller and are serviced {{by one or more}} <b>interrupt</b> service routines. When an <b>interrupt</b> occurs, the <b>interrupt</b> controller suspends normal CPU processing and saves internal state (typically on the stack), then vectors to the designated <b>interrupt</b> service routine. After handling the <b>interrupt,</b> the service routine executes a return from <b>interrupt</b> instruction which restores the internal state and resumes CPU processing.|$|R

50|$|A FLIH {{implements}} {{at minimum}} platform-specific <b>interrupt</b> handling similar to <b>interrupt</b> routines. In {{response to an}} <b>interrupt,</b> there is a context switch, and the code for the <b>interrupt</b> is loaded and executed. The job of a FLIH is to quickly service the <b>interrupt,</b> or to record platform-specific critical information which is only {{available at the time}} of the <b>interrupt,</b> and schedule the execution of a SLIH for further long-lived <b>interrupt</b> handling.|$|R
50|$|In the x86 architecture, <b>interrupts</b> {{are handled}} through the <b>Interrupt</b> Dispatch Table (IDT). When a device {{triggers}} an <b>interrupt,</b> the <b>interrupt</b> flag (IF) in the flags register is {{set and the}} processor's hardware looks for an <b>interrupt</b> handler in the table entry corresponding to the <b>interrupt</b> number, or IRQ. <b>Interrupt</b> handlers usually save the state of all or some registers before handling it and restore the registers when done.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} cause is when a device [...] "behind" [...] another signals an <b>interrupt</b> to a APIC (Advanced Programmable <b>Interrupt</b> Controller). Most {{computer}} peripherals generate <b>interrupts</b> through an APIC {{as the number of}} <b>interrupts</b> is most always less (typically 15 for the modern PC) than the number of devices. The OS must then query each driver registered to that <b>interrupt</b> to ask if the <b>interrupt</b> originated from its hardware. Faulty drivers may always claim [...] "yes", causing the OS to not query other drivers registered to that <b>interrupt</b> (only one <b>interrupt</b> can be processed at a time). The device which originally requested the <b>interrupt</b> therefore does not get its <b>interrupt</b> serviced, so a new <b>interrupt</b> is generated (or is not cleared) and the processor becomes swamped with continuous <b>interrupt</b> signals. Any operating system can live lock under an <b>interrupt</b> storm caused by such a fault. A kernel debugger can usually break the storm by unloading the faulty driver, allowing the driver [...] "underneath" [...] the faulty one to clear the <b>interrupt,</b> if user input is still possible.|$|R
