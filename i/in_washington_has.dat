5|$|The Cascadia {{subduction}} zone rarely influences the western portion of Washington state, but the November 1873 M7.3 shock near the California–Oregon border {{may have been}} associated with it. Although activity in the Pacific Northwest (especially west of the Cascades <b>in</b> <b>Washington)</b> <b>has</b> occasionally been located near the {{subduction zone}}, earthquakes there (1949 Olympia, 1965 Puget Sound, 2001 Nisqually) have mostly been intraslab events. A large M7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault in 900 C.E. may have generated a tsunami in Puget Sound. The 1872 event east of the Cascades is not understood well {{due to the lack of}} instrumental records and reliable felt intensity reports.|$|E

2500|$|William B. Quandt, in the {{introduction}} of his book Peace Process, says: Sometime in the mid-1970s the term peace process became widely {{used to describe the}} American-led efforts to bring about a negotiated peace between Israel and its neighbors. The phrase stuck, and ever since it has been synonymous with the gradual, step-by-step approach to resolving one of the world's most difficult conflicts. In the years since 1967 the emphasis <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>has</b> shifted from the spelling out of the ingredients of [...] "peace" [...] to the [...] "process" [...] of getting there. … Much of US constitutional theory focuses on how issues should be resolved – the process – rather than on substance – what should be done. … The United States has provided both a sense of direction and a mechanism. That, at its best, is what the peace process has been about. At worst, it has been little more than a slogan used to mask the marking of time.|$|E
