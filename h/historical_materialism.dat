5|$|From December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, a {{work on the}} French Revolution of 1848 {{in which}} he {{expanded}} upon his concepts of <b>historical</b> <b>materialism,</b> class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing the argument that victorious proletariat has to smash the bourgeois state.|$|E
5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that <b>historical</b> <b>materialism,</b> a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as <b>historical</b> <b>materialism,</b> Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{sets out}} to examine the {{contribution}} of critical perspectives {{to the study of}} European Union politics. The first perspective, <b>historical</b> <b>materialisms,</b> consists of critical approaches which draw explicitly on the intellectual heritage of Karl Marx and Antonio Gramsci. The second perspective, Frankfurt Critical Theories, involves critical approaches which can be identified with the intellectual heritage of the Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt, including the work of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Jürgen Habermas. The third perspective, postmodern sciences, includes critical approaches which can be located within the critiques of modernity initiated by Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida, amongst others. Finally, feminist perspectives comprise of critical approaches which seek to question gender and power, and to promote social change. The ordering of the perspectives reflects a journey from more positivist to more post-positivist political science, with feminist perspectives including liberal, radical, and post-structuralist approaches, rather than any judgement on the relative merits of the differing perspectives...|$|R
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} taken new {{approaches}} to analyzing both traditional and modern Ethiopian historiography. For instance, Donald Crummey (1941–2013) investigated instances in Ethiopian historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, and gender. He also criticized earlier approaches made by Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960) and Richard Pankhurst (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the Ethiopian ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in Ethiopian historical works. Following the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the <b>historical</b> <b>materialism</b> of Marxist historiography came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding of Northeast African history. In her 2001 article Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review, Belete Bizuneh remarks {{that the impact of}} social history on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of women and gender in historical societies, but that Ethiopian historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} <b>historical</b> <b>materialism,</b> will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E

He also praised Kołakowski's discussion of Marxism's economic foundations, and his critique of the labor theory of value. Jay credited Kołakowski with exposing the fallacies of <b>historical</b> <b>materialism's</b> reliance on the causal power of the economy [...] "in the last resort". However, Jay criticized Kołakowski's treatment of Lukács, Korsch, Gramsci, the Frankfurt School, Goldmann, and Bloch, calling it [...] "vituperative and ungenerous" [...] and lacking in detachment, though he granted that Kołakowski was aware of this issue. Jay wrote that while Kołakowski's work contained occasional factual errors or dubious interpretations, there were remarkably few of them considering its length.|$|R

His writings on the subject is used to justify the CPC's market reforms, since nations, according to Marx, have little choice in the matter of joining or not. Opting not to take part in capitalist globalization means losing out in the fields of economic development, technological development, foreign investment and world trade.

40|$|This {{article is}} about curiosity as a {{founding}} category {{in the process}} of knowledge acquisition in Paulo Freire, either in common sense or in science. Based on Marx (1977) and Engels (1979) studies, one can realize that it is through the labor that human beings establish a relationship with the nature, {{as a result of the}} <b>historical</b> dialectical <b>materialism</b> the curiosity can be designed as a essential factor in the gnosiological process. This way, the meaning that Paulo Freire gives to human curiosity is given by relating to its social, historical and economic conditions that the individual is emerged. For assign, in this point of view, is possible to identify in Paulo Freire the dialect of curiosity, I mean, the movement that leads the curious to exceed him. The fact of this theory not being rigorously constituted does not mean that there isn't an "episteme". Considering common sense, there is in the knowledge of curiosity "episteme" and according Paulo Freire there is also a distinction from of the relations of power, the curiosity is called "science", just because the curiosity is in the side of those who has got the power...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} framework for spatial inquiry into conditions of radical social gregariousness, through probing the crowd design problem {{in the work of}} the Soviet Rationalist architects (1920 s- 30 s) - particularly their submissions to the Palace of Soviets competition (Moscow 1931 - 3). Legitimizing the crowd construct as an index of collective consciousness, and examining the early-modern revolutionary crowd's struggles for proclaiming its self-consciousness, this thesis investigates the interwar political phenomenon of amassing large crowds within buildings as a device for constructing collective social relations. The research project is divided into two main parts. The first is concerned with the crowd design problem, identifying this problem not just as the technical task of accommodating large political crowds, but as the basis of the formulation a new kind of conceptual intent in architecture. Finding the competition brief inadequate to in-depth formulation, the thesis investigates three primary sources for the crowd design problem: mass-events, revolutionary-theatre and revolutionary-art. Four components comprise the Crowd Design Problem each seeking legitimacy in the mass of crowd-bodies: i) the problem of crowd configurations; ii) challenges from the kinesthetic-space conception evoked by theatrical director V. E. Meyerhold's Biomechanics; iii) the legitimacy of 'the object' within a spatial-field of intersubjectivity; and iv) the challenge of 'seeing' crowds from immersive viewpoints counteracting representational filters of class privilege. Part-II focuses on the response of the Rationalists [...] one of the groups participating in the competition [...] to the crowd design problem. The study unearths in their designs a logic of space-making founded in the construction of inter-subjective states of consciousness radically different from prevailing individualistic conceptions of social space. To explain this logic of space-making, it proposes the notion of Gregarious Space [...] {{a theoretical framework}} of inquiry into what Marx called "species-being", taking radical gregariousness as the primary, generative condition of society. Besides drawing on morphological principles, social theory, historical analyses, and philosophical reflections, the notion of Gregarious Space is found to be particularly amenable to design propositions. Within the proposed theoretical framework, the Rationalists' design-proposition of curved-grounds, dense notations, textured co-visibilities and empathetic graphic conventions - all comprise a founding spatial-principle trafficking in rhythmic fields between subjects and against non-commodified objects: a principle which challenges the material domain of Productivist Constructivism as well as <b>Historical</b> <b>Materialism's</b> canonical constructs of alienation. Moreover, its uncertain kinesthetics sustain dynamic, aleatory states of consciousness which subvert prevailing disciplinary techniques of Panopticon inspection. Ph. D.
