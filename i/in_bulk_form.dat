50|$|Indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) is a ternary {{composition}} of indium, tin and oxygen in varying proportions. Depending on the oxygen content, it {{can either be}} described as a ceramic or alloy. Indium tin oxide is typically encountered as an oxygen-saturated composition with a formulation of 74% In, 18% O2, and 8% Sn by weight. Oxygen-saturated compositions are so typical, that unsaturated compositions are termed oxygen-deficient ITO.

50|$|An ingot is a {{piece of}} {{relatively}} pure material, usually metal, that is cast into a shape suitable for further processing.

Ingots usually require a second procedure of shaping, such as cold/hot working, cutting, or milling to produce a useful final product. Non-metallic and semiconductor materials prepared <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>form</b> may also be referred to as ingots, particularly when cast by mold based methods. Precious metal ingots can be used as currency (with or without being processed into other shapes), or as a currency reserve, as with gold bars.|$|E

Precious metals <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>form</b> are known as bullion and are traded on commodity markets. Bullion metals may be cast into ingots or minted into coins.

50|$|Aluminum {{is widely}} used for making superconducting tunnel {{junctions}} because of its unique ability to form a very thin (2-3 nm) insulating oxide layer with no defects that short-circuit the insulating layer. The superconducting critical temperature of aluminum is approximately 1.2 kelvin (K). For many applications, it is convenient to have a device that is superconducting at a higher temperature, in particular at a temperature above the boiling point of liquid helium, which is 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. One approach to achieving this is to use niobium, which has a superconducting critical temperature <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>form</b> of 9.3 K. Niobium, however, does not form an oxide that is suitable for making tunnel junctions. To form an insulating oxide, the first layer of niobium can be coated with a very thin layer (approximately 5 nm) of aluminum, which is then oxidized to form a high quality aluminum oxide tunnel barrier before the final layer of niobium is deposited. The thin aluminum layer is proximitized by the thicker niobium, and the resulting device has a superconducting critical temperature above 4.2 K. Early work used lead-lead oxide-lead tunnel junctions. Lead has a superconducting critical temperature of 7.2 K <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>form,</b> but lead oxide tends to develop defects (sometimes called pinhole defects) that short-circuit the tunnel barrier when the device is thermally cycled between cryogenic temperatures and room temperature, and as result lead is no longer widely used to make STJs.|$|E
50|$|The Seebeck {{coefficient}} {{can change}} its sign in superlattice nanowires {{due to the}} existence of minigaps as Fermi energy varies. This indicates that superlattices can be tailored to exhibit n or p-type behavior by using the same dopants as those that are used for corresponding bulk materials by carefully controlling Fermi energy or the dopant concentration. With nanowire arrays, it is possible to exploit semimetal-semiconductor transition due to the quantum confinement and use materials that normally would not be good thermoelectric materials <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>form.</b> Such elements are for example bismuth. The Seebeck effect could also be used to determine the carrier concentration and Fermi energy in nanowires.|$|E
