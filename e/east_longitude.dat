25|$|The INPFC treaty {{worked in}} concert with {{multiple}} bi-lateral treaties between Canada, Japan, the USSR, and the USA to create a tapestry of policies that formed a North Pacific fisheries management regime. The first significant change to the INPFC treaty came in 1978 {{after a year of}} negotiations between members about access to salmon outside of a country's potential Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)—a concept developed at the third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) in 1973. Most provisions of the original treaty remained in place and a new abstention line at 175° <b>east</b> <b>longitude</b> was developed for Japanese salmon fisherman. The conclusion of UNCLOS III in 1982 and ongoing discussions of a moratorium on pelagic salmon fishing in the North Pacific prompted calls for a re-negotiation of an international salmon treaty by Canada, the USA, and the USSR. Japan at first objected to these calls, believing the INPFC framework currently in place to be sufficient, but agreed to re-negotiate a treaty in fear of being excluded from international salmon talks.|$|E

Its message is dated July 13 and gives the travel direction at that point as East by 10° South. The message reads: [...] "Från Andrées Polarexp. till Aftonbladet, Stockholm.

Lundström and others note that all three messages fail to mention the accident at takeoff, or the increasingly desperate situation, which Andrée was describing fully in his main diary. The balloon was out of equilibrium, sailing much too high and thereby losing hydrogen faster than even Nils Ekholm had feared, then repeatedly threatening to crash on the ice. It was weighed down by being rain-soaked ("dripping wet", writes Andrée in the diary), and the men were throwing all the sand {{and some of the}} payload overboard to keep it airborne.|$|E
