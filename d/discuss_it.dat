5|$|The Castle is a pub at No.54 Pentonville Road, at the {{junction}} with Baron Street. In 2015, the perpetrators of the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary met at the pub to discuss the crime shortly after it occurred, but were secretly filmed there by the Flying Squad. All were subsequently arrested and sent to prison. The current owners, Geronimo Inns, wish {{to distance themselves from}} the burglary and forbid staff to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> with customers.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{became a}} popular {{literary}} subject. The poet John Gower, who had {{close ties to}} officials involved in {{the suppression of the}} revolt, amended his famous poem Vox Clamantis after the revolt, inserting a section condemning the rebels and likening them to wild animals. Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in Aldgate and may have been in London during the revolt, used the rebel killing of Flemings as a metaphor for wider disorder in The Nun's Priest's Tale part of The Canterbury Tales, parodying Gower's poem. Chaucer otherwise made no reference to the revolt in his work, possibly because as he was a client of the King it would have been politically unwise to <b>discuss</b> <b>it.</b> William Langland, the author of the poem Piers Plowman, which had been widely used by the rebels, made various changes to its text after the revolt in order to distance himself from their cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Friendship Is Magic posts drew {{attention}} on the site. Fans of the show defended it against various trolling attacks from other 4chan boards, leading to a temporary ban on the discussion of anything related to ponies. Christopher Poole, the founder of 4chan, briefly acknowledged {{the popularity of the}} show on the site at the 2011 South by Southwest festival. Poole has since created a dedicated board for discussion of the show and its fandom. Though the discussion of the show continued at 4chan, fans created other venues to <b>discuss</b> <b>it,</b> and the fandom spread to other Internet forums.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) copes {{with her}} failed {{marriage}} to Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.). She tries to move on, but mementos {{of the past}} do not let her. Her best friend Will (Eric McCormack) tries to help her but to no avail. While at dinner with his boyfriend Vince (Bobby Cannavale), and Vince's superior officer, Grace calls him, displeasing Vince. Believing that Grace might be suicidal, Will leaves to attend to her. Vince shows up at Will and Grace's apartment to confront her, telling her that she is affecting his relationship with Will because she is too needy. This prompts Grace and Vince to bicker, with the two asking Will to choose between them. He cannot choose between them as Grace is his long-time friend, but he also cares for Vince. The episode concludes with him telling Vince {{that he wants to}} work things out, but before they can <b>discuss</b> <b>it,</b> Vince sees Grace's wedding album, resulting in him being more focused on the album than the relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Conference of Nyon was {{arranged}} in September 1937 for all parties with a Mediterranean coastline by the British, despite appeals by Italy and Germany that the Committee handle the piracy {{and other issues}} the conference was to <b>discuss.</b> <b>It</b> decided that French and British fleets patrol the areas of sea west of Malta, and attack any suspicious submarines. Warships that attacked neutral shipping would be attacked. On 18 September, Juan Negrín requested that the League of Nations' Political Committee examine Spain. He also demanded an end to non intervention. Eden claimed that non-intervention had stopped European war. The League did report on the Spanish situation, noting the 'failure of non-intervention'. On 6 November, the Committee met once again, with the plan to recognise the Nationalists as belligerents once significant progress had been made was finally accepted, down in part to Eden's patience. The Nationalists accepted on 20 November, the Republicans on 1 December. The former suggested 3,000 would be a reasonable number; this was, in reality the number of sick and unreliable Italians Franco wished to withdraw. This was countered by British suggestions fifteen or twenty thousand might be enough. These talks were subsumed by bilateral Anglo-Italian discussions. In trying to protect non-intervention in the Anglo-Italian meetings, which he grudgingly did, Eden would end up resigning from his post in the Foreign Office. On 17 March 1938, France reopened the border to arms traffic to the now weakened Republic. Between mid-April and mid-June, 21 British seamen were killed by attacks on British shipping in Spanish waters, {{as well as several}} Non-Intervention Committee observers.|$|E

5|$|The Peninsular War in Spain, {{along with}} the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville, {{escalated}} political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution. Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an open cabildo to <b>discuss</b> <b>it.</b> Azcuénaga attended it, and voted {{for the creation of a}} Junta with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. Azcuénaga lend his house to their secret meetings. Azcuénaga was appointed as a member of the new Primera Junta, and promoted to brigadier. The reasons of Azcuénaga's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists, Alzaguists, the military and the clergy; besides being from the armed forces, Azcuénaga had close ties with the rich people of the city.|$|E
5|$|The Z-4 Plan was a {{proposed}} basis for negotiations {{to end the}} Croatian War of Independence with a political settlement. It was drafted by Peter W. Galbraith, Leonid Kerestedjiants and Geert-Hinrich Ahrens {{on behalf of a}} mini-Contact Group comprising United Nations envoys and diplomats from the United States, Russia and the European Union. The co-chairs of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were closely involved in the political process surrounding the plan. The document was prepared in the final months of 1994 and early 1995 before being presented to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and the leaders of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 30 January 1995. Although Tuđman was displeased with the proposal, the RSK authorities—influenced by Serbian President Slobodan Milošević—refused to receive the document, let alone <b>discuss</b> <b>it.</b> Milošević was concerned that the plan might be used to force the settlement of a crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case {{continued}} on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton {{had attempted to}} discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to <b>discuss</b> <b>it.</b> Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton {{had told him that}} he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.|$|E
