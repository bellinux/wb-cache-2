5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is <b>found</b> <b>with</b> embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest {{they would be}} able to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E

5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} <b>found</b> <b>with</b> 17 clues, {{although}} finding {{them is not}} a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues have been <b>found</b> <b>with</b> 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of clues is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been <b>found</b> <b>with</b> two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of clues is minimal for this case.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{appears to}} be safe and {{effective}} to counteract the weight gain caused by antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is <b>found</b> <b>with</b> metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} <b>found</b> <b>with</b> Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tellurium}} is <b>found</b> <b>with</b> gold {{more often}} than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, <b>found</b> <b>with</b> conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E

5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} more {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been <b>found</b> <b>with</b> megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E
5|$|Feather mites of {{at least}} two species have been found on the storm petrel, with Halipeurus pelagicus {{occurring}} at much higher densities than Philoceanus robertsi. The flea Xenopsylla gratiosa and dermanyssid mites are commonly <b>found,</b> <b>with</b> lower numbers of ticks. These blood-sucking parasites slow the growth rate of nestlings and may affect their survival rate.|$|E
5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been <b>found</b> <b>with</b> stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
