5|$|Following {{his failure}} at Fredericksburg, Burnside was reassigned to the Department of the Ohio. The IX Corps, {{which he had}} {{formerly}} commanded, was reassigned with him. The 21st Massachusetts boarded trains for Cincinnati on March 28, 1863. They were then transported to Mount Sterling, Kentucky, to combat Confederate <b>guerrillas.</b> <b>In</b> April, due to the reduced numbers of the regiment (now about 200) several officers, being effectively without commands, chose to resign their commissions, including Col. William S. Clark. Command of the regiment passed to Lt. Col. George P. Hawkes.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, Japanese crackdowns {{on these}} <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> Luzon were {{widespread}} and brutal. The Japanese Army, Kempeitai and Filipino collaborators hunted down resistance fighters and anyone associated with them. One example happened to resistance leader Wenceslao Vinzons; {{leader of the}} successful guerilla movement in Bicol. After being betrayed to the Japanese by a Japanese collaborator, Vinzons was tortured to give up information on his resistance movement. Vinzons however, refused to cooperate, {{and he and his}} family, consisting of his father Gabino, his wife Liwayway, sister Milagros and children Aurora and Alexander, were bayoneted to death.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Cristina Kirchner continued {{the trials of}} military personnel involved in the Dirty War, started by her husband. There {{have been more than}} 500 people sentenced, and 1,000 convicted, in a process that was unprecedented in Latin America. De facto president Jorge Rafael Videla, who was convicted and given a life sentence in 1985 and pardoned years later, received a new life sentence in 2010. General Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, who waged war against the leftist <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> the northern Argentine provinces, received a life sentence as well.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the American and Philippines governments officially {{recognized}} some of {{the units}} and individuals who had fought against the Japanese, which led to benefits for the veterans but not all claims were upheld. There were 277 recognized guerrilla units out of over a thousand claimed and 260,715 individuals were recognized from nearly 1.3 million claims. These beneficiaries are only available to the guerrillas and veterans who have served for the Commonwealth, and doesn't include the brigand groups of the Huks and the Moros.

5|$|Donayre's {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{of the army}} was {{controversial}} from the start due to corruption allegations and an international incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular because at that time he was not serving as general {{of any of the}} three major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused of acquiring 50,000 American-made MREs— military rations— to supply troops deployed against Shining Path <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead of acquiring cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as <b>guerrillas.</b> <b>In</b> September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{commissioned}} as a {{pilot officer}} midway through his Korean service, Newham's next posting was with No. 78 (Fighter) Wing on Malta, where he flew de Havilland Vampires until 1955. The wing had been on garrison duty in Malta since July 1952, and Newham was one of five Korean War veterans who replaced pilots posted back to Australia. He married Jo Cranston in 1956; the couple had two daughters and a son. By November 1957, Newham had been promoted to flight lieutenant and was undergoing conversion training on the CAC Sabre. From 1958 to 1960 he served in Malaya with No. 3 Squadron, whose Sabres conducted operations against communist <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> {{the final years of}} the Malayan Emergency.|$|E

5|$|On 24 November 1942, the {{evacuation}} of the 2/2nd Australian Independent Company from Timor along with 150 Portuguese people {{was approved by the}} Allied Land Forces Headquarters. In response to this, Commodore Cuthbert Pope, the Naval Officer-in-Charge Darwin, organised an operation utilizing HMA Ships Kuru, Castlemaine and Armidale. The operation was to involve the three ships undertaking two voyages each, the first to take place on the night of 30 November/1 December and involve a trip to Betano, Timor, in which the ships were to land 50 fresh Dutch <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> the area along with supplies, and simultaneously withdraw 190 Dutch soldiers as well as the 150 Portuguese refugees. The second excursion was to be carried out on the night of 4/5 December, and entail the extraction of the 2/2nd Independent Company.|$|E
5|$|One seventh of the {{population}} and one fifth of the territory were in FRELIMO hands by 1967; at this time there were approximately 8000 <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> combat. During this period, Mondlane urged further expansion of the war effort, but also sought to retain the small strike groups. With the increasing cost of supply, more and more territory liberated from the Portuguese, and the adoption of measures to win the support of {{the population}}, it was at this time that Mondlane sought assistance from abroad, specifically the Soviet Union and China; from these benefactors, he obtained large-calibre machine guns, anti-aircraft rifles and 75mm recoilless rifles and 122mm rockets.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Entumbane uprising, {{also known}} as the Battle of Bulawayo or Entumbane II, {{occurred}} between 8 and 12 February 1981 in and around Bulawayo, Zimbabwe amid political tensions in the newly independent state. Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas, mainly in the city's western suburb of Entumbane, rebelled, creating a situation that threatened to develop into a fresh civil war, barely a year {{after the end of the}} Bush War. The Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) and other white-commanded elements of the former Rhodesian Security Forces, fighting for the Zimbabwean government as part of the new Zimbabwe National Army, put down the uprising. Groups of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) fighters attacked both ZIPRA and the government forces during the revolt, which followed a smaller outbreak of fighting between <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> November 1980.|$|E

5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} on 18 June 1948, {{prompted by a}} rise in Malayan Communist <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> Malaya (later Malaysia). Australia, {{as a member of}} the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, first deployed two RAAF squadrons to the region in 1950. In 1955, the Far East Strategic Reserve was created as a concentration of Commonwealth military forces (primarily British, New Zealand, and Australian) in Malaya for the protection of that nation from communist threats. Australia's commitment included two destroyers or frigates on station at any time, plus an annual visit by an aircraft carrier, and additional ships as needed. Training for the potentiality of war was the main occurrence for ships deployed to the Strategic Reserve, with RAN personnel gaining experience in working as part of a larger naval organisation.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{also took}} part in other Allied {{operations}} in the Mediterranean. Two RAAF squadrons, No.451Squadron (Spitfires) and No.458Squadron (Wellingtons), supported the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944. No.451Squadron was based in southern France in late August and September and when the operation ended both squadrons were moved to Italy, though No.451Squadron was transferred to Britain in December. No.459Squadron was based in the eastern Mediterranean until {{the last months of}} the war in Europe and attacked German targets in Greece and the Aegean Sea. In addition, 150Australians served with the Balkan Air Force, principally in No.148Squadron RAF. This special duties squadron dropped men and supplies to <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> Yugoslavia and attempted to supply the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell was {{subsequently}} posted to the British Army of the Rhine {{with the rest}} of the regiment, and then joined the King's African Rifles, and was posted to East Africa. Soon afterward, he saw action in Zanzibar with the KAR in breaking up disturbances between the island's Arab and African populations, which had begun during a general election and had descended into widespread rioting and clashes. He also participated in operations on the Northern Frontier District. At the time, Somali guerrillas were launching raids as part of a campaign to unite the region with Somalia, and the frontiers with other neighbouring states were also volatile. In one incident, Mitchell was searching for Somali <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> a low-flying helicopter, and an elephant attempted to attack the helicopter, nearly clipping it with its tusks. It has been claimed that while with the KAR Mitchell was instrumental in obtaining a commission for Idi Amin, who later became President of Uganda. Mitchell's familiarity with the Scottish clan system made him more comfortable with African tribal issues than was the case with his English contemporaries. Impressed by Mitchell and other Scottish officers, Amin would later adopt the title King of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia's Lisbon mission {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key {{link between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal bowed to British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in Lisbon remained open. With the Carnation Revolution of 1974, Portugal's African policy was suddenly reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories to maintain it, the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975. Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered {{the closure of the}} Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon formally closed on 1 May 1975.|$|E
5|$|She {{began her}} college {{studies at the}} University of La Plata. She studied {{psychology}} for a year, then dropped it and studied law instead. She met fellow student Néstor Kirchner in 1973. He introduced her to political debates. There were heated political controversies at the time caused by: {{the decline of the}} Argentine Revolution military government, the return of the former president Juan Perón from exile, the election of Héctor Cámpora as president of Argentina, and {{the early stages of the}} Dirty War. She became influenced by Peronism, left-wing politics, and anti-imperialism. Despite the presence of sympathizers of the Montoneros <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> La Plata, the Kirchners had never been involved themselves. Cristina and Néstor married in a civil ceremony on 9 May 1975. Her mother got them administrative jobs at her union. The 1976 Argentine coup d'état took place the following year. Cristina proposed to go to Río Gallegos, Néstor's home city, but he delayed their departure until his graduation on 3 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd King's {{had been}} on the Indian subcontinent since 1877 and had fought in the Second Afghan War. The Third Burmese War punctuated the battalion's {{overseas}} service in the 1880s. Intent on deposing Upper Burma's King Thibaw and imposing imperial rule, Britain issued an ultimatum consisting of demands that were rejected as anticipated. The invasion began in November 1885 {{in the form of the}} Burma Field Force, which progressed up the Irrawaddy River via transports, enabling the rapid capture of frontier forts and the capital Mandalay. After the capital's seizure, the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of Thibaw. A guerrilla campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma's annexation on 1 January 1886, lasting for at least five years. For more than a year, the King's operated in small groups pursuing <b>guerrillas</b> <b>in</b> the Burmese jungle. Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion had returned to India. In early 1900 the 2nd Battalion Liverpool Regiment was stationed at Gibraltar.|$|E
