5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{applications}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> include {{blood glucose}} monitoring systems to help manage diabetes mellitus. As the sensors employ an optical response, monitoring {{could be achieved}} using minimally invasive methods, one such example is the investigation of a contact lens that contains a boronic acid based sensor molecule to detect glucose levels within ocular fluids.|$|E

25|$|Western {{blotting}} is {{a fundamental}} technique of biochemistry and is therefore used by many researchers to prove different properties of proteins, based on molecular weight. Specifically, it has been employed by a research group with one publication depicting investigations of rapamycin treatment, acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and myocardial necrosis among many others. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> western blotting analysis helped confirm effective inhibition of myocardial mTOR kinase activities by analyzing protein molecular weights versus expected values. This study's conclusion: By using the western blot technique, the researchers were able to discover that by pre-treating healthy pigs with rapamycin before acute myocardial IRI, rapamycin is associated with decreased cardiac function and higher myocardial necrosis.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Sir Peter Medawar was {{appointed}} Mason Professor of Zoology at the university. His work involved investigating {{the phenomenon of}} tolerance and transplantation immunity. He collaborated with Rupert E. Billingham and they did research on problems of pigmentation and skin grafting in cattle. They utilized skin grafting to differentiate between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. Taking the earlier research of R. D. Owen into consideration, they concluded that actively acquired tolerance of homografts could be artificially reproduced. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He left Birmingham in 1951 and joined the faculty at University College London, where he continued his research on transplantation immunity. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Slack (2003) compares {{three groups}} that {{conducted}} biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved {{important as a}} site <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>research.</b> The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G.Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, {{over a long period}} of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.|$|E

500|$|The XB-70s were {{intended}} {{to be used for}} the advanced study of aerodynamics, propulsion, and other subjects related to large supersonic transports. The crew was reduced to only the two pilots, as a navigator and a bombardier were not needed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> role. The production order was reduced to three prototypes in March1961 with the third aircraft to incorporate improvements from the previous prototype. The order was later reduced to two experimental XB-70As, named Air Vehicle 1 and 2 (AV-1 and AV-2). XB-70 No. 1 was completed on 7 May 1964, and rolled out on 11 May 1964 at Palmdale, California. One report stated [...] "nothing like it existed anywhere". AV-2 was completed on 15 October 1964. The manufacture of the third prototype (AV-3) was canceled in July 1964 before completion. The first XB-70 carried out its maiden flight in September 1964 and many more test flights followed.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{reported}} that {{the ratio of the}} longitudinal to the transverse (radial and tangential) diffusion rates for wood ranges from about 100 at a moisture content of 5%, to 2 - 4 at a moisture content of 25% (Langrish and Walker, 1993). Radial diffusion is somewhat faster than tangential diffusion. Although longitudinal diffusion is most rapid, it is of practical importance only when short pieces are dried. Generally the timber boards are much longer than in width or thickness. For example, a typical size of a green board used <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> was 6 m long, 250mm in width and 43mm in thickness. If the boards are quartersawn, then the width will be in the radial direction whereas the thickness will be in tangential direction, and vice versa for plain-sawn boards. [...] Most of the moisture is removed from wood by lateral movement during drying.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} {{additional}} criticisms of some popular tests for diagnosis of APD. Tests that use tape-recorded American English {{have been shown to}} over-identify APD in speakers of other forms of English. Performance on a battery of non-verbal auditory tests devised by the Medical Research Council's Institute of Hearing Research was found to be heavily influenced by non-sensory task demands, and indices of APD had low reliability when this was controlled <b>for.</b> <b>This</b> <b>research</b> undermines the validity of APD as a distinct entity in its own right and suggests that {{the use of the term}} [...] "disorder" [...] itself is unwarranted. In a recent review of such diagnostic issues, it was recommended that children with suspected auditory processing impairments receive a holistic psychometric assessment including general intellectual ability, auditory memory, and attention, phonological processing, language, and literacy. The authors state that [...] "a clearer understanding of the relative contributions of perceptual and non-sensory, unimodal and supramodal factors to performance on psychoacoustic tests may well be the key to unravelling the clinical presentation of these individuals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} {{work of this}} period was {{an investigation of the}} influence of tea, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, {{and a number of other}} drugs on the capacity for doing work both muscular and mental. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>research</b> he was well fitted after his work under Kraepelin at Heidelberg. A great many of these experiments Rivers made on himself, and for this purpose gave up for a period of two years not only alcoholic beverages and tobacco, which was easy enough for him as he liked neither, but all tea, coffee and cocoa as well. Although the investigation was initially formed with physiological motives in mind, it soon became clear that a strong psychological influence was also involved in the act of taking the substances. Rivers realised that part of the effects- mental and physical- that substances had were caused psychologically by the excitement of knowing that one is indulging. In order, therefore, to eliminate [...] "all possible effects of suggestion, sensory stimulation and interest", Rivers made sure that the substances were disguised from him so that he was not aware, on any given occasion, whether he was taking a drug or a control substance. This was the first experiment of its kind to use this double-blind procedure and, in recognition of this momentous study, Rivers was appointed Croonian Lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians in 1906.|$|E
