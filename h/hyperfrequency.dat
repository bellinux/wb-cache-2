This kind of composites is very solicited for applications and miniaturization of the components circuits (cavities, antennas, substrates, etc.) in <b>hyperfrequency</b> electronics. In this study we have also highlighted the effect of the fillers nature and their concentrations on the behavior of these composites. The results obtained by time domain spectroscopy (TDS) have revealed the strong dependence of complex permittivity of the composite materials on both the nature and the concentration of conductive environment. Low frequency analysis (500 [*]MHz) has been investigated to determine the conductivity of composites which is related to the percolation phenomenon.

The {{effect of the}} growth temperature on the optical and structural properties of the e-beam evaporated ZnO is investigated. The hexagonal wurtzite structure is ascertained with X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction measurements have shown that e-beam evaporated ZnO films are highly c-axis oriented. Transmittance measurements showed that the best optical and structural quality of the e-beam evaporated ZnO occurred at 300 °C, correlating with X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Finally, thin films of ZnO evaporated by e-beam technique have served to vanish the compressive stress due to the sputtered piezoelectric ZnO, and therefore to ameliorate {{the quality of the}} fabricated resonators by stacking these ZnO layers fabricated by electron beam technique and rf magnetron sputtering, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{substitution}} of x(Ti-Co) for 2 x Fe cations reduces the strong axial anisotropy of the BaM-hexaferrite, which becomes in-plane for x = 1. 3. Then M(Ti-Co) substituted hexaferrite have been extensively investigated as promising material for magnetic recording or <b>hyperfrequency</b> wave absorption. But saturation magnetization and ordering temperature are unfortunately reduced {{in proportion to}} the substitution ratio. Doping barium hexafemte with A-Me elements (A = Ru, Ir; Me = Co, Zn) produces the same effects for a much smaller substitution ratio. Ordering temperature and saturation magnetization are consequently much higher. Large saturation magnetization associated with in-plane magnetic anisonopy allows to obtain high magnetic permeability values on a wide frequency range at high values of some GHz.

Nevertheless, high temperatures (> 1250 °C) are required to obtain well dense CZN ceramic, prohibiting any silver co-sintering (Tf (Ag) = 961 °C). For that reason, the sintering temperature lowering of CZN by glass phase’s additions has been investigated. This material is finally sinterable at low temperature with combined glass phase -lithium salt additions, and exhibits, at 1 MHz, very low dielectric losses, a relatively high dielectric constant with a good stability versus temperature. The 2 %weight of ZnO-SiO 2 -B 2 O 3 glass phase and 1 %wt of LiF added CZN sample sintered at 920 °C exhibits a relative density higher than 95 % and attractive dielectric properties: a dielectric constant εr of 22, low dielectrics losses (tan (δ) < 10 - 3), a temperature coefficient of the permittivity τε< 100 ppm. °C- 1, and an insulating resistivity higher than 1013 Ω. cm.

40|$|Double {{heterostructure}} diodes {{were widely}} {{studied in the}} 80 's; based {{on the use of}} "classical" III-V materials, i. e. based on (Ga, Al, In, As, P). Negative differential conductivities were predicted in these systems, making them highly interesting for <b>hyperfrequency</b> applications, but experimental results were always far from theoretical predictions, which resulted in a loss of interest for these systems. Recently, {{there has been a lot}} of efforts devoted to Nitride semiconductors, based on (Al,Ga,In) N alloys. These materials have been regarded as potential candidates for high frequency, high power applications, since they both exhibit high electron saturation velocities and high thermal and chemical stability. Moreover, although they usually contain a lot of growth defects, device properties were surprisingly good with regards to defect densities. In this work, we have modeled double heterostructure tunnel diodes based on AlGaN/GaN system. The extremely high conduction band offset in these materials, along with the quite low dielectric constants, and built-in electric fields (originating from both the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization), are extremely favorable parameters, which may renew the interest for such devices in this material system. It will be shown that the built-in electric field leads to a symmetric potential profile under a given external applied bias, which optimizes the transmission coefficient in the structure. We have calculated extremely high peak/valley ratios, which suggests that even mid quality samples could still exhibit interesting device properties...|$|E
