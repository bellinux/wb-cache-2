40|$|This article {{investigates the}} savings in {{inventory}} costs from the standardization of two computer modular instrument interface standards: NIM, an analog standard and CAMAC, a digital standard, at US nuclear laboratory installations. The major {{benefit from the}} standardization effort springs {{from the fact that}} the modular instruments are interchangeable, providing opportunities for reducing inventory costs. To that effect, the safety stock levels of <b>instrument</b> <b>modules</b> required for computer system configurations were estimated by an iterative procedure derived from a continuous Markov chain process with a one-to-one replacement policy. Since on the average, there are only two instruments of the same type per CAMAC or NIM crate, the opportunities for reducing inventory costs are a function of the number of crates and thus appear present only in medium and large systems. Large amounts of benefits of $ 206 m (in 1981 dollars) were estimated from this successful standardization effort. ...|$|R
