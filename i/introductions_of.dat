5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> A. altissima {{to countries}} outside of its native range {{were to the}} southern areas of Korea {{as well as to}} Japan. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction. Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} {{case of a}} classical biological control attempt in Canada involves the parasitoidal wasp Trichogramma minutum. Individuals were caught in New York State and released in Ontario gardens in 1882 by William Saunders, trained chemist and first Director of the Dominion Experimental Farms, for controlling the invasive currantworm Nematus ribesii. Between 1884 and 1908, the first Dominion Entomologist, James Fletcher, continued <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in Canada.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Sardinian ichnusae {{subspecies}} is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies' phenotypic diversity.|$|E
5|$|Usually, {{the episodes}} {{are focused on}} Adam's {{experiences}} at Charles Darwin Middle School due to his inability {{to fit in with}} his anthropomorphic schoolmates, the challenges that he must face (such as the presumed stupidity of his peers, being schooled in subjects of use only to animals, the <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> new students of odd, dangerous, or fictional species to the school or the misadventures that Adam stumbles into with them, or the common effects of adolescence as they are experienced by zoo animals).|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the range of}} the mockingbird {{expanded}} northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the twentieth century, regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Iowa, and New York. In western states such as California, the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties. Islands that saw <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> the mockingbird include Bermuda (in which it failed), Barbados, St. Helena, Socorro Island, the Cayman Islands and Tahiti.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United, {{the holders}} of the FA Cup, began their defence of the trophy {{with a home}} tie against non-league Exeter City. United had made several first team changes and {{struggled}} to find a breakthrough in the tie. Even with the second half <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo, the visitors held on for a goalless draw. The match was replayed at Exeter's home ground, St James Park on 19 January 2005. Ronaldo scored the opening goal of the match in the ninth minute and Wayne Rooney added a second, three minutes from normal time.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E

25|$|Recovered {{carcasses}} from gorillas contain multiple Ebola virus strains, which suggest multiple <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> the virus. Bodies decompose {{quickly and}} carcasses are not infectious after 3 to 4 days. Contact between gorilla groups is rare, suggesting transmission among gorilla groups is unlikely, and that outbreaks result from transmission between viral reservoir and animal populations.|$|E

25|$|Heard Island {{supports}} {{a relatively low}} number of terrestrial invertebrate species compared to other Southern Ocean islands, in parallel with the low species richness in the flora–that is, the island's isolation and limited ice-free area.

Positive associations between late <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> solids and food sensitization have to be interpreted with caution.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the Sami people's existence was documented by such writers as the Roman historian Tacitus. They have on uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the Fenni.

25|$|Fairyflies {{have been}} used for the {{biological}} pest control of various crop pests. They are especially valued for their ability to locate the eggs of their hosts. Of the fairyflies, the cosmopolitan genus Anagrus is the most promising, as it can parasitize a wide range of hosts. At least ten instances of successful <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> fairyflies to control pests are known.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s {{non-native}} European rabbits, {{an exotic}} invasive species, began to infest the islands {{as the result}} of the release of domestic rabbits on Smith Island.
