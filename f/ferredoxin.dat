Chlorella A 2 cells also contained two distinct <b>ferredoxins</b> whose retention times in the hydrophobic HPLC analysis were different from these of <b>ferredoxins</b> in A 1 cells. <b>Ferredoxins</b> were also isolated directly from an algal mat collected at another fresh-water pond, Lake Skallen Oike, Skallen. Cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial <b>ferredoxins</b> were separately extracted from the algal mat. Cyanobacterial <b>ferredoxins</b> extracted by sonication of the mat in 35 % saturated ammonium sulfate were separated into four peaks by the hydrophobic chromatography.

The process of nitrogen fixation requires an influx of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Nitrogen fixation is highly sensitive to the presence of oxygen, so Azotobacter developed a special defensive mechanism against oxygen, namely a significant intensification of metabolism that reduces the concentration of oxygen in the cells. Also, a special nitrogenase-protective protein [...] protects nitrogenase and is involved in protecting the cells from oxygen.

2500|$|Adrenodoxin (adrenal <b>ferredoxin)</b> is {{expressed}} in mammals including humans. [...] The human variant of adrenodoxin {{is referred to as}} <b>ferredoxin</b> 1. Adrenodoxin, putidaredoxin, and terpredoxin are soluble Fe2S2 proteins that act as single electron carriers. [...] In mitochondrial monooxygenase systems, adrenodoxin transfers an electron from [...] to membrane-bound cytochrome P450. In bacteria, putidaredoxin and terpredoxin serve as electron carriers between corresponding NADH-dependent <b>ferredoxin</b> reductases and soluble P450s. The exact functions of other members of this family are not known, although Escherichia coli Fdx is shown to be involved in biogenesis of Fe-S clusters.

2500|$|The Fe2S2 <b>ferredoxin</b> from Clostridium pasteurianum (Cp2FeFd) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as distinct protein family {{on the basis of}} its amino acid sequence, spectroscopic properties of its iron-sulfur cluster and the unique ligand swapping ability of two cysteine ligands to the [...] cluster. Although the physiological role of this <b>ferredoxin</b> remains unclear, a strong and specific interaction of Cp2FeFd with the molybdenum-iron protein of nitrogenase has been revealed. Homologous ferredoxins from Azotobacter vinelandii (Av2FeFdI) and Aquifex aeolicus (AaFd) have been characterized. The crystal structure of AaFd has been solved. AaFd exists as a dimer. The structure of AaFd monomer is different from other Fe2S2 ferredoxins. The fold belongs to the α+β class, with first four β-strands and two α-helices adopting a variant of the thioredoxin fold.|$|E

2500|$|A {{group of}} Fe4S4 ferredoxins, {{originally}} found in bacteria, has been termed [...] "bacterial-type".

2500|$|Biochemically, anoxygenic {{photosynthesis}} is {{very different}} from oxygenic photosynthesis. [...] Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the Z scheme of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH. [...] Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool. [...] In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center. [...] A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool. [...] In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein <b>ferredoxin,</b> an energetically favorable reaction. [...] In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center.

Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, ﬂavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, <b>ferredoxin,</b> molybdopterin, corrins and selenium.

2500|$|During the {{evolution}} of bacterial-type <b>ferredoxins,</b> intrasequence gene duplication, transposition and fusion events occurred, resulting in the appearance of proteins with multiple iron-sulfur centers.

40|$|Transition-metal/sulfide sites, {{especially}} those containing iron, {{are present in}} all forms of life and are found at the active centers {{of a wide variety}} of redox and catalytic proteins. These proteins include simple soluble electron-transfer agents (the <b>ferredoxins),</b> membrane-bound components of electron-transfer chains, and some of the most complex metalloenzymes, such as nitrogenase, hydrogenase, and xanthine oxidase. In this chapter we first review the chemistry of the Fe-S sites that occur in relatively simple rubredoxins and <b>ferredoxins,</b> and make note of the ubiquity of these sites in other metalloenzymes. We use these relatively simple systems to show the usefulness of spectroscopy and model-system studies for deducing bioinorganic structure and reactivity. We then direct our attention to the hydro-genase and nitrogenase enzyme systems, both of which use transition-metal-sulfur clusters to activate and evolve molecular hydrogen. I. IRON-SULFUR PROTEINS AND MODELS Iron sulfide proteins involved in electron transfer are called <b>ferredoxins</b> and rub-redoxins. * The <b>ferredoxins</b> were discovered first, and were originally classified as bacterial (containing Fe 4 S 4 clusters) and plant (containing FezSz clusters) fer-redoxins.
