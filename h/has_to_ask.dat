25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E
500|$|Don Draper (Jon Hamm) {{is being}} interviewed by a {{reporter}} from Advertising Age and declines to speak about his personal life. As a result, he comes across as arrogant and a cipher in the published story, a fact that senior partners Roger Sterling (John Slattery) and Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) lament, as they had hoped the interview would act as advertising for the company. The effects of the bad publicity is brought home just after Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) has sold a Jai Alai special to ABC, {{but it must be}} pulled because the client, Pete Campbell's (Vincent Kartheiser) college friend, Horace Cook Jr., nicknamed [...] "Ho Ho", fires the agency because Draper did not mention the client in his interview. Because of the agency's narrow client base, the loss is financially detrimental. Bert suggests Don do an interview with The Wall Street Journal to make amends, but Don demurs. Meanwhile, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) comes up with an idea to regain the Sugarberry Ham account. She hires two actresses to fight over a ham in a grocery store. The plan goes awry when the fight turns real and one of the women presses charges against the other for assault, and Peggy <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Don for bail and hush money. Don disapproves of the stunt (which was carried out behind his back), but Peggy points out that they did retain the account. Also new part-time member of the creative team has been added: Joey, who Peggy has a friendly relationship with.|$|E

Crime author Jonathan Goodman wrote that [...] "the shambling lunatic [...]. is in prison only because no mental institution is secure enough to guarantee his confinement". Many years later, a prison officer recalled seeing Straffen [...] "circling, banging the fence every couple of minutes", and that one fellow officer described Straffen as aloof and hostile: [...] "Never talks unless he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for something.

6000|$|At the Lord Mayor’s feast in November, {{the prime}} {{minister}} used menacing language. The policy of England, he said, was peace, but no country was so well prepared for war as ours. If England were {{to enter into a}} righteous war, her resources were inexhaustible. “She is not a country that, when she enters into a campaign, <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> herself whether she can support a second or a third campaign. She enters into a campaign which she will not terminate till right is done.” This was a hardly veiled threat to Russia, it was encouragement to Turkey, it was incitement to a war party in Great Britain. “The provocation offered by Disraeli at the Guildhall,” wrote Mr. Gladstone, “is almost incredible. Some new lights about his Judaic feeling in which he is both consistent and conscientious have come in upon me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|But, in the Wiraijuri mysteries, the master, Baiame, deceives {{the women}} {{as to the}} Mysteries! Shocking to US, but to deceive the women as to these arcana, is, to the Australian mind in general, {{necessary}} {{for the safety of}} the world. Moreover, we have heard of a lying spirit sent to deceive prophets in a much higher creed. Finally, in a myth of the Mystery of the Wiraijuri, Baiame is not omniscient. Indeed, even civilised races cannot keep on the level of these religious conceptions, and not to keep on that level is--mythology. Apollo, in the hymn to Hermes, sung on a sacred occasion, needs to ask an old vine-dresser for intelligence. Hyperion [...] "sees all and hears all," [...] but needs to be informed, by his daughters, of the slaughter of his kine. The Lord, in the Book of Job, <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Satan, [...] "Whence comest thou?" [...] Now for the sake of dramatic effect, now from pure inability to live on the level of his highest thought, man mythologises and anthropomorphises, in Greece or Israel, as in Australia.|$|E
