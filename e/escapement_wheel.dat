25|$|Since 2000, silicon {{has found}} a new use in {{mechanical}} watch movements. Several manufacturers of mechanical watch movements have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the <b>escapements</b> and balance <b>wheel</b> regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon <b>escapement</b> <b>wheels</b> and forks. Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following. Most of these parts for watch movements are manufactured by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).|$|R

50|$|Seen {{from the}} going train side, the great wheel with the winding barrel turns anti-clockwise, and the <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> turns clockwise.|$|E
50|$|The {{escapement}} arbor turns anti-clockwise. The pendulum theoretically swings {{once every}} second, and the <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> (brass) has 20 teeth, so the escapement arbor takes 40 seconds per turn.|$|E
50|$|The <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> has {{an outer}} {{diameter}} of 28 cm, and a width of 4 cm including the teeth. It has 4 spokes, each roughly 2 cm wide and 7mm thick.|$|E
50|$|On {{the first}} year of the new millennium, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin created a {{wristwatch}} that was irrevocably to change the face of modern horology. Their audacious Freak, a 7-day carrousel tourbillon with no hands or crown, is the world's first example of horological modern art. With its purity of design involving a movement that also gives indications of time, it still stands as the most creative innovation of the 21st century watch world. The Freak single-handedly smashed every convention known to haut de gamme watchmaking and opened the floodgates of creativity. As if this isn't enough, beating within it is the Dual Direct escapement, the first successful implementation of a non-lubricated alternative to the Swiss lever escapement. The Dual Direct <b>escapement's</b> <b>wheels</b> were made in silicium, another historical first in watchmaking history.|$|R
50|$|In 1864 Aaron Dennison and A. O. Bigelow {{set up the}} Tremont Watch Company in Boston. The {{idea was}} that fine parts (such as <b>escapements</b> and <b>wheel</b> trains) would be made in Switzerland (where {{journeyman}} wages were lower than American wages), and the larger parts (such as barrels plates) and assembling would be done in America.|$|R
50|$|The verge (or crown <b>wheel)</b> <b>escapement</b> is the {{earliest}} known type of mechanical escapement, the mechanism in a mechanical clock that controls its rate by allowing the gear train to advance at regular intervals or 'ticks'. Its origin is unknown. Verge escapements were used from the 14th century until the mid 19th century in clocks and pocketwatches. The name verge comes from the Latin virga, meaning stick or rod.|$|R

50|$|In 1993, Kiu Tai-Yu, a Chinese watchmaker {{residing}} in Hong Kong, created a semi-flying tourbillon with only an abbreviated carriage for the <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> and pallet fork, the upper pivot {{of the balance}} wheel being supported in a sapphire bridge.|$|E
50|$|The great {{wheel of}} the going train does one turn in 3600 seconds (1 hour), the <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> takes 303.1579 seconds for one turn, and the foliot does one full swing in 12.1263 seconds, one half swing in 6.06317 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|In horology, a {{tourbillon}} ( [...] ; [...] "whirlwind") is {{an addition}} to the mechanics of a watch escapement. Developed around 1795 and patented by the French-Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet on June 26, 1801, a tourbillon aims to counter the effects of gravity by mounting the <b>escapement</b> and balance <b>wheel</b> in a rotating cage, to negate the effect of gravity when the timepiece (thus the escapement) is stuck in a certain position. By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement assembly at a slow rate (typically about one revolution per minute), the tourbillon averages out positional errors.|$|R
50|$|Ahasuerus Fromanteel was apprenticed {{for seven}} years to a blacksmith, before {{settling}} in London in 1629. He began as a crafter of steeple clocks in East Smithfield, near the Tower of London, becoming a member of Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in 1631. He made lantern clocks with balance <b>wheel</b> <b>escapement,</b> and spring-driven table clocks, and joined the Clockmakers' Guild in 1632. In 1658 Fromanteel were taken before the guild for hiring more apprentices than the rules stipulated, {{which suggests that the}} firm was thriving. He developed microscopes and lenses, building on the work of Cornelis Drebbel and Benjamin Worsley in Amsterdam.|$|R
5000|$|An {{escapement}} is {{a device}} in mechanical {{watches and clocks}} that transfers energy to the timekeeping element (the [...] "impulse action") and allows the number of its oscillations to be counted (the [...] "locking action"). The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or balance wheel) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle and keep the timekeeper oscillating. The escapement is driven by force from a coiled spring or a suspended weight, transmitted through the timepiece's gear train. Each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel releases a tooth of the <b>escapement's</b> escape <b>wheel</b> gear, allowing the clock's gear train to advance or [...] "escape" [...] by a fixed amount. This regular periodic advancement moves the clock's hands forward at a steady rate. At {{the same time the}} tooth gives the timekeeping element a push, before another tooth catches on the escapement's pallet, returning the escapement to its [...] "locked" [...] state. The sudden stopping of the escapement's tooth is what generates the characteristic [...] "ticking" [...] sound heard in operating mechanical clocks and watches.|$|R
5000|$|... the <b>{{escapement}}</b> <b>wheel</b> and the pallets of {{the verge}} do not engage very exactly. This {{leads to the}} verge pallets [...] "falling" [...] onto the escapement teeth causing a lot of vibration in the verge and foliot. This could be down to wear over the years, and to a reconstruction of the pallets at an earlier overhaul ...|$|E
50|$|There is no {{pattern that}} is {{repeated}} every 60 minutes, but this {{might well have}} to do with the fact that the gear ratio of the going train is 95:8, meaning that it takes a full 8 hours until the same teeth on the <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> pinion and the great wheel engage again. A longer measuring interval (24 hours) might be necessary to observe repeat patterns.|$|E
50|$|In many escapements, the {{unlocking}} of the escapement involves sliding motion; for example, in {{the animation}} shown above, the pallets of the anchor slide against the <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> teeth as the pendulum swings. The pallets are often made of very hard {{materials such as}} polished stone (for example, artificial ruby), but even so they normally require lubrication. Since lubricating oil degrades over time due to evaporation, dust, oxidation, etc., periodic re-lubrication is needed. If this is not done, the timepiece may work unreliably or stop altogether, and the escapement components may be subjected to rapid wear. The increased reliability of modern watches is due primarily to the higher-quality oils used for lubrication. Lubricant lifetimes can be greater than five years in a high-quality watch.|$|E
5000|$|In early {{watches the}} pallet fork and the lever were made as {{separate}} components and joined together. In later watches {{they were made}} as a single component {{as shown in the}} picture. The combined component is often referred to simply as the [...] "lever". In a straight line Swiss lever type escapement, the lever is shaped like a 'T' or an anchor, which gives this escapement its alternative name of anchor escapement. The lever is pivoted in the center; in operation it rocks back and forth. [...] On the arms of the 'T' are angled surfaces called pallets which alternately engage the teeth of the <b>escapement's</b> escape <b>wheel.</b> The central shaft of the lever ends in a fork, which gives pushes to the balance wheel's impulse pin, which is set off center in a disk on the balance wheel's shaft. To reduce friction, the pallets are made of precisely shaped pieces of ruby jewel. The pallet which the teeth first contact is called the entry pallet, while the other one is called the exit pallet.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth wheel}} also drives the escape {{wheel of the}} lever <b>escapement.</b> The escape <b>wheel</b> teeth {{alternately}} catch on two fingers called pallets on {{the arms of the}} pallet lever, which rocks back and forth. The other end of the lever has a fork which engages with an upright impulse pin on the balance wheel shaft. Each time the balance wheel swings through its center position, it unlocks the lever, which releases one tooth of the escape wheel, allowing the watch's wheels to advance by a fixed amount, moving the hands forward. As the escape wheel turns, its tooth pushes against the lever, which gives the balance wheel a brief push, keeping it swinging back and forth.|$|R
5000|$|The detent is a {{detached}} escapement; {{it allows the}} balance wheel to swing undisturbed during most of its cycle, except the brief impulse period, which is only given once per cycle (every other swing). [...] Because the driving escape wheel tooth moves almost parallel to the pallet, the escapement has little friction and did not need oiling. For these reasons among others the detent was considered the most accurate <b>escapement</b> for balance <b>wheel</b> timepieces. [...] John Arnold {{was the first to}} use the detent escapement with an overcoil balance spring (patented 1782) and with this improvement his watches were the first really accurate pocket timekeepers, keeping time to within 1 or 2 seconds per day. These were produced from 1783 onwards.|$|R
50|$|In February 2007, Frederique Constant began {{production}} of the Silicon <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> (first introduced to the industry by Patek Philippe in 2005). The company introduced the Heart Beat Calibre FC 935 Silicium in October 2007. It implements new high tech materials to create better, more precise and more reliable mechanical watches. Deep reactive-ion etching is used to shape silicon wafers into escapement wheels, pallets, and plateaus. Silicon is lighter, harder and stronger than metal. Etched into tiny skeletal structures that {{would be impossible to}} form with metal, it becomes the featherweight heart of a mechanism that can run at a far higher accuracy. The silicon parts are virtually frictionless, so need no lubrication, and are immune to most external forces. And when bonded with a carbon coating, silicon's only real drawback, brittleness, can also be overcome.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{we are facing}} the power cut {{problems}} due to increasing demand of electricity, due {{to the development of}} industrial automation that requires huge power. Multinational companies (MNCs) also need certain Mega Watt (MW) interruption free power supply. This means that we may experience power cut much more than 60 % in the short future. To compensate this power demand, power production through hybrid energy harvesting from piezoelectric material, rotational solar panel(sun tracking) and vertical axis wind turbine methods are used. These concepts can be used separately or combined depending upon electric power requirement. This project is used to power up the domestic houses and to power up the street lights in two-way roads. Piezoelectric materials are integrated and placed beneath the road for a particular distance from the street light. Due to mechanical stress produced by the vehicle, piezoelectric material produces electrical energy which is then it is stored in grid battery. In Rotational solar panel method, pendulum concept is used to rotate the solar panel to track the sun. The aim of this is to get the maximum energy with little use of solar panel. This model has an <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel</b> and a pendulum. A hanging weight transfers energy to an <b>escapement</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is released periodically by a swinging pendulum. So that the panel attached to shaft tracks the sun. Power produced from this is also stored in the same battery through charge controller. Vertical axis wind turbine is placed between the two way roads. Opposite motion of vehicle on two ways road induces a rotational force on the turbine which in turn produces an electric power. This power is also stored in the same battery. The battery is then discharged to power up the street lights. Same set up is built on the roof top of the houses, so that hybrid energy produced from these is used to power the domestic houses. This idea makes the domestic houses and street light to be independent of Electricity Board power supply...|$|E
5000|$|The {{movement}} uses a mainspring as {{a source}} of energy and transmits it through gear train just like a traditional mechanical watch, but instead of an <b>escapement</b> and balance <b>wheel,</b> Seiko used the newly developed [...] "Tri-synchro regulator", which acts like a quartz movement. The Tri-synchro regulator has three main function: controlling the mechanical energy of the mainspring, generate electricity for the low consumption (~25 nanowatts) quartz crystal oscillator and generate a magnetic force to regulate the glide wheel. By replacing the traditional escapement with magnetic brake, the Spring Drive operates with lower noise and present a glide motion hand that shows continuous flow of time. The Spring Drive movement was also used {{as the basis for the}} first ever watch designed to be worn by an astronaut during a space walk, the aptly named Seiko Spring Drive Spacewalk.|$|R
50|$|A {{great leap}} forward in {{accuracy}} occurred in 1657 {{with the addition of}} the balance spring to the balance wheel, an invention disputed both at the time and ever since between Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens. Prior to this, the only force limiting the back and forth motion of the balance wheel under the force of the <b>escapement</b> was the <b>wheel's</b> inertia. This caused the wheel's period to be very sensitive to the force of the mainspring. The balance spring made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator, with a natural 'beat' resistant to disturbances. This increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the face from around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France. The increased accuracy of the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by other parts of the movement, igniting a two century wave of watchmaking innovation.|$|R
50|$|In the 1937 he {{constructed}} {{his first}} astronomical clock, showing standard and greenwich time, all solar and lunar cycles and phases, julian calendar, {{high and low}} tides and sunset/sunrise. The firmament is visualized on a two-dimensional dial, holes are drilled for the larger stars and the dial is illuminated from behind to make the stars visible in the evening. A switch allows the clock to be run forward and backwards in time. The clock is controlled by Sørnes' own invention, an electromagnetic balance <b>wheel</b> <b>escapement.</b> It feeds the system with a constant revolution of one rotation per second and is in this clock powered by two 1.5 V batteries. He experimented with the escapement for many years but eventually resorted to more traditional solutions. The accuracy of the celestial orbits suffered as the calculations were based on regular calendars without full correction of the irregularities. Around {{at the same time}} he designed and constructed a large reflecting telescope.|$|R
50|$|The detent or {{chronometer}} escapement {{is considered}} the most accurate of the balance <b>wheel</b> <b>escapements,</b> and was used in marine chronometers, although some precision watches during the 18th and 19th century also used it. The early form was invented by Pierre Le Roy in 1748, who created a pivoted detent type of escapement, though this was theoretically deficient. The first effective design of detent escapement was invented by John Arnold around 1775, but with the detent pivoted. This escapement was modified by Thomas Earnshaw in 1780 and patented by Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783, however as depicted in the patent it was unworkable. Arnold also designed a spring detent escapement but, with improved design, Earnshaw's version eventually prevailed as the basic idea underwent several minor modifications {{during the last decade}} of the 18th century. The final form appeared around 1800, and this design was used until mechanical chronometers became obsolete in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The lever escapement, {{invented by}} Thomas Mudge in 1759 and {{improved}} by Josiah Emery in 1785, gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain; {{it was also}} adopted by Abraham-Louis Breguet, but Swiss watchmakers (who by now were the chief suppliers of watches to most of Europe) mostly adhered to the cylinder until the 1860s. By about 1900, however, the lever was used in almost every watch made. In this <b>escapement</b> the escape <b>wheel</b> pushed on a T shaped 'lever', which was unlocked as the balance wheel swung through its centre position and gave the wheel a brief push before releasing it. The advantages of the lever was that it allowed the balance wheel to swing completely free during most of its cycle; due to 'locking' and 'draw' its action was very precise; and it was self-starting, so if the balance wheel was stopped by a jar it would start again.|$|R
50|$|It is {{considered}} to be a showcase design and intentionally exposes to plain view the various gears, wheels and springs within the movement itself. There is no official definition of a skeleton clock per se, but a major portion of the main parts of the timepiece should be openly visible from the front of the clock and most often from the back as well in order for it to be considered and accepted as a skeleton clock. The parts most commonly showcased by a skeleton design are those exhibiting either the most movement or the most attractive design. These may include, but are not limited to the <b>escapement,</b> balance <b>wheel</b> and balance spring, mainspring, and tourbillon. Generally there is either no dial present in a skeleton clock, the dial is clear, or it has been limited to a ring around the edge of the case to provide a mounting surface for the hour markers. In the case of skeleton wristwatches, the back will usually be made of sapphire crystal or another clear material that affords easy examination of the parts protected within both from the front and from behind.In addition, several authors have published construction manuals on skeleton clocks in clockmaking and model engineering journals in the UK and USA, several of which (UK) have ceased operations. However, the best known of these authors had the manuals reprinted in comb bound format and these are still available (2012). John Wilding in the UK wrote manuals on Large Wheel, Elegant Scroll Frame, Chrystal Wheel and Scissors. Bill Smith in the US wrote on Lyre, Grasshopper and Epicyclic skeleton clocks.|$|R
5000|$|The going {{train is}} the main gear train of the timepiece. It {{consists}} of the wheels that transmit {{the force of the}} timepiece's power source, the mainspring or weight, to the escapement to drive the pendulum or balance wheel. [...] The going train has two functions. First, it scales up the speed of rotation of the mainspring or weight pulley. This allows the use of a very strong, slow turning mainspring or heavy weight that will run the timepiece for days or weeks. Second, its gear ratios divide the rotation of the escape wheel into convenient time units of seconds, minutes, and hours, to turn the timepiece's hands. The going train wheels are the only ones under load in a timepiece, since they bear the constant torque of the mainspring which is applied to the <b>escapement,</b> so these <b>wheels</b> are the only ones that receive significant wear. [...] In watches and some high quality clocks their arbors have jewel bearings. The going train in a modern clock or watch consists of: ...|$|R
5000|$|The lever escapement, {{invented by}} Thomas Mudge in 1750, {{has been used}} in the vast {{majority}} of watches since the 19th century. Its advantages are (1) it is a [...] "detached" [...] escapement; unlike the cylinder or duplex <b>escapements</b> the balance <b>wheel</b> is only in contact with the lever during the short impulse period when it swings through its centre position and swings freely the rest of its cycle, increasing accuracy, and (2) it is a self-starting escapement, so if the watch is shaken so that the balance wheel stops, it will automatically start again. The original form was the rack lever escapement, in which the lever and the balance wheel were always in contact via a gear rack on the lever. Later, it was realized that all the teeth from the gears could be removed except one, and this created the detached lever escapement. British watchmakers used the English detached lever, in which the lever was at right angles to the balance wheel. Later Swiss and American manufacturers used the inline lever, in which the lever is inline between the balance wheel and the escape wheel; this is the form used in modern watches. In 1867 Georges Frederic Roskopf invented an inexpensive, less accurate form called the Roskopf or pin-pallet escapement, which was used in cheap [...] "dollar watches" [...] in the early 20th century and is still used in cheap alarm clocks and kitchen timers.|$|R
