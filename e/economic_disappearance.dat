40|$|Background: The {{consumption}} of omega- 3 (n– 3) and omega- 6 (n– 6) {{essential fatty acids}} in Western diets {{is thought to have}} changed markedly during the 20 th century. Objective: We sought to quantify changes in the apparent {{consumption of}} essential fatty acids in the United States from 1909 to 1999. Design:We calculated the estimated per capita consumption of food commodities and availability of essential fatty acids from 373 food commodities by using <b>economic</b> <b>disappearance</b> data for each year from 1909 to 1999. Nutrient compositions for 1909 were modeled by using current foods (1909 -C) and foods produced by traditional early 20 th century practices (1909 -T). Results: The estimated per capita consumption of soybean oil increased. 1000 -fold from 1909 to 1999. The availability of linoleic acid (LA) increased from 2. 79 % to 7. 21 % of energy (P, 0. 000001), whereas the availability of a-linolenic acid (ALA) increased from 0. 39 % to 0. 72 % of energy by using 1909 -C modeling. By using 1909 -T modeling, LA was 2. 23 % of energy, and ALA was 0. 35 % of energy. The ratio of LA to ALA increased from 6. 4 in 1909 to 10. 0 in 1999. The 1909 -T but not the 1909 -C data showed substantial declines in dietary availability (percentage of energy) of n 26 arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Predicted net effects of these dietary changes included declines in tissue n– 3 highly unsaturated fatty acid status (36. 81 %, 1909 -T; 31. 28 %, 1909 -C; 22. 95 %, 1999) and declines in the estimated omega- 3 index (8. 28, 1909 -T; 6. 51, 1909 -C; 3. 84, 1999). Conclusion: The apparent increased consumption of LA, which was primarily from soybean oil, has likely decreased tissue concentrations of EPA and DHA during the 20 th century.

30|$|At this stage, most {{countries}} in the world have become the aging society, and China is no exception. China became the aging society in 2000, 1 and population aging is increasing in the following years. The proportion of population at the age of 60 and age of 65 and above reached 15.53 and 10.06 % 2 in 2014, which increased by 5.2 and 3.06 respectively. One of the main reasons for China’s entering into the aging society is the one-child policy implemented since 1978 (Wang, 2010). The implementation of “one-child policy” has reduced the total fertility rate, 3 as well as the newly born population (namely low fertility), which contributes to the increasing population aging. The population aging has brought a series of problems and negative effects, such as the decline of <b>economic</b> growth, <b>disappearance</b> of demographic dividend, rising payment pressure of China’s pension insurance fund, 4 even the payment crisis 5 and so on (Peng and Hu 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{meaning of}} Say's Law may seem {{an issue of}} little {{relevance}} to economists today. It would seem, {{on the face of}} it, of interest only to historians of economics. Whatever Say's Law might mean, the one thing we economists know, or at least think we know, is that it was comprehensively refuted by John Maynard Keynes in his "General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. " Knowing the meaning of this ancient economic doctrine would appear a matter of no contemporary importance. Part of a Symposium entitled, "Say's Law Revisited", this paper argues that the disappearance of the guiding principles underlying Say's Law has grievously damaged our understanding of <b>economic</b> processes. The <b>disappearance</b> of Say's Law from amongst the conceptual tools employed by economists is in fact Keynes's most enduring legacy. Employment; Money...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} {{integration of immigrants}} has been a much-studied topic in social science research, yet the research on high-skilled immigration has been scant. As the U. S. becomes increasingly reliant on foreign labor, foreign-trained immigrants may experience a very different adaptive pathway from the dominant assimilation paradigm. The stylized portrait of immigrant incorporation as posited by the classical assimilation framework has immigrants facing initial economic disadvantages. Through assimilation – the learning of host-country ways and practices – immigrants are expected to climb the socioeconomic ladder and eventually reach parity with natives. The main assumption is that Americanization is invariably better than retaining ethnic roots and once assimilated, upward mobility is inevitable. However, structural changes {{in the economy and}} the socioeconomic diversity of contemporary immigrants have called the classical assimilation paradigm into question. The overarching aim is to test whether classical assimilation is still a sweeping and necessary process for <b>economic</b> convergence. The <b>disappearance</b> of the persistent Asian-white earnings gap with the inclusion of place of education serves as the crux in motivating this research. When the location of one’s education is partitioned into foreign- or domestic-acquired, the between-race gap disappears, revealing a within-race disparity along the lines of place of education. What is it about foreign education that contributes to depressed earnings? This dissertation attempts to uncover the underlying mechanisms that link foreign education to lower earnings. To operationalize assimilation, this dissertation borrows the Gordonian understanding of assimilation – the sharing of norms and practices with natives. The more-assimilated do what the natives do, which in this case, is the acquisition of US-based education. Conversely, the less-assimilated are conceptualized to be the foreign-educated, who deviate from normative “American” behavior. The three essays explore the resilience of the foreign education penalty thesis in light of the current economy and the socioeconomic diversity within the contemporary immigrant pool. General findings indicate that foreign education is not universally penalized. For workers who have good skills, {{even in the absence of}} assimilation, they are able to reach economic convergence with their more-assimilated counterparts, rendering the high-skilled a particular threat to the classical assimilation thesis...|$|R
