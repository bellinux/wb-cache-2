Sherman saw after night, from a high point, the road burning for miles. The defence of {{the railroad}} by our troops was very gallant, {{but they could not}} <b>hold</b> <b>points</b> between their intrenched positions against Hood's whole army; in fact they made no attempt to do so; but generally the intrenched positions were held, as well as important bridges, and store located at them. Allatoona, for instance, was defended by a small force of men under the command of General Corse, one of the very able and efficient volunteer officers produced by the war. He, with a small force, was cut off from the remainder of the National army and was attacked with great vigor by many times his own number. Sherman from his high position could see the battle raging, with the Confederate troops between him and his subordinate. He sent men, of course, to raise the temporary siege, but the time that would be necessarily consumed in reaching Corse, would be so great that all occupying the intrenchments might be dead. Corse was a man who would never surrender. From a high position some of Sherman's signal corps discovered a signal flag waving from a hole in the block house at Allatoona. It was from Corse. He had been shot through the face, but he signalled to his chief a message which left no doubt of his determination to hold his post at all hazards. It was at this point probably, that Sherman first realized that with the forces at his disposal, the keeping open of his line of communication with the North would be impossible if he expected to retain any force with which to operate offensively beyond Atlanta. He proposed, therefore, to destroy the roads back to Chattanooga, when all ready to move, and leave the latter place garrisoned. Yet, before abandoning the railroad, it was necessary that he should repair damages already done, and hold the road until he could get forward such supplies, ordnance stores and small rations, as he wanted to carry with him on his proposed march, and to return to the north his surplus artillery; his object being to move light and to have no more artillery than could be used to advantage on the field.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{applications}} of gamma ray spectroscopy for D&D process development, inventory reduction, safety analysis and facility management {{are discussed in}} this paper. These {{applications of}} gamma spectroscopy were developed and implemented during the Risk Reduction Program (RPP) to successfully downgrade the Heavy Element Facility (B 251) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) from a Category II Nuclear Facility to a Radiological Facility. Non-destructive assay in general, gamma spectroscopy in particular, {{were found to be}} important tools in project management, work planning, and work control (''Expect the unexpected and confirm the expected''), minimizing worker dose, and resulted in significant safety improvements and operational efficiencies. Inventory reduction activities utilized gamma spectroscopy to identify and confirm isotopics of legacy inventory, ingrowth of daughter products and the presence of process impurities; quantify inventory; prioritize work activities for project management; and to supply information to satisfy shipper/receiver documentation requirements. D&D activities utilize in-situ gamma spectroscopy to identify and confirm isotopics of legacy contamination; quantify contamination levels and monitor the progress of decontamination efforts; and determine the point of diminishing returns in decontaminating enclosures and glove boxes containing high specific activity isotopes such as {sup 244 }Cm and {sup 238 }Pu. In-situ gamma spectroscopy provided quantitative comparisons of several decontamination techniques (e. g. TLC-free Stripcoat{trademark}, Radiac{trademark} wash, acid wash, scrubbing) and was used as a part of an iterative process to determine the appropriate level of decontamination and optimal cost to benefit ratio. Facility management followed a formal, rigorous process utilizing an independent, state certified, peer-reviewed gamma spectroscopy program, in conjunction with other characterization techniques, process knowledge, and historical records, to provide information for work planning, work prioritization, work control, and safety analyses (e. g. development of <b>hold</b> <b>points,</b> stop work points); and resulted in B 251 successfully achieving Radiological status on schedule.

The objective of this work-in-progress is to develop a compact instrument for strain measurement consisting of a camera, image capture card, PC, software, and light source. The instrument is portable and useful in a variety of applications and environments. A digital camera with a microscopic lens is connected to an image capture card in a PC. Commercially available image processing software is used to control the image capture and image processing steps leading up to displacement/strain measurement.

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{minimize}} security risks, proliferation hazards, and safety risks in the design of new nuclear facilities in a global environment of nuclear power expansion, while improving the synergy of major design features and raising operational efficiency. In 2008, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) launched the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) covering many safeguards areas. One of these, launched by NNSA with support of the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy, was a multi-laboratory project, led by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to develop safeguards by design. The proposed Safeguards-by-Design (SBD) process has been developed as a structured approach to ensure the timely, efficient, and cost effective integration of international safeguards and other nonproliferation barriers with national material control and accountability, physical security, and safety objectives into the overall design process for the nuclear facility lifecycle. A graded, iterative process was developed to integrate these areas throughout the project phases. It identified activities, deliverables, interfaces, and <b>hold</b> <b>points</b> covering both domestic regulatory requirements and international safeguards using the DOE regulatory environment as exemplar to provide a framework and guidance for project management and integration of safety with security during design. Further work, reported in this paper, created a generalized SBD process which could also be employed within the licensed nuclear industry and internationally for design of new facilities. Several tools for integrating safeguards, safety, and security into design are discussed here. SBD appears complementary to the EFCOG TROSSI process for security and safety integration created in 2006, which focuses on standardized upgrades to enable existing DOE facilities to meet a more severe design basis threat.

40|$|Orbital {{rendezvous}} involves {{execution of}} a sequence of maneuvers by a chaser vehicle to bring the chaser to a desired state relative to a target vehicle while meeting intermediate and final relative constraints. Intermediate and final relative constraints are necessary to meet a multitude of requirements such as to control approach direction, ensure relative position is adequate for operation of space-to-space communication systems and relative sensors, provide fail-safe trajectory features, and provide contingency <b>hold</b> <b>points.</b> The effect of maneuvers on constraints is often coupled, so the maneuvers must be solved for as a set. For example, maneuvers that affect orbital energy change both the chaser's height and downrange position relative to the target vehicle. Rendezvous designers use experience and rules-of-thumb to design a sequence of maneuvers and constraints. A non-iterative method is presented for targeting a rendezvous scenario that includes a sequence of maneuvers and relative constraints. This method {{is referred to as}} Multi-Maneuver Clohessy-Wiltshire Targeting (MM_CW_TGT). When a single maneuver is targeted to a single relative position, the classic CW targeting solution is obtained. The MM_CW_TGT method involves manipulation of the CW state transition matrix to form a linear system. As a starting point for forming the algorithm, the effects of a series of impulsive maneuvers on the state are derived. Simple and moderately complex examples are used to demonstrate the pattern of the resulting linear system. The general form of the pattern results in an algorithm for formation of the linear system. The resulting linear system relates the effect of maneuver components and initial conditions on relative constraints specified by the rendezvous designer. Solution of the linear system includes the straight-forward inverse of a square matrix. Inversion of the square matrix is assured if the designer poses a controllable scenario - a scenario where the the constraints can be met by the sequence of maneuvers. Matrices in the linear system are dependent on selection of maneuvers and constraints by the designer, but the matrices are independent of the chaser's initial conditions. For scenarios where the sequence of maneuvers and constraints are fixed, the linear system can be formed and the square matrix inverted prior to real-time operations. Example solutions are presented for several rendezvous scenarios to illustrate the utility of the method. The MM_CW_TGT method has been used during the preliminary design of rendezvous scenarios and is expected to be useful for iterative methods in the generation of an initial guess and corrections...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{autonomous}} trajectory planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR), commencing from far-range rendezvous and {{up to a point}} just before docking. Unlike typical rendezvous missions, the target in ADR is not designed for rendezvous and capture; it is usually uncooperative and possibly tumbling. If the satellite is unpassivated, then there is the added risk of explosion, while the presence of large appendages can make the satellite fragile. A case in point is Envisat, European Space Agency's largest satellite (about 8000 kg) that went defunct in 2012 and is currently, their prime concern for ADR. Most past and current technology for guidance is based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) equations, which are limited in terms of application - they use linearized dynamics, need circular orbits, employ impulsive burns, and require the user to provide some initial guess for the solution. Realistic final approach involves a number of trajectory constraints, like those on docking axis alignment, approach cone angle, keep-out-sphere, station-keeping and <b>hold</b> <b>points,</b> which are hard to include with CW-equations. Further, {{there is a need to}} make the system autonomous so that it can handle off-nominal situations as well. Convex optimization problems are a class of problems that are nearly as easy to solve as linear problems, but are more general in their scope of application. They can handle some non-linear constraints, be solved in polynomial time and are guaranteed to give global minimum. Inspired from the recent development of convex-optimization based trajectory-planning technique by Liu (Autonomous trajectory planning by convex optimization, PhD thesis, Iowa State University, 2013), a guidance algorithm is developed for the Envisat mission. In comparision with Liu's algorithm, it shows faster convergence (upto 5 times faster), improved accuracy (by an order of 2), and low computational cost (upto 40 % in specific cases). Additionally, a method to automate the problem formulation in conic form is provided, so interfacing software can be skipped and the problem can be solved upto 9 times quicker. The guidance algorithm is able to handle all constraints of the Envisat mission, with the exception of forced motion constraint inside the keep-out-sphere. An alternative formulation is suggested which is moderately successful. The algorithm is also able to generate solutions for various attitude scenarios of Envisat. However, it is found that the method is not reliable, as some times feasible problems are found to be infeasible, or the solution is over/under estimated. Also, despite the improvement in accuracy, it still deviates substantially from the computed path, and needs a path-tracking mechanism. A PID controller is found to be sufficient for this purpose. A novel work-around to include perturbations was successfully demonstrated as well. To summarize, although the convex-optimization based guidance method has very specific advantages over CW-equations, there is a lot left to be improved with respect to robustness and autonomy.
