They were {{developed}} several {{hours into the}} session, though according to BloodPop, [...] "Every few days, a lyric would change and it'd get better and better". In an interview for BBC Radio 1, Gaga explained that they [...] "would bounce lyrics back and forth", adding: [...] "We stripped everything away. Changed the melody, shifted it. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> a piano, Kevin was on guitar, Mark was on the bass." [...] Recording took place at various studios across the United States {{to fit in with}} each contributor's schedule. In Malibu, they recorded at Shangri-La Studios, which BloodPop preferred since it was outside the influence of city life. A few days of recording also took place at Gaga's home, and her vocals were recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|In an eighth-grade {{commencement}} address entitled “Humanity's Next Great Adventure,” {{given at}} a school in San Mateo, California, in 2002, Clancey recalled his own school years, when he “always got extra credit in eighth grade science, answering quiz questions about the latest Gemini two-person launches, getting us ready for the {{first trip to the}} moon in three years. I used to read these stories in the New York Times--absorbing every word. And of course when Star Trek began on TV in September, I watched the first episode and haven't missed any in 36 years. So space travel was on my mind as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> MY eighth grade graduation, and it's probably no coincidence that I work for NASA today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first edition}} was {{published}} in 1941, with the subtitle then being 'An attempt to re-interpret' rather than as later 'to clarify'. Cleckley says in the preface that the book [...] "grew out of an old conviction which increased during several years while <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> staff meetings in a large neuropsychiatric hospital." [...] He added that after commencing full-time teaching duties he found similar patients to be as prevalent in a general hospital, outpatient clinic and the community. In later editions he explains that the basic concepts presented in 1941 were based primarily on [...] "adult male psychopaths hospitalized in a closed institution" [...] for several years. Cleckley had worked {{for a number of}} years at a United States Veterans (military) Administration hospital, before taking up full-time teaching responsibilities at the University of Georgia School of Medicine.|$|E

2500|$|In 1876, Anna {{visited the}} Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia where she saw {{an exhibit of}} {{educational}} blocks created by Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel. The blocks, known as Froebel Gifts, were the foundation of his innovative kindergarten curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: [...] "For several years <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the little Kindergarten table-top… and played… with the cube, the sphere and the triangle—these smooth wooden maple blocks… All are in my fingers to this day… [...] " [...] Many of Wright's buildings are notable for their geometrical clarity.|$|E

60|$|Ralph {{had drawn}} the Times towards him, {{and he did}} not notice my start. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> him in blank amazement.|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> aghast <b>at</b> his penetration. After a pause he said carelessly, as if {{dismissing the}} subject: [...] "Besides, I hear the {{rain on the}} window. Listen." ...|$|R
60|$|May 5.--A moist rainy day, mild, however, and {{promising}} good weather. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> my desk the whole day, {{and worked at}} Gillies's review. So was the day exhausted.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{dinner in}} my prime, And glimpsed {{my face in}} the sideboard-glass, And started as if I had seen a crime, And prayed the ghastly show might pass.|$|E
60|$|While {{busy with}} what the waiter had brought, I saw Mr. Allen Price enter. Luckily the table <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> was full, and he was {{compelled}} to take a seat some distance from me.|$|E

60|$|The {{letters to}} the lawyer and to Mr. Fairlie were still to be written, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> once without a moment's {{hesitation}} to devote myself to them.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{and gazed}} <b>at</b> Miss Laniston without comprehending what I had heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} else to do, {{because it was the}} vacation, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my {{inclination}} to apply." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah, {{dear old}} times! there {{once it was}} my hap, [...] Perched on a stool, to wear the long-eared cap; [...] From books degraded, there <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> ease, [...] A drone, the envy of {{compulsory}} bees." ...|$|E
60|$|Aurelia {{was still}} on the stoop. The moon was higher and the ivy shadows were deeper. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> her side and we watched a little cloud tilt at the {{drifting}} moon and go asunder quite pale and discomfited.|$|E
60|$|And {{no longer}} master of myself, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> {{the table and}} hid my face, shaken by great sobs, {{to think that this}} was my return for his kindness.|$|R
60|$|In the back, where a {{stage was}} located, {{were a number}} of small tables. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> one of these and had a waiter bring me a glass of soda water.|$|R

6000|$|He {{swallowed}} {{some wine}} {{and then sat}} up, leaning against me as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{the bottom of the}} stairs, quite himself again, and assuring us that he was not hurt; Perrault never touched him--"Threatened you, then," [...] said Fulk.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{came after}} dinner one evening and talked in the office. She made a white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues of my big window. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{my desk and}} tore a quill pen to pieces as I talked.|$|E
60|$|ON TUESDAY, the 20th of February, while <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> my master's {{work in the}} evening, he came in, looking sad, {{and said}} it had been decided to begin the trial at eight o'clock the next morning, and I must get ready to assist him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down again}} <b>at</b> my desk, and made {{another attempt to}} write to Mr. Playmore.|$|R
60|$|And I was so {{amazed that}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> and looked <b>at</b> Pomona {{without saying a}} word.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to build a cathedral one of these days," [...] said I to my wife, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> the slant line of light made by the {{afternoon}} sun on our picture of the Cathedral of Milan.|$|R
6000|$|January 23.--Still severe frost, {{annoying}} to sore fingers.

60|$|On {{the third}} morning, at break of day, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the {{steering}} oar, {{an hour or}} two previous having relieved Jarl, now fast asleep.

60|$|It was late, and we {{had eaten}} and drunk together. He was lying back in an easy-chair, flushed, and strange to say, wonderfully handsome.

6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} had a good heart," [...] said my mother, softly, to me, looking over to Uncle Chipperton, who was telling my father, for the second time, just how I looked, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>at</b> the long table.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} ceased talking and fell fast asleep, leaving me awake, {{seated on a}} chest with my face bent over my knees between my hands.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> the window, where I {{could just}} discover, {{here and there}} between the trees, the glimmer of {{the waters of the}} lake. I thought to myself: [...] "Thus far my mortal journey has brought me. Why not end it here?" ...|$|R
