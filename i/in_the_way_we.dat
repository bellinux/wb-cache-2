[...] "In doing so we are acknowledging not so much our sameness to othersor our difference, but rather the commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because {{each one of us}} is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of absolute similarities and a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, <b>we</b> find similarities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> are different from one another and differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> are <b>the</b> same.

25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we start talking about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

The album featured a peculiar cover photo of Markley and the Harris brothers sitting bare-chested in a silver bathroom, and a bold declaration on the backside: [...] "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to say everything we wanted to say, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> wanted to say it". For the first time, each track was credited either {{in whole or in}} part to members of the WCPAEB; however, Markley's manic narratives and questionable lyrical content (particularly young girls) dominate the record. An edited version of the Morgan-Markley composition [...] "Smell of Incense" [...] was issued just ahead of Vol. 2 (Breaking Through), but it failed to chart. The Dallas psychedelic pop group Southwest FOB covered the song in 1968, which reached No.56 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Vol. 2 (Breaking Through) also features the anti-war song [...] "Suppose They Gave a War and No One Comes", the full version of [...] "Smell of Incense", and a rare instance of Markley singing is found on [...] "Unfree Child".|$|E

2500|$|The total {{result of}} all these (and many more) {{contemporary}} effects is that {{the growth of the}} profit volume is underestimated, and that the growth of the capital stock is exaggerated. The effect is that the overall profit rate seems to fall, although in reality it does not fall, or not nearly as much. In general, the orthodox revolutionary classical Marxist data constructs, based on value-added statistics and the PIM method, lack the scientific accuracy and reliability required to prove whether very long-run trends in profitability are up or down. At best, they offer an accurate indicator of shortterm trends (5–7 years). For example, no economist on record has ever denied that between 1967 and 1973 the average rate of profit fell in the OECD area, but there has been dispute about how much it fell, and why. Michael Perelman concluded that [...] "Although empirical work is undeniably important, we should be more modest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> regard it.

[...] The company performed 48 weeks per year, mostly on tour, usually with winter seasons in London. [...] Reed appeared in the chorus and was given several smaller roles: Associate (1952–55) in Trial by Jury, Major Murgatroyd in Patience (1952–59), Second Citizen in The Yeomen of the Guard (1952–59), Annibale (1952–59) and Antonio (1953–59) in The Gondoliers (a role that took advantage of his dancing skills), and Mr. Cox in Cox and Box (1957–59). He was coached in his own roles and those he understudied by Eleanor Evans. the company's stage director. [...] In 1955, Reed began to play the Learned Judge in Trial. [...] He also substituted for Pratt occasionally, including when Pratt was ill in March and April 1959.|$|E

In 2000, Gwen Stefani was invited to sing and perform with the Dolls and brought along Interscope Geffen A chairman Jimmy Iovine and then-president of A Records; both took interest into turning it in a singing group.
