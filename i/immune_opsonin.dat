40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus is an {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen {{that typically}} infects the lungs of immunocompromised patients {{leading to a}} high mortality. H-Ficolin, an innate <b>immune</b> <b>opsonin,</b> is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells and could participate in lung defences against infections. Here, we used the human type II alveolar epithelial cell line, A 549, to determine the involvement of H-ficolin in fungal defence. Additionally, we investigated the presence of H-ficolin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from transplant patients during pneumonia. H-Ficolin exhibited demonstrable binding to A.  fumigatus conidia via l-fucose, d-mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues in a calcium- and pH-dependent manner. Moreover, recognition led to lectin complement pathway activation and enhanced fungal association with A 549 cells. Following recognition, H-ficolin opsonization manifested an increase in interleukin- 8 production from A 549 cells, which involved activation of the intracellular signalling pathways mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase 1 / 2, p 38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Finally, H-ficolin concentrations were significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with lung infections compared with control subjects (n =  16; P =  0 · 00726). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis further highlighted the potential of H-ficolin as a diagnostic marker for lung infection (area under the curve =  0 · 77; P <  0 · 0001). Hence, H-ficolin participates in A.  fumigatus defence through the activation of the lectin complement pathway, enhanced fungus-host interactions and modulated immune responses...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{the nature}} and {{function}} of the antigenic components of Staphylococc~ aureus is limited, particularly with respect to those factors which endow the organism with pathogenicity and virulence. A substantial body of information is available concerning the extracellular products of the organism which have the potential of altering host tissues and body fluids; e. g., coagulase, the hemolysins, fibrinolysin, and leucocidin. However, none of these substances has thus far been shown to be a major determinant of the initiation and persistence of staphylococcal disease. Phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria by host leucocytes constitute the primary defense against microbial invasion. It is well known that efficient phagocytosis of many virulent bacteria requires the presence of specific <b>immune</b> <b>opsonins.</b> Thus, in the absence of antibody against the capsular polysaccharides of pneumococci, these organisms are not readily phagocyted and overwhelming microbial invasion may ensue. In the presence of specific antisera the anti-phagocytic properties of the surface polysaccharides are neutralized and the organisms are readily ingested. The role of <b>immune</b> <b>opsonins</b> in experimental and clinical staphylococcal diseas...|$|R
40|$|The high {{variability}} in infectivity of Diplococcus intracellularis makes it impracticable to standardize the antimeningitis serum {{on the basis}} of the virulence of the diplococcus. The irregularity of reaction of small animals to the poison or endotoxin of Diplococcus intracellularis makes it impracticable to standardize the antimeningitis serum {{on the basis of}} endotoxic value. The want of uniformity in the complement-binding power of the antimeningitis serum, and the absence of established relation between complement-binding power and therapeutic activity make the employment of this method of standardization impracticable. The part taken by specific opsonins in promoting recovery from infection with Diplococcus intracellularis suggests their employment as a measure of the therapeutic activity of the antiserum. Methods of quantitative estimation of opsonic content of the antimeningitis serum being available, it would seem advantageous to adopt for the present as a standard of value a definite and suitable strength in opsonins of the antimeningitis serum. As a definite and suitable standard of strength a minimum dilution activity of a 1 to 5, 000 dilution of the antiserum is proposed. Since the <b>immune</b> <b>opsonins</b> of the antimeningitis serum appear to be highly durable under proper conditions of refrigeration of the antiserum, the test proposed will be applicable when the antimeningitis serum shall have become an article of commerce...|$|R
40|$|The pentraxin C-reactive protein (CRP), {{an innate}} <b>immune</b> system <b>opsonin</b> which binds nuclear debris and {{apoptotic}} bodies, may protect against autoimmunity. A relative deficiency of CRP levels {{in patients with}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might contribute to altered handling of self-antigens. We report that the proximal 50 promoter region of CRP contains several polymorphisms that exhibit association with SLE in multiple populations. Strongest association was observed at the proximal promoter single nucleotide poly-morphism (SNP) rs 3093061 (CRP- 707) (P 5 6. 41 3 1027 and P 5 2. 13 3 1026 in African-American and Caucasian case–control samples respectively). This association remains after adjustment for admixture. Linkage disequilibrium exists between SNPs in the proximal promoter and association of functional haplotypes containing rs 3091244 /rs 3093062 (CRP- 409 /- 390) appear {{to be driven by}} the rs 3093061 (CRP- 707) association. These data demonstrate that rs 3093061 at the- 707 site within the CRP gene is an SLE susceptibility locus...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the changes in humoral {{immunity}} occurring during the early phases of experimental pneumococcus infection in the dog and cat. The methods devised by Robertson and Sia were employed to demonstrate the presence of anti-pneumococcus properties in the serum of animals naturally resistant to this micro-organism. It was found that with a generalized and overwhelming infection accompanied by early blood invasion, there was a prompt and rapid decrease in the concentration of natural humoral immune bodies which frequently disappeared entirely by the time of death. This same early diminution of humoral <b>immune</b> substances, <b>opsonins,</b> agglutinins, and pneumococcidal-promoting bodies was observed in animals that survived a moderately severe generalized infection but the concentration of immune bodies rose again with the onset of recovery. The decrease in concentration of humoral immune substances during a severe generalized infection appeared to be due to the combination of "S" substance with the normal immune bodies. When the pneumococcus infection was more localized {{as in the case of}} true lobar pneumonia a quite different sequence of events was observed to occur. Several animals, in which extensive lobar pneumonia was produced, showed the presence in quantity of humoral immune bodies in the blood throughout the course of an infection terminating fatally. These findings suggest that after the inception of pneumococcus infection in the dog and cat the chief function of natural anti-pneurnococcus substances in the blood is to limit or prevent blood invasion. When pneumococcic infection is localized these circulating antibodies appear to have little effect either in preventing the spread of the process or determining the outcome of the disease...|$|R
40|$|The opsonic {{activity}} of serum and isolated immunoglobulin fractions {{has been studied}} in twenty patients with osteomyelitis, using a quantitative assay which measures phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Opsonic functions as well as agglutinating and complement-fixing antibodies were compared with normal human sera {{as well as with}} a control group of eighteen patients with miscellaneous established severe infections. A surprising lack of heat stable γG opsonic activity, particularly for various species of Staphylococcus aureus, was documented among many patients with chronic active osteomyelitis. A similar apparent deficiency or low level of heat stable γG opsonin was also demonstrated among some of the controls with severe soft tissue infections. These weak opsonins showed a marked contrast to the potent heat stable γG opsonin activity previously documented in sub-acute bacterial endocarditis. Heat stable γG opsonin proved to be present in effective concentration in Gram-negative infections of bone and in the control group. Evidence was obtained for competitive blocking of phagocytic mechanisms by relatively weak <b>immune</b> γG <b>opsonins</b> allowed to react with bacteria prior to contact with more potent γG opsonins subsequently added to the test system. High titres of agglutinating anti-bacterial antibodies contrasted with relatively low levels of complement-fixing antibodies in many patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Opsonic activities of both 7 S and 19 S fractions of heat inactivated sera were studied in sera from osteomyelitis patients and control infections. When phagocytosis-promoting properties were not detectable in such fractions, opsonic capacity could be effectively restored by adding fresh serum devoid of anti-bacterial antibodies but possessing complement activity. Opsonic capacity of serum fractions then depended on the marked facilitative effect of heat labile factors. Activity ratios were derived of opsonic activity to actual amount of immunoglobulin present acting in concert with a constant amount of complement...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of microbial infections in humans are biofilm-associated {{and difficult to}} treat, as biofilms are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents and protect themselves from external threats in various ways. Biofilms are tenaciously attached to surfaces and impede the ability of host defense molecules and cells to penetrate them. On the other hand, some biofilms are beneficial for the host and contain protective micro-organisms. Microbes in biofilms express pathogen-associated molecular patterns and epitopes that can be recognized by innate <b>immune</b> cells and <b>opsonins,</b> leading to activation of neutrophils and other leukocytes. Neutrophils {{are part of the}} first line of defense and have multiple antimicrobial strategies allowing them to attack pathogenic biofilms. Objective/design: In this paper, interaction modes of neutrophils with biofilms are reviewed. Antimicrobial strategies of neutrophils and the counteractions of the biofilm communities, with special attention to oral biofilms, are presented. Moreover, possible adverse effects of neutrophil activity and their biofilm-promoting side effects are discussed. Results/conclusion: Biofilms are partially, but not entirely, protected against neutrophil assault, which include the processes of phagocytosis, degranulation, and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. However, viru-lence factors of microorganisms, microbial composition, and properties of the extracellular matrix determin...|$|R
40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper we {{have described the}} characteristics of two human-virulent variants (F and M) of the hemolytic streptococcus, and have presented the evidence which leads {{us to believe that}} the determining factor in the virulence of these two variants is their capacity to resist phagocytosis, although the exotoxin, the fibrinolysin of Tillett and Garner (1), and the delay in inflammatory fixation described by Menkin (2) may well be important accessory factors in human infections. Were this conception of virulence correct, {{it should be possible to}} demonstrate opsonizing antibodies in the serum of the <b>immune</b> animal. Such <b>opsonins</b> were demonstrated by Denys and Leclef (3) in 1895, and by many other workers since that time. The difficulties of the phagocytic technique have discouraged extended studies of the opsonic antibody. In the accompanying paper we described a method of demonstrating the resistance to phagocytosis of streptococci in infant's blood; i. e., in the absence of specific opsonin. In the present paper we are reporting the phagocytosis induced by adding opsonin to such a system, with studies upon the specificity and identity of the opsonin with other known antibodies to the streptococcus. The word "opsortin " is used throughout to connote that specific heat-stable antibody which combines with the organism to render it susceptible to phagocytosis; no distinction is drawn between the so called natura...|$|R
40|$|The leishmanioses, vector-borne {{diseases}} {{caused by the}} trypanosomatid protozoan Leishmania, are transmitted to susceptible mammals by infected phlebotomine sand flies that inoculate promastigotes into hemorrhagic pools created in host skin. We assumed that promastigotes are delivered to a blood pool, and analyzed early promastigote interactions (0 – 5 min) with host components, which lead to parasite endocytosis by blood leukocytes, and to host infection. Promastigotes were incubated with NHS or with heparinized blood in near-physiological conditions, and we used cell radioimmunoassay and flow cytometry to measure the on-rate constants (k + 1) of promastigote interactions with natural opsonins and erythrocytes. We obtained quantitative data for parasitized cells to determine the time-course of promastigote binding and internalization by blood leukocytes. In these reactions, promastigotes bind natural <b>opsonins,</b> <b>immune</b> adhere to erythrocytes and activate complement cytolysis, which kills, 95 % of promastigotes by 2 min post-infection. C 3 promastigote binding is a key step in opsonization; nascent C 3 -promastigotes are the substrate for two simultaneous reactions, C 3 -promastigote immune adherence (IA) to erythrocytes and complement-mediated promastigote killing. The k+ 1 for IA was 75 -fold greater than that for promastigote killing, showing that IA facilitates promastigote endocytosis and circumvents lysis. At 5 min post-infection, when reaction velocity is still linear and promastigote concentration is not limiting, 17. 4 % of granulocytes and 10. 7 % of monocytes had bound promastigotes, of which, 50 % and, 25 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Immune {{information}} {{in the form of}} inflammatory mediators directs phagocyte locomotion and increases expression of opsonin receptors such that contact with an opsonized microbe results in receptor ligation and activation of microbicidal metabolism. Carbohydrate dehydrogenation and 02 consumption feed reactions that effectively lower the spin quantum number (S) of 02 from 1 to 1 / 2 and finally to 0. Oxidase-catalyzed univalent reduction of 02 (S = 1; triplet multiplicity) yields hydrodioxylic acid (HO 2) and its conjugate base superoxide, 0 ° (S = 1 / 2; doublet multiplicity). Acid or enzymatic disproportionation of superoxide yields H 202 (S = 0; singlet multiplicity). Haloperoxidase catalyzes H 202 -dependent oxidation of Cl- yielding HOCI (S = 0), and reaction of HOCI with H 202 yields singlet molecular oxygen, 102 (S = 0; singlet multiplicity). The Wigner spin conservation rule restricts direct reaction of S = 1 02 with S = 0 organic molecules. Lowering the S of 02 overcomes this spin restriction and allows microbicidal combustion. High exergonicity dioxygenation reactions yield electronically excited carbonyl products that relax by photon emission, i. e., phagocyte luminescence. Addition of high quantum yield substrates susceptible to spin allowed dioxygenation, i. e., chemiluminigenic substrates, greatly increases detection sensitivity and defines the nature of the oxygenating agent. Measurement of luminescence allows high sensitivity, real-time, and substrate-specific differential analysis of phagocyte dioxygenating activities. Under assay conditions where <b>immune</b> mediator and <b>opsonin</b> exposure are controlled, luminescence analysis of the initial phase of opsonin-stimulated oxygenation activity allows functional assessment of the opsonin receptor expression per circulating phagocyte and can be used to gauge the in vivo state of immune activation. - Environ Health Perspect 1 02 (Suppl 10) ...|$|R
