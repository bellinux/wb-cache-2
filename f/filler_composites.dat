Various ways have been developed to repair the broken porcelain, one of them is the use of composite resin as the material for the restoration of fractured porcelain. Repairing porcelain inside the mouth without removing the restoration of the damaged porcelain using light cured composite resins material seems to be an advantageous option because it is relatively simple, has low risks, good esthetically and cheap.

5000|$|The {{second tier}} is third {{generation}} Kontakt-5 ERA (explosive reactive armour) which significantly degrades the penetrating power of kinetic-energy APFSDS ammunition; these ERA blocks give the turret its distinctive angled [...] "clam shell" [...] appearance. ERA bricks are also {{located on the}} turret roof and provide protection from top-attack weapons. The turret's forward armour package, {{in addition to the}} ERA and steel plating, contains a <b>composite</b> <b>filler</b> of Russian <b>composite</b> armour sandwiched between upper and lower steel plates. The composite armour results in a lower weight and improved protection when compared with steel-only armour.|$|R
30|$|Use {{of sulfur}} {{crosslinked}} nanogels to improve various properties of virgin elastomers was investigated {{for the first}} time. Natural rubber (NR) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) nanogels were prepared by prevulcanization of the respective rubber lattices. These nanogels were characterized by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy (AFM), solvent swelling, mechanical, and dynamic mechanical property measurements. Intermixing of gel and matrix at various ratios was carried out. Addition of NR gels greatly improved the green strength of SBR, whereas presence of SBR nanogels induced greater thermal stability in NR. For example, addition of 16 phr of NR gel increased the maximum tensile stress value of neat SBR by more than 48 %. Noticeable increase in glass transition temperature of the gel filled systems was also observed. Morphology of these gel filled elastomers was studied {{by a combination of}} energy dispersive X-ray mapping, transmission electron microscopy, and AFM techniques. Particulate <b>filler</b> <b>composite</b> reinforcement models were used to understand the reinforcement mechanism of these nanogels.|$|R
