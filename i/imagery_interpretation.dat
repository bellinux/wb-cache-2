40|$|Cognitive-behavioral {{models of}} {{clinical}} problems typically postulate {{a role for}} the combined effects of different cognitive biases in {{the maintenance of a}} given disorder. It is striking therefore that research has tended to examine cognitive biases in isolation rather than assessing how they work together to maintain psychological dysfunction. The combined cognitive biases hypothesis presented here suggests that cognitive biases influence each another and can interact to maintain a given disorder. Furthermore, it is proposed that the combined effects of cognitive biases may have a greater impact on sustaining a given disorder than if the biases operated in isolation. The combined cognitive biases hypothesis is examined in relation to <b>imagery</b> and <b>interpretation</b> in social phobia. Individuals with social phobia experience negative images of themselves performing poorly in social situations, and they also interpret external social information in a less positive way than those without social anxiety. Evidence of a reciprocal relationship between <b>imagery</b> and <b>interpretations</b> is presented, and the mechanisms underlying the combined effects are discussed.

The new Branch was to be named the Security Branch, which officially was created on 1 February 1968. The recommendations of the Piquet Study were implemented by the CDS on 3 May 1967 and by 1968, the Officer specifications were in draft form and included five sub-classifications: Military Police, Investigation, Intelligence, <b>Imagery</b> <b>Interpretation</b> and Interrogation. With the formation of a unified Branch came a need to replace the previous corps and service badges {{and the use of the}} Indian Totemic Thunderbird as the symbol for the Security Branch arose out of the recommendations of the Insignia Steering Group appointed by DGI on 15 May 1967. In 1970, the branch unofficially deleted the Military Police sub-classification at the officer level since the Basic Officer Specifications included all the tasks of the sub-classification. In effect, the Branch had adopted a four subclassification structure. Therefore, between 1971 and 1974, the new Security Services Basic Officer course was the Branch qualifying course and consisted of 84 days devoted to police/security instruction and three days to Intelligence subjects.|$|E

Imagery has a {{particularly}} powerful effect on emotion and as such plays a particularly important role in emotional disorders. In depression, not only is the occurrence of intrusive negative imagery problematic, but also the lack of positive (in particular, future-directed) imagery is important. The authors suggest that, in depression, imagery can exacerbate the effects of interpretation bias. This article outlines an experimental psychopathology subcomponents model of depression that focuses specifically on the role of <b>imagery</b> and <b>interpretation</b> bias in the maintenance of the disorder.

40|$|Two {{critical}} {{limitations of}} very high resolution <b>imagery</b> <b>interpretations</b> for time-series analysis are higher imagery variances and large data sizes. Although object-based analyses with a multi-scale framework for diverse object sizes are one potential solution, more data requirements and large amounts of testing at high costs are required.

Step one and step two were able to delineating tree density segments and label species association robustly, compared to previous hierarchical frameworks. However, step three was limited by less image information to produce detailed, reasonable image objects with optimal scale parameters for species labeling.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{feasibility}} of using Landsat Thematic Mapper data for mapping muskox summer habitat was tested on northern Banks Island, Northwest Territories. Digital image enhancement and classification techniques were examined {{to determine if}} summer foraging habitats could be detected and mapped using Thematic Mapper <b>imagery.</b> <b>Interpretations</b> of the Satellite data were verified in the field during the summers of 1988 and 1989. The most important summer foraging habitats for muskoxen included the wet sedge meadow, graminoid tundra and graminoid/dwarf shrub tundra cover types. These lowland habitats were generally distinguishable on enhanced colour images and were easily differentiated from upland areas. The most suitable colour composite for differentiating muskox summer habitats was the near-infrared (band 4), shortwave infrared (band 5) and red (band 3) spectral bands displayed in red, green and blue respectively. Upland cover types, including dwarf shrub tundra, hummocky tundra and dwarf shrub/lichen barrens, were more difficult to differentiate because of spectral variability resulting from differences in plant cover and site characteristics. The classified image had an overall accuracy of 88 %. The summer habitats of particular importance to muskoxen had classification accuracies of 8449 %. Detection of important foraging habitats on Thematic Mapper imagery is attributable to the spectral distinctiveness of wet graminoid communities and the high spectral sensitivity and spatial resolution of the infrared sensors, which allow detection of differences in surface moisture and vegetation physiognomy.
