2500|$|While {{operating}} with Combined Task Force 151, on 13 December 2011, the destroyer [...] disrupted {{a group of}} suspected pirates south of Yemen near the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor. [...] At approximately 8:40am local time, the merchant vessel M/V Nordic Apollo reported to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, Dubai, of being fired upon by pirates in a skiff. At approximately 11:00am, the M/V Heather, operating 30 nautical miles from Nordic Apollo, reported suspicious activity by a skiff. [...] CTF-151 commander Rear Admiral Kaleem Shaukat, Pakistan Navy, ordered Pinckney to investigate. Pinckney got underway and launched its MH-60R helicopter which located a suspicious skiff. [...] Once under observation, the helicopter reported that the skiff had nine suspected pirates aboard, {{as well as several}} ladders, weapons and <b>fuel</b> <b>containers</b> that the suspected pirates attempted to cover up or throw overboard. [...] As Pinckney closed, the skiff stopped and the suspected pirates threw their weapons overboard, which were identified as five AK-47 rifles, one rocket propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. and three RPG rounds. [...] Pinckney conduct a boarding using their visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) team (pictured), and once aboard, the VBSS team confirmed that there were nine suspected pirates, one grappling hook, 36 barrels of fuel, and 75 and 45 horsepower outboard engines. The VBSS team scuttled one outboard motor and left the skiff with enough fuel and water to return to shore.|$|E

50|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to man-portable units, the Germans designed heavy flamethrowers {{before and during}} the First World War. The large flamethrower (Grossflammenwerfer or [...] "Grof") was designed to be used from the trenches. The fuel and propellant containers were too large and heavy for mobility, but the hose could be long enough to be carried out of the trenches closer to the enemy. Multiple propellant and <b>fuel</b> <b>containers</b> could be connected together to improve range and usage time.|$|E

50|$|The nanoFET's {{adjustable}} {{force and}} specific impulse make it extremely versatile. It can produce more thrust while using less power and fuel {{than any other}} electronic thrust system. In addition, no charge is built up within {{the system as a}} whole; any negative charge built up on one charging pad is canceled by the positive charge built up on another. The high level of integration with its <b>fuel</b> <b>containers</b> makes it extremely compact and easy to place in a space ship. Unfortunately, like all other electronic thrusters, it produces nowhere near the amount of thrust that current chemical rockets produce (a few hundred Newtons compared to ~15 million Newtons). Although the fact that it doesn't need a few million pounds of fuel does significantly offset this power difference, in their current form, nanoFETs are not suitable for earth based launches.|$|E

[...] Continental was able to surmount the rigors of the great depression of the 1930s, and in 1936 its stocks, listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange since 1929, were admitted on the New York Stock Exchange. Its earnings for 1935 had reached over one million dollars, with total assets valued at more than $18,000,000. [...] During the Second World War Continental produced large tonnages of barbed wire, nails and sheet steel for military use, and it provided material for products manufactured by defense industries.
