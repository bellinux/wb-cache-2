Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection {{to some of the}} country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union {{became the}} first country to adopt a planned economy, whereby {{production}} and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> were centralized and directed by the government. The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as private enterprises and free trade. After the severe economic collapse caused by the war, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses. The economy quickly recovered.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} revolutionary years, Congress in 1814 elected José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia {{to be the}} supreme {{dictator}} (Supremo) of Paraguay. Under dictatorships of Francia (1814–1840), Carlos Antonio López (1841–1862) and Francisco Solano López (1862–1870) Paraguay developed quite differently from other South American countries. They encouraged self-sufficient economic development, state ownership of most industries and imposed {{a high level of}} isolation from neighboring countries. The regime of the López family was characterized by a harsh centralism in the production and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> There was no distinction between the public and the private sphere, and the López family ruled the country as it would a large estate.|$|E

The estimated cost was £72,000.

25|$|Trade {{has been}} a very {{significant}} factor of the People's Republic of China's economy. In the twenty-five years that followed the founding of the Republic in 1949, China's trade institutions developed into a partially modern but somewhat inefficient system. The drive to modernize the economy that began in 1978 required a sharp acceleration in commodity flows and greatly improved efficiency in economic transactions. In the ensuing years economic reforms were adopted by the government to develop a socialist market economy. This type of economy combined central planning with market mechanisms. The changes resulted in the decentralization and expansion of domestic and foreign trade institutions, as well as a greatly enlarged role for free markets in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> and a prominent role for foreign trade and investment in economic development.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} under the player's control {{throughout}} the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by selecting {{how much of a}} given resource is transported to a given building, under six separate headings; foodstuff, grain, iron, coal, boards and water. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when; by increasing the significance of a particular tool, that tool will be produced before others. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a bakery, and the building is still empty despite idle settlers in the headquarters, a rolling pin will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these reforms, the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> used in {{industrial}} production was based on mandatory planning with fixed prices, guidance planning with floating prices, and the free market. Mandatory planning covered sixty industrial products, including coal, crude oil, rolled steel, nonferrous metals, timber, cement, electricity, basic industrial chemicals, chemical fertilizers, major machines and electrical equipment, chemical fibers, newsprint, cigarettes, and defense industry products. Once enterprises under mandatory planning had met the state's mandatory plans and supply contracts, they could sell surplus production to commercial departments or other enterprises. Prices of surplus industrial producer goods floated within limits set by the state. The state also had a planned distribution system for important materials such as coal, iron and steel, timber, and cement. Enterprise managers who chose to exceed planned production goals purchased additional materials on the market. Major cities established wholesale markets for industrial producer goods to supplement the state's allocation system.|$|E

500|$|The {{state was}} {{ruled by a}} king, the wanax (ϝάναξ), whose role was {{religious}} and perhaps also military and judicial.

2500|$|The British {{government}} viewed strategic {{problems as}} {{stemming from the}} loss of Burma, and serving to reinforce the importance of Calcutta, which was producing [...] "as much as 80% of the armament, textile and heavy machinery production used in the Asian theater." [...] The paramount goal became the support of this centre of wartime mobilisation. To address this problem, they greatly expanded their use of a technique already employed since the outset of the war— prioritised <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services. The Government of India made a conscious decision to divide socioeconomic groups into [...] "priority" [...] and [...] "non-priority" [...] classes according to the relative importance of their contributions to the war effort. Rather than being faced with starvation, workers in prioritised sectorsprivate and government wartime industries, military and civilian construction, paper and textile mills, engineering firms, the Indian Railways, coal mining, and government workers of various levels— were given significant advantages and benefits. In particular, rice was preferentially provided to the workers in Calcutta's vital industries. To a large extent, these priority classes were composed of bhadraloks, who were upper-class or bourgeois middle-class, socially mobile, educated, urban, and sympathetic to Western values and modernisation. Protecting their interests was a major concern of both private and public relief efforts.|$|E
2500|$|From a sociological {{point of}} view, both Horkheimer's and Adorno's works contain a certain ambivalence {{concerning}} the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence {{that gave rise}} to the [...] "pessimism" [...] of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and freedom. This ambivalence was rooted, of course, in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, in particular, the rise of National Socialism, state capitalism, and mass culture as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology.See also: Dubiel, Helmut. (1985). Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory. Trans. Benjamin Gregg. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London. For Adorno and Horkheimer, state intervention in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the [...] "relations of production" [...] and [...] "material productive forces of society"—a tension that, according to traditional Marxist theory, constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The previously [...] "free" [...] market (as an [...] "unconscious" [...] mechanism for the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods)</b> and [...] "irrevocable" [...] private property of Marx's epoch have gradually been replaced by the centralized state planning and socialized ownership of the means of production in contemporary Western societies. The dialectic through which Marx predicted the emancipation of modern society is thus suppressed, effectively being subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination.|$|E
2500|$|Sarkar‘s {{economic}} system rests upon {{the concept of}} a tiered economic structure in which the production and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> is performed according to three distinctive business models [...] During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned cooperatives, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large scale key industries. Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation [...] Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises [...] This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business. However, key industries vital {{to the development of the}} country and of strategic importance (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are to complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative. Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed. Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.|$|E
