25|$|A system {{widely used}} in Europe known as the Mullard–Philips tube designation, also {{extended}} to transistors, uses a letter, followed {{by one or more}} further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the <b>heater</b> <b>voltage</b> or current (one letter), the functions of all sections of the tube (one letter per section), the socket type (first digit), and the particular tube (remaining digits). For example, the ECC83 (equivalent to the 12AX7) is a 6.3V (E) double triode (CC) with a miniature base (8). In this system special-quality tubes (e.g., for long-life computer use) are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special-quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power pentode with no consumer equivalent.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with <b>heater</b> <b>voltages</b> well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|R

5000|$|Radio {{manufacturers}} {{attempted to}} deviate from traditional <b>heater</b> <b>voltages</b> of 2.5, 5 and 6.3 volts to try and use a 5 tube heater scheme to get as close to 110-120 VAC line voltage. For the 1935 model year, designers {{were able to get}} a 5-tube heater string to total up to 78 volts. This meant that a dropping resistor or line ballast tube was needed to drop the remaining 35-42 volts. If a ballast tube was used, the radio would be marketed as a [...] "6-tube" [...] radio even though one was just a voltage dropping ballast. Other manufacturers used a [...] "line cord resistor", a special AC cord made with resistance wire which replaced a power resistor in the radio chassis. These line cords tend to get warm to the touch after the radio was in use for a while.|$|R

2500|$|To {{meet the}} {{reliability}} {{requirements of the}} 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, [...] "special-quality" [...] tubes with extended life, and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of silicon, used in the tungsten alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the wire drawing dies) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant SAGE air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, {{and the other in}} standby. To locate potential tube failures in the standby computer, <b>heater</b> <b>voltages</b> were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service.

40|$|We {{present the}} design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of a mechanically flexible diaphragm-based microvalve actuator employing {{a reservoir of}} the thermally responsive hydrogel PNIPAAm and a conductive nanocomposite polymer (C-NCP) heater element. The microvalve actuator can be fabricated employing traditional soft lithography processes for fabrication of all components, including the tungsten-based C-NCP heater element, the hydrogel reservoir, and the deflecting polymer membrane. Shrinking of the hydrogel under the application of heat supplied by the flexible heater, or the removal of this thermal energy by turning off the heater, forces the diaphragm to move. The silicone diaphragm actuator is compatible with a normally-closed polymer microvalve design where-by the fluidic channel can be opened and closed via the hydrogel diaphragm actuator, in which the hydrogel is normally swollen and heating opens the valve via membrane deflection. Our prototype hydrogel actuator diaphragms are between 100 - 200 micrometers in diameter, and experimentally deflect approximately 100 micrometers under heating to 32 degrees ºC or above, which is sufficient to theoretically open a microvalve to allow flow to pass through a 100 micrometer deep channel.

5000|$|A [...] "farm radio" [...] {{modification}} (usually done at {{the point}} of sale) allowed an AA5 to run off 32 volt DC, commonly generated by farm windmills. With a relatively simple rewiring, the tube heaters could be put in series-parallel to run off 32 volts, with the three twelve-volt heaters in series and a 25L6, 35L6 or 43 in parallel; the tubes would still function with the <b>heater</b> <b>voltage</b> somewhat out of specification. If run from a 32-volt supply the radio had a substantially reduced performance because the B+ voltage would only be 32 volts compared with 160-170 volts when operated from AC. With 32 volts on the plate, the radio tended to be insensitive. Sometimes only the tube heater power was derived from a windmill, and dry batteries were retained for the plate voltage supply. The advantage was that the heaters were a high and continuous load on the battery, whereas the plate voltage battery drain was smaller and intermittent. Often a wet-cell rechargeable battery was used for tube heaters, recharged by a local garage or by exchanging with a vehicle battery.|$|E
