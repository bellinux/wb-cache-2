5|$|The {{line from}} Sandvika to Oslo was {{substantially}} upgraded between 1917 and 1922. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at Lysaker and standard gauge traffic {{was carried out}} on the northern track. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All–standard gauge operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. Electric traction started operation on 30 August 1922. An <b>interlocking</b> <b>system</b> was installed on 29 July 1924. From 1922 a half-hour headway was introduced on the local trains between Sandvika and Oslo West Station.|$|E

40|$|A complex Machine Protection System {{has been}} {{designed}} to protect the LHC machine from an accidental release of the beam energy, with about 20 subsystems providing status information to the Beam <b>Interlock</b> <b>System</b> that is the backbone of machine protection. Only if the subsystems are in the correct state for beam operation, the Beam <b>Interlock</b> <b>System</b> receives a status flag and beam can be injected into LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The Beam <b>Interlock</b> <b>System</b> also relays commands from the connected subsystems in case of failure for triggering the LHC Beam Dumping System. To maintain the required level of safety of the Beam <b>Interlock</b> <b>System,</b> the performance of the key components is verified before every fill of the machine and validated after every emergency beam dump before beam operation is allowed to continue.
