500|$|Balzac was undeterred by the {{negative}} reactions; referring to Louis Lambert {{and the other}} works in Le Livre mystique, he wrote: [...] "Those are books that <b>I</b> <b>create</b> for myself {{and for a few}} others." [...] Although he was often critical of Balzac's work, French author Gustave Flaubert was influenced – perhaps unconsciously – by the book. His own story [...] "La Spirale", written in the 1850s, bears a strong plot resemblance to Balzac's 1832 novel.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2003 SciFi Channel aired the one-hour special Supernatural {{starring}} Angel. Kate O'Hare said of {{the special}} that, [...] "Filmed in part at Universal Theme Park in Orlando, Fla., [...] "Supernatural" [...] finds Angel crawling up buildings, passing a quarter through his skin, spontaneously combusting and having otherworldly creatures burst from his chest." [...] When asked about his process in creating television specials, Angel said that, [...] "I like to have my hand in everything on my TV specials. I'm the executive producer; I direct it; <b>I</b> <b>create</b> it. I write all the music for my TV specials and my live performances. It's on my label. I write it; I produce it." [...] During the special Angel performed stunts including lighting himself on fire and making a tarantula emerge from a pedestrian's soda can. In 2003, Angel was also featured in the two-hour TBS special Made in Japan.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on the incident, while also adding that since August 2016, PewDiePie has included anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery in nine separate videos. The publication reported he removed three of the videos, including the January 2017 Fiverr one. In a 12 February Tumblr post, PewDiePie expressed: [...] "I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes, [...] I think of the content that <b>I</b> <b>create</b> as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary," [...] and conceded, [...] "though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive." [...] In his post, he also reiterated he does not support anti-Semitic groups. PewDiePie's motivation for his Tumblr post was partially driven {{by the fact that}} neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups and publications, such as The Daily Stormer, were referencing and praising PewDiePie for his jokes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{describing}} his own work, Chalfant stated the following: [...] "Many {{of the forms}} <b>I</b> <b>create,</b> reminiscent of architecture and objects of suggested utility, security and protection, are used as metaphors for our psychological behavior, and for the phenomenology of the body. Architectural furnishing structures like a chair and table, allow me to explore specific polar states {{that are relevant to}} the structure and also to the personal psyche such as; large/small, inside/outside, private/public, adult/child, beginning/end, birth/death. [...] The sculptures that <b>I</b> <b>create</b> are a means to reflect certain elements of our society. Paradox is probably the most poignant in my work. Part of the narrative in my pieces {{has to do with the}} human condition and in particular today's youth. Connotations of purity; innocence and promise are being subjected to some of the elements of the environment around it, which are disrespect, danger, violence and abuse." ...|$|E

[...] For example, Yanni's university study of psychology influenced his music: “When <b>I</b> <b>create</b> music, it is a reflection of my soul, my experiences in life and my relationships with other people and cultures.

2500|$|Taupin on his art: [...] "I don’t feel {{brighter}} colors necessarily constitute upbeat feelings although without contradiction {{they can}} accomplish the job if the emotion {{is one of}} simple joy. However, in much of my work darker colors such as blacks and deep blues might convey the depth of musical genres such as the Blues and Jazz or old school Folk and Country. These musical forms are the blueprint of much of what <b>I</b> <b>create</b> {{so it could be}} said that their emotion and passion, which is exhilarating, brings a deeper style of muted exuberance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of Eve, according to Rabbi Joshua, is that: [...] "God deliberated from what member He would create woman, and He reasoned with Himself thus: I must not create her from Adam's head, for {{she would be}} a proud person, and hold her head high. If <b>I</b> <b>create</b> her from the eye, then she will wish to pry into all things; if from the ear, she will wish to hear all things; if from the mouth, she will talk much; if from the heart, she will envy people; if from the hand, she will desire to take all things; if from the feet, she will be a gadabout.

2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. <b>I</b> <b>create</b> what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|E

In 2002, {{he worked with}} the Make-A-Wish Foundation to collaborate with a fan who {{had been diagnosed with}} a life-threatening illness. 16-year-old Andrew Baines from Tennessee was invited into the band's recording studio to record backing vocals for their then-upcoming album, The Golden Age of Grotesque. Manson said on his website, [...] "Yesterday, I spent the afternoon with Andrew, who reminded me the things <b>I</b> <b>create</b> are only made complete by those who enjoy them. I just want to simply say, thank you to Andrew for sharing such an important wish with me." [...] He contributed to Oxfam's 2013 [...] "Rumble in the Jumble" [...] event, which raised money to aid victims of domestic and sexual abuse in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He {{has supported}} various organizations – such as Music for Life and Little Kids Rock – which enable access to musical instruments and education to children of low-income families.
