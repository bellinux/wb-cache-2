5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, the FAA granted its <b>first</b> <b>approval</b> for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|E

25|$|Omeprazole {{showed an}} inter-individual {{variability}} {{and therefore a}} significant number of patients with acid-related disorders required higher or multiple doses to achieve symptom relief and healing. Astra started a new research program in 1987 to identify a new analogue to omeprazole with less interpatient variability. Only one compound proved superior to omeprazole and that was the (S)-(−)-isomer, esomeprazole, which was developed as the magnesium salt. Esomeprazole magnesium (brand name Nexium) received its <b>first</b> <b>approval</b> in 2000 and provided more pronounced inhibition of acid secretion and less inter-patient variation compared to omeprazole. In 2004, Nexium had already been used to treat over 200 million patients.|$|E
500|$|Other former Star Trek {{crew members}} were recruited, such as costume {{designer}} William Ware Theiss. He {{began working on}} new designs for the Starfleet uniforms based on his creations for The Original Series. Other creations which were updated included the phaser, which were built to the same design {{as in the previous}} series, but were built out of aluminium instead of the fiberglass resin props used before. The battery packs were detachable, and contained actual batteries which activated strobe lighting on {{the main body of the}} prop. Writers began to be recruited, with Livingston given the <b>first</b> <b>approval</b> to write a script, entitled [...] "In Thy Image". Alan Dean Foster was hired to write a story based on Roddenberry's Genesis II pilot, [...] "Robot's Return". He had previously adapted episodes of [...] in a series of short stories published in the Star Trek Logs series of books. Further technical advisers were recruited, such as Marvin Minsky, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his wife Gloria Rudisch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{breakthrough in}} soft lenses {{was made by}} Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím, who published their work [...] "Hydrophilic gels for biological use" [...] in the journal Nature in 1959. In 1965, National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States. The Czech scientists' work led to {{the launch of the}} first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the <b>first</b> <b>approval</b> of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort, if any, is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.|$|E

These were the <b>first</b> <b>approvals</b> granted by the FDA and USDA for phage-based applications.
