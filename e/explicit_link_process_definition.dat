40|$|During {{the last}} decade a variety of {{information}} technologies have emerged relating to business process modelling. One issue resulting from the introduction of these technologies is the inability to <b>link</b> the business <b>process</b> <b>definition</b> with the information gathered during {{the development of the}} business strategy. Organisations require the ability to define their business strategy, then use the outcomes of this definition to drive the business <b>process</b> <b>definition.</b> This paper details a methodology that applies XML to link business strategy with business <b>process</b> <b>definition.</b> The key contribution of this work is an extension to the Balanced Scorecard XML draft standard that incorporates quantified business process performance measures. This methodology is then applied to a specific case study where an organisation plans to provide personal loans to its customers...|$|R
40|$|In process-driven, service-oriented architectures, {{there are}} a number of {{important}} factors that hinder the traceability between design and implementation artifacts. First of all, there are no <b>explicit</b> <b>links</b> between <b>process</b> design and implementation languages not only due to the differences of syntax and semantics but also the differences of granularity. The second factor is the complexity caused by tangled process concerns that multiplies the difficulty of analyzing and understanding the trace dependencies. Finally, there is a lack of adequate tool support for establishing and maintaining the trace dependencies between process designs and implementations. We present in this article a view-based, model-driven traceability approach that tackles these challenges. Our approach supports (semi-) automatically eliciting and (semi-) formalizing trace dependencies among process development artifacts at different levels of granularity and abstraction. A proof-of-concept tool support has been realized, and its functionality is illustrated via an industrial case study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSea-level rise is {{expected}} to dramatically alter low-lying coastal and intertidal areas, which provide important habitat for shoreline-dependent species. The Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) is a threatened shorebird that relies on Florida Gulf Coast sandy beaches for nesting and breeding. Selecting a management strategy {{for the conservation of}} this species under sea-level rise is a complex task that entails the consideration of multiple streams of information, stakeholder preferences, value judgments, and uncertainty. We use a spatially <b>explicit</b> <b>linked</b> modeling <b>process</b> that incorporates geomorphological (SLAMM), habitat (MaxEnt), and metapopulation (RAMAS GIS) models to simulate the effect of sea-level rise on Snowy Plover populations. We then apply multi-criteria decision analysis to identify preferred management strategies for the conservation of the species. Results show that nest exclosures are the most promising conservation strategy followed by predator management, species focused beach nourishment, and no action. Uncertainty in these results remains an important concern, and a better understanding of decision-maker preferences and the Snowy Plover's life history would improve the reliability of the results. This is an innovative method for planning for sea-level rise through pairing a linked modeling system with decision analysis to provide management focused results under an inherently uncertain future...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{influence of}} habitat loss, fragmentation and matrix heterogeneity on {{the viability of}} populations is a critical area of conservation research that remains unresolved. Using simulation modelling, we provide {{an analysis of the}} influence both patch size and patch isolation have on abundance, effective population size (Ne) and FST. An individual-based, spatially explicit population model based on 15 years of field work on the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) was applied to different landscape configurations. The variation in landscape patterns was summarized using spatial statistics based on O-ring statistics. By regressing demographic and genetics attributes that emerged across the landscape treatments against proportion of total habitat and O-ring statistics, we show that O-ring statistics provide an <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> between population <b>processes,</b> habitat area, and critical thresholds of fragmentation that affect those processes. Spatial distances among land cover classes that affect biological processes translated into critical scales at which the measures of landscape structure correlated best with genetic indices. Therefore our study infers pattern from process, which contrasts with past studies of landscape genetics. We found that population genetic structure was more strongly affected by fragmentation than population size, which suggests that examining only population size may limit recognition of fragmentation effects that erode genetic variation. If effective population size is used to set recovery goals for endangered species, then habitat fragmentation effects may be sufficiently strong to prevent evaluation of recovery based on the ratio of census:effective population size alone. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|A key {{promise of}} process {{languages}} based on open standards, {{such as the}} Web Services Business Process Execution Language, is the avoidance of vendor lock-in through the portability of <b>process</b> <b>definitions</b> among runtime environments. Despite the fact that today, various runtimes claim to support this language, every runtime implements a different subset, thus hampering portability and locking in their users. In this paper, we intend to improve this situation by enabling the measurement {{of the degree of}} portability of <b>process</b> <b>definitions.</b> This helps developers to assess their <b>process</b> <b>definitions</b> and to decide if it is feasible to invest in the effort of porting a <b>process</b> <b>definition</b> to another runtime.

40|$|Online {{newspapers}} and journals, {{as well as}} many other types of informational sites, are invariably confronted with the question of where to place links associated with the online document. Currently, many informational sites place associative links below (as seen with CNN. com) or {{on the side of the}} document (as seen with techreview. com), while a shrinking number of sites embed associative links within their documents, such as scientificamerican. com. Placing associative links either outside or within a document has both benefits and drawbacks. The placement of links outside of a document (<b>explicit</b> <b>links)</b> may promote quicker selection times once the context of the link is known, since the reader does not have to wade through the entire document to find the link. Moreover, readers exposed to <b>explicit</b> <b>links</b> may be less prone to digress to other information paths before completely reading and grasping the meaning of the entire document. If digression does occur, then information may be retrieved faster with <b>explicit</b> <b>links.</b> On the other hand, embedding the links may provide an important context that would be absent if they stood outside of a document. It also may provide for a stronger association between the main document and the secondary, associative pages. Unfortunately, there has been very little empirically validated research concerning associative lin...|$|R
40|$|Many {{requirements}} {{for a business}} process depend on the entire workflow environment that includes common data for all the population of processes, state of resources, state of processes, etc. The natural way to specify and implement such requirements is to put them into the <b>process</b> <b>definition.</b> In order to do it, we need: (1) a generalised workflow meta-model that includes data on the workflow environment, <b>process</b> <b>definitions,</b> and {{the current state of}} execution of all processes; (2) a powerful and flexible query language addressing the meta-model; (3) integration of a query language with a business <b>process</b> <b>definition</b> language.

Although this work is still ongoing, early experi-ences suggest that this approach can help reduce medical errors and improve patient safety.
