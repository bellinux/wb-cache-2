25|$|There are {{distinct}} differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically {{emerge from a}} column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize {{the effect of this}} difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. <b>Displacement</b> <b>chromatography</b> has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.|$|E

Soybean trypsin inhibitor was purified from a crude protein extract by this technique using an analytical anion-exchange column with small particle size (20,um).

At the start of the 1950s, Kraus and Nelson demonstrated the use of many analytical methods for metal ions dependent on their separation of their chloride, fluoride, nitrate or sulfate complexes by anion chromatography. Automatic in-line detection was progressively introduced from 1960 to 1980 as well as novel chromatographic methods for metal ion separations. A groundbreaking method by Small, Stevens and Bauman at Dow Chemical Co. unfolded the creation of the modern ion chromatography. Anions and cations could now be separated efficiently by a system of suppressed conductivity detection.

40|$|Several {{methods were}} {{examined}} {{to characterize the}} binding between astaxanthin and salmon muscle protein(s) {{in order to provide}} tools for evaluation of the role of muscle proteins on astaxanthin retention in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. flesh. The methods included gel filtration <b>chromatography,</b> <b>displacement</b> of a hydrophobic probe and ultrafiltration. With gel filtration chromatography, aggregation of astaxanthin under the experimental conditions was a major problem for the separation of bound astaxanthin from free astaxanthin because the apparent molecular weight of aggregated astaxanthin or astaxanthin micelles was in the range of protein 2 ̆ 013 astaxanthin complexes. Displacement of the fluorescent probe 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalenesulphonate (ANS) was not effective as astaxanthin quenched the fluorophore so that displacement could not be observed. An ultrafiltration method was developed using 200 -mM sodium cholate for dispersion of astaxanthin aggregates. This allowed unbound astaxanthin to be separated from bound astaxanthin using a 30 -kDa filter. After salmon muscle proteins were solubilized in different fractions by sequential extraction using low ionic strength solutions, the astaxanthin binding of different fractions was assessed using the ultrafiltration method. The significant difference (P< 0. 05) observed in the astaxanthin binding of the various fractions suggests an application of this assay to detect differences in affinity of proteins for astaxanthin. The results also suggest that proteins other than actomyosin or actin can bind astaxanthin in Atlantic salmon flesh.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to elution chromatography, solutes separated in displacement mode form sharp-edged zones rather than spreading peaks. Zone boundaries in <b>displacement</b> <b>chromatography</b> are self-sharpening: if a molecule {{for some reason}} gets ahead of its band, it enters a zone {{in which it is}} more strongly retained, and will then run more slowly until its zone catches up. Furthermore, because <b>displacement</b> <b>chromatography</b> takes advantage of the non-linearity of the isotherms, loadings are deliberately high; more material can be separated on a given column, in a given time, with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations. Retention conditions can still be adjusted, but the displacer controls the migration rate of the solutes. The displacer is selected to have higher affinity for the stationary phase than does any of the solutes being separated, and its concentration is set to approach saturation of the stationary phase and to give the desired migration rate of the concentration wave. High-retention conditions can be employed without gradient operation, because the displacer ensures removal of all solutes of interest in the designed run time.|$|E
50|$|The chromatographic {{purification}} {{of proteins}} from complex mixtures {{can be quite}} challenging, particularly when the mixtures contain similarly retained proteins or when it is desired to enrich trace components in the feed.

50|$|The {{compounds}} {{are produced}} using a proprietary purification technology called Sample <b>Displacement</b> <b>Chromatography</b> (SDC). The technique exploits {{the correlation between}} molecular weight and binding strength of PEG species. That is, individual PEG molecules bind to the matrix within a chromatography column at differing affinity depending on their molecular weight. Because of this property, when PEG {{is applied to the}} top of a chromatography column, strong binding species take possession of the first binding positions available and thereby force weaker binders to follow the liquid flow down the column to the next vacant positions. This results in the spatial separation of PEG species within the column according to affinity and thereby molecular weight.|$|E
50|$|In {{any form}} of chromatography, {{the rate at which}} the solute moves down the column is a direct {{reflection}} of the percentage of time the solute spends in the mobile phase. To achieve separation in either elution or <b>displacement</b> <b>chromatography,</b> there must be appreciable differences in the affinity of the respective solutes for the stationary phase. Both methods rely on movement down the column to amplify the effect of small differences in distribution between the two phases. Distribution between the mobile and stationary phases is described by the binding isotherm, a plot of solute bound to (or partitioned into) the stationary phase as a function of concentration in the mobile phase. The isotherm is often linear, or approximately so, at low concentrations, but commonly curves (concave-downward) at higher concentrations as the stationary phase becomes saturated.|$|E
5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of <b>displacement</b> <b>chromatography</b> is that non-idealities always {{give rise to}} an overlap zone between each pair of components; this mixed zone must be collected separately for recycle or discard to preserve {{the purity of the}} separated materials. The strategy of adding spacer molecules to form zones between the components (sometimes termed [...] "carrier displacement chromatography") has been investigated and can be useful when suitable, readily removable spacers are found. Another disadvantage is that the raw chromatogram, for instance a plot of absorbance or refractive index vs elution volume, can be difficult to interpret for contiguous zones, especially if the displacement train is not fully developed. Documentation and troubleshooting may require additional chemical analysis to establish the distribution of a given component. Another disadvantage is that the time required for regeneration limits throughput.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{principle}} of <b>displacement</b> <b>chromatography</b> is: {{there are only}} a finite number of binding sites for solutes on the matrix (the stationary phase), and if a site is occupied by one molecule, it is unavailable to others. As in any chromatography, equilibrium is established between molecules of a given kind bound to the matrix and those of the same kind free in solution. Because the number of binding sites is finite, when the concentration of molecules free in solution is large relative to the dissociation constant for the sites, those sites will mostly be filled. This results in a downward-curvature in the plot of bound vs free solute, in the simplest case giving a Langmuir isotherm. A molecule with a high affinity for the matrix (the displacer) will compete more effectively for binding sites, leaving the mobile phase enriched in the lower-affinity solute. Flow of mobile phase through the column preferentially carries off the lower-affinity solute and thus at high concentration the higher-affinity solute will eventually displace all molecules with lesser affinities.|$|E

In this study we present a method for applying <b>displacement</b> <b>chromatography</b> in an online 2 D-LC-MS system including a cation exchange (CEX) column and a reversed phase column. We circumvented the problem of determining the sample capacity of the CEX column by repeated injection (pulses) of sample aliquots monitored by an LC-MS analysis of each flow-through fraction of the CEX column. Elution of tryptic peptides from the CEX column was achieved by repeated injection (pulses) of the displacer spermine. Pulsed displacer injections offer the advantage through physical separation of preventing post-column mixing of already separated compounds.

In this study we compared to what extend displacement mode was a suitable alternative to gradient mode for the separation of a complex protein mixture using anion-exchange <b>displacement</b> <b>chromatography</b> and if it is therefore helpful for proteomic investigations. Hence we analyzed the qualitative protein composition of each fraction by tryptic digestion of the proteins, analysis of the tryptic peptides by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry followed by data base analysis and by measuring the elution profiles of 22 selected proteins with selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. In the fractions of displacement mode a significantly higher number of identified proteins (51 versus 16) was yielded in comparison to gradient mode.
