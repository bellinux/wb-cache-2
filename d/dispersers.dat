5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed <b>dispersers</b> in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining <b>dispersers</b> in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding <b>dispersers.</b> In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} {{is the value of}} protection: would the plant be less able to survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal <b>dispersers</b> while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to seed-eating pigeons, Ducula have thin-walled gizzards and short wide guts, allowing large seeds to pass through. After digesting the fleshy parts, they void the seeds intact, thus playing {{an important role}} as seed <b>dispersers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tamarins act as seed <b>dispersers</b> in {{tropical}} ecosystems. While larger primates eat larger seeds, tamarins eat the smaller ones. The expelled seeds {{have a higher}} germination rate than others and ingesting larger seeds may help to dislodge and expel intestinal parasites.|$|E
25|$|The diets of the {{starlings}} {{are usually}} dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important <b>dispersers</b> of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example white sandalwood, Indian Banyan. In addition to trees {{they are also}} important <b>dispersers</b> of parasitic mistletoes. In South Africa, the red-winged starling is an important disperser of the introduced Acacia cyclops. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, {{which led to the}} speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol. Laboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly. In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume nectar. The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown, but at least some are, such as the slender-billed starling of alpine East Africa, which pollinates giant lobelias.|$|E
25|$|In {{tropical}} forests, gorillas are hunted {{to provide}} meat for the bushmeat trade. Logging also destroys gorilla habitats. Although logging diminishes gorilla habitats, {{it may also}} provide for increased herbaceous vegetation {{as a result of}} gaps in the tree cover. Destruction of gorilla habitat may harm the overall forest ecosystem. Western lowland gorillas are seed <b>dispersers,</b> which mean they carry seeds from one place to another, and this trait is beneficial to many of the animals in the forest. Therefore, if there are no western lowland gorillas to disperse the needed seeds to other animals, not only will the gorillas become extinct but so will many other animals, which could over time destroy an entire ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Facilitation of {{non-native}} species, {{either by}} native species or other non-native species, {{may increase the}} invasibility of a community, or {{the ease with which}} non-native species become established in a community. In an examination of 254 published studies of introduced species, 22 of 190 interactions studied between introduced species in the studies were facilitative. It is worth noting that 128 of the 190 examined interactions were predator–prey relationships of a single plant-eating insect reported in a single study, which may have overemphasized the importance of negative interactions. Introduced plants are also facilitated by native pollinators, <b>dispersers,</b> and mycorrhizae. Thus, positive interactions must be considered in any attempt to understand the invasibility of a community.|$|E
25|$|Tree species {{adapted to}} {{seasonal}} inundation {{have adapted to}} maximize fruit production during periods of flooding {{in order to take}} advantage of newly available seed dispersal methods. Fish consume nearly all fruit that fall into the water, and species that are unable to digest the seeds eventually excrete and disperse them into the water. Dispersal by other vectors such as birds and monkeys is secondary to that of fishes in igapó. An important factor in seed survival is the presence of seed predators. Fishes that lack the strong jaws found in characins, such as catfish, digest the fleshy material of the fruit while the seeds pass through the gut unharmed. Because many catfishes are bottom-feeders, they are critical <b>dispersers</b> for seeds that sink upon entering the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} the berries can vary {{depending}} on the species, but most produce a white berry with slight tones of green. Some produce orange berries and others yellow berries, though. Still others will produce berries that start off white, but then change to another color with time. Philodendrons that produce orange berries tend to be members of the section Calostigma. Contained within the berries are the seeds which are extremely small compared to other members of the Araceae family. The berries often give off odors to attract animals to eat and disperse them. For example, Philodendron alliodorum berries are known to emit an odor similar to that of garlic. The animals that distribute the seeds depends on the species, but some possible <b>dispersers</b> include bats and monkeys. Insects also may be responsible for dispersing seeds, as beetles and wasps have been seen feeding on philodendron berries.|$|E
25|$|Many facilitative {{interactions}} {{directly affect}} {{the distribution of}} species. As discussed above, transport of plant propagules by animal <b>dispersers</b> can increase colonization rates of more distant sites, which may impact the distribution and population dynamics of the plant species. Facilitation most often affects distribution by simply {{making it possible for}} a species to occur in a site where some environmental stress would otherwise prohibit growth of that species. This is apparent in whole-community facilitation by a foundation species, such as sediment stabilization in cobble beach plant communities by smooth cordgrass. A facilitating species may also help drive the progression from one ecosystem type to another, as mesquite apparently does in the grasslands of the Rio Grande Plains. As a nitrogen-fixing tree, mesquite establishes more readily than other species on nutrient-poor soils, and following establishment, mesquite acts as a nurse plant for seedlings of other species. Thus, mesquite facilitates the dynamic spatial shift from grassland to savanna to woodland across the habitat.|$|E
25|$|The diet of parrots {{consists}} of seeds, fruit, nectar, pollen, buds, and sometimes arthropods and other animal prey. The {{most important of}} these for most true parrots and cockatoos are seeds; the evolution of the large and powerful bill can be explained primarily as an adaptation to opening and consuming seeds. All true parrots except the Pesquet's parrot employ the same method to obtain the seed from the husk; the seed is held between the mandibles and the lower mandible crushes the husk, whereupon the seed is rotated in the bill and the remaining husk is removed. A foot is sometimes used to help hold large seeds in place. Parrots are seed predators rather than seed <b>dispersers,</b> and in many cases where species are recorded as consuming fruit, they are only eating the fruit to get at the seed. As seeds often have poisons that protect them, parrots carefully remove seed coats and other chemically defended fruit parts prior to ingestion. Many species in the Americas, Africa, and Papua New Guinea consume clay, which releases minerals and absorbs toxic compounds from the gut.|$|E
25|$|Like all macaws {{and most}} parrots seeds and fruit {{are the major}} part of the diet of the genus Ara. The {{particular}} species and range of diet varies from species to species. Unlike many birds macaws are seed predators not seed <b>dispersers,</b> and use their immensely strong beaks to open even the hardest shells. Their diet overlaps with that of some monkey species; in one study of green-winged macaws in Venezuela they shared many of the same trees as bearded sakis, although in some cases they ate the seeds at an earlier stage of ripeness than the sakis, when they contained more poison. Macaws, like other parrots, may consume clay to absorb toxic compounds produced by some poison...but with further research we now at last know it is just to eat life saving sodium that is missing. As well, the toxic compounds of some foods may be neutralized by compounds, such as tannins, found in other foods consumed at the same time...but we have found that it is untrue and really just to gain access to sodium missing otherwise in their diet because of the area they live in.|$|E
25|$|The Indian subcontinent {{has served}} as a stage for intense human and tiger confrontations. The region affording habitat where tigers have {{achieved}} their highest densities is also one which has housed one of the most concentrated and rapidly expanding human populations. At the beginning of the 19th century tigers were so numerous {{it seemed to be a}} question as to whether man or tiger would survive. It became the official policy to encourage the killing of tigers as rapidly as possible, rewards being paid for their destruction in many localities. The United Provinces supported large numbers of tigers in the submontane Terai region, where man-eating had been uncommon. In the latter half of the 19th century, marauding tigers began to take a toll of human life. These animals were pushed into marginal habitat, where tigers had formerly not been known, or where they existed only in very low density, by an expanding population of more vigorous animals that occupied the prime habitat in the lowlands, where there was high prey density and good habitat for reproduction. The <b>dispersers</b> had no where else to go, since the prime habitat was bordered in the south by cultivation. They are thought to have followed back the herds of domestic livestock that wintered in the plains when they returned to the hills in the spring, and then being left without prey when the herds dispersed back to their respective villages. These tigers were the old, the young and the disabled. All suffered from some disability, mainly caused either by gunshot wounds or porcupine quills.|$|E
500|$|In its environment, the {{collared}} {{brown lemur}} {{acts as a}} seed disperser, and is especially critical for the dispersal of large-seeded fruiting trees within its range. [...] However, {{there is no evidence}} that these relationships are coevolutionary and instead these lemurs may be the last remaining seed <b>dispersers</b> for these tree species following the extinction of larger frugivorous birds and subfossil lemurs.|$|E
500|$|Because it ate larger, harder, more fibrous fruits than ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur {{was likely}} an {{important}} seed disperser {{compared to the}} more folivorous extinct giant lemurs. [...] Within the spiny thickets of southwest Madagascar, only P.insignis and Archaeolemur majori, a type of extinct monkey lemur, are suspected of having been large-seed <b>dispersers,</b> particularly for plants that use a form of photosynthesis known as C3 carbon fixation. [...] The plants that may have depended on these giant extinct lemurs include Adansonia (baobabs), Cedrelopsis, Commiphora, Delonix, Diospyros, Grewia, Pachypodium, Salvadora, Strychnos, Tamarindus, and Uncarina.|$|E
500|$|The fruit are {{dispersed}} by animals; fruit {{which are}} not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bruchid beetles. Certain species of Attalea have been mentioned as examples of [...] "anachronistic" [...] species which are adapted for dispersal by now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna. On Maracá Island, Roraima, in the Brazilian Amazon, Attalea maripa fruit were consumed by tapirs, collared peccaries, deer and primates. Rodents, including agoutis, fed upon the fruit and, as the fruit availability declined, they fed on the seeds. Other <b>dispersers</b> of Attalea fruit include Crested Caracaras which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A.phalerata in the Brazilian Pantanal.|$|E
500|$|Black-and-white ruffed lemurs can swallow seeds with a {{diameter}} up to , which {{is larger than}} any other living lemur. [...] Having been {{more than twice as}} large, Pachylemur would have been capable of swallowing even larger seeds. [...] In the case of baobabs, the fruits have large seeds surrounded by a nutritious pulp and may have required seed dispersal through ingestion. [...] In western Madagascar, the genetic diversity of Commiphora guillaminii suggests it had more widespread seed dispersal in the past, but today shows signs of more localized diversity when compared to African species within the same genus that have not lost their seed <b>dispersers.</b>|$|E
500|$|Giant subfossil lemurs {{are thought}} to have also played a {{significant}} role in seed dispersal, possibly targeting species that did not attract the seed dispersal services of the extinct elephant birds. [...] Biogeochemistry studies have shown that they may have been the primary seed <b>dispersers</b> for the endemic and native C3 trees in the spiny forests. [...] Terrestrial species may even have dispersed seeds for small bushes in addition to tall trees. [...] Seed dispersal can involve passing seeds through the gut (endozoochory) or attaching the seeds to the animal's body (epizoochory), and both processes probably occurred with subfossil lemurs. [...] Seeds from Uncarina species embed themselves in lemur fur, and likely did the same with subfossil lemurs. [...] Seed dispersal biology is known for very few species in the spiny forest, including genera of plants suspected of depending on giant lemurs, such as Adansonia, Cedrelopsis, Commiphora, Delonix, Diospyros, Grewia, Pachypodium, Salvadora, Strychnos, and Tamarindus. [...] For example, Delonix has edible pods that are rich in protein, and Adansonia fruits have a nutritious pulp and large seeds that may have been dispersed by Archaeolemur majori or Pachylemur insignis.|$|E
2500|$|Ficus maxima fruit are {{consumed}} by birds and mammals. These animals act as seed <b>dispersers</b> when the defaecate or regurgitate intact seeds, {{or when they}} drop fruit below the parent tree. [...] In Panama, F. maxima fruit {{were reported to have}} relatively high levels of protein and low levels of water-soluble carbohydrates in a study of Ficus fruit consumed by bats.|$|E
2500|$|Imperial pigeons are {{amongst the}} largest frugivores in the forest, and can {{disperse}} seeds from fruit {{too large for}} most other species to handle. A fruit size of 30mm would exclude all vertebrates other than hornbills (Bucerotidae) and Ducula. Medium-sized pigeons tend to feed on medium-sized fruit, while larger pigeons feed on larger fruit. [...] Pacific pigeons (D. pacifica) are shown to be excellent seed <b>dispersers</b> in Tonga and are thus critical {{in the management of}} forests throughout their habitat.|$|E
2500|$|Normal {{population}} cycles do {{not occur}} when dispersal is prevented; under normal conditions, <b>dispersers</b> {{have been shown to}} be behaviorally, genetically, and demographically different from residents. A threshold density of cover is thought to be needed for meadow vole populations to increase. [...] Above the threshold amount, the quantity of cover influences the amplitude and possibly the duration of the population peak. Local patches of dense cover could serve as source populations or reservoirs to colonize less favorable habitats with sparse cover.|$|E
2500|$|Some seeds {{have evolved}} strong anti-herbivore {{chemical}} compounds. In contrast to physical defenses, chemical defenses in seeds to deter consumption by seed predators by using chemicals that are toxic to granivores or inhibit the digestibility of the seed. These chemicals include non-protein amino acids, cyanogenic-glycosides, protease and amylase inhibitors, phytohaemaglutinins. Seeds face trade-offs between allocation toward defenses {{and the size}} and number of seeds produced. [...] Additionally plants have trade-offs in seed defense allocation between deterring seed predators and attracting seed <b>dispersers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most of the world's two thousand-odd {{species of}} geckos are active by night (nocturnal) whereas all species of Naultinus are active by day (diurnal). Unlike their close {{relatives}} in the Hoplodactylus genus, Naultinus species lack the ability to alter their skin color. These geckos are omnivores. Diet for members of this genus consists of flying insects such as moths and flies but also of flightless invertebrates such as amphipods and spiders. All New Zealand geckos will supplement their primarily insectivorous diet and consume nectar and berries (the small purple fruits of Māhoe for example) [...] and there is evidence that, in doing so, {{they may have a}} function in New Zealand ecosystems as pollinators and seed <b>dispersers</b> for certain species of native plant. In captivity they will thrive on a simple diet of moths and flies caught in traps.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] boar needs around 4,000–4,500 {{calories}} of food per day, {{though this}} required amount increases during winter and pregnancy, {{with the majority}} of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground like underground plant material and burrowing animals. Acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones, as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods. In Western Europe, underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken, willow herb, bulbs, meadow herb roots and bulbs, and the bulbs of cultivated crops. Such food is favoured in early spring and summer, but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failures. Should regular wild foods become scarce, boars will eat tree bark and fungi, as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields. Boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants. Boars of the vittatus subspecies in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet, which consists of 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed <b>dispersers.</b> The wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect, including Aconitum, Anemone, Calla, Caltha, Ferula, and Pteridium.|$|E
60|$|Some endeavors {{were used}} to {{suppress}} the printing of such books as terrified the people, and to frighten the <b>dispersers</b> of them, {{some of whom were}} taken up, but nothing done in it, as I am informed; the government being unwilling to exasperate the people, who were, as I may say, all out of their wits already.|$|E
6000|$|This execution, {{which so}} captivated the {{imagination}} of Sir Mungo Malagrowther, was really a striking one. The criminal, a furious and bigoted Puritan, had published a book in very violent terms against the match of Elizabeth with the Duke of Alencon, which he termed an union of a daughter of God with a son of antichrist. Queen Elizabeth was greatly incensed at the freedom assumed in this work, and caused the author Stubbs, with Page the publisher, and one Singleton the printer, to be tried on an act passed by Philip and Mary against the writers and <b>dispersers</b> of seditious publications. They were convicted, and although there was an opinion strongly entertained by the lawyers, that the act was only temporary, and expired with Queen Mary, Stubbs and Page received sentence to have their right hands struck off. They accordingly suffered the punishment, the wrist being divided by a cleaver driven through the joint by force of a mallet. The printer was pardoned. [...] "I remember," [...] says the historian Camden, [...] "being then present, that Stubbs, when his right hand was cut off, plucked off his hat with the left, and said, with a loud voice, 'God save the Queen!' The multitude standing about was deeply silent, either out of horror of this new and unwonted kind of punishment, or out of commiseration towards the man, as being of an honest and unblamable repute, or else out of hatred to the marriage, which most men presaged would be the overthrow of religion."-CAMDBN'S Annals for the Year 1581.|$|E
50|$|For visible {{characteristic}} {{differences to}} develop between <b>dispersers</b> and non-dispersers a few conditions {{need to be}} met 1. Specialization must increase dispersal success whether morphological, physiological or behavioural 2. Energy investment for dispersal will be taken from energy investment of other traits 3. Dispersal traits will benefit the <b>dispersers</b> over non-dispersers. Phenotypic (visible characteristics) differences in non-dispersers and <b>dispersers</b> {{can be caused by}} external factors, kin competition, intraspecific competition and habitat quality.|$|E
50|$|Male hyraxes {{have been}} {{categorised}} into four classes: territorial, peripheral, early <b>dispersers,</b> and late <b>dispersers.</b> The territorial males are dominant. Peripheral males are more solitary and sometimes {{take over a}} group when the dominant male is missing. Early-dispersing males are juveniles that leave the birth site around 16 to 24 months of age. Late <b>dispersers</b> are also juvenile males, but they leave the birth site much later; around 30 or more months of age.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{have shown}} that body size and {{dispersal}} ability do not correlate (Jenkins et al. 2007). However, this finding rests heavily {{on the fact that}} active and passive <b>dispersers</b> have been grouped together in the analyses. When the same data are separated into two categories (active and passive <b>dispersers)</b> a pattern emerges. Jenkins and others (2007) have found that for active <b>dispersers</b> larger organisms will disperse greater distances. Regardless of this correlation its effects on speciation rates remain unclear.|$|E
