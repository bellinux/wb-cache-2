5|$|Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael {{was born}} in Haarlem in 1628 or 1629 into a family of {{painters}}, all landscapists. The number of painters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> the multiple spellings of the Ruisdael name, have hampered attempts to document his life and attribute his works.|$|E
5|$|Before her marriage, Louise {{served as}} an {{unofficial}} secretary to her mother, the Queen (1866–1871). The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria wanted new blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the aristocracy. Despite opposition {{from members of the}} royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, the heir to the Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. Despite a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen's constraints on their activities.|$|E
5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family is also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E

5|$|The seized estates of the Earl Marischal were {{purchased}} in 1720 for £41,172, by the York Buildings Company who dismantled {{much of the}} castle. In 1761 the Earl briefly returned to Scotland and bought back Dunnottar only to sell it five years later to Alexander Keith, an Edinburgh lawyer who served as Knight Marischal of Scotland. Dunnottar was inherited in 1852 by Sir Patrick Keith-Murray of Ochtertyre, who in turn sold it in July 1873 to Major Alexander Innes of Cowie and Raemoir for about £80,000. It was purchased by Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, in 1925 after which his wife embarked on a programme of repairs. Since that time the castle has remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> has been open to the public, attracting 52,500 visitors in 2009.|$|E

Following Don's death, Sue began battling depression, requiring Penny to at times care for her mother and her younger brothers. At age 16, Penny wrote a letter to her grandfather, and head of the family business empire, A.N. Pritzker, in which she asked why he talked business with the men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> not with her. Finally realizing Penny's interest in business, A.N. provided her with a summer course in accounting.|$|E

25|$|One can {{represent}} any partial order {{as a family}} of sets, such that x < y in the partial order whenever the set corresponding to x is {{a subset of the}} set corresponding to y.
