40|$|Abstract. Paper {{presents}} a lab low power wind turbine of 2. 5 kW. The <b>driving</b> <b>propeller</b> is modeled with an assembly of variable frequency converter, three-phase induction motor and speed reducer. Thus the motor's speed {{can be easily}} driven {{in the range of}} (300 – 1500) rpm and its size is little. The speed reducer lowers the speed 5 times so that the generator will spin in the range (60 – 300) rpm. This range is usual for the propellers of wind turbines. In the end the trials of the system are presented using a specific data acquisition system. Key word...|$|E
50|$|As in the {{preceding}} P and Q classes, the forward control car contained a single engine <b>driving</b> a pusher <b>propeller</b> and an aft engine car contained three engines, one <b>driving</b> a pusher <b>propeller</b> {{at the rear of}} the car and the other two <b>driving</b> <b>propellers</b> mounted on brackets on either side of the hull via driveshafts: these were reversible. Unlike the previous design, which had the three engines mounted in line, the two engines <b>driving</b> the hull-mounted <b>propellers</b> were side by side. The additional two engines were carried in small engine cars either side of the hull, accessed by a catwalk from the keel gangway.|$|R
50|$|Anton Flettner was {{an early}} rotary-wing pioneer in Germany, he {{developed}} a torqueless rotor by powering it with small engines fixed directly to the blades <b>driving</b> <b>propellers.</b> this arrangement drove the rotor without transmitting torque (other than bearing friction) to the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|A {{steamboat}} is a {{boat that}} is propelled primarily by steam power, typically <b>driving</b> <b>propellers</b> or paddlewheels. Steamboats sometimes use the prefix designation SS, S.S. or S/S (for 'Screw Steamer') or PS (for 'Paddle Steamer'), however these designations are most often used for Steamships.|$|R

50|$|Anatolii Georgievich Bedunkovich {{designed}} a large single-engined twin-boomed attack aircraft during 1939, to be constructed from stressed skin light-alloy.
