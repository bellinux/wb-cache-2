5|$|Gravel was in {{the next}} several debates, in one case after CNN {{reversed}} a decision to exclude him. Gravel, as with some of the other second-tier candidates, did not get as much time as the leaders; during the June 2, 2007, New Hampshire debate, which lasted two <b>hours,</b> <b>he</b> was asked 10 questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and 37 seconds.|$|E
5|$|James Bond {{is sent to}} {{investigate}} the murder of three British MI6 agents, {{all of whom have}} been killed within 24 <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> discovers the victims were all separately investigating the operations of Dr. Kananga, the dictator of a small Caribbean island, San Monique. He also establishes that Kananga also acts as Mr. Big, a ruthless and cunning gangster.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 2007, Serevi was {{appointed}} a Special Inspector with the Fiji Police Force by the acting Commissioner of Police Romanu Tikotikoca. The appointment is in youth and community policing. Serevi {{will not be}} a regular officer, but will be paid for the <b>hours</b> <b>he</b> works.|$|E

60|$|CURATE. Possibly to-morrow at {{an early}} <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> may be more perspicuous.|$|R
60|$|In an <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> {{returned}} {{with one of}} his men, carrying two parcels.|$|R
5|$|The French {{carried out}} seven assaults against the flèches {{and each time}} were beaten back in fierce close combat. Bagration in some {{instances}} was personally leading counterattacks, and in a final attempt to push the French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball splinters somewhere around 11:00 <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka's decisive cavalry attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which Crusoe will reach an {{equilibrium}} {{between the number of}} <b>hours</b> <b>he</b> works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function. This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Taylor moved to Raleigh, North Carolina with his five daughters {{and worked as}} a UPS package handler, then worked as a beer distributor. By 2006, he had moved back home and was working as a bricklayer with his father. In January 2005, police charged Taylor with misdemeanor child abuse for allegedly leaving four of his children (ages from 2 to 11) alone for more than eight <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> did not show up for his court date, and at one point there were four outstanding warrants for his arrest.|$|E
60|$|In {{a quarter}} of an <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> heard the distant note of a bugle.|$|R
60|$|In {{a quarter}} of an <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> was holding the glass against his sleeve.|$|R
60|$|At twilight, {{long before}} the {{appointed}} <b>hour,</b> <b>he</b> returned empty-handed, much begrimed with dirt.|$|R
5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|McCabe scored 60 of the 70 runs that Australia {{added on}} the second day to finish 187 not out from 233 balls as Australia were bowled out for 360. McCabe added the runs in just one hour of batting and ended with 25 {{boundaries}} in his innings, which lasted a little over four <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> was particularly effectively in farming the strike while batting with his tail end partners; in his last wicket stand of 55 with Tim Wall, he scored 50 of the runs in just half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic, with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane. On the final day, Miller set the hosts 275 for victory in three <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> {{lengthened}} the innings break by seven minutes, by remonstrating with officials to pause the {{match for the}} running of the Melbourne Cup. They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 minutes for the race. Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.|$|E
60|$|In a half <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> {{returned}} with a dozen prisoners, but no Peter of Colfax.|$|R
60|$|For an <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> remained, {{apparently}} unnoticed, then Captain Wingratz rode up {{with another}} officer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{come to you}} early {{like this}} because there's not an <b>hour</b> to lose"--if <b>he</b> lost an <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> might fail himself yet! [...] "Have you a really {{trustworthy}} woman free?" ...|$|R
5|$|On 10 April, Rane got {{up early}} and resumed work on an {{obstacle}} {{that had not been}} cleared the previous night. Within a span of two <b>hours,</b> <b>he</b> cleared the roadblock of five large pine trees in the midst of mines and machine-gun fire. This allowed the 4th Dogra Battalion to advance another thirteen kilometers until it encountered another major roadblock. The Pakistani forces were situated on the adjoining hills and able to fire on all approaches to the block, making its destruction problematic. Rane drove a tank to the roadblock and took cover behind the tank while blasting open the roadblock with mines, opening the road {{before the end of the}} night.|$|E
5|$|On 12–13 April 1916 near Beit Ayeesa, Mesopotamia, Naik Shahamad Khan was {{in charge}} of a machine-gun {{covering}} a gap in our new line within 150 yards of the entrenched enemy. He beat off three counter-attacks and worked his gun single-handed after all his men, except two belt-fillers, had become casualties. For three <b>hours</b> <b>he</b> held the gap under very heavy fire and when his gun was knocked out, he and his two belt-fillers held their ground with rifles until ordered to withdraw. With help he then brought back his gun, ammunition and one severely wounded man, and finally all remaining arms and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Roland Morris was an {{experienced}} instructor {{with more than}} 2,000 <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> was critical of Finucane's habit of trying to force the aircraft {{to do what he}} wanted instead of coaxing it. Despite a series of blunders, Finucane wanted to fly solo. At that time Finucane was five hours flight training behind the rest of his group, but he made a successful solo trip on 21 September after the completion of 14:05 hours piloting. The flight was not without fault; Finucane nearly stalled the aircraft after taking off.|$|E
60|$|THE rain {{trickled down}} his back, and {{for nearly an}} <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> stared at the float.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} half an <b>hour,</b> <b>he</b> {{tossed the}} twig from him with a grunt.|$|R

5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet. In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor caucus had decided that should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be Cabinet members. Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work, and on 18 December the caucus elected the Cabinet. The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam, and within three <b>hours,</b> <b>he</b> had announced the portfolios of the Cabinet members. To give himself greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control of the Cabinet agenda.|$|E
5|$|The {{burden on}} Miller and Lindwall {{increased}} when Johnston {{broke down in}} an early tour game. Miller was wicketless against Worcestershire, but succeeded with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 220 in just over six <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> then scored 159notout against Yorkshire. At this point, Miller had scored 421runs in the week of May, and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000runs in one month, something {{that had been done}} on a tour only by Bradman.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Romeo (Nolan North), and Mickey (Alan Tudyk) {{discussing}} the Covenant ship above New Mombasa, with the Rookie asleep nearby. Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> awakens and proceeds to find clues {{as to what happened}} to his squadmates.|$|E
60|$|In another <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> stood {{once more}} on the spot at which he and Sally had met.|$|R
60|$|During an <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> waited, {{shrouded}} {{from view}} by the gloom, {{and then came}} the desired opportunity.|$|R
60|$|Within the <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> {{was in the}} saddle, and his horse's {{head was}} turned northwards once more.|$|R
5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two <b>hours,</b> <b>he</b> escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan sent out a search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two chairs across a window was found in the jury room just after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought that the men had intended to hang Laura out of the window, but were deterred by an electric light burning nearby.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being {{prepared}} for the men, their first meal in 48 <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> {{was standing in the doorway}} of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.|$|E
5|$|To this day, George P. Burdell {{is listed}} as a letterman in the {{official}} media guides of two Tech sports: from 1928 to 1930 in football and 1956 to 1958 in basketball. In 1969, Georgia Tech computerized its class registration, believing it had successfully {{found a way to}} keep students from registering Burdell for class that semester. As it turned out, hackers registered him for every class at the school that quarter, over 3,000 credit <b>hours.</b> <b>He</b> was subsequently re-enrolled several times, including in 1975 and 1980.|$|E
5000|$|On Alex Clare's 2011 album The Lateness of the <b>Hour,</b> <b>he</b> co-wrote the {{hit song}} [...] "Too Close".|$|R
60|$|Every half <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> went upstairs, and inquired, {{through the}} door, {{as to the}} state of the boy.|$|R
60|$|It {{was three}} in the afternoon, and in another <b>hour</b> <b>he</b> would be {{in his state of}} beatitude.|$|R
