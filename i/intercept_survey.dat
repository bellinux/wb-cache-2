30|$|A {{traveler}} <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> {{was carried}} out on 22 road segments located {{in different parts of}} the study area. These segments were basically selected from varying road conditions (excellent-worst). Similar to the videography survey, this traveler <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> was also carried out during the peak hours of traffic flow to reflect the worst perceived conditions. Team members were employed to conduct on-site face-to-face interactions with at least 145 on-street bicycle users from each segment and collect their responses. The socio-demographic diversities among these participants were kept approximately similar to those in videography survey participants.|$|E
40|$|Growing {{interest}} in sustainable transportation systems and livable communities {{has created a}} need for more complete measures of pedestrian travel. Yet, many performance measures do not account for short pedestrian movements, such as walking between stores in a shopping district, walking from a street parking space to a building entrance, or walking from a bus stop to home. This study uses a 2009 <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> and the 2009 National Household Travel Survey to quantify pedestrian travel to, from, and within 20 San Francisco Bay Area shopping districts. Overall, walking was the primary travel mode for 21 % of <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> and 10 % of NHTS tours with stops in these shopping districts. However, detailed analysis of pedestrian movements showed that walking was common on respondent tours (52 % of <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> tours included some walking) and that walking was used on the majority of trips within these shopping districts (65 % of <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> trips and 71 % of NHTS trips within the shopping districts were made by walking). In general, Urban Core and Suburban Main Street shopping districts had higher levels of pedestrian activity than Suburban Thoroughfare and Suburban Shopping Center shopping districts. The detailed analysis in this paper provides a more complete picture of pedestrian activity than is commonly shown by national and regional household survey summaries. ...|$|E

During the summer of 2014, surveys were mailed to 1537 households near a proposed cycle track on Malcolm X Boulevard in Roxbury, MA. On the Boulevard, <b>intercept</b> <b>surveys</b> were distributed to cyclists and observations noted about passing cyclist's characteristics. Data were analyzed from 252 returned-mailed <b>surveys,</b> 120 <b>intercept</b> <b>surveys,</b> and 709 bicyclists. White (100 %), Hispanic (79 %), and Black (76 %) bicyclists shown pictures of 6 bicycle facility types in <b>intercept</b> <b>surveys</b> perceived the cycle track as safest. More White mailed-survey respondents thought bikes would not be stolen {{which may explain why}} more Hispanics (52 %) and Blacks (47 %) preferred to park their bikes inside their home compared with Whites (28 %), with H/W B/W differences statistically significant (p <  0. 05). More Hispanic (81 %) and Black (54 %) mailed-survey respondents thought they would bicycle more if they could bicycle with family and friends compared with Whites (40 %). Bicyclists observed commuting morning and evening included Blacks (55 %), Whites (36 %) and Hispanics (9 %). More Whites (68 %) wore helmets compared with Hispanics (21 %) and Blacks (17 %) (p <  0. 001). More Blacks (94 %) and Hispanics (94 %) rode a mountain bike compared with Whites (75 %). Minority populations are biking on roads but prefer cycle tracks. They also prefer to park bikes inside their homes and bicycle with family and friends. Wide cycle tracks (bicycling with family/friends) and home bike parking should be targeted as capital investments in lower-income minority neighborhoods...|$|R

30|$|A {{perception}} {{survey was}} conducted to test how bicyclists perceive their satisfaction levels under varying roadway environments. Videography survey (showing roadway environments to the participants through suitable video clips and asking them to rate the road under shown conditions) and traveler <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> (on-site face-to-face interaction with the users of interest) are commonly followed methods to assess user’s satisfaction levels. It is well accepted that, videography survey is an established method and has several advantages like (1) the number of street segments that participants can rate during a reasonable period of time is generally high, (2) more diverse group of participants can be included, (3) it is more cost-effective than having respondents on site, and many more. Thus, an extensive videography survey {{was carried out in}} this study to gather a huge amount of data sets. These data sets were utilized for the development of BLOS models. However, videography survey has several limitations as well, and those bicyclists who travel regularly on a road segment are the best examiners of the perceived bicycling quality of that particular roadway section. Thus, a traveler <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> was also carried out at some identified locations (22 segments), and the proposed BLOS model was validated with so obtained data sets.|$|E

40|$|How {{people respond}} to {{research}} surveys has been of long standing interest to investigators. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences in using the <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> {{as part of a}} study that examined m‑payment in Thailand. The paper does not rep ort the findings of the original m‑payment study, but highlights how the cultural features of the target population were an important consideration at the survey translation, pilot testing and data collection stages. We propose that cultural features such as face‑to‑face interaction, the intrinsic notion of politeness (Kreng Jai) and conveying respect to potential participants (giving the Wai) as significant elements in achieving a relatively high participation rate. Survey translation occurred via mo derated discussions where the cultural dimensions of collectivism and personal status (relevant in high PDI societies) were observed to influence group dynamics. In the field, the <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> promoted direct engagement with people (preferred among st collectivism cultures), with respondents observed to be highly considerate of investigator needs and thus more likely to participate in the study. The paper�s contribution is one of highlighting the importance of considering national culture in the ini tial survey translation stage and later when collecting data in the field. Although a reflective piece, we believe that the findings have the potential to inform and assist researchers {{to improve the quality of}} their survey instruments and data responses in similar cultural settings...|$|E
