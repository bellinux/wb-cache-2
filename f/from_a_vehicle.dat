5|$|Anarky is {{a fictional}} character, {{appearing}} in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he {{first appeared in}} Detective Comics No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration {{for the creation of}} the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and free market thinking.|$|E

5|$|The game retains some {{platforming}} traits; {{the player}} may disembark <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{and explore the}} environment {{in a manner similar}} to that of the previous games. On foot the duo can grab ledges, swim underwater, balance on tightropes and perform basic jumps. Kazooie's spanner can also be used as a melee weapon outside of the vehicle, in addition to levitating lopsided vehicles. Banjo and Kazooie have limited attack power and agility on foot at first, but the duo can upgrade their speed, stamina and strength by visiting Boggy's gym in the game's hub world. Scattered around the game's six worlds are musical notes, which serve as currency for the player to purchase certain items such as blueprints, parts, and access to advanced vehicles. Musical notes vary in value as determined by its colour; gold, silver or bronze. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts also features an online multiplayer; players can compete in challenges such as races and combat over Xbox Live. In addition, players can share their own vehicle designs and blueprints online.|$|E

25|$|Several large {{quantities}} of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In June 2006, 945 grams (2.08 lbs) of 83 %-pure fentanyl powder was seized by Border Patrol agents in California <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> that had entered from Mexico. Mexico {{is the source of}} much of the illicit fentanyl for sale in the U.S. However, in April 2006, there was one domestic fentanyl lab discovered by law enforcement in Azusa, California. The lab was a source of counterfeit 80mg OxyContin tablets containing fentanyl instead of oxycodone, as well as bulk fentanyl and other drugs. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China.|$|E

On 9December Hodgson was charged in relation to the theft and remanded in custody. He was interviewed by detectives on several occasions about DeSimone's murder; however, as his whereabouts at the time of the murder could not be verified, and police knew he was of blood type [...] "A", he was briefly investigated.|$|E
2500|$|The Governor-General's flag is a {{dark blue}} flag with the Shield of the New Zealand Coat of Arms surmounted by a Royal Crown in the centre.
