2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "And Cain spoke to Abel his brother," [...] a Midrash {{imagined}} the subject of their discussion. The Midrash taught that they divided the world between them.

The second retorted that the first was wearing the second's clothes. The second told the first to strip off his clothes. The first retorted that the second should fly off his ground.

[...] Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in Rabbi Levi's name, however, that Cain and Abel quarreled because one said that the Temple would have to be built in his area, while the other claimed that {{it would have to be}} built in his. For [...] says, [...] "And it came to pass, when they were in the field," [...] and [...] "field" [...] refers to the Temple, as [...] equates the two when it says, [...] "Zion (that is, the Temple) shall be plowed as a field."

[...] Judah the son of Rabbi, however, said that their quarrel was about the first Eve. But Rabbi Aibu said that the first Eve had by then returned to dust. Rav Huna taught that Cain and Abel quarreled over an additional twin daughter who was born with Abel, whom each brother claimed for his own. Cain said that he would have her, because he was the firstborn, while Abel maintained that he would have to have her, because she was born with him.|$|E

He would urinate with the bathroom door open and, if she was walking by, would mumble about his penis, saying [...] "Ahh, what a beauty! It looks just like a big, fine beef heart". [...] In a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Van Vliet requests [...] "don't ask me why or how" [...] he and Zappa came up with the name. Johnny Carson also asked him the same question to which Van Vliet replied that one day <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the pier and saw fishermen cutting the bills off pelicans. He said it made him sad and put [...] "a beef in his heart". Carson appeared nervous and uncomfortable interviewing Van Vliet and after the next commercial break Van Vliet was gone. He would later claim in an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman that the name referred to [...] "a beef in my heart against this society". In the [...] "Grunt People" [...] draft script Beefheart and his mother play themselves, with his father played by Howlin' Wolf. Grace Slick is penned in as a [...] "celestial seductress" [...] and there are also roles for future Magic Band members Bill Harkleroad and Mark Boston.|$|E
