40|$|Abstract- There are {{a number}} of factors that need to be {{considered}} when designing high voltage substations. Therefore, <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> high voltage substation is a challenging task. The first step in <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> high voltage substation is to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> earthing and bonding system. An earthing system connection is one to which transformer and generators neutrals or earthing impedances may be connected in order to pass the maximum fault current. In this paper <b>designing</b> <b>an</b> earthing and bonding system for high voltage substation using one and half circuit breaker layout has been briefly explained...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} method that enables {{cognitive}} processes to be analysed quantitatively without having a conceptual framework {{in place at the}} start of the research. With current methods, the general structure of the cognitive process in question has to be known before quantitative analyses can be preformed. With the method, we studied the cognitive process of weighting the importance of attributes in a purchasing decision. Our approach consists of seven steps: determining the research method (in our case: the think-aloud method); <b>designing</b> <b>an</b> experiment; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> data collection method; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for preliminary analysis; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for qualitative analysis; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for quantitative analysis; assessing external validity.
