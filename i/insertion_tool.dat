50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the <b>insertion</b> <b>tool</b> with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the <b>insertion</b> <b>tool</b> using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the <b>insertion</b> <b>tool</b> that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|E

Some tools are used by users taking on one specific role, in very specific activities and to process documents of a specific type (e. g., a compiler).

40|$|Abstract—The {{injection}} of small implants into precisely localized sites {{within the body}} is a difficult task usually undertaken by surgeons or interventive radiologists. We have designed, produced and tested a simple tool for implanting BIONTM wireless microstimulators as an outpatient office procedure.

40|$|Abstract—Cochlear {{electrode}} insertion is {{a challenging}} manual procedure. One technique requires the physician {{to coordinate the}} motions of an electrode array approximately 1 mm in diameter and the smaller stylet within it, using miniature forceps.

To address this, we present an automated <b>insertion</b> <b>tool.</b> This second generation device not only enables deployment in the minimally invasive setting, but also makes insertion velocity profiles repeatable and can sense insertion forces. Force sensing is essential because insertion forces can indicate impending damage to cochlear membranes, but are below the thresholds that can be sensed by human hands.

40|$|Software {{tools are}} often adopted during {{large-scale}} software development {{in order to}} increase software productivity. Tools can affect the ability of the organization to deliver quality software systems; and they can affect software development cost and cycle-time. However, too frequently, the <b>insertion</b> of <b>tools</b> fails to yield the desired improvement. This constitutes a significant problem to software organizations because the adoption of a tool can incur considerable cost, and because the adoption of inappropriate tools can disrupt the development process. Predicting the impact of <b>tool</b> <b>insertion</b> has traditionally been difficult because one tool can have drastically different effects on different projects. Among the many factors that can affect the impact of <b>tool</b> <b>insertion,</b> two key factors are the development activities practiced in the process {{and the size of the}} adopting project. In order to improve the ability of software organizations to predict the impact of the <b>insertion</b> of <b>tools</b> on productivity, we have developed a method, called the Software Productivity Analysis Method (SPAM). The method helps in analyzing how the adoption of different technologies affects productivity in projects of different sizes when different development activities are used. To compare software productivity in different situations using SPAM, one must model the alternative activity sets, technologies and project sizes, using the specific modeling notation proposed here, and evaluate such models. A prototype tool has also been developed that supports the construction of such models and automates the analysis of software productivity in each case. To date, only a small number of methods have been proposed that facilitate the study of <b>tool</b> <b>insertion</b> impact. Arguably, SPAM is the first method that enables comparative analyses of software productivity with respect to technology, activities and project size. In order to validate the SPAM method it was used it in a case study in a large-scale industrial software development environment. The study revealed that there exists a complex interplay among the size of a software project, the technology and development activities employed in the project, and the productivity of software development. For instance, the study found that: (1) for a given tool, software productivity may peak at certain project sizes and drop down for both smaller and larger projects; (2) large projects with a relatively simple development process could lose productivity as a result of inserting a sophisticated tool; and (3) a software project that moves to a more rigorous process can regain much of the productivity losses entailed by inserting an appropriate tool. In the study, SPAM proved to be an effective vehicle for understanding the implications of <b>tool</b> <b>insertion</b> in a specific project.

It has been shown that microstereotactic frames can enable an image-guided, minimally invasive approach to CI surgery called percutaneous cochlear implantation (PCI) that uses a single drill hole for electrode array insertion, avoiding a more invasive mastoidectomy. Current clinical methods for elec-trode array insertion are not compatible with PCI surgery because they require a mastoidectomy to access the cochlea; thus, we have developed a manually operated electrode array <b>insertion</b> <b>tool</b> that can be deployed through a PCI drill hole.

As a common feature the MMS blanket consist of in regard to electromagnetic loads and thermal stresses reasonable small blanket modules which are mounted onto a vertical back-plate that contains the coolant channels and in case of liquid metal blankets also the breeder manifolds. For all considered blanket concepts (HCPB, HCLL and DCLL) a common remote handling strategy was developed which – similar to the ITER divertor cassette maintenance – is based on the consecutive exchange of a limited number of assembled functional units. In addition to vertical <b>insertion</b> <b>tools</b> located inside the transfer casks, remote transport machines are involved that are inserted into the divertor region after the removal of the divertor cassettes to transport the MMS in toroidal direction.

The use of traditional IGBs require complex <b>insertion</b> <b>tools</b> and flexible endoscopes to place and remove the balloon inside the patient's stomach, which may cause discomfort and complications to the patient. This paper introduces a new ingestible weight-loss capsule with a magnetically remote-controlled inflatable and deflatable balloon. To inflate the balloon, biocompatible effervescent chemicals are used. As {{the source of the}} actuation is provided via external magnetic fields, the magnetic capsule size can be significantly reduced compared to current weight-loss capsules in the literature. In addition, there are no limitations on the power supply. To lose weight, the obese subject needs only to swallow the magnetic capsule with a glass of water. Once the magnetic capsule has reached the patient's stomach, the balloon will be wirelessly inflated to occupy gastric space and give the feeling of satiety. The balloon can be wirelessly deflated at any time to allow the magnetic capsule to travel down the intestine and exit the body via normal peristalsis. The optimal ratio between the acid and base to provide the desired gas volume is experimentally evaluated and presented.

The implants are for restoring speech function in cleft palate patients presenting velopharyngeal insufficiency and providing volume to reduce the nasolabial folds in order to create a more youthful appearance. We have developed facial implants for the nasolabial fold and lip plumping to address low efficiency of the current methods employed for dermal fillers by providing both long-term usage as well as removability. Furthermore, an insertion method and <b>insertion</b> <b>tools</b> were developed to facilitate the implantation for the surgeons. Regarding the reconstructive aspects of the maxillofacial implants, we have developed a pharyngeal implant aiming to reduce the gap between the pharyngeal implant and the velum (soft palate) of 20 % of patients presenting a cleft palate.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} MEMORAX, a {{tool for}} the verification of control state reachability (i. e., safety properties) of concurrent programs manipulating finite range and integer variables and running on top of weak memory models. The verification task is non-trivial as it involves exploring state spaces of arbitrary or even infinite sizes. Even for programs that only manipulate finite range variables, the sizes of the store buffers could grow unboundedly, and hence the state spaces {{that need to be}} explored could be of infinite size. In addition, MEMORAX in-corporates an interpolation based CEGAR loop to make possible the verification of control state reachability for concurrent programs involving integer variables. The reachability procedure is used to automatically compute possible memory fence placements that guarantee the unreachability of bad control states under TSO. In fact, for programs only involving finite range variables and running on TSO, the fence insertion functionality is complete, i. e., it will find all minimal sets of memory fence placements (minimal in the sense that removing any fence would result in the reachability of the bad control states). This makes MEMORAX the first freely available, open source, push-button verification and fence <b>insertion</b> <b>tool</b> for programs running under TSO with integer variables. ...|$|E

40|$|Superconducting (SC) bulk {{materials}} {{are commonly used}} as permanent magnets in synchronous rotating machines. When the machine is in operation, the {{bulk materials}} that are placed in the machine rotor can experience a certain misalignment with the magnetic field generated by the stator. This situation {{is likely to happen}} during transients or non-ideal behavior of the machine: the angle between the stator field and the SC magnetization can change because of a sudden change of mechanical load or vibrations of the device. The consequence is that the SC pellet can be subjected to a transverse component of magnetic field which is likely to cause a significant demagnetization and therefore a decrease of the machine performances. In previous works, we already have studied the problem of a “pure” transverse magnetic field (also called “crossed field”) as well as the beneficial influence of a ferromagnetic (FM) disk placed {{on the top of the}} SC pellet. To this aim, a bespoke <b>insertion</b> <b>tool</b> for a PPMS was designed and constructed. The tool can be used to characterize a SC sample whose orientation is changed from a parallel to a perpendicular direction with respect to the magnetic field direction. Here, this <b>insertion</b> <b>tool</b> was used to rotate the sample at various angles regarding to the field direction. A GdBCO pellet of 9 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height was characterized at 77 K in various experimental conditions by measuring the magnetic induction below the centre of the sample surface. We compared the results obtained with the GdBCO pellet alone to those with a FM disk of various thicknesses attached on the top of the sample. A first set of experiments consisted in applying pure transverse magnetic field cycles of 50 mT and 100 mT at low frequency, the polarity of the field being either always the same (unipolar) or reversed after half of the period (bipolar). A second set of experiments was carried out by rotating the applied magnetic field (applied first in the pellet magnetization direction) in several steps to a given angle (up to 90 °) and back to 0 °. All these experiments were carried out after having fully magnetized the sample and recorded the magnetization decay due to the flux creep during 30 min. The results show that (i) the FM disk reduces the magnetization decay in both pure transverse and rotated magnetic field experiments, (ii) rotated magnetic fields have a less detrimental effect than the “pure transverse” magnetic field. This phenomenon is likely to be caused by a partial remagnetization of the sample when the angle of the magnetic field is reduced back to 0 °. Finite element modelling was carried out to sustain the measurements of the local magnetic induction and gives additional information on the supercurrent distribution inside the SC pellet during “pure transverse” and “rotated” applied fields...|$|E

Aim: To provide a scoping review of decision aids for PIVC <b>insertion</b> including <b>tools,</b> clinical prediction rules, and algorithms (TRA) and their findings on factors associated with insertion success. Methods: In June 2016, a systematic literature search was performed using the medical subject heading of peripheral catheterization and tool* or rule* or algorithm*. Data extraction included clinician, patient and/or product variables associated with PIVC insertion success. Information about TRA reliability, validity, responsiveness and utility was also extracted. Results: We screened 36 studies, and included 13 for review. Seven papers reported insertion success ranging from 61...|$|R
5000|$|The Helicopter Flight Rescue System (HFRS), {{also known}} as the Helicopter External Transport System (HETS), is a {{helicopter}} <b>insertion</b> and extraction <b>tool</b> which as under the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) is authorized for use in Forest Fire Fighting, Law Enforcement and Search and Rescue. The system is often referred to a [...] "Long Line", [...] "Short Haul" [...] and other terms, and is similar to other helicopter long line systems in use throughout the world.|$|R
40|$|Theacquisition of a tool-using ability was {{investigated}} in six young chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, 2 to 4 years old). Age-matched pairs were presented with a horizontal transparent tube with a food item inserted in the center, and a wooden <b>tool.</b> <b>Insertion</b> of the <b>tool</b> into the tube was {{required in order to}} obtain the food item. One of each pair was exposed to a model performing the task successfully,whereas the age-matched peer was not. Following acquisition, subjects were tested with more complex versions of the task to evaluate their comprehension. Age affected acquisition; older individuals learned to solve the task in fewer number of trials than younger chimpanzees. The presence of a model influenced acquisition only in the 3 -and- 4 year-old groups and not in the 2 -year-old group. Moreover,older individuals made fewer errors when faced with tools requiring modification, and the performance of older individuals on these complex tasks improved with limited practice. These results are related to recent findings on cognitive development in chimpanzees indicating that self-recognition emerges between 24 and 30 months and that 4 year-old chimpanzees can imitate novel arbitrary actions. Comparisons with human cognitive developmental data and findings on the same task with older apes point to the link between the emergence of imitation, self recognition, and comprehension of the cause-effect relation present in this task. Competence in all these domains is somewhat delayed in chimpanzees compared to humans...|$|R
