40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} {{is frequently}} associated with anaemia. The prevalence of anaemia among Egyptian infants {{and young children}} is 25 %. Fortification of infant and follow-up milk-based formulae remains a valuable method for delivering iron to {{reduce the incidence of}} iron deficiency anaemia. Percentage of Egyptian non-breastfed children consuming milk or milk products (7 - 23 months) are 79. 1 %. No studies have focused on infant and follow-up milk-based formulae that are marketed in Egypt regarding iron fortification and consumption. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the intake of iron by non-breastfed Egyptian infants and young children. To achieve this goal the infant and <b>follow-up</b> <b>milk</b> based formulae brands and types, low – iron and iron – fortified, that are commercially available on the local market were collected. In addition, the iron concentration was determined in the collected formulae in relation to the label statements to ensure the correct intake. Finally, the actual daily intake of iron from formulae consumption was estimated in relation to the nutritional requirements. The CRM 1846 and 3126 a were used for the precision and accuracy o...|$|E
5000|$|The two new songs, [...] "Grow Old with Me" [...] and [...] "Let Me Count the Ways" [...] were {{originally}} meant for inclusion on the Double Fantasy album. However, Lennon and Ono {{were working on}} a tight deadline to get the album finished and released before Christmas, and decided to postpone recording of the song until the following year (1981) for the <b>follow-up</b> album, <b>Milk</b> and Honey. This never happened due to Lennon's murder in December 1980.|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} much more {{successful}} than its predecessors both critically and commercially, and was the band's first album to enter the Billboard 200, where it charted at number 148. Although Uplifts <b>follow-up</b> Mother's <b>Milk</b> would reach Gold first, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan {{would go on to}} become the band's earliest effort to do so. [...] Following the tour to promote the album, Slovak died of a heroin overdose and shortly after, Irons decided to quit the band, unable to cope with his friend's death.|$|R
500|$|Lennon {{emerged from}} his pause in music {{recording}} in October 1980 with the single [...] "(Just Like) Starting Over", followed the next month by the album Double Fantasy, which contained songs written during a journey to Bermuda on a 43-foot sailing boat the previous June, that reflected his fulfilment in his new-found stable family life. Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned <b>follow-up</b> album <b>Milk</b> and Honey (released posthumously in 1984). Released jointly by Lennon and Ono, Double Fantasy was not well received, drawing comments such as Melody Makers [...] "indulgent sterility... a godawful yawn".|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a community education campaign to encourage a switch from high-fat (whole and 2 %) milk to low-fat (1 %, 1 / 2 %, and skim) milk as a way to reduce consumption of saturated fat. METHODS: Milk sales data were collected from supermarkets in the intervention and comparison communities for three one-month time periods: at baseline, immediately following the campaign, and six months after the campaign. In addition, trained volunteers conducted pre- and post-intervention telephone surveys. RESULTS: Overall milk sales increased by 16 % in the intervention cities following the campaign and remained high at <b>follow-up.</b> Low-fat <b>milk's</b> market share increased from 18 % of overall milk sales at baseline to 41 % of overall milk sales in the month following the end of the campaign, an increase in market share that was sustained at the six-month follow-up. In the post-intervention telephone survey, 38. 2 % of those respondents who reported drinking high-fat milk at baseline reported having switched to low-fat milk. CONCLUSION: A focused message communicated through paid advertising, public relations activities, and community-based education programs increased low-fat and overall milk consumption in one community...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Conflicting {{results in}} the {{literature}} exist {{on the role of}} dairy products {{in the context of a}} Nordic Healthy Diet (NHD). Two recent Swedish studies indicate both negative and positive associations with total mortality when comparing key dairy products. There is no consensus about how to include these foods into the NHD. PURPOSE: To study consumption of cheese and milk products (milk, sour milk and unsweetened yoghurt) by 70 -year-old Swedes in relation to all-cause mortality. METHODS: Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for potential confounders and stratified by follow-up duration, were used to assess the prediction of all-cause mortality by the above foods. The associations of fat from cheese and milk products with mortality were tested in separate models. RESULTS: Cheese intake inversely predicted total mortality, particularly at high protein intakes, and this association decreased in strength with increasing <b>follow-up</b> time. <b>Milk</b> products predicted increased mortality with stable HRs over follow-up. The association between milk products and mortality was strongly influenced by the group with the highest consumption. Fat from cheese mirrored the protective association of cheese intake with mortality, whereas fat from milk products predicted excess mortality, but only in an energy-adjusted model. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, it may be argued that the role of dairy products in the context of a Nordic healthy diet should be more clearly defined by disaggregating cheese and milk products and not necessarily focusing on dairy fat content. Future epidemiological research should consider dairy products as disaggregated food items due to their great diversity in health properties...|$|R
40|$|A study {{aiming to}} assess the {{clinical}} tolerance of a special <b>follow-up</b> soybean <b>milk</b> formula (Neo-Soyal 2) in children with cow's milk protein intolerance or allergy (CMPI/CMPA) has been conducted in 17 infants and children (9 girls and 8 boys) aged from 6 months to 3 years. All the patients had a past history suggestive of CMPI/CMPA and were fed a restricted hypoallergenic diet with a semi-elemental formula based on protein hydrolysates. At the time of initiation of the study, all the patients were asymptomatic with normal growth while on a semi-elemental diet. The formula with protein hydrolysates was substituted by the test milk (Neo-Soyal 2) and blood samples were taken before and after 2 months. The clinical tolerance to the follow-up soybean formula was considered excellent in 16 children who remained asymptomatic with normal growth velocity. Only one patient developed a severe diarrhoea within 72 hours after introduction of the soybean formula which was stopped. However, after one month {{he was able to}} tolerate a certain amount of the soybean milk (240 ml) without symptoms. For all the patients studied, there was no change in the nutritional parameters measured in the blood before and after 2 months of the trial. Likewise, the plasma amino acid levels determined in 2 patients remained unchanged before and after the experimental period. These data indicate that the soybean milk formula used here (Neo-Soyal 2) can be safely given as a substitute of semi-elemental diets during the follow-up of children with CMPI/CMPA after the age of 6 months...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A joint {{study group}} on cow's milk allergy was convened by the Emilia-Romagna Working Group for Paediatric Allergy and by the Emilia-Romagna Working Group for Paediatric Gastroenterology to focus best {{practice}} for diagnosis, management and <b>follow-up</b> of cow's <b>milk</b> allergy in children and to offer a common approach for allergologists, gastroenterologists, general paediatricians and primary care physicians. The report prepared by the study group was discussed by members of Working Groups who met three times in Italy. This guide {{is the result of}} a consensus reached in the following areas. Cow's milk allergy should be suspected in children who have immediate symptoms such as acute urticaria/angioedema, wheezing, rhinitis, dry cough, vomiting, laryngeal edema, acute asthma with severe respiratory distress, anaphylaxis. Late reactions due to cow's milk allergy are atopic dermatitis, chronic diarrhoea, blood in the stools, iron deficiency anaemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, chronic vomiting, colic, poor growth (food refusal), enterocolitis syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminemia, eosinophilic oesophagogastroenteropathy. An overview of acceptable means for diagnosis is included. According to symptoms and infant diet, three different algorithms for diagnosis and follow-up have been suggested. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria {{are known}} to occur in breast-fed pre-term infants, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, it has never been {{reported}} in a term baby previously. We report a term male baby who was followed-up during pregnancy for having bright kidneys, but a follow-up renal ultrasound (US) after birth had revealed normal scan. Laboratory inves-tigations revealed normal serum calcium (Ca), phosphorous (PO 4) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The baby was being fed by breast <b>milk.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> US two months later showed early nephrocalcinosis along with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria; by the age of three months, nephrocalcinosis was more extensive and the serum Ca level was more than 12 mg/L with hypercalciuria. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphorous (PO 4), ALP and thyroid function tests were all normal. Antenatal history revealed a hypothyroid mother who was maintained on L-thyroxin, calcium and vitamin D supplement during pregnancy. Her blood tests showed normal serum Ca, low PO 4 and elevated PTH. The baby was diagnosed to have hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia secondary to maternal hypophosphatemia (maternal vitamin D deficiency). Breast feeding was stopped and the baby was started on formula, whereby he showed remarkable improvement both for his blood chemistry as well as his hypercalciuria...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-four {{and fifty}} samples of home-prepared feeding bottles for infants {{from a public}} health unit (low {{socioeconomic}} group, LSG) and from a private pediatric clinic (high socioeconomic group, HSG), respectively, were chemically analyzed, and their energy, macronutrient and iron contents were compared with the standard composition recommended for <b>follow-up</b> formulas. Cow's <b>milk</b> and sucrose and cereals added to the bottles were largely used in the study. Energy, protein and carbohydrate contents were higher than the recommended level in 75. 9, 27. 7 and 81. 5 % of LSG samples and 62. 0, 48. 0 and 34. 0 % of HSG samples, respectively. Fat content was lower than the recommended level in 83. 3 % of LSG and 58. 0 % of HSG samples. Excessive values of energy, carbohydrates and protein, low fat content and macronutrient imbalance were found regardless of the socioeconomic class, thus indicating {{the need to improve}} the domestic feeding bottles' preparation practices and discourage the use of cow's milk and the addition of other ingredients.
