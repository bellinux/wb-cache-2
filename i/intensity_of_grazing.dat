40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{interactive}} effects of multiple forms of disturbance - natural or anthropogenic - on plant population dynamics. This limits our ability to understand the drivers of these dynamics and effectively manage plant populations in the face of changing disturbance regimes. Fire, <b>grazing</b> and harvest <b>of</b> wild plants are three widespread, commonly co-occurring land management activities in the tropics that contribute to altered disturbance regimes. In this study, we investigate the effects of and interactions among these activities on mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi) populations in the Western Ghats, India with data from 14 palm populations, including over 2300 palm ramets monitored from 2009 to 2011. We construct integral projection models (IPMs) of palm population dynamics based on the response of palm individuals to fire and varying <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> and leaf harvest and carry out Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to understand the implications of different scenarios of disturbance for population persistence. We find that palm individuals and populations were resilient to low levels <b>of</b> fire, <b>grazing</b> and harvest. There are also important interactions among these forms <b>of</b> disturbance: <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> harvest and <b>grazing</b> are highest in populations one to two years after fire, and the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> harvest is lower in heavily grazed populations. These interactions mean that the combined effects of multiple forms of disturbance differ from what would be assumed from simply adding their separate effects. While simulations show that sustained high <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> harvest and <b>grazing</b> would have severely negative consequences for palm populations, interactions between these two forms of disturbance prevent palm populations from actually experiencing such extreme conditions. On the other hand, because <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> and harvest both increase moderately following fire, their combined negative effects on population growth rates are exacerbated by fire. Thus, multiple, interacting disturbances determine the resilience of these palm populations and the sustainability of their management. Synthesis. This study illustrates the importance of explicitly incorporating realistic interactions among multiple forms of disturbance when evaluating plant populations' resilience to changing disturbance regimes and the sustainability of plant harvest.

40|$|A simple {{protocol}} {{is presented}} for a functional classification of European grassland species using attributes {{that can be}} quickly and easily measured. These attributes relate to habitat fertility, <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> and disturbance. As a surrogate for habitat fertility we use leaf nitrogen predicted by multiple regression from three leaf characters, specific leaf area, dry matter content and size. Average maximum canopy height of the component species of our vegetation, weighted by abundance, provides a rough assessment of the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing.</b> The percentage of annuals and vernal geophytes assesses disturbance. Functional descriptions of the CLIMB grasslands were produced and trends relating to both ecosystem and economic processes were detected. Most importantly, our estimate of habitat fertility predicts land use change. Within NW Europe the threat to grassland of conservation value from agricultural ‘improvement’ increases with fertility while in the Mediterranean increased fertility decreases the likelihood of abandonment. These mathematical relationships between an ecological attribute and a perception of economic potential can help us to routinely combine ecological and economic data. This is an important preliminary step as we attempt to reconcile practical economic concerns and conservation objectives within working landscapes. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{decline of}} many altricial species in {{temperate}} areas on land managed for agriculture {{is thought to}} be linked to changes in summer food availability, impacting on chick survival. This study specifically investigates the impacts <b>of</b> livestock <b>grazing</b> on the breeding performance of an insectivorous species, the meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), through the assessment of chick diet. Using conventional methods, adults are found to feed chicks a wide range of prey taxa. The significance of this diversity is shown by improved chick growth, emphasising an important link between diet and chick survival. Changes in the diets fed to chicks, as measured by conventional dietary methods, were observed in association with different <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> management. High stocking densities and also no livestock grazing resulted in a reduced biomass of invertebrates being fed to chicks. Conventional dietary analysis methods have a number of biases associated with them. Examining diet using three methods produced significantly different diet descriptions for meadow pipit chicks. The concept of using dietary markers was examined, which is increasingly becoming popular in ecological dietary studies. Lipids, namely hydrocarbons have been successfully established as faecal dietary markers in the examination of herbivore diet compositions. A range of hydrocarbons were extracted, identified and quantified from both invertebrate prey and bird faeces indicating the potential for this technique to assess bird diets, also highlighting areas of focus for future research. Hydrocarbon analysis was successfully used to show dietary changes occurring as result <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> managements; therefore, this approach shows great potential as an ecological tool for assessing ecosystem changes as a result of human activities.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the forage yield and subsequent recovery of dual-purpose wheat and canola crops sown at different times and subjected to differing durations and <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing.</b> The success <b>of</b> a dual-purpose crop {{is determined by the}} combined value of vegetative biomass consumed by livestock and grain yield, and hence maximised when forage yield is greatest and grain yield is unhindered. This experiment investigated the forage yield and crop recovery for wheat and canola sown on two dates, with two grazing methods and three times of closure. When sown on 9 December (TOS 1), canola sheep consumed 5540 kg DM ha⁻¹ over 28 days in March, compared with wheat, where 1905 kg DM ha⁻¹ was consumed. Accumulated biomass for grazing commencement in June was 2270 kg DM ha⁻¹ for 17 February-sown crops (TOS 2) and 1173 kg DM ha⁻¹ for TOS 1 crops, with no difference between crops. Grazing took place between 5 June and 20 July, with greater forage yields of TOS 2 crops. TOS 2 wheat had the greatest rate of recovery, increasing to 2405 kg DM ha⁻¹ after the accumulation of 700 °C d following the termination <b>of</b> <b>grazing.</b> Canola TOS 1 recovered to 1570 kg DM ha- 1 over the same period; canola TOS 2 and wheat TOS 1 reached 1135 - 1165 kg DM ha⁻¹. The canola was infected with a virus due to aphid damage before the winter grazing, which affected the recovery following the <b>grazing</b> period. Duration <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> was determined to be detrimental to crop recovery, with periods < 20 days required for maximum recovery rate. Timing <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> was not important when biomass was considered on a thermal time accumulation basis, however reduced time from the termination <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> to flowering for canola defoliated in late July may not allow for sufficient leaf recovery to support grain yield.

Treatments consisted <b>of</b> three <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing,</b> and <b>of</b> protection from <b>grazing</b> for either 3 or 14 years. For all treatments, {{the number of species}} fitted a normal distribution with the log (ln) of the area inventoried. However, the fit improved slightly when the model included two successive log-normal distributions respectively considered as species distribution within a patch and at the patch mosaic scale. Across treatments, the optimal sampling areas averaged 3. 8 Â± 1. 1 m 2 for the within-patch and 725 Â± 113 m 2 for the mosaic scale distributions. It is argued that similarity between treatments in the overall log-normal distribution resulted from compensations between the divergent trends that affected species distribution within and across patches depending on the grazing status. Long-term protection resulted in a regular spatial arrangement of highly contrasted, but internally homogeneous patches. Heavy grazing ensued the dominance of a few species in contagious patches but also left niches for scattered individuals of other species.

30|$|Dry {{aggregate}} {{stability is}} one of the most important soil physical parameters that are used to estimate erosion susceptibility of soils (Greeves et al., 2007). On the other hand, soil aggregate stability is a function of different soil management factors such as tillage frequency (Masri and Ryan 2006), <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> (de Souza et al. 2010) and land use change (Gajić et al. 2013). Loss of soil aggregate stability could enhance soil erodibility. Susceptibility to erosion goes higher as aggregate size of soils decrease. The macro-aggregates that are characterized by higher SOC and N (Wilson et al. 2009) are less susceptible to wind erosion than the micro-aggregates (Yang et al. 2007). However, the macro-aggregates are more prone to management impacts (Ashagrie et al. 2007). This implies that poor land management options deteriorates these macro-aggregates, and leads to soil erosion.|$|E
30|$|Restoration of {{historical}} disturbance regimes (ungrazed and burnt) facilitated {{the invasion of}} the annual grass species Bromus tectorum and other exotic forbs into sagebrush communities (Davies et al. 2009). In comparison, treatments that combined historical and non-historical disturbances (grazed and burnt) did not facilitate an invasion and resulted in greater cover of perennial vegetation. Livestock grazing is a causal factor in B. tectorum invasion but can also, depending on the grazing regime, provide resilience to invasion. The mechanism cited here is increased litter accumulation in the ungrazed condition resulting in greater post-fire mortality of native species providing space and resources for invasion. The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> determines the outcome because heavy grazing facilitates invasion by decreasing the cover of native plant species. The authors highlight that best management practices are counterintuitive to the assumption that restoring historical disturbances will provide best management of ecosystems.|$|E

Paddocks within each <b>of</b> the <b>grazing</b> systems on each property were monitored for pasture attributes, soil surface condition, grazing days harvested, and diet quality of cattle between 2006 and 2009. The intensive systems on each property had been in place for up to 10 years prior to the project starting. During the four-years of measurement, there were initially two or more years at each site of well below average rainfall followed by up to two average rainfall years. There was little or no impact <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> system on pasture attributes or soil surface condition. Trends in pasture condition and growth were dominated by seasonal conditions, with pastures in all systems responding well to the better rainfall conditions towards the end of the project. Diet quality (measured by NIRS) was generally lower in the more intensive systems, especially during the growing season. There was no consistent difference in grazing days per ha due to grazing system. The different grazing systems within a property were not managed independently of each other but tended to be operated as an integrated management system. This meant cattle could spend time within different systems within the one 12 -month period, especially during dry years. In combination with differences in animal classes between systems at some sites, this precluded attempts to directly assess the impact <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> system on individual animal productivity. The integrated management of paddocks across systems on each property suggests that key management principles, such as matching stocking rate to carrying capacity, were applied to all paddocks on a property to a similar extent.

The differences {{were related to the}} <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing.</b> Other parameters, including mean weight per seed, mean number of seeds per spike, mean number of spikes per plot, mean plant height and head date, were also measured. Statistically significant differences were found for many of these variables between grazed and un-grazed plots. The estimates of yield reduction were probably conservative in that the presence of control exclosures may have discouraged goose use of experimental fields compared to other fields in the vicinity...|$|E
40|$|Free grazing and herding {{of local}} breeds {{have a long}} {{tradition}} in management and conservation of extended grassland habitats such as alkali steppes. However, {{there is a lack}} in studies evaluating the effects of grazing types and regimes on the vegetation composition and functional diversity. We selected Artemisia steppes, a widespread type of alkali steppes, to study the changes of vegetation composition and diversity along a grazing intensity gradient. We recorded the cover of vascular plant species, in altogether 150, 2 � 2 -m-sized plots of 15 steppes in 2014. The steppes were managed by free grazing, traditional Hungarian Grey cattle grazing (low, moderate and high intensity), or by heavy grazing (Grey cattle and sheep, and additional donkey grazing). We answered the following questions: (i) How do the species richness, diversity and species evenness change along the increasing <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing?</b> (ii) How does the grazing affect the functional trait composition along the intensity gradient? (iii) How similar is the composition and diversity of free grazed steppes to the pastoral grazed ones? We detected no significant differences in species richness but a humped-back curve with a peak at the medium grazing intensity was found for the Shannon diversity, evenness and the proportion of subordinated target species. The highest Rao’s quadratic entropy was found for low intensity grazing. The lowest scores of multi-trait functional evenness were detected for the medium grazing intensity, while for multi-trait functional divergence both medium and very high intensity displayed low scores. The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> was negatively correlated with the plant height and LDMC, while positively with the rosette forming, SLA, thousand-seed weights, terminal velocity and flowering period. Our results suggest that for the highest functional diversity a low intensity traditional cattle grazing is recommended. A medium grazing intensity should be chosen to have the highest proportion of subordinated target species of conservation interest, and the highest species diversity and evenness. Our findings suggest that free grazing and low- intensity traditional grazing can be substitutive to each other; various grazing intensities from low to medium, alternating in space and/or time can be appropriate to maintain high compositional diversity...|$|E
40|$|The {{measure of}} climate change in dairy farms can be {{achieved}} by using the emissions of methane by the ruminants converted in CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq). In order to know the impact of future quotes of methane in the Azorean dairy milk farms, a decision model is built to the Azorean intensive <b>grazing</b> system <b>of</b> dairy farms. Some scenarios of methane levels reductions from 10 to 75 % are considered and their impact is evaluated upon dairy farms income, level of CO 2 -eq emissions and <b>intensity</b> level <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> system. The results have shown that any reduction of the methane level always implies a consequent decrease in income. If the CO 2 -eq has to be limited than there is the need to find alternative income activities for farmers in order to preserve economic sustainability. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Question Can we {{reliably}} estimate <b>grazing</b> <b>intensity,</b> indicators <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>intensity</b> (i. e. field-layer {{height and}} shrub-cover), and vascular plant species richness in semi-natural grasslands from high spatial resolution satellite data? Location The Baltic Island of Oland (Sweden). Methods Fieldwork included the on-site description <b>of</b> <b>grazed</b> and ungrazed areas and shrub-cover within 107 semi-natural grassland sites. Field-layer height and vascular plant species richness (total within-site and mean small-scale species richness) were recorded within the sites. Digital classification of QuickBird data {{was performed to}} identify grazed and ungrazed areas and shrub-cover. Vegetation indices were generated to analyze the performance of satellite data for estimating field-layer height, and the spectral heterogeneity was used to characterize the within-site environmental heterogeneity. Results The proportion <b>of</b> digitally classified <b>grazed</b> area explained 45 % {{of the variation in}} field-layer height and 43 % of the variation in shrub-cover. Field-layer height was significantly related to vegetation indices. A linear model with three explanatory variables (spectral richness(red), spectral richness(NIR), and shrub-cover) explained 47 % of the variation in total within-site species richness. Conclusions High spatial resolution imagery may assist in the monitoring of the processes that follow the cessation <b>of</b> <b>grazing,</b> on the scale of individual grassland sites. Measures of spectral heterogeneity acquired by high spatial resolution imagery can be used in the assessment of total within-site vascular plant species richness in semi-natural grassland vegetation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBarbary macaques, {{like other}} {{non-human}} primates living in highly seasonal temperate environments, display high monthly variations in their diet. In addition, their diet changes {{according to the}} habitat type they colonize and {{to the degree of}} habitat degradation due to resource exploitation by local people, in particular through pastoralism. We studied the time-budget adjustments of wild Barbary macaques in three cedar-oak forests impacted by different <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> pressure from goats and sheep. We examined how diet variations influenced the time monkeys spent in their activities and their day range lengths (i. e. their energy costs). At three studied sites, diet composition and time budgets showed marked seasonal variations. Diet composition had a strong influence on monkeys' time budget. In the forest where pastoralism was the highest, diet included a greater proportion of underground resources, shrub fruit and acorns, which led to an increase in the time spent foraging and moving, as well as an important increase in day range lengths. Energy costs were therefore higher in a degraded environment than in a suitable habitat. The monkeys living in forests subjected to pastoralism took advantage of increased day lengths to spend more time searching for food. However, in the forest with the highest pastoralism pressure, although monkeys spent more time foraging, they spent less time feeding than monkeys at the other sites. In addition, they appeared to have reached the limits of the available time they could devote to these activities, as their diurnal resting time was at its lowest level over several months. Temperature variations did not appear to modify monkeys' time budgets. In the least favourable habitat, saving time from resting activity allowed monkeys to maintain a relatively high level of social activity, partly linked to rearing constraints...|$|R
